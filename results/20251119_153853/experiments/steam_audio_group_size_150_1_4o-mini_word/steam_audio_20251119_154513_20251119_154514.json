      "Great addition to the series. Adds just enough on to the original game's mechanics to justify itself. The length is a good bit shorter than the first but the price is reduced to completely make up for it. All around great buy if you enjoyed the first.",
      "I wish there were a \"mixed\" option for recommending this game, as I think for a lot of people out there, this is a fantastic game, and it's definitely well made with a lot of love and attention to detail in many respects. I really like puzzles and problem solving, so part of my disappointment with The Witness is that I really thought I would enjoy the game. Myst was one of my favorite games growing up, and I was extremely excited to see a well-reviewed game in the Myst genre surface after far too long. \n\nThe problem for me was that The Witness is very much a game about the journey, and not the destination. It turns its head on the genre as it's less a game about solving puzzles within a set of rules, and more about discovering what those rules are. And for the most part, it does that well. Instead of the usual game conventions, rewards for solving hard puzzles weren't any kind of story unlock, more just to give you a harder puzzle. That approach was fun for awhile, but some story unlock would've been appreciated, especially because there is so much mystery and it's such an immersive world that was clearly built for a reason and has a fascinating backstory. \n\nSome of the mechanics also just seem arbitrary, or at the very least, not quite obvious enough. Sometimes perspective puzzles require you to either take a screenshot or jot down on pencil and paper the answer, then transfer it on screen. That seems like lazy game design and worst of all, takes you out of the immersive experience. It's possible I'm mostly tone deaf, as some of the sound puzzles seemed almost impossible to me, despite numerous listens. There's also just the repetitiveness of the \"pathfinding\" puzzles, which range from challenging (and satisfying) to punitive in their difficulty spikes. It's in these difficulty spikes where I think the core game mechanic of pathfinding lets you down, as it requires you to be much more of a planner than a \"hands on\" problem solver. In a game like this, I would think it would accommodate multiple approaches, but really there's a right way to approach this game, and a wrong way. Unfortunately for me, I think the way I approach puzzles (trial and error) is strongly discouraged, at times in punitive ways. \n\nThe philosophy from the audio/video portions will likely be appreciated by some, and for some come off as the worst kind of douchey-hipster nonsense. Had they been delivered in shorter pieces, I might've fallen into the former. But as rambling as some of them are, I found them more annoying than enjoyable unfortunately. \n\nI don't know, I'm really torn on this. It's a well made game, and while it seems so open and non-confined, I found the game to be far too linear in mechanics and how to approach problem solving. At times it actually made me feel like a lesser thinker because I have a different approach to puzzles than what the game designer prefers. What I'm sure is a really fun journey for some, left me disappointed with the destination. \n\nAm realizing this reads a lot like an apology for not liking this game, which I think it is. I really, really wanted to love The Witness, but in the end, not only was this game not for me, but I genuinely feel lesser for that fact because I feel like I should have loved it, and just didn't.",
      "When I first played Battlefield 1 it literally sent me to the hospital, cause you’re supposed to seek immediate medical attention if your erection lasts longer than 4 hours.\n\nThis is easily one of the most badass games  in history. The music, the landscape, the gunplay, the hit register and the satisfying kill effect, EVERYTHING is just amazing. The last true Battlefield game. I enjoyed every second of this amazing game.  \n\nBF1 isn’t fully historically accurate but it is historically immersive. The war stories in this game genuinely made me emotional sometimes and I’m not ashamed to admit that. \n\nAs someone who is more on the “historical accuracy” side of games, I can say without a doubt that Battlefield 1 did an incredible job. Hell, they were even able to be diverse without pandering to anybody! The 1st Russian Women’s Battalion of Death, the Harlem Hellfighters, people from French-occupied northwestern Africa, the list goes on. What sets this game’s inclusivity of a variety of people and groups from other games is that it does so when it has a reason to and is still accurate to the time and setting. \n\nThat’s one of the main reasons why Battlefield 5 pissed me off so much. Instead of a British woman with a prosthetic arm wielding a cricket bat in WW2, why not include Lyudmila Pavlichenko, aka Lady Death, a female Russian sniper who had 309 confirmed kills? What about the French women who fought? They were in extremely small numbers, but they were a thing. Historically accurate inclusion is fucking awesome, and I love when games do it. But inclusivity for its own sake is terrible and it cheapens said character’s presence in the game’s setting. \n\nEven the DLC are fantastic. I remember how amazing I felt when the “for the Tsar” DLC came out and I first played it. I have never seen people fight so hard to the death in a video game without a whole lot of rage. It was amazing. I felt like I was part of the Russian revolution. Please do yourself a favor and buy this game.\n\n9/10\n\nOnly gave it a 9 ‘cause the 1 is already there…",
      "Lemme give it to y'all straight, who are on the fence;\n\n- Yes, the game is very much worth it at full price.\n\n- One of the first games in a long while, that has kept me up until 5 A.M. in the morning, because of how lost I get myself into it.\n\n- Doesn't do dumb jump scares, save for a VERY FEW TIMES, and each one counted.\n\n- The game is maybe one of the best zombie based games out there, so long as you do enjoy it with action.\n\n- Parkour in the game is AMAZING. Sometimes I like just playing the game, so I can run\naround, across roof tops, and attacking zombies while talking to friends.\n\n- Co-op in story mode. Freaking amazing. No dumb lobby. Just click 'Join game' and bam,\nyou'll be thrown a few feet away from a friend without them sometimes even noticing you joined!\n\n- Single play and Co-op have a huge impact; co-op feels fun, slightly safer, and adds a lot in the form of friendly rivals! Single player feels way more tense and everything you do counts, making you second guess some choices, for fear or death. Night time in either mode is fun as heck, though four co-op makes it pretty easy.\n\n- Night and Day feel almost like two different modes. In the day, zombies shuffle around, falling off rooftops, being dumb, easy to avoid and kill. Night time? Get those UV Flares ready, and be ready to flee if they catch sight of you.\n\n- Even after beating the story, I keep coming back for more, as it's super fun.\n\n- Took me around 30 hours to do the story, which also included only HALF of the side missions. Still got a little over 50% left to go, and looking forward to it!\n\nTL;DR - Get the game, find friends to play with, enjoy the hell out of one of the few games worth it at full price.",
      "As i previously stated, i was going to play through metro fully and i have done so, so here is my update to this review. \nThis game is not the best selling triple A game in the world and it may have some bugs (like a table that wasnt solid or the objects in that room lol) however it is a decent game. the story is decent and the characters voices are way off but they sorta make up for it with their personalities. \n\nExploration in this game is by far one of the most interesting in my opinion and the way your character acts in the enviroment makes it more interesting aswell, for example wiping your visor when it gets dirty (wasnt that helpful for me in my play through but it was a nice touch) and your visor taking damage in combat adds to the immersive feel of this wasteland/paradise almost. Scavenging weapons and parts and combining them to make better equipment is quite intriguing and quick to do if you can find the parts. \n\nat the end of the day my final review of this is its a good game i would play it again even if it is a bit clunky sometimes (atleast it was for me lmao)\n\n\n\n\n\nOh and hopefully my punctuation is good enough so no one passes out this time lmao",
      "Game really falls off after Anor Londo. The difficulty starts to come more from tedium, shitty terrain/hitboxes, and cheap shots than any test of reflex or strategy. Bosses can be total snoozefests (Ornstein and Smough, Four Kings, Quelaag) or relentless, cheap bastards (Gwyn, Sif) or even dumb puzzles that rely on at least one death to figure out (Discharge, Bed of Chaos, Gaping Dragon). Actual fun bosses are few despite the total number of boss fights. Try not to fall asleep while waiting for the boss to do the one attack you can actually punish without getting hit by the patented zero frame windup or retarded delayed backswing. Marvel at how touching the air 1 foot away from the boss kills you after he does his big EPIC swing because silly player, you should know the exact dimensions of the hitbox surrounding the 20ft tall demon and his 2 ton hammer. Sigh as you run past all the enemies and time-wasting obstacles again as you try to figure out the one stupid gimmick you need to master.\n\nNow, this game isn't all bad. The game's artstyle and atmosphere are pretty cool and the voice acting is good. Some of the levels are also really interesting and well-designed (Undead Burg and Parish, Sen's Fortress, Anor Londo) even if there are also some really shitty ones (Tomb of Giants, Blighttown through Lost Izalith, Crystal Cavern). Play after the second bell only if you want to see whether you can \"git gud.\" I got gud but I see that this game was popular mostly because AAA games were shit when it came out and because of the multiplayer gimmicks.",
      "Great story, great features. But in my honest opinion unless your going for a nostalgia trip, give it a pass. The gun play and AI alone is enough for me to justify a refund, I mean shit cops hear the sounds of gunshots right next to them and act like nothing is happening. Immersion 0/10 sorry. I must admit I really enjoyed this game on console, but I am gonna have to take the money and run. Notice how almost all of the reviews just say All YOU haD to do Was FoLlow The DAmn Train cj or Ill HAve TWo NumBER 9s. I cant say I didn't expect this game to be a little shit judging by how old it is, but I will NOT suck it off and say buy it, the actual game play is PATHETIC. In all honesty I think this game remastered with gta v's physics and polish would be SOOO much better than gta v. They really captured the hood life in this one, damn shame it fucking sucks. This game's age sadly isn't up to par and sadly, it's getting a fat thumbs down from this boomer.",
      "I like furry art, but first and foremost im a RPG gamer, and as such I will rend judgment impartially. \n\nThe story is not bad, but still falls in the average category and it is predictable, gameplay is the same as the first Fuga (I have no problems there) but there are few new enemies,  so the strategy to beat the regular battles is very repetitive. My biggest complain remains the same since Tail Concerto and it is the dificulty... which is way too easy, there is no hard / nightmare mode for veteran players, Im not asking to die repeatedly like in dark souls but Cyberconnect2 needs to understand some players like a challenge in their games.\n\nMusic is ok and Hack is the best character of the lot (Tah tah tah tah  taaah!!!!!) I would play Fuga 3 just for him.\n\nIt pains me to give the thumbs down, but Cyberconnect2 needs to work a little harder.",
      "More broken than Cyberpunk could ever dream. Sure the game has nice graphics but the game play, toxic online players, and poor physics make this one of the most frustrating games I have ever played. Dont even bother using the stable either your game will glitch and youll be stuck looking at you player stuck in the stable and nothing more causing you to reset the game or the rogue horses that will drive by kick you in the face. Good luck if you play.",
      "This is more than a game for me.  It has become a hobby.  What started as a random purchase for myself last Christmas -- I had an old electric guitar I never played in the closet, so this gave me an excuse to see if I can learn -- has become an expensive obsession for me.  Warning -- but a good warning -- you'll find that you're learning guitar very quickly on this game, and it will become the start of an expensive habit!  I have downloaded hundreds of dollars worth of songs, bought a brand new guitar, I've signed up for music theory and guitar lessons at the local county college ... this has become a genuine hobby for me.  Literally, it is one of those rare games which has genuinely made an impact on my life.  Six months later, and the game has not gotten old.  I look forward to new songs, I laugh when a new chord I've never seen magically appears on the song that I've practiced the hell out and achieved a new difficulty.  The game is, most importantly, fun.  It remains fresh and only gets better as you get better.  I highly recommend.",

      "I technically got this game for free, as it was bought for me from a friend. And honestly, I didn't really like it. She got it for me, as a means to help with some of my mental health issues I suppose? But it just was very big miss for me, and kinda made me feel worse. A bit anxiety inducing for me, just given the circumstances, talking about life and death. Just not my personal cup of tea.",
      "Great game... who need 1 or 2 years of development. tl;dr: mid game turn into a micromanagment hell.\n\nThe game is fantastic until a certain point. You start as a mercenary, one party, 50-150 soldiers doing missions, small battles or bigger fights joining armies. Good graphics, brutal engagments with 200-1000 units at the same time if your computer can handle, playing as a soldier is a blast.\n\nThe problems start when you get a few towns and a bigger family, the micromanagement never stops and gets worse overtime. You have to physically move your party to towns to fix their issues. When your lords get captured & escapes, they'll go into a random town until you pick em again, then you'll have to reform the party. Same with caravanes for trading, if they get captured, you'll have to go in his town and recreate the caravan. You have to partially fill towns with soldiers, manually, from your own soldiers. All the little fun things of the beginning soon become a hassle, as you can't delegate. Messengers are not a thing.\n\nYou can't manage a town at a distance, you can't tell a party member to move to a location or guard a territory, they do whatever they want if they're out of your army / party, so you have to do it yourself. Either you're leading your huge army to fight what is basically an enless war mid game, or you take care of your cities while the rest of your faction fight... with various success. Some commanders are pretty good, other will throw waves of recruits at highly trained arbalists in the open backed with cavalry. Protip: don't be a recruit in an imperial army.\n\nYou can't tell a party you created to guard an area or to kill all bandits attacking your villagers, it's up to you, or the IA if it feel like it. Worst, if you let the parties you created roam around (parties = group of 70-200 soldiers under a lord) they can be (temporarily) drafted in other armies of your kingdom... and you'll have to physically move to the army, talk to the leader and pay some reputation to get them back. Of course, large armies are slow. This leads the the next problem, swarms.\n\nMy worst fear is not a massive army, it's an army disbanded in the middle of my territory. The small parties usually start raiding all villages in the vicinity while being too fast to be catched by a big army. Raided villages impact your town / castle loyalty and gold quite heavily. Sure, you could disband your army and hunt them yourself... but that makes you take a step back, and all your parties would reform under another army you can't control. And man, some army commanders are really, really stupid. Verdun style charge in the open against walls of archers, cavalry in a forest vs pikemens, you name it. I can't count the time i had parties wiped in someone else army. But let's say you managed to capture the lords burning your villages.\n\nThe capture system is broken. Captured lords escape A LOT. I had some escape 20 seconds after being captured. They never stay in a jail for more than a few in game days. Once they escape, they magically teleport to their hometown, rebuild a fast 80 mens army in the blink of an eye and go back to raiding villages. AI \"cheat\" with recruits, they will always find soldiers in town, even if they're empty for you. Executions you say?\n\nIf you execute a lord, no matter how much of an A-hole he/she is, the whole faction will hate you. He raided dozens of villages and killed hundreds of peasants? Still not good enough. You just can't kill a lord without suffering heavy consequences down the line, and you'll need those lords to be friendly later. Worth to mention, capturing the leader of a faction won't stop a war.\n\nLast - peace / war is on/off. I had 600 days of continuous war, followed by 600 days of complete peace in the entire map (due to a bug apparently), and i'm now back at 300 days of war. Not a single day of peace, when one war stop another start immediatly. They will just never, ever stop fighting. Can't catch a breath, can't leave the front of your lose towns.\n\nOh and the main quest randomly failed after 875 days or so.\n\nI would still recommand the game, it's really fun for a while but it need a HUGE QoL update.\n",
      "[h1] 9/10 [/h1]\n[h1] As a sequel to Steins;Gate, you won't be able to understand the content of the game without playing the previous game. [/h1]\n\nThe sequel to the famous visual novel game Steins;Gate. Although some people think that Steins;Gate 0 is not as good as its predecessor, I think this game is a well-deserved excellent sequel.\n\nA change from the witty and relaxed game style of the previous game, the overall atmosphere of this game is heavy, and personally I prefer this kind of visual novel work. The plot of the game is naturally wonderful, so I won’t comment here to avoid spoilers. If you are deeply attracted by the game’s background settings and characters before playing Steins;Gate, then this work must be worthwhile. The music of this game is also very beautiful, and it will never disappoint the players. The only shortcoming of it is that the description of some characters is too sloppy and the characterization is insufficient, such as Kagari.\n\nIn any case, this one is definitely a must-try work for players who love Steins;Gate, and it is an important addition to the series of plots. As a related supplementary sequel, its nature is also destined that players must play the previous game in order to understand the content of this one.",

      "It's hard not to compare this with Divinity: Original Sin. Both were funded on Kickstarter, both have a 91% score on Steam, both are rich, engaging cRPGs, and they were released months apart. It's fair to say both games have been wild successes that have surprised even the developers. If you had to pick ONE of these to invest time in which should it be?\n\nTurn-based vs. Real-time with pause: I eventually came to accept and even enjoy the real-time with pause combat of Pillars, though I much prefer turn-based. Real-time combat presents many problems that aren't the result of player mistakes. On numerous occasions I'd have characters stuck in place because the pathfinding didn't work right. The real-time combat often felt like a jumbled, chaotic mess instead of the tactical plan I had set out. Divinity is much cleaner in this respect and offered a much better experience, especially with respect to using the environment as a weapon. With Divinity I felt each power had a time and place, whereas with Pillars I ended up spamming the same powers and hoping for the best.\n\nStory: Pillars of Eternity definity wins out here. While the story in Divinity:OS wasn't bad, I would call it playful to the point of campy. Pillars had a deep, mature fantasy story worthy of a novel. While it was almost too much reading at times, the story was serious, dark, and dealt with real themes. \n\nArt: Pillars harkens back to the golden age of Infinity Engine games like Balgur's Gate, Icewind Dale, Planescape Torment, etc. The scenes are appealing, but prerendered and they felt a little static. This helps stoke the nostalgia for the late 90s, but Divinity feels up-to-date and immersive. Couple the art style of Divinity with it's highly interactive environments, and the world of Original Sin ends up feeling much more alive. \n\nMusic: Both were great soundtracks but Pillars feels just a bit derivative of the Lord of the Rings movies. They aren't bad at all, but almost generically fantasy at times. Music is important here because when you spend tens of hours in these worlds, you're gonna get this music stuck in your head.\n\nIn short, you should play both if you love deep, isometric, high-fantasy, western computer RPGs. If you MUST pick, consider the following choice. Choose Pillars of Eternity if you favor story and choose Divinity: Original Sin if you prefer combat. Both are hallmarks of a great RPG and each specializes beautifully.",
      "Alright. Time for a review.\n\nThe launch on this game has been absolutely horrible. Day-zero patch, day-one patch, none of 'em did nothing. My rig is running a 10-series i9 and a 4090 Suprim X GPU. Along with 64 GB ram that should be more then enough. However, it was not. Frames between 10 and 30 fps, with a resting 30-40 when in smaller areas, has been quite common for me. As others have noted, the framedrops appeared to happen when changing \"zones\" in maps, and not when there are many enemies, demanding light-sequences, etc. This made my initial experience a living nightmare, as some fights especially are depending on quick reactions. Try quicktiming a block with 10 fps.\n\nThis has been my experience, and it was horrible. I stared off into the sunset. I cried. I questioned my existence. I murdered people (in real life, as i couldn't kill anything in-game). Until 2 hours ago. Because then, a wild 3,3 GB patch appeared.\n\nThe game is now running smoothly at 150 fps. I have no lag whatsoever when changing zones or being in separation areas, and no issues with combat. Finally the game runs as it should. The story is great, gameplay is better. Combat is more immersive and diverse, and somehow the creators made the game in a way that gives you a ton of new skills and equipment as you play, while still letting you start off with the stuff you had in Fallen Order. Its legendary.\n\nThat sound too good to be true? Well, it kinda is, in a way. Cause i have one more thing to add. People have been reporting game crashes. I have had a total of two crashes in 19 hours, until this patch appeared. Now I've had 9 crashes in 19 minutes. However, the reason I'm saving this for last and don't really care that much is that the crashes are completely connected the archive base on Jedha. This is a small area, and not one you have to spend much time in.  It is, however, quite critical when you do have to go there. As things stand now, i have to reboot the game once or twice to get in, deliver a quest and get back out again. The crashes always happen upon entering or exiting the area, not while inside. So until they fix that... well. I can deal with that.\n\nAll in all, it's a great game, and if you're way too obsessed with this game the way that I am, i'd chance buying it now :) If you have self-control (self-respect...?) you might want to wait a bit more, but I'm pretty confident that the next patch will fix the remaining serious issues for most people.\n\nTLDNR: Game bad then. Game much gooder now. Game goodest next week ish. Caveman out.",

Since those were the more difficult parts of the original game, I assume this was done for a more streamlined experience. \nInstead of your flower wilting to represent your life, it is now replaced by more accurate \"points\". Although this makes it easier to tell exactly how many hits you can take, I miss the more original old design.\nAn iconic music track was also changed, likely due to licensing issues...\n \nCan't completely replace the original for me, but it's still a very worthwhile experience! \nStill wishing for a sequel a decade later.",

      "Undoubtedly one of the best if not THE BEST modern video game remaster out there. I will summarize the pros and cons of this remaster into the following:\n\n[b]The Good:[/b]\n\n- Totally seamless transition into the new modern 4K visual from the old classic Win95 at a push of a key\n- Extremely faithful to the original titles (some might say that it is perhaps TOO faithful)\n- Game \"installation\" screen when you first boot up for both Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert is filled with God tier nostalgia \n- New UI with a complete revamp of the sidebar complete with higher quality artwork that totally feels in place\n- Plethora of never-before-seen bonus contents including exclusive missions and cinematic cutscenes for Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert that was only available on certain console platforms\n- You can queue multiple units while in production now\n- New multiplayer features and service is great. Finally you can now play 1v1 ranked and spectate any previous matches that was played including spectating ongoing games in the lobby\n- You can add, remove and create your very own custom music tracks in-game for both Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert however you want\n- All of Frank Klepacki's overly iconic classical and remixed tracks are here including various modern remixed that was composed solely for this remastered collection!!!\n\n[b]The Bad:[/b]\n\n- Minor bugs (though not a real dealbreaker)\n- The gameplay meta among factions/units remains as unbalanced as ever. Kinda of a tradeoff for being too faithful to the original titles\n- Multiplayer is still officially limited to a maximum of 4 players total per map in Tiberium Dawn, while in Red Alert the limit is a maximum of 8 players total\n- FMV cutscenes are all still heavily compressed in SD resolution extracted from the Playstation home console version and further artificially enhanced via AI upscaling due to the fact that the original master footage tapes for both Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert are still yet to be found\n\n[b]The Kinda Ugly:[/b]\n\n- Certain mission on hard difficulty are completely unbalanced. This is already another insult to injury as the AI blatantly cheats when it comes to resource procurement and unit build time. The fault of a clear lack of playtesting",
      "Ok, so... one of my favourite films of my childhood. HOWEVER; not being able to start in SANDBOX mode from the start almost INSTANTLY put me off this title, I mean, really? So you have to complete the in-game island tasks/missions (***)*)*)*)*). And after only 4 hours of play through.... \n\nSPOILER ALERT: Dinosaurs escape their enclosures!! ALL THE TIME, its frankly trying to emulate the movie (Jurassic Park 1) as where the DIno's always escape and again SPOILER ALERT: THE INTROS TO EVERY PART OF THE GAME BASICALLY TELL YOU THIS IS DEFO GOING TO HAPPEN.\n\nTo conclude:\n\n1) There is a heavy lean on the movies (I personally don't think that's bad)\n2) It offers a SANDBOX within the opening screen however then informs this is blocked (WHICH IS ANNOYING) until certain missions have been completed.\n3)  DINOSAURS ESCAPE CONSTANTLY\n4) DINOSAURS ESCAPE CONSTANTLY\n5) The game is more interested in visuals rather than content",

      "Good game that flips the p2w/f2p mobile ideas on its head, and succeeds. It's totally free to play, and actually encourages playing to improve over buying. Other mobile developers should take notice. Especially if it still makes money through Season Pass and cosmetics. I'm buying a few passes just to support their f2p model.\nIt also helps that the game is fun and addicting. There's always a 'one more game' feel...",
      "Ib manages to do for me what so few horror games manage to accomplish, and that is to actually give a sense of unease and dread. Without going into spoilers, it's only a few minutes into the game that things start to tread the path of uncomfortable surrealism, with the art growing considerably more disturbing in how Ib interacts with it, and how the art interacts with her.\n\nWith all due respect to more conventional horror titles, say, Dead Space or The Evil Within, Ib maintains a feeling of dread and discomfort. Enemies can be evaded, yes, but there's a feeling of being stalked while trapped in a world you can't possibly fully understand. \n\nContrast Dead Space remake, where soon enough the horror gives way to cutting off an abomination's arm, then using telekinesis to impale it or another horror with said arm, then simply setting fire to the more mobile enemies.\n\nThis is not, I repeat, not to disrespect games in which reducing enemies to a smoldering heap of charred body parts is an acceptable tactic- there is a time and a place for the cathartic destruction of the nightmares that haunted our closets and lurked under our beds. Ib, however, leans firmly towards the horror and self-preservation of being in a hostile and unknown environment, where the only feasible option is to run, hide, and hope whatever nameless horror eventually loses track of you.\n\nAnd let's face it- some modern art galleries are creepy enough already, even in the daylight.\n",
      "This might literally be the coolest game I've ever played, and possibly the best game that I've played in the last 10 years.\n\nThough, I might be the wrong person to ask though as Earthbound is my favorite game, and this game is obviously heavily Earthbound inspired. Stylistically and comedy wise anyway. The story is much darker than anything in Earthbound, but it's all buried underneath some of the funniest writing I've ever seen in a game. The writing start to finish is amazing, I'm only dissappointed that the game wasn't longer as there's a few questions left unanswered.\n\nI did normal mode, first run, collected all characters and beat the game in 12-13 hours. For 10 dollars, that's pretty alright. The fights are pretty open ended as there are like 20+ characters you can choose from, but I ended up using Rage, Bottles and Mad Dog. I found it wasn't the hardest game I've played, but I also haven't tried pain mode yet.\n\nAnyway, if this game interests you at all, buy it. You won't regret it.",
      "Playerunknowns Battlegrounds\n\n\nIn my opinion hands down the best Battle Royale game released.\n\n\n+Built on a very flexible engine that is built to handle games of the FPS genre\n\n+Core mechanics of the game are solid and function with little to no bugs (In my experience, I've personally only encountered 2 bugs)\n\n+Vehicles that have good physics and good controls to them\n\n+The game in most aspects visually looks great\n\n+Plenty of weaponry (For release)\n\n+Gun mechanics themselves feel very solid and fluid, weapons have recoil to them and for me feel \"weighted\" \n\n+Nice animations for all weapons currently in game\n\n+The map size in my opinion is perfect. Large enough that you aren't always on top of another player (Unless you purposely land in an area with others), vehicles are useful, while also being small enough that generally it's not a painful chore to run somewhere \n\n++SPECTATOR MODE IN TEAMS (No more sitting staring at a death screen for 20 minutes waiting for your teammates, while also making your teammates feel guilty for \"leaving you behind\" ) \n\n\n\n-Server stability (There are semi frequent heavy lag spikes that can affect the entire server, from what I heard this wasn't as bad in the closed beta, hopefully this will be resolved soon) \n\n-Performance/Optimization is quite bad (For many, many people) in this, IF you don't apply some commands/launch parameters to the game. (I personally went from 25-40 fps on medium and very low, to 55-65 by inputting a simple launch parameter, this command/launch parameter \"fix\" does NOT work for everyone) \n\n\nAside from those 2 negatives I cannot think of anything else that's bad enough to be worth mentioning. \n\n\n\nOverall this game is great, even if doing solos, but is even more fun when playing with friends, I would entirely recommend it to a friend, so long as their PC is capable of handling it, or if the launch parameter works for them\n\n\n\n\nSystem specs the game was played on:\n\nIntel Core i7 6700 HQ Skylake 3.6 ghz\n\nNvidia GTX 960m 2GB \n\n16gb's DDR4 2133mhz\n\nWindows 10 \n\n(System was an ASUS ROG gaming laptop) \n\n\n\nEDIT: For those who may be looking for the launch parameter me and friends used:\n\n\nNavigate to the game in your library\n\nRight click and go to properties, click \"Set Launch Options\" and enter the following command\n\n\n\n-USEALLAVAILABLECORES -malloc=system -sm4",
      "At a first glance I thought I would hate [b]Human Fall Flat[/b]. \n“Oh, this is another one of those wonky psychics ragdoll games that are obnoxiously hard to control,” I thought. \n...\nAfter playing it, I can now confidently say that my first impression was spot on. The only surprise was how much I enjoyed playing it. \n \n[h1][u]Positive:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]I can’t fully explain why but I found Human Fall Flat charming. The “human” is adorably simplistic and can complete daunting tasks despite only being able to jump and grab onto things. It reminds me of a very energetic toddler, especially when you raise your arms and jump - [b]it’s so cute[/b]. Something about an awkward “human” taking on challenges makes me feel warm inside [i](is it weird that I feel like I’m watching a baby grow up?)[/i]. \n[*]The levels gradually get larger and the puzzles more complex. I find that this works well with the awkward movements of your character, as you progressively learn how to better control him/her. It’s almost as if you start off as a clumsy baby, learning how to move and perform simple tasks, and end up as an awkward adult, still clumsy but expected to complete harder tasks. \n[*]I’m impressed at how many interactable objects are included in this game. Paired with a pretty good physics engine and you can really have a blast. Swing on a vine like Tarzan? Why not. Row a boat? Sure. Shoot yourself out of a catapult? No one’s stopping you.\n[/list]\n\n[h1][u]Neutral:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]It’s not always clear what you are expected to do, but I guess that’s kind of the point of Human Fall Flat? From what I could tell, you can get past the obstacles in whatever way you like. Sure, there’s the intended way, but if you want you can just climb over things and rush to the end of the level. Or you can just fool around to your heart’s content. It’s essentially one big playground with a goal at the end. \n[/list]\n\n[h1][u]Negative:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]It can be frustrating when things don’t go as you expect. Since your character has the structural rigidity of jelly, you’re constantly battling the floppiness of your character. My advice is: don’t expect to move with precision and you’ll have a good time. I also encountered a few bugs, like my arms or legs getting stuck in an object. Luckily there are many checkpoints and it’s relatively quick to reload.\n[/list]\n \n[h1][u]Conclusion:[/u][/h1]\n[h1]★★★✬☆ Surprisingly fun[/h1]\nI was honestly surprised at how much fun I had playing Human Fall Flat. I tend to avoid ragdoll/physics-y games - Getting Over It, for example, looks like an absolute nightmare to me - but I don’t regret playing Human Fall Flat at all. \nHuman Fall Flat is an absolute blast if you don’t take it too seriously or just like goofing around. I wouldn’t recommend it if you prefer serious games, as it’s very likely that you will just end up getting frustrated. The choice is entirely yours. \n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th][h1]If you enjoyed this review please follow me on my [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/26827738-%27b-Reviews/?appid=241930]curator page[/url] and [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/breviews]group[/url].

      "Lots of people parrot the \"tech demo\" or \"benchmark of the singularity\" lines without forming their own opinions.\n\nMe personally, as a fan of Supreme Commander, I enjoyed this game more then I thought I would. I only played the single player campaigns and haven't touched multiplayer. \n\nThe gameplay is exactly what it should be for this kind of game. When I first saw this game I didn't like how every unit was a hovering unit, but it makes sense with the class system the game has. Frigates are basically infantry, Cruisers are tanks, Dreadnauts are hero/high tier. The game borrows from Dawn of War with the territory control mechanic.",
      "So, I only found this game because my favorite Vtuber Miilkywayz on Twitch played it. It seemed pretty interesting but when she started making her own cards. As an IRL witch I was WAY more interested. The game itself is great, I love making cards and learning their meanings and seeing how how the story changes changes based on your deck and the cards drawn. And the replaybility of it is amazing given its price. 10/10 from me. Need more games like this.",
      "Did you lost faith in parkur adventure, horror and stealth genres? Did you lost hope to see realistic, immersive and HARCORE AAA game without press x to win killstreaks and cluttering UI? Outlast will restore your faith in everything mentioned and game industy! It also will prove you that indie team of 10 men can do AAA-Indie titles without greedy publishers that killing their creative freedom and forcing them to make a Call of Duty and Gears of War accessible for wider re-tar-ded audience. No no no, this game is not accessible to wide audience, it will scare shit out of most players not only because its good horror, but also because it realistic and hardcore stealth just like Thief was and its damn hard for braindead Call of Duty Xbox 360 generation, thats why its damn pleasant for old school gamers such as me who loved realism and challenge in older games before its almost gone from modern games.\nIf you love hard chellenge, innovative, realistc and purely immersive games such as Alone in Dark 2008, and if you hate YOBA call of duty style FPS games, you will love this one! If you love true surival horrors where survival is very hard because you cant even fight back, and if you love Amnesia you will love this game as well, and if you love old Splinter Cell up to Chaos Theory and loved Thief and remember that scarry part in catacomb,  you will love this game too!\nI love this game, its not perfect however, but its almos what i dreamed about for many years. Oh yeah, did i tell you that its one of rare games with full body awareness and every action in game totally animated?\n\nWhat you waiting for ? BUY THIS GAME ALREADY! I cost twice cheaper than most of recent Mediocre AAA games like Tomb Raider 2013, Bioshock Infinite, Resident Evil 6, Splinter Cell Blacklist, Call of Duty BO2, Metro Las Light, Far Cry, Assassin's Creed 3 and so on, but it brings more fun and joy than all of them together. Before this game 2013 year was a year of dissapointment (if you count only AAA type of games), but Outlast  game changed it for me! 10 men can do job better than over 100 men in big companies, and glory of  this game puts all big companies to shame! \n\nAnd a bonus: no precut DLC, no season passes, no achivements and stupid unlocks that turns game intro retarded grind, and most importan -  this game is MOD-FRIENDLY and allows to tweak AI and Difficulty a lot, nothing locked, and critical patches was released just next day after bugs was reported! Trully oldschool PC-specific way of doing business with respect to customers!",
      "a very interesting FPS multiplayer and co-op, It would be better if it was still in development like early access because it needs some work. shorter spawn times, vehicles , larger and more varied maps, what this game has that no other FPS has is realistic weapons. you will not find another game that models modern military grade firearms more realisticily in terms of what they sound like ,recoil, look, feel ( to the extent that a pc game can offer) they are amazing and I would buy this game for 8 bucks just for that alone. But it does need work , this game could be a great title to rival Battlefield and COD franchises ( maybe not Advanced Warfare) it may not surpass those titles but it could give them a better run for the money.",
      "I'm severely disappointed whenever a game points at the stands and intends to hit a home run, and then instead smashes the pitcher out after the bat flies out of their hands.\n\nIt looks wonderful, it's relentlessly and uncompromisingly unique, and it plays like complete hell.\n\nUnreasonable difficulty, bordering on sadism, a unique idea let down by just-so-imprecise hitboxes and the feeling of being far too weak to take on anything.\n\nI haven't enjoyed this game, I can't recommend it to anyone else, if you buy it and find favour with it then bully for you, but I'll never understand how.",
      "After almost 300 hours in-game, I might be qualified to review this. I'll start by saying that Larian has really got something special here. I'm glad that the work is ongoing, but the progress is palpable. I've broken down my review into a couple sections to hopefully give you a better idea of what you can expect.\n\n1. Graphics\nBG3 has the best graphics in any CRPG I've played up until this point. The animations still need work, as there are a number of cutscenes where things and characters are misplaced. However, environments, spell effects, equipment, characters, etc., are all meticulously designed and you can rest assured that Larian has painstakingly made even the most inconsequential NPC stand out.\n\n2. Sound\nThe sound design is fantastic. Each spell and weapon attack has a unique sound. The ambient sounds are distinct with each area you are located in, as well as the soundtrack. The soundtrack, in general, is well composed. I could sit on the title screen and just listen to the opening song for a long time. The voice acting is fantastic, especially the narrator. The only issue that I've found with the sound is similar to that of graphical bugs: cutscenes need polish. Sometimes characters don't properly voice their lines when cued. If there is a large fight going on with many different effects at once, some new effects may not properly play either.\n\n3. Story\nNot a whole lot of tied up loose ends story-wise as of yet. However, the intro scene is phenomenal. Probably the best intro cutscene in just about any game I've played. From there, the story picks up on a grand scale, then drops you off in the  starting area. You then begin to pick up the pieces to figure out what is going on and how to best solve your little problem. The storyline so far as what's available in EA isn't overly complex, but the particularly enticing part about it is the number of other smaller plots and characters which lend to the main. Over the course of my playthrough, I've picked up several potential paths which could ultimately be taken probably closer to the midpoint of the finished game. \n\n4. Characters\nI'll keep this one brief, but I just want to take a second to say that all of the characters are very well fleshed out and distinct. Even simple NPC's have personalities which, for the most part, don't strike me as cookie cutter in any way. Care has been taken into writing seemingly each and every character, even many animals and corpses. Many actions you take have an effect on your party's opinion of you, but each character has different preferences. Some party members, however, are a tough to nail down as to what makes them happy, even after almost 300 hours. The personality differences between what is expressed through character dialogue and what changes their opinion of your character can feel a bit inconsistent.\n\n5. Combat\nThe combat is fun and rewarding. Each action you take feels as if it has a distinct impact on the battle. This is partially due to the aforementioned animation and sound effects, very punchy and flashy, lots of pretty colors. This is also thanks, in part, to the combat system adopted from 5th ed. D&D. The die rolls, while not visible during combat, add quite a bit of tension and strategy to a fight. You can't just fling cantrips and spells willy-nilly at random enemies and expect to come out on top (for the most part). The balancing is done well enough to allow for a fair fight, but one that doesn't hold your hand throughout and is rewarding when you win. The world design is also done so well that, anywhere a fight could possibly break out (you can attack/kill anyone), the environment lends a lot of variation and strategy to the fight. The enemies are also very smart, to the point where they will flank and take the high ground on you. Stay frosty!\n\n6. Exploration\nExpanding on the final point of the Combat section, the world design makes Faerun feel alive. There is usually something to find around every corner; exploration is very rewarding. Exploration is rewarded in a few different ways. You can get unique loot (while not necessarily as distinct as titles such as Elden Ring, there is a good variety of equipment to find), find interesting social encounters, or battles. Furthermore, battles can be turned to social encounters or vice versa. The versatility in how the player overcomes different situations is very well thought out. My main grip with the exploration is a personal one, but it's the map. It can get sort of tedious trying to navigate the world using the map. But, the exploration area is not particularly sprawling, so you won't be caught wandering around looking for a particular area for too long. A few important items for side quests also come to mind as being particularly hard to find, as they don't really stand out from the background. But, holding Left ALT will bring up titles for items lying around the area if you want to go that route.\n\n7. Races/Classes\nThe current races available are as follows: drow, human, githyanki, dwarf, elf, half elf, halfling, gnome, and tiefling. The classes are fighter, wizard, rogue, ranger, cleric, warlock, druid, sorcerer, warlock, and bard. Larian has done a good job distinguishing each race and class from one another, whether the customization options or progression. The only issue that I have is that the full PHB selection is not yet available. There are subraces available for each race, each with differing characteristics from another. The subclasses are all very self explanatory, if you are familiar with the 5th edition Player's Handbook. A few names had to be changed for certain things within classes, probably due to licensing issues. Also no multiclassing as of just yet. Curious to see if they decide to patch that one in.\n\n8. Character Creation (Visual)\nKind of simplistic at this point. There are no sliders which allow to you to sculpt the face or body, although there are a fair number of preset faces. A good number of hairstyles and facial hair options, as well as colors to apply. And yes, you can apply beards to female dwarves (lookin' at you, Rings of Power).\n\n9. Progression\nSimilar progression to 5e, except that there are several events which grant XP other than just slaying your enemies. Now comes the main problem I have with EA, the level cap. The world is very well designed and very dense, each action you take for the most part feels well rewarded with XP. But, a full playthrough of all the content could see you sitting at 4th level for several hours before completing. This is especially frustrating because 5th level is when you get your second attack and 3rd level spells. But the loot in the game still allows for a little more variety as it does continue to progress in power/utility even up until the end.\n\n10. Optimization\nI run this on a pretty mid-system (Ryzen 5, 1660ti, 16gb RAM) and I can hold between 50-60 fps when exploring on high settings. When in a busier fight, my fps ranges from 35-45 ish. There are a few bugs which impact functionality (dialogue not displaying during conversation, getting stuck on a character's turn during combat, random crashes, etc.). Luckily, these have all vastly reduced in frequency. While the gameplay is by no means flawless, it has reduced frequency enough to where it's not so bothersome as to ruin the game for me. Just depends on your bug tolerance. If you're a Bethesda fan, you'll be just fine.\n\nJust a final thought before I end this thing. If you just want to experience something different and don't mind playing a work in progress, this game is for you. Larian is fantastic at listening to user feedback for optimization to things as small as simple tooltips. If you want a full experience (and I 100% would not blame you if that were the case), just wait until it comes out. Hoping for early-mid '23.",
      "EDIT: they made putting easier!  I can finally shoot even and below on the first few courses.  Ignore my complaints about impossible putting below.  I'm back playing this again and enjoying it much more since the putting changes.\n\nI have a love/hate relationship with this game.  It's the closest thing to an enjoyable disc golf game on the PC that I've ever seen, and on that basis I recommend it.  Unlike most sports games, where I can play better on the computer than I can in real life, in this game that's not the case.  After six miserable hours of failure in this game I can safely promise you that I'm wildly better at real life disc golf than I ever will be with this game.\n\nPositives:\n\n- Discs mostly work the way they should (assuming you understand from IRL play how a particular disc should  behave depending on speed and throwing angle) though I feel like flight paths when you're throwing up or down in elevation are off sometimes, but if you throw a fast understable disc at too low a speed it will tail off into the left immediately and when you want to crank up and hyzer bomb the same disc at high speed it gives you the long S you expect and so forth\n- No bugs really (a couple of times the character model went wonky when a disc landed on/next to a rock wall)\n- Graphics are fine by me\n\nCons (possibly only for me, you may not suck at this):\n\n- The entire game is based on a \"stop the tick mark on a spot as it circles a ring\" type swing meter, and I'm absolute trash at it\n- Feels like no progress, other than buying discs--I've upgraded the three skill meters a lot and it has never felt like game play changed much (lol, it certainly hasn't gotten any easier!)\n- Putting is im-fucking-possible, at least for me, it's way too hard--putts that would be gimmes for a novice in real life are a crapshoot, especially if there's any elevation difference\n- After six hours I have only unlocked the first course and half of the second course . . . I may try to go back to this at some point, but for now I've given up on this sucker which is a shame--there are a bunch of other courses that I will never see (my fault, to be sure--I'm terrible at that stupid swing meter)\n\nI haven't played any better options, so while I'm probably giving up at six hours in I'd still recommend it to anyone who's into disc golf.  It's clearly too hard for me, but assuming you're not a complete klutz you will probably have better luck with it.",
      "One of the hardest game I've ever played, also the most fun. Satisfying gameplay + pretty cool visuals and story. The moment the game clicks for you is like crack. Finishing the game gave me a better feeling than that one time I escaped child services by immigrating to Argentina",
      "This game is great for young kids. By that I mean my 6 yo daughter.\nAs an adult, it kept me entertained for about 10 minutes.\n\nThe controls took only a few minutes to work out, and there's not too much motion, nor too much text on menus, which has encouraged her to read the menu herself.\n\nWhilst the content is light on, she really seems to enjoy it. I put this down the the way the dragons are interactive and respond to her actions. This supports the way she has imaginative play with her stuffed toys.\n\nShe does stuff like:\n- makes up names\n- feeds her dragons\n- pets her dragons\n- playing throw/fetch\n- tells the dragons off for bad behaviour like stealing food\n\nWhen playing shes constantly chatting to the dragons.\n\nI'd love to see stronger personalities show up.\n\nFor example dragons wanting particular props more than others, and a little more interacting between the dragons.",

      "This game has (while this review is being written) 10076 reviews. 221 of these reviews are negative. I think this ratio of reviews is deserved and here's why:\n\n- It's a fun story, but not something outstandingly new or anything\n- No one ever can deny that it has an amazing soundtrack\n- The combat is a bit bland, but this is compensated by the fact that the game is pretty short\n- It's a short game, but definitely worth it\n\nOverall: it's just a fun short game to play on a day off. Also, I can't get this soundtrack out of my head! PLEASE SEND HELP!",
      "I am a day one player who quit the game within a few days. After coming back after almost 2 years, I am shocked and surprised. The overall improvement is great, quests are not bothering you. Story and atmosphere is hooking you up and the overall experience is good. Leveling up is easy and also you are not struggling as in most MMOs.\n\nDespite the past of the game, I think it is worth trying.",
      "First of all, i'd like to mention that i found this game by chance. But it's surprisingly better than some RPGMaker game i've tried and it's not your typical RPGMaker which is surprising since it's developed by one person.\n\n[h2]Story/character[/h2]\nOverall the story is good enough to keep myself immersed with the game. However the story and characters aren't really memorable. For lack of better comparison, it's similar with movie which entertain you but you won't remember it for long time. Although it's probably because i've played many top-rated RPGMaker game which have more budget/resource.\n\n[h2]Gameplay[/h2]\nWhile the developer emphasize this game is story-focused game, i would also describe this game as puzzle-focused RPGMaker game. Store page mention 3 hours, but it took me 9.5 hours to beat this game. Although if i never experience bug (mentioned below) and stuck at one puzzle (where i asked help on Steam discussion), i expect i would spend 7.5 hours.\n\nThe amount and variety of puzzle presented on this game is surprisingly very diverse. Some of them are the best puzzle I've experienced even though I've played fair amount of RPGMaker game. Although few others feels repetitive, difficult due to lack of hint or force you to walk around if you miss/skip something. Lack of option to run/always run is also mildly annoying for me.\n\nAnd since the puzzle of this game is rather challenging/tricky for RPGMaker game, here are few general hints from me in case you're stuck,\n[list]\n    [*]Check for hidden/invisible wall.\n    [*]Try to use items on your inventory.\n    [*]Some interactive object have no impact to solve the puzzle.\n    [*]The game show some hint, usually by highlight/flicker certain object.\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Graphic/music[/h2]\nNothing much to say here. There's few usage of stock RPGMaker asset which used accordingly. The music is nice. While the artstyle/visual is on good side, personally i feel it doesn't match very well with space/sci-fi theme. The cutscene CG also looks good.\n\n[h2]Misc.[/h2]\nThis game runs well on Linux with only minor problem. I experienced one bug which makes me unable to continue the game (not caused by Linux, since it also happen on device which use Windows OS), but the developer fixed it after some time. The game only offer single save file which is annoying to me since i experienced a bug and few puzzle are very tricky.\n\n[h2]Conclusion[/h2]\nOverall Mihirha's Legacy is nice RPGMaker despite few hiccups I've mentioned above. The developer is also responsive to my query which is also plus point. If you're RPGMaker enthusiast, you might want to try this game.",

      "First steps:\n-set nioh.exe and nioh_launcher.exe to win7 compatibility (if you experience crashes).\n-first level (London) is poorly optimized, so better rush through it and judge the next.\n-experience this game as Nioh and not as a \"Souls\" game, tho I draw comparisons here\n\n\n[h1]Good[/h1]\n\nCombat\nBy far the best thing about the game. You get 7 weapon classes + 3 ranged weapons, and each of the 7 weapons has it's own unique skillset accompanied by 3 different stances. On the fly switching between 3 stances and 2 weapons, or even both at the same time allows for a ton of combinations to chain different attacks and combos. On top of all that you get magic, spirit guardians and ninjutsu. Sky is the limit if you're willing to experiment.\n\n\nBosses\nThe game comes with roughly over 30 unique bossfights, some of them will reappear or be demoted to regular enemies over the course of the game. There are only very few bosses I didn't like. Most of them are going to be human, but that doesn't mean they are boring. Most have sick movesets that make them very engaging and fun to fight, especially the DLC bosses. \n\n\nDifficulty\nJust like Dark Souls the game is as difficult as you want it to be. This means you get alot of tools that allow you to cheese the game. Like summons, or certain character builds centered around spirit guadians and op magic like sloth talisman which makes enemies move in slow motion. \nThe difficulty curve is a falling one, aka the game is more difficult in the begining when you're figuering things out, then it remains on a steady level with occasional spikes upwards. Disregarding bs like sloth talisman I would say the game is overall more difficult than Dark Souls. Combat is faster and mistakes are punished severly, even human fodder enemies can 1-shot you if you happen to take swings when they are in heavy stance.\n\n\nStory\nIt's decent, but nothing special. Nerds interested in the sengoku period to early edo period \nwill probably appreciate the characters and their interactions.\n\n\nWorld\nIt's not an interconnected world like DS1. It is mission based where you pick main or side missions from a map, personally I don't mind the \"arcade\" style. Main missions themself are big levels with multiple shortcuts that loop back to shrines (bonfires). Those levels are bigger than most designated areas in DS3, my guess is like 1.5x-2x the size. If I had to rank the level design... DS1 >>>> DS3 > Nioh >>>>>>> DS2 \n\n\nReplayability\nThe game offers 4 NG difficulties which spice things up by switching enemy placements or giving enemies (and bosses) status effects and new moves. Other than that you get Abyss mode which is most comparable to DMC's bloody palace. \n\n\nMultiplayer/Netcode + pseudo PvP\n3 ways to play mutiplayer: as summon/summoner, co-op missions where both players make progress at the same time and PvP (which is dead).  The Netcode worked quite well for me, even over wide distances like brazil-germany. I never had to adjust for delay and could parry attacks just like offline.  The netcode is quite good imo compared to DS3 where I did lots of co-op at Champion Gundyr and parrying was totally out of the question.\n\n\nThe other \"pvp mode\" is the faction/clan system. You get multiple clans that belong to 1 of the 2 factions. A clan gives you 2 passive buffs that can compliment your playstyle. You obtain glory by killing revenants, succesfull co-op or pvp for your clan. The more glory you obtain, the higher the rank of your faction, clan and yourself. Glory acts as another currency and can be used to buy npc skins, gestures or items.\n\n\nFashion Souls\nLike the look of a particular light armor set but hate getting insta killed by radroaches? No problem, at the blacksmith you can transform any weapon skin or piece of armor, and keep the stats of your preferred equipment. If you get tired of playing as William you can buy npc skins for glory at the teahouse (unlocks at roughly 33% of the game) which is the only way to play as a female as there is no character creation.\n\n[h1]Bad[/h1]\n\nEnemy Variaty\nThe games biggest weakness in my opinion.  Enemy \"species\" come in different flavours, e.g. humans can wield any of the 7 weapons, however this doesn't realy trigger the visual stimulation of seeing something new. Saving grace: the game throws you into different 1vsX situations, so the combination of enemies keeps things interesting, kinda like DMC4 which also has wack enemy variety. I think they could've done much more in terms of creativity when it comes to the yokai/oni realm given the huge amount of lore.\n\n\nRepetition\nSide missions take place in mostly the same batch of areas or in parts of main missions. \nThey try to keep things fresh by switching enemies and spawn points. But they still feel kinda tedious because skipping them isn't realy an option as you can't deny yourself the experience, rewards and loot.\n\n\nMusic\nGood but gets repetitive as only few themes are shared across bosses.\n\n\nFunky Optimization\nSelf explainatory. FPS tanks in London and I had random crashes. The later were solved by the tips mentioned at the top of the review.\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nI found the combat mechanics to be more than able to compensate for the games weaknesses (repetition, enemy variety). This means you've to take up responsibility and be creative yourself. If you're the type who doesn't like experimenting and spends 90% of his time with spear in mid stance, and plays like its DS (dodge > R1 > R1 > dodge > R1 > dodge...), then you're gonna get bored quickly. Although, I've seen those guys during co-op all the way up to NG3-4, so who knows... .",
      "After around an hour and a half of bad spawns, scarce resources, and short-lived ventures into the more inhabited areas of the map, I ran into the first friendly player I had met in Rust. I had initially spotted him pretty far away, but I paid no real notice to him as he had a rock equipped. Eventually he got close enough for us to clearly see each other and, upon the realization that neither of us were hostile, we both pulled out torches as a mutual sign of peace (or the highest possible level of non-aggression that can exist in Rust). I dropped my old hatchet for him as I had just finished crafting one with metal, and he gave me some food as a sign of good faith. After nearly 30 minutes of searching and scavenging, we had pooled enough resources to craft us each some minimally decent gear. We knew that if we wanted to progress any further we would need to mine boulders, and a lot of them. I used what remaining materials we had to put together a 9mm handgun and several bullets, though I reminded him it was only in case we really needed it. I had decided earlier during my many unwanted experiences with bullets to the face that I would try my hardest not to run around slaughtering every newly spawned player that I came across. A few minutes out from camp we had encountered a player with a hunting bow. I had been running with my hatchet out, so I quickly took out the handgun in my inventory and pointed it in his direction, attempting to scare him away. When the player was far enough away we continued up a road towards a few stones. The area was surrounded by trees so I opted to stand guard with the handgun while my friend mined. Just as we were moving on to the next boulder, I heard the gunfire start. I turned around to see a player with an assault rifle gunning down my friend, and before I could land any shots on him he had already begun shooting me. It was at that moment that I remembered I hadn't even crafted a sleeping bag for the camp, as that was one of the objectives of the trip we were taking. I typed into the chat, thanking the friend I had made for all of his help and asking the player who had killed us if we had been intruding in his area or something along those lines. He simply wrote \"Sorry guys :D\" This is the single problem that I have with games like this. Why does it have to be \"shoot-on-sight?\" That player had obviously taken us by surprise and was better equipped than us. Even if he had a justifiable reason for approaching two very poorly equipped players (which he really didn't considering we were in the middle of the woods and he had pretty much all of the gear you could need in this game) he could have easily told us to cooperate by either putting away our weapons or just leaving the area. But of course, he comes around, sees some players trying to gather enough supplies to get to a stable point in the game, and decides to go out of his way to approach us and use unecessary ammo for a hatchet and a handgun with four bullets. Then, to add even more of an insult, he adds an apology at the end, as if he had no choice but to shoot two unexpecting, half-naked, unprepared players. \n\nAll in all, though, I do see a lot of potential in this game, and the good in the community does shine through every once in a while. I just wish that people would realize that they don't need to go around killing players who haven't had the chance to experience the game. People like that are the single reason why so many players on steam feel that they wasted money on what would otherwise be a great experience.",
      "To be honest, I could've typed this review up years ago when I got this, but I never knew how to make a review. But I'm here now, and I'm doing this... Okay, here we go...\nThe Good(AKA:Everything):\n-Cars go crunch here so you don't have to crash IRL(Though I know that won't stop all of you...).\n-Great cars and maps with nice little details.\n-An INCREDIBLE modding community. There's and ENDLESS supply of content coming out all the time from hard-working individuals, all so we can take your masterpieces and turn them into heaps of scrap.\nThe Bad(AKA:What bad?):\n-This is on me... but it can get a little boring, as your mostly just crashing cars. There are so challenges to do in game, and there are so many things you COULD do... but I guess I don't have the imagination to do that. Like I said, this is bad on me. No fault of the game.\n-Game is really graphics heavy, so a higher-end PC is recommended. Nothing too fancy, but RAM and GPU are hardest hit... maybe processor too...(I'm not that smart with tech...) But this isn't truly bad, as you probably already have good spec if you're looking to play a physics-heavy game.\n-Load times... They used to be bad, but they've gotten considerably better in recent updates. But... the more mods you get, the more it'll have to load. A good PC should be able to handle it, but just keep this in mind.(I have 100's of mods, and it's not too bad...)\nAnd well, that's it. Sorry this it so long... One of my first reviews, after all. But this game deserves to looked at in detail. If you play it once, you'll come back to it here and there to have more fun. So, in short, I HIGHLY recommend this game!\nIf you read this far, thank you so much! I tried my best here!\n",
      "i would say yes there are many bugs especially in the ne update where the cell doors remain open in normal mode and the guards take the new prisoners in the new cells and leave them there handcuffed forever. however this is one of the funnest games iv'e ever bought and it has brought me countless hours of enjoyment, the bugs might be annoying at times but mostly a good restart should do it :). overall i think this game is very worth getting, it lets you play the game how you want to play it and doing so will give you hours of fun as theres always something to do wether its create mor cells or make a execution room. and the mods are great you can really see the creativity in the prisons people have made i would definantly reccomend the checkpoint charlie military prion texture mod too.",

      "1. What is \"Pyre\"?\nThe game \"Pyre\" was made by Supergiant Games and was released on the 25th of July in 2017. After \"Bastion\" and \"Transistor\" this is their third game. \"Pyre\" is an indie-action-rpg, which story is mostly told in form of a novel. The gameplay is very different to the experience you probably made in \"Bastion/Transistor\", which lead a few people to put a negative review on steam. Now you will no longer play as one single character like before, but you are responsible for a group of exiles. The gameplay at it´s heart can be declared as 3 parts:\n \npart 1 contains travelling/exploring the world\n\npart 2 contains social interactivity with your group (talking/trading/decision-making)\n\npart 3 contains to take part in the rites, that means a fast-paced action ball game (3 vs 3) without        a planning phase (like in \"Transistor\")\n\n\n2. Technical details\n-the game runs fine on my windows 10 64 bit machine and it needs about 8.2 gb space of your hard drive. Unfortunately the game runs bad on old machines, because you need about 4 gb ram to run it without an error (my other 3 gb ddr2-system couldn´t run it, I received a ram-error-message when starting the game).\n\n-controls with mouse+keyboard or gamepad are good and well implemented.\n\n\n3. What does the game do right?\n-great rpg-novel-mixture as a whole unique and emotional experience\n-despite the linear progression (mentioned \"phases/parts\" above) the game stays interesting enough to continue\n-a colourful and fantastic world to explore (no open-world)\n-great character-design and a good variety of different creatures, which affects the gameplay during the rites\n-beautiful artstyle with a lot of detail and smooth animations \n-believable and fleshed-out storyline (NOT \"black and white\") with a personalised ending! \n-wonderful soundtrack (mostly ambient)\n-the creatures of the world speak their own language, subtitle is displayed in old-fashioned English\n-rites: the thrilling-faced-paced-action-game has a lot of depth to it (skill tree/character selection/items/area of the rite)\n-selectable difficulty level (rites can be optionally restartet), which can be changed during the game (+ \"titan-mode\": advanced challenges you can add separately like in \"Bastion/Transistor\")\n-meaningful and emotional decisions to be made (I´m looking at you mass effect), thankfully there are no dead-ends but different endings (personalised!)\n-\"Pyre\" is \"2-3 times\" longer compared to \"Bastion\"/\"Transistor\" without getting boring\n-good mouse+keyboard and gamepad support\n-\"versus-mode\": you can play against friends together on your pc or alone against CPU (with all the characters in the game!)\n\n\n4. What does the game do wrong?\n-the fast-paced-gameplay during the rites can be very fast and too stressful at times (I experienced some unfair situations here and there)\n-controls are sometimes not precise enough, especially when the gameplay is getting hot\n-hardware requirements (like \"Transistor\") with 4 gb ddr-ram are over the top regarding old rigs with dual-core cpu´s \n-some minor bugs during the rites (ball gets stuck, switching between characters over distance, bad camera angles over distance)\n-\"versus mode\" can only be played as local multiplayer\n-no bonus material for fans at all \n\n\n5. tl;dr\nPyre offers a fantastic but linear action-rpg-experience with a great story, which is told in form of a novel with a personalised ending. The gameplay is a mixture of exploration, social interactivity and a 3 vs 3 ball-sports-game. The level of creativity considering world-building, character design, music and the way the story is being told is on an insanely high level. If you liked \"Bastion\" and \"Transistor\" you need to know that you don´t play just as one character anymore. But what you can expect is a game with a heart, just like their games before. Pyre is in my opinion a masterpiece and the best Supergiant game so far.\n\n\n6. Final thoughts\nAs a child of the 80´s I played a lot of pc games. Sometimes I look back and remember how I bought game boxes from a company called \"Lucas Arts\". There were times I didn´t even inform myself about the upcoming games, I just bought them because I loved their games I purchased before. For me Supergiant reached that status in the present time. \n\n\n\nUntil the stars align!\nIf you liked this review be sure to hit the like button to help other players with helpful reviews.

      "Yeah sooooo I went 1k words past the max...had to pare this down...it's ok...I'm mentally stable...\n\nCrossCode is a top-notch indie in its genre. I'd mention it in the same breath as Celeste, Hades, and Outer Wilds. (guess I just did.) If you can at least enjoy both puzzles and real-time combat, this game is for you; it's not as much of a JRPG as it might look. The only real flaw I care to levy is that it isn’t incredible out of the gate; it’s merely good, and gets much better. I was going to summarize my reactions and add a \"what is the premise/gameplay loop\" section and have longer sections but I had to cut it all out so have _/5 ratings on the section titles instead. It's fine. I'm fine. Everything is fine.\n\nOk, review time.\n\nSTORY 4/5 NEATO\n\nThe story is great, and not quite what you might expect. It starts pretty light and cozy, with solid (and often meta) humor interspersed with cryptic moments. I like how casually the in-universe MMO is treated by the players. I enjoyed all the characters, including our mostly-mute but personable Lea. Once it ramps up, the story takes some exciting turns, too; the devs really know how to do drama without doing overdrama. I didn't relate too much to the story but I think it was told quite well. I like the portrayal of the antagonists for the most part, though I wish I could have felt their presence more often. The lore is also fascinating, if occasionally hard to grasp because the line between real and virtual is very thin due to the game’s particular premise. (The difference between real people and NPCs is sometimes unclear, for instance.) The ending was good, but I think the DLC epilogue wraps the game up far better.\n\nCOMBAT 5/5 WOWIE\n\nWhen you start out, combat feels almost hack-n-slashy. You can spam melee attacks and bullets for days, but you also have a charged projectile, a dodge-dash, and a shield. The elemental modes are absolutely the highlight due to the way enemies work, and the sort of limiter gauge they have forces strategy. Special moves are stylish and borderline absurd at higher levels. A huge skill tree controls them and much more; unlike some skill trees, this one requires choices, which is always a good sign. Oh and consumables are your main source of healing and buffs, and they aren't overpowered! Balancing win.\n\nThe enemies are really what make the combat fantastic. Almost every enemy has at least one gimmick and one visible weakness. The stun gauge mechanic is vital to all battles, forcing you to exploit those weaknesses to stun enemies and give you time to use your extra-long special moves. Bosses love to give you iterative micro-puzzles to fill their stun gauges, while minibosses are comfortably in-between. Bosses commonly have armor or invulnerability when not stunned, forcing even overleveled players to figure out the micro-puzzles to hit hard. (More great balancing.) Most weaknesses involve the element system, eventually encouraging you to swap elements multiple times mid-fight. The micro-puzzles will build on what you’ve been learning in a dungeon if it’s a dungeon fight. I'll mention that some normal enemies do feel like damage sponges at first, but you'll get used to this; the simple enemy design in the early game makes it seem worse than it is imo.\n\nPUZZLES 5/5 FUN COOL\n\nFor puzzles you've got your common environmental \"platforming\" puzzles, your specialized quest puzzles, your dynamic mini-puzzles in battles, and your iterative puzzling gauntlets in dungeons. Also almost everything is secretly part puzzle? Like, everything. They're an invasive species. They draw most of their complexity from the element system too. Each element has its own effects on certain objects and structures, and mainly you use charge shots to interact, though each attack has its own uses. Not much to say here; they're great puzzles. A couple may stump you for a while, but that's impossible to avoid, and I think CrossCode strikes a perfect challenge balance.\n\nQUESTS 5/5 WHEEEEEE\n\nWhile some quests conform to the typical hunting/gathering quests of MMOs, most boast some entirely unique content. Challenges range from unique bosses to puzzles to platforming to other familiar gimmicks that are secretly also puzzles. I won't spoil them. Quests generally use mechanics you have seen already in new, often very different, scenarios. NPCs are mostly there to be amusing or set up the gameplay, and that didn't bother me tbh.\n\nITEM MANAGEMENT 5/5 AAAAA\n\nItem and equipment acquisition? Engaging? WTF? Technically you get them like you do in any RPG. But, rare plants have high rare item drop rates, so if you know the platforming puzzle to reach em you don't have to waste much time. Enemies' drop rates rise with a high Combat Rank, which you get by killing many enemies in a row before the post-fight cooldown period ends and you get to heal to full and level up. This is tough until you're very comfortable with the area. Once you are, it's a whole new way of battling, using area knowledge to string together sequential fights. And what does the game do but give you a piece of upgradable equipment that grants the Combat Rating bonus to plants too?\n\nI actually cared about the equipment in the game too! *kisses Life Fiber Uniform* (yes they really make this reference) Equipment also matters more than level so the devs can control your power level better. Most times you can buy some basic equipment to explore, then return with items to trade to NPCs for stronger gear. Stronger gear has unique traits and you might prefer one over another, so it's nice that with trading you get to focus your resources on what you want. Sometimes you can trade some enemy drops for other ones, as I recall, which is a nice...uh, trade-off to get to make.\n\nQUALITY OF LIFE 5/5 HELP\n\nCONVENIENCE REIGNS in CrossCode. Text log like in visual novels? Check. Encyclopedia of story recaps, character summaries, CrossWorlds lore & terminology, etc.? Check. Enemy index? Check. Item drop rates? Check. Available trades? You beck. This is EXTREMELY helpful for an RPG, which otherwise would require a guide or plain luck to find rare item drops. Oh yeah also there's UI? I forgot about it cuz it's really good. Also the keyboard controls for swapping elements are a bit janky but I managed.\n\nAesthetics 3/5-5/5 SUBJECTIVITY WOOOOOO\n\nYeah if ya like what you see in the trailers and screenshots, that oughta be enough. I thought the art was average-good in the beginning, but like everything else the art improves as you go. They must’ve gone back and worked on old stuff, but not too much. The music is great. No complaints there. My one objective critique is, Lea has no depth perception -- the art makes similar-height platforms look identical. I ran into so many walls and stared at so many small flat gaps I thought I couldn't cross. I'm not a fool! It's the game's fault! But actually this time!\n\nA NEW HOME DLC 6/5 WTF OMG\n\nThe paid DLC is The Culmination of CrossCode. The epilogue is complex and fascinating and rewarding. The dungeon is an incredible all-elements send-off. I adore the new quests. And the art?? The environments, the enemies, the NPC portraits are all so pretty. Don't be fooled by the letters \"DLC\": this is not Discretionary Leisure Content. If you liked the base game, this is...Deluxe...eLite...C-content??? look these are not great letters to work with ok\n\nCONCDLUDSIONO\n\nWhat else to say? CrossCode good. Buy it. Do the thing. Also, look out for Project Terra, Radical Fish's next project. It translates their current style into a 3D environment with dynamic lighting. It’s pretty & it reduces that height perspective issue. There isn’t much info about it out yet, but keep your eyes out! (figuratively pls) I'm excited for what they'll come up with.\n\nHOLY **** I MADE IT AND WITH CHARACTERS TO SPARE YESSSS — ohnowai",
      "I hated Undertale.\n\nIt was, pretty clearly, a game about sexy skeletons. I did not care about sexy skeletons. I refused to play a game about sexy skeletons.\n\nThen my friend made me listen to the soundtrack, and I decided I could deal with a few hours of sexy skeletons if I got to listen to the best video game music I had ever heard while doing it. \n\nI played Undertale. It's not a game about sexy skeletons. It's a game about choices, maybe, or morality, or curiosity. It's a game about pushing the limits. It's a game about experiences, about \"what would happen if I did this?\", about storytelling so intricate and complex and raw that it shouldn't be able to fit into seven hours of bullet hell and pixel graphics. But, somehow, it does. Every choice you make has an impact. Every object you check has a story. The soundtrack, the witty yet profound writing, the simple pixel graphics, and even the menu screens and bullet patterns themselves all intertwine in order to tell a story that only you decide the ending of.\n\nAlso, the skeletons aren't even sexy.\n\nMy advice to you: Go in as blind as you can.

      "[h1]Gameplay : 9/10\nGraphic : 9/10\nCommunity : -25/10 ( updated, people see this wrong and keep asking me.   \nI wrote\" negative 25.\")\n\n\nPlaying with friends: 11/10\nCompetitiveness&balance: 11/10\n[/h1]\n----------------------------------------INTRO--------------------------------------------------\n\n         For those of you who aren't familiar with the MOBA genre, here's a quick explanation. There are two bases, each on opposing corners of the map, and one for each team. The objective is to destroy the opposing team's base. Three roads, or lanes, connect the bases. Low-level units automatically and periodically spawn from each base in groups, and these soldiers travel down the three paths between the bases. As a result, there is always a battle going on in the trio of lanes.\nIn addition, each team has three defensive towers in each lane on their side of the map, totaling nine towers per team. These structures deliver powerful attacks against enemy soldiers and players, but they can be destroyed through significant effort. Because of this, fights tend to center on the towers.\n\n         All of this happens automatically. Unlike in typical RTS games, you don't have to collect resources, build structures, or train units. You only control your hero, which can level up and acquire a range of upgradeable powers. However, its role might best be described as support for the A.I. soldier units. Players help control the battlefronts and destroy enemy towers in the lanes. The idea is to to open your opponent's base up to a direct attack by the A.I. and hero once the towers in a lane are gone. There are five players per team, which of course doesn't divide into the three lanes equally. When a player dies, he respawns at the team's base after a penalty period.\n\n\n[h1]Overall:\npros: A much better game than lol\ncons: A much harder game than lol\n\nLMAO\nquit playing trash game plz[/h1]\n\n----------------------------------------Pro&Con---------------------------------------------\nPROS\n\n1,   All At Your Fingertips – players have access to ALL of the game's heroes from the start. No need to unlock or purchase heroes. ( poor LOL)\n2,  Snowball Easily – dying results in a loss of gold, can magnify the effects of snowballing(Buyback system can make sure you don't lose a game with just one mistake).\n3,  Huge Variety of Cosmetics and Skins – players can customize individual parts of their heroes from both valve and community.

      "If you somehow don't know what this is: It's a meta-narrative focused walking sim with a funny narrator. Only you know if that kind of thing sounds like a good time to you.\n\nSubtract about 26 hours from my playtime because I'm a lunatic who left the game running for a whole day to get a silly achievement.\n\nI loved the HD remix (never played the og mod), and I really liked this one too, but I will say that a lot of the commentary the original offered doesn't hit as hard or hold up as well almost a decade later, just because the narrative structure and how narrative is tied to gameplay of many story-driven games has changed in that time (because of course it has), as well as the mindset of a lot of players being different. So I think that it's worth keeping in mind the cultural moment the original was made during... if you're the thinky type who likes to overthink things. You massive nerd.\n\nStill, it felt nice to jump back in and spend a little more time with the narrator, and there were some legitimately striking moments in the new content that I found to be quite powerful and engaging. Overall, though, having played the original, getting all the new stuff (and revisiting the old) felt a lot more like checking off a to-do list than active exploration teasing at the boundaries of the game and it's layout than the first one.",
      "A Short Hike is a relaxing, casual game about exploring an expansive, mountainous island park and eventually making your way to its summit so you can get cell phone reception.\n\nYou play as Claire, a bird who can climb, glide, and flap to great heights using a stamina system based upon how many golden and silver feathers you’ve collected. Along the path to the mountaintop you’ll encounter Animal Crossing-style characters who are friendly, punny, and usually have some minor task for you to solve, ranging from finding lost items to making deliveries.\n\nHelping residents of the island is completely optional, as is just about every activity in the game other than locating a few feathers and reaching the summit; as a result, length can range from an hour if you don’t stop to smell the roses to a few hours if you decide to make friends with everyone and see all the park has to offer.\n\nActivities include filling out a fishing journal by trading in your catches, digging in suspicious spots, solving treasure map clues, parkour racing, and opening up shortcuts by breaking blocked entrances and watering bouncy flowers. \n\nA Short Hike has a charming aesthetic and a lovely, peaceful soundtrack. I felt driven to see everything the game had to offer despite not being forced into any of it and never lost interest until I did so. It’s a beautiful little world that will make fans of Animal Crossing feel right at home.",

That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.\n\nI liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters. But it all fell apart and tries to teach a very vapid moral that someone in their early 20's who has never had a meaningful relationship would idealize.\n\nAt least it was short.\n",

The on foot combat feels a little too straight foward though, the gore animations are kinda boring though, like feels like its a Xbox/360 game in that way, and collecting scrap can get a little repetitive. My final thought yea this game is worth getting but if you haven't played id's \"RAGE\", I'd reccomend getting that first, it's a extremely simmilar although kinda diffrent scenario game that will quench your Mad Max thirst.",

After all, it has to be ready for take-off in order for children everywhere to receive their presents on schedule. But a wicked troll blasts us out of the sky just as the test drive is about to end. He went over the line and wants to ruin Christmas for everyone on Earth. It is up to us to bring the troll to his senses and save Christmas for everyone.\n\nTLoS brings players to one world and six levels of great platforming that are reminiscent of Super Mario World (SNES) but simplified. There are only six levels total, one of which is a castle, before the final battle with the troll. The only difference is that we will be collecting chocolate cookies rather than the traditional yellow coins. We also lose part of our cloak when we are injured, so it's not uncommon for you to find yourself jumping through the levels wearing nothing but red boxer shorts. For instance, red blocks can give you a new coat, which means extra life, or Santa socks and hats, which give a power-up or simply chocolate cookies. The power-up allows you to throw stones as if you had collected the Fire Flower from Super Mario, and that's about it. TLoS also offers a 2-4 co-op player mode, in which players will be able to work together to complete this short and family-friendly adventure.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3009359595\n\nSimilar to Super Mario World, you walk to a level to choose them in the Overworld. Once we reach a certain level, we are allowed to walk, leap, and even sprint. Additionally, there are other indications on the screen that show you how many cookies you have already gathered and how much time is remaining to finish the level. We get an extra life when 100 cookies are collected. We can activate a checkpoint about halfway through the level to pick up exactly where the checkpoint was reached, instead of having to do the entire level all over again. The game also features side-scrolling and underwater levels. The only problem is that if you quit at level three, close the game and start again, you have to start from level one, so you have to play the game in one go. This means that there are no save points or \"save states\". Considering the length of the game, this is not a big deal, but it's still \"annoying\".\n\n[h3] My Specs [/h3]\n\n[code]CPU: i9 9900k\nGPU: RTX 2080 Ti\nRAM: DDR4 32 GB RAM\nOS: Win10\nResolution: 1440p @144hz\n[/code]\n\n[h3] Conclusion [/h3]\n\nWe are all hoping that Nintendo will release their IPs on Steam so that we can play with them one more time. We may all agree, based on experience, that this is probably never going to happen, but Indie developers are there to make it happen. To avoid the tedious teachings at school, you used to be able to play these types of games in class on the usual Flash Player websites, and now you can play them on Steam. Though it's not a masterpiece, it's extremely minimalistic, and it's unquestionably too short, the 20 minutes I spent playing it were nevertheless a lot of fun, especially because the platforming is accurate and not wonky at all. Just remember, it's very minimalistic and may be too minimalistic for some, but if that doesn't bother you, feel free to go ahead and try it out.\n\nIt would be my personal highlight if there were additional levels, more secret exits, more power-up alternatives, and more hours of overall playtime.\n\n[h2] Final Verdict: 8/10 A typical gas station snack that turns out to be a surprisingly good one.🎅 [/h2]",
      "I am a Filthy Casual (tm) who plays games like Mass Effect and Fallout 4 on easy and still die over and over. I got my \"you died\" achievement in Dark Souls 2 before the tutorial and stopped playing after like forty minutes with zero qualms. I have rage quit every single platformer game I have ever touched, and just sort of despise brutally hard things that feel like chores.\n\nBasically, I am not exactly sure why I decided to buy Dead Cells in the first place. Sure, I love the look and one of the few platformers I've ever 100%'d was Super Metroid (with a LOT of swearing and rage quitting), so 'Metroidvania' is an appealing term to me, but it is still inherently marketed as a game that is not for me, or people like me.\n\nThis game is hard. I have 11 hours on it and I can't get past the third area on any given path. I die for stupid reasons and lose all my stuff and... I don't care. I haven't rage quit once; in fact, I have to force myself away from the game after a death so I can do things like eat. I find the combat engaging and entertaining, the progression satisfying and there's something really solid about being forced to start from square one (ish) every single time, in a way I've just never experienced.\n\nSo, sure, buy this if you love hard games/Dark Souls/no checkpoint kind of games. Absolutely, I'm pretty sure you've alreeady heard this is likely to be up your alley.\n\nBut even if you're a dirty rotten casual gamer who button smashes in any game approaching action, and panics when the screen flashes red around the edges... give it a try if you get the opportunity. It is seriously fun.",
      "Damn this game is so unexpectedly good i can't believe it.\nThe setting is perfect. The idea behind the game is awesome.\nThe graphics are so atmospheric.\n\nThank f*ck that this isn't published by EA.\nStay indipendent Crytek, listen to the Community and the Profit will rain.\n\nRating: FUCK YEAH DUDE!!!!",
      "Absolutely Don't understand all the negative reviews for this game. \n\nFirst off: this game is a RogueLite in that death is permanent, be prepared for this. Death is a part of the game and you are NOT losing progress by dying.. it's death mechanic is very much like Rogue Legacy in that you keep progress that carries on to your next character when you begin again. Dying also isn't like you lost more than 45 minutes of your time. Every single game in this genre will have plenty of deaths involved before you FINALLY get that first win (in most cases). Some people are going to need to spend some time grinding levels, dying and repeat until they have enough sticker slots open to overpower things. Keep that in mind going into it. You retain your level and any big upgrades you acquire when you die so you are NOT starting from scratch every single time like you would in most rogue likes. \n\nI normally wouldn't review a game so early but I saw the negative reviews pouring in and felt I needed to add some counters to it. \n\nThe second thing: the art/music/atmosphere is absolutely brilliant for a game in this genre where most games of this nature tend to be relatively grim. As with most roguelike/lites its procedurally generated so the map, enemies and what have you will be different each time. \n\nThird: the forced timer before you have to fight the boss is a bit jarring at first as i've never played a game of this type where I have limited time to actually get there.. but it's kind of brilliant really because it adds a completely different layer to the game in that you have to manage your time very well. What do you think you have time to do before the inevitable? Do you want to run around and grind exp killing trash mobs? Or do you think that time could be better spent knocking some dungeons out (time halts when in dungeons so take your time in these) and getting some gear and arguably more exp than you would just wandering the map. Also, you absolutely have plenty of time to explore the map as there are shrines (you have to find them but the map isn't huge), that you can pay a special currency to add another day of time to the clock. If you see a review complaining about the timer and they have less than an hour in the game... take that with a grain of salt. \n\nFour: The combat is pretty simple but well done. There is a surprising amount of depth to it as well when you start buying and finding more powerful weapons (toys) that can do a variety of things and synergize pretty well together. Enemy variety is pretty good so far, each time you level up it adds more enemy variety to encounter around the map. \n\nFive: dungeons are fairly simple and a good mix of mini puzzles and fun combat encounters. \n\nIf you enjoy roguelike/lite games DEFINITELY give this a spot in your library to see what it has to offer. So far I'd put it 8-9/10 but I don't quite have the amount of time necessary to feel comfortable ranking it against other rogue games. I may edit this once I get to a point to see how much replayability it has but until then I'm eager to keep sending swords into a meat grinder and just adding to my power each time. Please look at how much time people have in a game before rating their reviews and taking their word. .5 hours is not enough time to really warrant a helpful review... nor is 6 in my case but I really don't want this game to be DoA\n\nEdit: Just beat Mormo for the second time.. trust me when i say you can make the timer go on infinitely. I Don't want to spoil anything BUT head to dungeons and kill as many enemies as you can to save up gold and another currency, and make a good loop around each area of the map and you'll find all sorts of neat things. As for bugs, I've had none and I'm at 13 hours of steady play. Don't waste time killing EVERY enemy that's in the open areas cause that will eat too much of your time, but focus on finding dungeons and the hidden npc encounters. I had my timer extended to approx. 8 days in game time and I also found a way to permanently increase the amount of time I have on subsequent runs. Give it a chance, learn how the game works before being upset about the timer.",
      "DON'T BUY THIS GAME!\nThis is one of the best games I've ever played.

It is a beautiful story about loss, depression, and finding meaning in a chaotic and absurd reality. Anything more is kinda spoilery so I'm gonna stop myself there.

(You'll be amazed at how many NPCs stress over a family member unable to get or hold a job.) As you march on, you'll learn that beneath all the apparent sweetness lies a serious, compelling narrative. Its logic includes economy, psychology and strategy and favours realism + logic to drive and resolve many conflicts. The overwhelming cuteness and apparent anime-aesthetics serve as a visual counter-point and a fun diversion for the consumer - as ever.\n\nXSEED did a wonderful job on translating and adapting the game. [url=xseedgames.tumblr.com/post/92769039590/xseed-blog-the-legend-of-heroes-trails-in-the]With the problems they faced[/url] and work ahead of them, this needs to be stressed.\n\n[i]Warning for the easily offendable:[/i] This RPG follows the tradition of amalgamating many diverse cultural and historical influences in a distinct blend of East & West. When the Gospel and an Apostle make an appearance, they singify something else from what one might expect. Also, while loved and cared for, children of Liberl do get exposed to real danger. That orphanage you helped? Burnt to the ground. The grand-daughter wanting to help her grandpa? Gets sternly warned, but ultimately joins for an incredibly dangerous infiltration mission to rescue him.\n\n***** [b]Playable characters[/b]: varied, with very flexible builds, require some system mastery. (5/5)\n\nYou get to make a party of up to 4 PCs and as the story goes on, more people join the Bright kids. The Bracer Guild they're a part of provides them with much quest fodder and some plot protection, but ultimately, they're on their own. Their companions are darn well excellent and come in very handy: if you can't fight through an area, wait until your ranks well. Of the 6 available, Schera's and Oliverier's antics made me giggle ever so often, and they are my favourites. In lieu of an old favourite of mine, imagine a game where most of in-game banter has Sands pitted against Neeshkas... You'll love it.\n\nSo what's with the builds? They are limited, but not in a bad way. The character level-ups are automated, abilities are unlocked intermittently and vary greatly (each character has a different build, but no class). You get a pick of 5 equippable items + some slots to fill wil crystals which are more than wondrous items, because they synergize. You may play around for a bit and just pick anything to wear/slot, because there's always a reload/retry or flight from a battle... I've actually made it halfway through the game before I read up on those orbal crystals and made my first optimized builds. \n\nAll in all, the character building is very beginner-friendly, which helps a lot. And there's ample room for experiment, which is great. Strategic value of turn-based combat is best described elsewhere, but let's just say it doesn't disappoint.\n\n[i]Warning for the lazy:[/i] The characters need to be fine-tuned, eventually. Final chapter presents a tournament which requires a higher level of orbal system mastery, while the final battle sequence ranges from enjoyable (if you got the combinations right) to downright enfuriating (if you didn't).\n\n[i]Warning for time-constrained:[/i] Beware the walls of text. Seriously. It's a living book.  It eats players.\n\n[i]Warning for the romantically inclined:[/i] There is much in-game talk about the nature of Joshua and Estelle's growing relationship, yet not one NPC seems to mind the fact that they're officially siblings (Estelle is Cassisus' daughter, and Joshua's his ward/stepson). Which is fine by me, because the two couldn't be more opposed than they are, and their confusion about life & love is delivered tactfully and with much wit. \n\n*** [b] The gameplay [/b]: a rocky ride to get through the story. (3/5)\n\nWhat I didn't miss here was a feeling of game being rushed and some content dropped because of time constraints - something my favourite Western RPGs chronically suffer from. The main narrative is one of adventure, with walls of text hinting at massive spoilers. I enjoyed it immensely, and can't wait for the sequel!\n\nWith that said, there are some glaring issues with gamplay and story presentation. The one thing I did have a problem with were wildly varying secret quests one can discover along the way (you'll need to consult a [url=www.gamefaqs.com/psp/933329-the-legend-of-heroes-trails-in-the-sky/faqs/62079?single=1]guide[/url] to get them). In-game Junior Bracer Journal served me well as an agenda, so that's a plus. \n\n[i]Warning in general:[/i] achievements such as best rank/weapon take a lot of time and effort, so be warned and grab a guide BEFORE starting the game properly. As TvTropes put it, my playthrough suffered a heavy case of Guide Dang It!\n\n[i]Warning for time-constrained:[/i]  I didn't mind all the grinding, but you can't escape it. Especially if you want the best gear the game's got or insist on micro-managing stuff. The difference between starting the Chapter 1 as L14 (my first try) and L18 (the second playthrough I finished) taught me to grind as I save: at every opportunity, as much as I can. And also, the railroading, apparently a traditional facet of the JRPG genre. Finally, hasty decisions versus small time windows. You can miss so much with only a click. I re-did the Prologue because I was merely getting to know the ropes and I missed two books I wanted to collect. The re-run was worth it.\n\n*\n\n[b]TL;DR[/b]: Very good game, with some issues for the uninitiated. Merits a sequel (localization's in the works!) and a second playthrough (especially for achievements).\n\n*\n\nThank you for reading this review. It was my first, and I hope it served you well. =)",
      "From my nine year old: \"We like that every screen you can stop and color, and if you don't want to color there is a story part to it. We really like to do both; there are puzzles, different colors and different sections. I would definitely recommend this game for five and up year olds.\"",

      "VIDEO REVIEW: https://youtu.be/DzdF-i2drLs\n\nI loved this game!  It was a worthy prequel to Cthulhu Saves the World!  If you’re a fan of the games from this company I recommend playing it!\n\nIf there is one downside to the game, it’s that it’s very linear. Every game day you just make a selection to the R'lyehtionships options, a cutscene occurs and you get a reward item. Do that for a few in game days than the next level plays. These levels are just as linear as there’s very little deviating. \n\nHowever the rest of the game makes up for that short coming. The R'lyehtionships choices give great replay value, the writing is spot on, and the fighting is just as good.\n\nAlso the addition of a “skip incoming random battle” option was refreshing. \n\nSo overall i say that the game is another Zeboyd games classic that is perfect for the holiday. \n\nPRO\n+Great funny writing as per Zeboyd Games\n+Amazing graphics on par with Cosmic Star Heroine\n+Great music\n+Combat is easy simple and fun\n+Challenging but fair\n+ R'lyehtionships gives clever replay value \n\nCON\n-Game is painfully linear.\n-Very little places to wonder around in gameplay\n-R'lyehtionships causes Uber simplified “quests” to be glorified cutscenes\n-Needs more interactive items in the maps for more funny writing \n\nI’d give the game an 8/10! It’s highly recommend it if you’re a long time fan and it’s worthy a purchase during a sale if you’re unsure.",

      "Dear Dev, \nI love this game, if you're reading reviews, please consider some ideas to make it better:\n-  Level designing: Add more ways to choose, and different endings. Right now SoR4 is flat from A to B, it made me feel down compare to SoR3.\n- Alternate customs, and playable same characters: Floyd is overrated and all my friends want to pick him. Make a game with 4 Floyds running sound fun. Use lifetime score to unlock customs.\n- 2v2 Battle!

      "[b][i]AMID EVIL[/i] is very much [i]Quake[/i] 1 level design in a [i]Hexen[/i]/[i]Heretic[/i] universe.[/b] It's well done. We're a bit spoiled this year with outstanding '90s FPS shooters. Personally, I prefer both [i]Ion Maiden[/i] and [i]DUSK[/i] over this title for the following reasons:\n\n1) I find [i]AMID EVIL[/i] to be a bit generic in terms of theme; the fantasy setting could use a bit more to set it apart.\n\n2) I prefer real or low fantasy weapons/guns over wands and totally high fantasy weapons. Now, don't get it twisted - I appreciate that these high fantasy weapons exist, but yeah, they leave something to be desired. I miss reloading and all of that. \n\n3) The level design in [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is much more 'sprawling' (for lack of a better term) just like the original [i]Quake[/i]. Most levels are indoors in what feels like an underground compound (at the time of writing this review). I personally like the backwoods feel of [i]DUSK[/i], or the dystopian cityscape of [i]Ion Maiden[/i] far more. I want to look up at the sky in most levels.\n\n4) The enemy design is different than the other two games I mention, which is good - but they all mostly have a 'same' kind of feel. The enemies are all super fast, so most of your efforts are focused on running backwards while fending them off. It's fun, but gunplay isn't quite as fun as the other two games for this particular reason.\n\n5) The font and overall menu system definitely feels 'Early Access'. I know the font is being worked on, which is desperately needed. \n\n6) My favorite way to play the game is Endless mode - and I feel like that's a flaw in itself. It's the opposite for me with [i]DUSK[/i]. I want to fall in love with the campaign, but eh, there isn't really any story or anything all that interesting to suck me in. The secrets are super easy to find compared to the other two games, too.\n\n7) No multiplayer. Now, I really don't care about this - but who designs a game in this genre without building this in from the ground up? You know the community is going to whine about this. Questionable design decision to say the least.\n\n[b]Well, it sounds like I just dumped all over the game.[/b] Please don't get me wrong. [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is a welcome addition to the genre. The *great news* is that this is not just some reskin of [i]DUSK[/i] - it certainly is it's own thing. And that's really important. \n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+Fairly polished game for Early Access\n+It's the most modern version of the original [i]Quake[/i] we've seen this year\n+Well optimized\n+Lots of content right now\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-The universe is generic\n-No multiplayer\n-The font is too hard to read\n-Music is nothing to write home about\n-The secrets are easy, and there really aren't all that many of them\n-Weapons could use more 'oomph' to them; also we should be able to use the special ability when we want to as opposed to it autotriggering\n\n[b]I was psyched out of my mind for [i]AMID EVIL[/i] - and while it is certainly good - I think I'll be focused more on [i]DUSK[/i] and [i]Ion Maiden[/i].[/b] Because, let's face it, gaming time is valuable and we can't play everything.",
      "(If you're past a certain age, I can just say that this is Take Two Interactive's \"Bureau 13\" game, except actually done WELL. If not, keep reading.)\n\nTechnobabylon was one of the best games I played in 2017 (yeah I know it came out in 2015, shh). Wadjet Eye has done it again with Unavowed, one of the best games I played in 2018 and an amazing capstone to all of their work so far. You can play this game without having played the Blackwell series, but you'll get a little more out of it if you have.\n\nIt's also a rather dark piece of work, with a tone somewhere between Sleepy Hollow (the TV show) and something like Buffy. Your character (whose gender and former profession are chosen by you) gets possessed and goes on a year-long murderfestival rampage across New York City. Eventually the Unavowed, a brave supernatural-evil-fighting duo show up, and with the body back in your own control you sign up to fight evil with them. \n\nAs the game goes on, you recruit more characters in Bioware style, solve mysteries (all of which center around that year of hell your character went through), make Tough Choices and work to make the city a better place. All in absolutely gorgeous 640x480 resolution pixel art. \n\nThere were a couple of puzzles that slowed me down (the word \"LEGS\" is going to cause me to make faces for weeks) but this mostly flowed very smoothly. If you're at all a fan of past Wadjet Eye creations, this game needs to be in your life. If you're not, it's a good starting place, maybe the best starting place except that its quality might spoil you for the rough patches of past games.\n\nThis game contains some gore, some body/existential horror that might be jarring to some, and a lot of swearing.",
      "For context, I played it on PC for 77 hours including the post-game content which I presumed to be obligatory to complete. I highly recommend to use a gamepad or other controllers instead of K+M controls because support is bad in the ported version.\n\nNow, to start with: Undernaut: Labyrinth of Yomi is a first person dungeon crawler at first, then a horror game second. To my surprise, the game remarkably managed to show the correct way to set an ominous tone and a gritty narrative of a sick and twisted world with the story pulling-no-punches when it's required which I personally absolutely enjoyed. You, as the main protagonist will be subjected to numerous morally dubious acts to survive under the whims of otherworldly beings whether you want to or not. And adding that, the somber visual style captures perfectly the way the story should be told. And I simply adore the art directions and the representations of the characters in-game such as the Mad King and The Divine Child which I noticed to be quite different from the other characters' design of which heavily came from the Spirit Hunter series artist. Different from the other games, ULoY is a reverse-isekai game where the world takes place in Yomi Ward - Japan during the Showa period. It's a very interesting take on the trope and one I thoroughly enjoyed.\n\nFor the gameplay section, you have the freedom of choice to role-play as either Male or Female MC, as well as choosing a multitude of charming portraits for your subordinates with the ability to add backstories and backgrounds for the full immersion. You have 8 classes to choose from, with each diverging into Specialized and Comprehensive jobs. In my opinion, Experience Inc had done a wonderful job of not overpowering one class to another, instead adding great complimentary skills i.e buffs that lasts until returning to base, withstanding K.O etc. Not to mention, fine-tuning the equipment system such as weapons, armors, and accessories having elements of diversity to effectively and efficiently killing enemies and dungeon-crawling.\n\nBut there are two gameplay elements that I absolutely enjoyed using. The first being the \"Flowers\" mechanic to build ladders, bridges, fast-travelling and much more to progress in-game, connecting shortcuts or finding secrets. It's very interactive and simple in design but contributes extremely well for the overall dungeon puzzles in the game. Next is the \"Switch Boost\" mechanic during battles, allowing you to select 3 wonderful benefits such as \"No skill consumption\", \"Damage halved & HP recovery\", and \"First initiative + raised accuracy and evasion\" to maximize your strategy. There's also the added benefit of speeding through battles if you want to which is a plus for me.\n\nThere's also the \"Talk System\" where you could either Talk, Attack or Use Item to glean information and lore of the game as well as multiple-choices in the dialogues that implies your MC as being money-loving or having a dry sense of humor. Earning money is not a problem in this game, since you will be selling quite a lot of items and junks (which I did) that you could use to upgrade equipment, buy flowers and create items. It's a neat thing to have, that's for sure.\n\nAs for the music direction, there's quite a number of reused tracks from Experience Inc's older games such as from Stranger of Sword City and the Spirit Hunter series which while I appreciate they're being used effectively, I hate that they didn't have much variety and lacking impact in certain areas of the game. Though admittedly, I have found myself quite fond of the Mad King's theme and Kenji Yazawa's \"Namennayo!\" as well as certain bosses and dungeon themes.\n\nSpeaking of variety, the dungeon and enemies designs quality compared to other Experience Inc's DRPGs are somewhat lackluster. Lackluster is an understatement, they really do pales in comparison to Demon's Gaze and SoSC in terms of innovation and atmospheric sense. Whether they have the lack of production values which you could definitely notice since the game doesn't even offer voice-acting or simple battle cries for your party or being simply plain lazy I don't know.\n\nFor the main cast, I'd say they are amazingly done with great personalities, no cap. Hanba is your self-centered supervisor, grounded in nature but kind nonetheless. President Kaori is your money-loving mysterious female supervisor, a very cool one at that. The Divine Child is...your main driving purpose in the entire section of the game, at least from my perspective. Her presence and representations are very emotional, depressing and tragic. Which ties very well with the Mad King with his grand delusional obsession to his dream that makes her life a total suffering. The Cyborg, my personal favorite, is your reality-check being made form. I love them all though, really digging their art styles and backstories.\n\nThough some of their flavor text including the equipment and dialogues hint of their world spiritually connected to Demon's Gaze, SoSc, SoSW and so forth which is a pleasure to know. But ULoY is a standalone game with its own self-contained story, so you don't need to play older titles to understand the plot.\n\nOverall, while I'm happy I got to enjoy this game and invest in its world, I do think Experience Inc should've ported with good K+M support, charge a well-deserved price tag instead of ripping their consumer off as well as implementing prime QOL updates i.e permanent SAVE OPTIONS so I could save and backtracking my choices or place in game, fixing text that's not running their usual lines going outside the text box and adding simple battle cries to your party (like they used to do in past titles).\n\nI paid, played and enjoyed it immensely. ULoY is a game that you should not skip if you're a fan of DRPG since the story is a true gem in this genre, however niche it is. Paying a premium price (60$) for a game that's not triple AAA quality is my way of supporting the devs, but for those interested to play do not follow my example and wait for a sale or something.\n\nOnto my closing thoughts, I truly think Experience Inc. have great potential, and I wish more quality DRPG games from them while maintaining the same dark narrative they are known for. Overall a solid DRPG experience 8.9/10.",
      "It is a very good game, some people complain about how there are no checkpoints in levels, but fear not, as they can all be beaten in a couple of minutes, and some people complain about how its repetitive because you need to do everything over and over if you keep dying, but if that happens, its clear you are missing something, so by heading to the IEYTD website, you can see tips for every level (secrets are not included, only how to beat the level itself), and if the tips dont help, after 2 tips you can just choose to reveal the answer, so those negative reviews are no reason to not buy this amazing game, this is the game trilogy i recommend every VR player to play ATLEAST once",
      "Okay this is a weird situation. I personally don't like this game all that much, but I do still recommend it nonetheless. That's because despite me not being personally huge on it, I can't deny that it is a very well-crafted game that definitely will give people the experience they want if this is the type of game they're looking for. I, turns out, am not part of the crowd that is targeted for said experience. I just found the whole trial and error stealth RTS style of this game to just not be my cup of tea, but again I can't deny its very well-crafted. I also think the art style and voice acting and story are all very well done as well. So yeah, if you're fond of games of this type, then go for it. I'm sure you won't be disappointed. I, for one, don't think I'm entirely sold on it though.",
      "UGH! The scariest thing about this game is that someone at Steam okayed it for being released. Absolute garbage! Frustrating as heck and not fun in the least bit. If you want a scare, you might accidentally get one through a jumpscare, but don't count on it. Avoid this game at all costs, even if its free, I would be hesitant to recommend downloading this pile of crap. You'll spend the entire time just trying to find things to click on, and when you do, you're rewarded with? some of the worst animations ever to be found in gaming",
      "You know what?\n\nI was so ready to give this game a negative review. \n\nSure, the style, atmosphere and music are jaw-dropping. However, the gameplay (specifically the combat) didn't really click with me until I defeated the first boss after ~50 tries (yes, really that many). The combat was just not what I signed up for. I was expecting 2D Zelda with more fluid combat, but I got was a top down Souls game. Expect to get stunlocked, die in a split-second and generally get this shit kicked out of you.\n\nAfter I came to terms with that, I actually started having fun.",
      "Overall the concept and idea of the game is good and I would recommend it. It is worth the price for the amount of fun time you can have with it.\n\nPositives:\n+ Initially the game gives you some good frights and tension\n+ Variety of characters, ethnics and aesthetics to pick and chose from\n+ Variety of skills and abilities that are mostly unique and some have good synergy\n+ Variety of maps\n+ DLC costs are fair\n+ Skin costs are fair\n+ One of very few companies who communicates with the community\n+ A lot of good license characters available\n+ The game has a tutorial that explains the basics\n+ Various ways to play the game (stealth / agressive)\n\nNegatives:\n- A few bugs here and there\n- Some really annoying perks / addons on killers / survivors like 1 shot long range axes (to name an example), keys and moris (to name a few more)\n- Toxic community - Not everyone is toxic but a large portion of players are but lets be real you get that in every game these days\n- Matchmaking is pretty bad (but DBD is trying to fix this)\n- Sometimes unfair hit detection - Some hits look like you are being smacked way out of range or as a killer you see the grab animation on a survivor and then it just cancels out\n- Steep learning curve / unforgiving gameplay. You either have to learn and improve and adapt and overcome or you will be having a bad time as you climb ranks.",
      "I got this game on a whim because I once played this series like... a decade ago. DW3/4 to be specific. And even though I know full well that this sort of game is basically meant for consoles, I managed to play it just fine once I adjusted the key bindings to stuff that worked well for me. Anyway... game.\n\nIf, like me, you have played these games before, you pretty much know what you are in for. If you have never played any of these games, I'm not quite sure what else is quite like it. Basically it's a fighting game, except it is on large battlefield maps where you murder thousands of random and a handful of named NPC's while following objectives in order to complete each level. If that sounds repetitive... well it can certainly be that. It's the ultimate hack and slash-fest game, and if you get bored with murdering insane numbers of enemies, then chances are this game is not for you.\n\nThe game is based upon the Three Kingdoms era of Ancient China (184-280, roughly), and, despite the absurd outfits and personalities of many of the characters in the game, it is actually fairly consistent with what is known about the period. Or rather, it is consistent with the famous novel 'Romance of the Three Kingdoms' by Luo Guanzhong, which is basically a work of historical fiction that takes real events and bends them a bit according to the whims and views of the author. Which, of course, means that certain characters (particularly Shu-Han characters like Xuande/Liu Bei) are depicted as noble honorable sorts fighting for justice while others (like Mengde/Cao Cao) are depicted as villanous and driven by ambition. I don't want to dig too deep into this because there most likely are entire books written about how Luo Guanzhong messed around with the characters, but the depictions he made are pretty much what are found in this and all previous DW games. The nice thing though is that if you read between the lines (or maybe it's just because I am very familiar with the source material this game is based off of), you can see the flaws in the author's bias in the game as well. Namely that Liu Bei was a massive hypocrite every bit as ambitious as his rivals, and that Cao Cao, while not exactly the nicest guy around, wasn't the hellspawn other characters (like Liu Bei) called him.\n\nAnyway, the game follows the story decently well, though some creative license and trimming down obviously has happened. I still liked how the game depicted things most of the time. Perhaps my favorite was Lu Bu's campaign which, while maintaining the massive \"OMG ITS LU BU\" hype that all DW games have had, reveals exactly why the real Lu Bu got himself executed in chapter 19 of a 120 chapter book: that he was dumb as a brick, betrayed people constantly, and never listened to anyone's advice. While the old DW games I played did have storylines for him, they didn't take the historical route that this game's (default) story path takes. The same goes for the numerous character deaths shown, though many of these are made more dramatic than they actually were.\n\nAlso, while the playable character cast has increased to the point of total insanity (including some that may not have even existed or actually fought on battlefields), I did like that, in the time between DW4 and this, they added a number of characters that rounded out the cast further by including some of the other lesser-known strategists (Chen Gong, Lu Su) and characters who rose to prominence in the later parts of the story (Deng Ai, the sons of Guan Yu/Zhang Fei, as well as the entire Jin faction who were the ultimate winners of this whole mess). I thought that was a nice treat since these sorts had been badly neglected in past games, where everything seemed to stop at the year 234 (when Kongming/Zhuge Liang died), which was roughly the chronological halfway point of the entire story.\n\nOk, I better stop and just finish this up.\n\nIn short, It's a DW game. That means that on the one hand, the combat gets repetitive, many of the characters are very hard to take seriously, and many of the story events are overdramatized to the point of being kind of ridiculous. On the other hand, there is a MASSIVE amount of content (and all those DLC's for this \"Complete Edition\" are purely cosmetic), big battles are kind of fun, and one can even argue that the storyline's inherent cheesiness may actually be more a positive than a negative.\n\nIf you have never played one of these games before, this is the one i'd look at because (to my knowledge) it's the newest one and has an insane amount of content even compared to its predecessors. If you have played these and liked them before... why not?

      "Let's get this out of the way: If you're into Chris Avellone/Obsidian/Black Isle kind of games and know what that even means, you know what you're getting. Another clunky game with writing so good you'll forgive any of its flaws. It's another one of those games: a Baldur's Gate, NWN2, Kotor 2, Fallout: New Vegas, Alpha Protocol kinda game.\n\nIf that paragraph didn't make any sense, the rest of this review is for you. Planescape: Torment tends to be less hack-and-slash than it looks, playing according to a system roughly based on second edition Dungeons & Dragons. But in a big departure from both, you can solve a huge amount of your problems with minimal combat and the real meat of the game comes in your decision making, mystery solving, and dealing with people around you. True to the Planescape setting, Torment is a game about the power of belief and the battlefield of ideas.\n\nI don't want to oversell that because you *will* be attacked by random thugs, some combats are downright mandatory, and there is a very real difficulty spike about three quarters through the game. But the allies you keep and the knowledge you gain can help you bypass some encounters or at least trivalize them under mountains of xp gained from unraveling cosmic questions. \n\nIt's a grim, often macabre journey back and forth across the boundaries of life and death where even the happiest endings are pretty heavy, but it's also a brilliantly written, thought-provoking experience that's well worth the time and money. Just make sure to go deep on wisdom, okay, berk? Don't need some dusty penning you in the deadbook because you couldn't see the dark of things, cutter.",
      "Ahh, CrossCode.\nLet's start this review with what this game does right.\n\nPros:\nEverything. There review is complete. But on a serious note I'll elaborate.\n\nThis game starts out very generically. You got an amnesia stricken heroine. You got fairly archetypal characters. The story is the typical trying to figure out your past. But it's not. I lied about all that, that only covers the first 10-15 hours then you see drastic changes in the pace and tone. The story turns out to be well done, not the best, but enjoyable. 8/10 for story and characters.\n\nLet's talk about gameplay. It's perfect, seriously. The pacing of combat is fairly quick. There's a decent variety of enemy types which nearly all of them have some sort of unique trait. Your skill set leaves you with a lot of variety and different tools to take on different situations. I have yet to get bored of it, despite the fact combat isn't inherently profitable for most of the game. Puzzles. You have timing puzzles, logic puzzles, memory puzzles, enemy based puzzles. It's all there. It's all enjoyable. They're quite varied, no two puzzles feel the same. This game has over 200 'maps'. And just about every 'map' has a puzzle or two (optional or not). Ez 10/10.\n\nArt design. I'm a sucker for 16 and 32 bit graphics. The level designer, this guy made the game. He created some beautiful and interconnected maps with nearly everything having purpose. In all honesty, I have never seen design quality this high, it even beats out SquareSoft games (you know before they became that crappy company that is SE). 10/10 again.\n\nCharacter design. It works. Not the best. Not bad. The characters look the way they should. Lukas' nose drives me crazy, it's huge. But Holiday Man is solid. 7/10.\n\nMusic. Some of it's great. Some of it annoyed ME (but I'm picky). They stayed true to what they were trying to make. But it's obvious their composer was no Yasunori Mitsuda. But still, what I enjoyed, I really enjoyed. 8/10.\n\nDid I enjoy it? Every single minute of it. Even when I was confused. \"I WILL figure this puzzle out.\" 35/40, based off my personal taste, but CrossCode is as damn near perfect as you can get.",
      "Playing this game instantly brought back memories of me playing TMNT, Battletoads, Double Dragon, and Streets of Rage, with my little brother on the NES and Sega Genesis in the early 90s. Luckily this game doesn’t feature TMNT’s ridiculous water level or Battletoads' sadistic peed bike level. The graphics are perfect, the controls are great, the soundtrack is awesome (especially the Wu-Tang stage, and the Shredder stage), and the levels and overworld map are fun to navigate. I’ve played through the story mode with all 7 characters and have played through the arcade mode multiple times solo and many times in multiplayer and I’ve enjoyed every bit of it. This game is so much fun.\n\nThere are a few things I wish existed though. I wish there were more playable characters. I wish that you did not lose your 7 character’s progress in story mode when you start a new game. I wish you could see the difficulty level of the online arcade game you are joining. I wish there were cumulative stats you could see for arcade and story mode that showed the number of times you completed a stage, how many enemies you knocked out, objects you’ve destroyed, stage times, combo streaks, times taunted, etc. I wish you could create your own turtle and assigned moves, specials, jumps, taunts, and colors.",
      "good sales pitch for a game. i guess that's the point of being a kickstarter-based video game. everything related to specifically your character and the character action related feels fantastic and looks great and i feel like it scratches an itch no other game really does, and the environments and your animations look great. and yet you're seeing this on a negative review.\n\n-the progression involved with exploring unreality until you stumble onto where you think you should go is miserable. it looks like a mega man x4 level had a bad trip, headache inducing and aimless. the process of finding a lot of secrets is either the trite \"you have a movement powerup, backtrack here and move up there\" sorta deal, or invisible wall shit that i've never been a fan of without decent tells (which admittedly the game sometimes does!)\n\n-combat almost entirely takes place in closed off arenas (not necessarily a bad thing, this game draws heavy inspiration from DMC which does similar) and with the same cast of like 10~ enemies. poise is a chore, even after trivializing the process with the time bomb and the grounded down charge attack, and particular enemies like the guy with the red sword and the caped man are incredibly annoying. there are 2 different instances of an enemy either doing a short version or annoyingly long version of an attack with 0 tell. A lot of the combat is trivial on hard, don't know about\n\n-bosses are a mixed bag. some of them you can loop poise breaks. some of them 2 or 3 tap you. the last one does the latter, makes you slog through a nintendo-ass hands and face boss before you are put up against bootleg senator armstrong with an unskippable cutscene and no checkpoint after the boring phase 1. huge waste of time.\n\n-too many levels just feel empty and lifeless. just a pleasant looking floral jog from arena to arena, felt like nothing and left no impression. \n\n-the movement feels like it has the potential to be insane. there's a million options that all can really push how much distance you can get, and there's a learning curve with how you sequence them all, and there's an entirely separate learning curve with pulse fly though that mechanic feels mostly untapped. \n\n-for a game with a speedrun timer and that kind of carpal tunnel inducing movement, it's really weird that there's not a \"reset to checkpoint\" button or any way to fast travel back to the airship. feels INCREDIBLY bad when you're lost and checking every nook and cranny for where to go next, or when you've ran yourself out of pulse meter when trying to pulse fly in locations that aren't littered with the blue pulse bulbs. special shoutouts to the pyramid, you can screw up especially when trying to do it early and the run is completely dead, but you have to just sit there and wait while you scroll through twitter or whatever. \n\n-music and voice acting quality was all over the place. i'm not more than a hobbyist but a lot of the voices sound like they were recorded on a variety of audio hardware, run through audacity w/ noise reduction and normalization, and tossed in. it's an indie game so please don't take this as the worst critique in the world, i'm sure the VAs were all fellow hobbyists/amateurs and there's literally nothing wrong with that, but a good handful of the yells, insults, and grunts were doing NOTHING for me. some of the music just sounds like penis music, i can't think of a better term. there were definitely a few great tunes on the atmospheric end of things but overall some of them, in particular 2 or 3 boss themes, just kinda sucked. also the segues between combat and atmospheric music was not executed well at all for several areas.\n\n-the fog level in particular had a lot of stuttering especially during combat. not looking forward to the braindead \"works fine on my machine\" type of people, but i'm on a ryzen 9 3900x, a 5900XT sapphire pulse, and 32 GB of 3600mhz ram. I'm pretty sure a machine with a tenth of the power should be able to run a gamemaker studio 2 game, it's on the switch and that thing's basically a leapfrog.\n\ni really wanted to like this game but like i said at the start, it feels like a sales pitch (albiet a great one) with everything not related to the selling point feeling tacked on. I hope this dev learns more about level design in particular and keeps making more games, because this game really does feel like it's designed to appeal to me w/ the mix of genres and the list of inspirations this game seems to wear on its sleeve.\n\ntldr the angled dash memory doesn't let you wavedash, and ur left in a crappy sticky sliding animation when you try. 1/10 can't believe i played this game\n",
      "Probaly the best game ive ever told people to hold back on\n\nIts fun, its rude, it's the best Southpark Game ever made, but its only a 10 to 14 hour game. Its a satisfying 10 hours mind you, i dont think i have played a game in recent memory good enough to hold me the way this game has, the atmosphere and envoriment just puts you right in a long southpark episode, and youll love every minute of it.\n\nSadly, there are not enough minutes of it for $59.99, and thats why i sadly don't recomend this excelent game.\n\nAnd to clarify, its 10 hours if you just take your time enjoying the story, its plausible to 100% this game in under 20 hours, and thats if you are in no hurry, with no game guide.",
      "First of all, I really like the Game, it's Gameplay is wonderful and i really enjoy the parkour to combat mix in it. Although i noticed a lot of bugs especially in COOP i still enjoy logging on the game.\n\nThe Story is good but doesn't need a upgrade in my opinion. I like that certain map changes and Story decisions are dependant on some side quests and on each other.\n\nNow to the sad part:\n\nTencent recently bought Techland which was controversial at first, but then DL points were added which made a lot of people mad at Tencent and partially Techland, understandably.\nThey Including me don't want the game to die out because a greedy company wants to make some quick buck.\n\nAlthough i have to say myself, other Tencent bought games still are quite enjoyable.\n\nI just hope that Techland does the right thing in future and makes the current state of DL points less predatory and more Cosmetic based pure.\n\nIn it current state we still have no knifes without Bundles, but that was before Tencent so the blame for that goes to Techland, but i am excited for future updates and playing Dying light 2, even without buying DL points :)\n\nI'll give this game a solid 7/10 for the bugs, microtransactions but also because it has good gameplay and community reach\n\n(I have edited my original negative review about the pure rant about DL points because i also wanted to consider current gameplay and more)",

      "if you love trpgs but are getting tired of all the great indie devs emulating ogre tactics and ff tactics while wondering where the fire emblem/langrisser love is at then this is your game. It is hands down THE best non-fire emblem game that falls under the latter category of styles and punches so far above its weight class that at one point while playing i idly wondered if they poached an intelligent systems game designer or something (they didnt).",
      "I hated this game.\n\nHowever, it is undeniably brilliant. To try and explain how it is brilliant would cheapen the experience. I would put this game in the same category as The Stanley Parable, The Beginner's Guide, Dear Esther, and everything Freebird Games ever created. These are games that should be experienced by everyone.\n\nI was gifted this by my wonderful husband. I'm sure he meant well because he knows I like horror games. I'm going to choose to believe that anyway. What followed was five hours of paranoia, frustration, and more of a feeling that the game was playing me.\n\nThanks honey.",
      "Blows every single PFS game of the last decade out of the water, even those shitty D**M games that people who never played FPS games before seems to worship in order to look cool. Smooth and fast gameplay with a lot of variety. Great visuals even on medium/high settings. Story and writing is shit but pretty much on the same level as rest of the Borderlands series with the exception of the Telltale one. Writing has always been the worst part of the series, dont be delusional retards.",
      "Tentative review of game in progress, but so far it is amazing and I had to leave a review in support of it.  As far as the game itself goes, I'm giving it a 9/10.  As far as the port goes, the lack of keyboard input prompts seems frustrating when they already have the ability to change between xbox and ps4 buttons, but I use a controller and expect most will for this, but it's worth mentioning in the sake of fairness and accuracy.  There is a certain graphics setting called \"effects\" with high and low.  High is causing major fps drops under certain conditions even on a pc with an rtx 3080 and a 5800x cpu.  Devs have acknowledged it and are working on improving it.  Other than these issues though, no problems at all.  Online play has been smooth and i haven't experienced any disconnects.  The game itself has only crashed once in 93 hours, but that was also during excessive alt tabbing while the game was in true fullscreen mode, and it crashed on an alt-tab itself, so I'm not really blaming the game on that one given it was the only time.  Again, overall the game is playing great and I have no problems with it on a functional level as well as an entertainment level, I just want to be as fair and accurate as I can, and these were really the only problems I could find with it.",

This is BY FAR the best visual novel i have played. the old school forums and cameras feel very detailed as whenever anything happens in a video chat, no matter how small, the characters react to it. the story was very enthralling and every time i slipped up and made a wrong move, my heart would feel as though it was gonna beat out of my chest. talking to violet felt very real and made the ending that i got so much more satisfying. the only bad things i can even say about this absolute masterpiece is just the fact that most of the really impact full options were locked because \"Emmett isn't cocky enough\" or  \"Emmett isn't compassionate enough\" which felt very vague and confining.\n\noverall the game is absolutely amazing and i wish the devs would come out with a game similar to this because of how good it was.\n9/10",

      "1 week before release i played the demo, it was a 20 minutes demo that was very underwhelming, but i still thought i should give the game a chance to see if it gets better later on.\n\nIt doesn't.\n\nSo the first thing i read about this game in the embed of the steam link was \"a fresh take on the jrpg genre\", and its probably the biggest problem of the game. It is really the most basic, mediocre turn base combat you can find.\n\nTurn base combat, rock paper scissor elemental types plus physical, materia base skills with few spots (i had only 4 skills activated),  no gear, no party. Does that sound like a fresh take to you?\n\nSo if the gameplay is so barebones it means is at least hard right? Well no, it is basic and easy. The start is easy, in the mid part they blow up the HP of enemies so you understand you should buy new skills, and once you do it the game is easy again. Mob enemies are generally harder than bosses because you are 1vs3 most of the time, while in bosses you can just debuff it and make it slow, while you have 2 turns to spam healings and hitting. There also some questionable decisions on the minor mechanics of the combat system but i don't think they matter (see some paragraphs below)\n\nNow here is what is really the \"fresh take\": the setting being cyberpunk. Everything is written with tech terminology. The mana is called data, block and delay turn is called cache, melee combat is called hack? some of the terms don't even make sense of what they actually do. Also because we obviously live in a technological society we have people called \"V-sync\" or \"Nullpointer\", expresions like \"Digits!\" or \"Oh my grind!\", you know, normal behaviour if you ask me.\n\nThe story is pretty standard for a futuristic setting, it wasn't bad but also it wasn't good, pretty normal.\n\nThe artstyle is cool, the music is generally cool, which i think its why most people would don't mind the boring gameplay and will just play for the story, which is also present in the game itself because you have options to either skip every random encounter (yeah we have those here) or to insta win every battle when you want it.\n\nSo if you want to try this game because of the \"fresh take in the jrpg genre\" you will be disappointed, if you have played jrpgs before there is nothing new in this game, you have already played it before.",

This is a very interesting game for those who are not very focused on real world aviation.  The airports are not accurately represented and the aircraft do not respond realistically, unless you are not interested in detail.   I think that it is an interesting product for casual entertainment, but serious flight enthusiasts will likely be disappointed.  I expect that with time users will create mods (aircraft and airports) to repair the inaccuracies, and fix the lack of detail, but I doubt that the weird graphics will ever be fixed.",
      "As a former astronaut, I find this game incredibly inaccurate and offensive to the profession. This game is massively simplified to a point in which rocket science may be likened to Legos. This game is perfect for children who like to boast in the YouTube comments section about how they're smarter than everyone else because they get good grades in middle school and build elaborate structures in minecraft. If you're a 12 year old who thinks you're the shit, this game is perfect for you; for anyone who is actually smart like myself, go to Harvard and use your time usefully learning astrophysics.",
      "2023...\n\n2 years...\n\n2 Languages...\n\nEDIT:\n\nTLDR: Game is too simple, better get Factorio or Riftbreaker\n\n\nPlayed again after ~1 year, nothing has changed in the basic QoL or coding system.\n\n\n- It still uses an older builder system than Factorio did 10 years ago: you actually have to craft the base material manually every time before you can build the building, instead of it being done automatically by a simple click on the building in the build menu.\n\n- If you have crafting orders set, new items added to your inventory will not be read by the current crafting orders and keeps on produce stuff your already own...\n\n- Items don't have their own output for transport lines, but instead require this stupid additional output... (I think the developer couldn't create a better output than this simple one)\n\n\n20 minutes and that's enough for me for now, I'm not putting in any more effort for EA project",
      "I really, really wanted to like this game.\n\nI preface this review by saying that Guacamelee 1 is in my top 10 games of all time. I've been a gamer for 33 years. Sotn, Chrono Trigger, and FFVII are my go-tos. G-Melee 1 is a charming and original romp through a metroidvania style genre.\n\nGuacamelee 2 fails so ridiculously hard, it actually makes me sad when I think about it. The puzzles are uninspired, the abilities don't really feel enjoyable, and the platforming elements are just unforgivingly tight for the sake of it. I had all the \"schools\" maxed out before the end, it didnt make me feel any more powerful. I didn't have that super saiyan mode like in GM 1.\n\nThe final bossfight is a 3/10 compared to the first game where it is at BARE MINIMUM 9/10.\n\nI wish I could rank this game higher because I adore the original. However, this became a slog several hours before I could finish it. I would not recommend this to anyone, ever. It's light on the humor and story, it requires you to be invested in the previous game. The mechanics aren't new and they threw in some unnecessary tight, like razor thin, platforming into the game.",

      "Looks like a game for children, but underneath the friendliness there is a great challenge! Move on the rhythm of good songs on a note bar! \n\n[h2]Swim! Swim little tredpole!

Through various rivers and waters you journey, and eventually save your pond from a disaster that will occur. \nEverything in the river translates to an instrument tone and respects the height on the note bar. The primary goal is to reach the finish. The melody is depicted as little mines which hurt your health if you swim across one. Along the way you can collect points by collecting bubbles (with a bonus if you collect them all), little bubbles, health packs, and you can slap your tail on bamboo or cymbals that launch you in the air!

      "Since when I played Plants vs Zombies, years ago, I looked for its great soundtrack composer Laura Shigihara, finding her Twitter profile. She was talking about a game she was developing, named Rakuen or something like this, and the whole project sounded awesome. I promised to myself that I would buy it the day it was released.  \n\nTo be exact, I only got motivated to register a Steam account specifically in order to buy Rakuen, even if other games were bought before and after it.  Also, even if I found a blog and YouTube videos where Laura talked about Rakuen's development, I didn't read or watch any of it, to avoid creating wrong or misguided expectations. \n\nAnd it was worth the wait. This is an awesome piece of art.\n\nAs a story, Rakuen has a well developed and thoughtful plot, deep and diverse characters, balanced and pleasant pace. \n\nVisually, Rakuen has colorful and elegant graphics, with easily recognizable sprites and detailed scenarios.\n\nThe gameplay is fluid, with simple but entertaining puzzles, not too hard, not too easy, and with rock solid programming.\n\nFinally, Rakuen's music is delightful, perfectly syncronized with the feelings inspired by the plot.\n\nRakuen provoke chuckles, tears and smiles. It brings back a warmth sometimes we forget that exist. It became one of my favorite games ever, and I doubt its place will ever be taken by another title.\n\nThank you Laura, thank you very much for Rakuen.",

But I'm very glad they did, because it is absolutely incredible.\n\nIt is a love letter to history, to writing, to stories, to culture. A gorgeously illustrated and scored, geekly researched slice of humanity, where the fate of the Universe is not at stake, where there are no cosmic heroes to save the day.

      "i don't think i liked it :(\n\na richly illustrated nightmare fairy tale which warns of paranoid infighting and reaching for an unattainable ideal, broken apart by tedious and artificially difficult survival horror segments. i meet each hazard as intended and am often punished with unforgiving damage or by being taken to an instant game over, and while i fully accept that this very well might just be a skill issue on my part, it remains a significant hurdle that's barring me from engaging properly with the unfolding narrative.\n\ni'm not unfamiliar with the death-laden rpgmaker horror-esque titles which preceded LGTS and those it draws its inspirations from, its how it contextualises such flaws that becomes an issue. there are no \"skip seen dialogue\" options, with the fast forward made available to us after Elise's delayed inputs just slow enough to be annoying. on that note, bosses with instant death attacks have unskippable cutscenes prior making repeat attempts patronising. two core survival systems are made redundant within one of the in-game days. perhaps most tragically, the distinct visual style which once pleased the eye beings to blend into monotony and goes unappreciated after some hours.\n\nand like i'm sad about it! i wanted to like it! i really enjoyed how the story progressed and how my bond with my favourite lady bloomed and i liked the endings i've managed to get, but all these hiccups had me nearly just uninstalling early. it's a beautiful poetic horror title, but so many little things simply ended up overwhelming me."

      "Not For Broadcast is in the simplest of terms, a multi-tasking simulator.\n\nYou sit in a news control room and you have to keep track of multiple things: censoring curse words, switching between cameras, playing ads at the right time, ensuring your broadcast frequency isn't disrupted, as well as keeping an eye out for a bunch of other strange things that appear later in the game.\n\nThis isn't the easiest of games as it requires a good deal of attentiveness. The description isn't joking when they call this \"high-pressure\". You have to rely heavily on both audio and visual cues to make sure your broadcast doesn't get screwed up. As this is the news (and live), there is no rewind or undo button. If you mess up and want to get a good performance grade, you'll need to redo the entire news segment. \nIf you're a perfectionist like me, a 10 min segment can end up turning into an hour of trying to perfect that news segment. As such, I do hope an option to quick save, or at the very least, save and quit, can later be put into the game. It felt rather taxing having to keep an eye on so many things for so long. But as with any game, excellence isn't an art, it's a habit. You'll find yourself turning into a multitasking expert eventually.\n\nThankfully, the actors in the game do a great job of making the experience an entertaining one. There is a good amount of humour written into each broadcast, although I must admit I wasn't quite able to pay attention to all the dialogue, as I was too busy trying to switch to the right cameras whilst ensuring my electricity didn't get cut out. Luckily, the game does have an archive which allows you to playback the broadcasts. Without that, I'd probably be missing out on 70% of what was going on.\n\nThere is also a text narrative, choices matter portion in between news segments. As of now, it feels a little out of place and incomplete, but then again, this is an Early Access review.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that at the time of writing this review, there isn't really any \"propaganda\" aspect to the game yet.\n\nPerformance-wise, the game runs pretty smoothly. I did encounter occasional crashes if I looked left or right and back and forth too quickly, but other than that, the game is pretty much bug-free. Also, this game has my RTX 2070 Super running at rather high temps for some reason. Rather surprising for a game that doesn't appear to have particularly high-end graphics.\n\nAnyway, I'll be looking forward to see what comes next for this game. Definitely worth the buy despite being Early Access.",

      "From afar, the life of royalty can seem very glamorous: the lavish lifestyle, the royal finery, fancy food and drink. However, the life of a prince can be very difficult and traumatic, when your very birth was a disappointment to the king. \n\nUGLY is the fragmented story of a prince who was considered by his father, the king, to be much too ugly to show his face. Forced to wear a mask and bear his father’s unfair demands, we wake up amongst the ruins of what must have been a rather fantastic palace. \n\nThe main mechanic in UGLY is the magical mirror that the prince receives at the beginning. This mirror allows him to create a reflection of himself within the space that you can switch between. You can place the mirror either vertically or horizontally, allowing you to enter rooms that may be blocked by impassable walls, or reaching platforms high up in hard to reach areas.\n\nThere are several different areas, each locked by a door with a particular coloured gemstone. To progress you must find the special key for each door, and inside clear out all of the rooms by, again, finding keys and unlocking every door. Once you’ve cleared an area, and collected the next coloured-gemstone-key, you will be confronted with that area’s boss. \n\nThe boss battles are extremely fun, and are like a much more intensified puzzle than a “fight”. Some of the puzzle rooms are real mind bogglers, and it will take all of your ingenuity to flip the switch in your brain to maximize the mechanics and figure out all of the puzzles. Each room is different and challenging, and the background design is chalk full of visual storytelling. \n\nFrom drawings and pictures on walls, to very interesting machines, to a whole theatre room where you can tell the little prince used to put on puppet shows for his loving mother and all of his stuffed animals.  The story is a treatise to what can happen to a child who’s tenderness and creativity is stifled by the unseemly and unreasonable demands of a narcissistic parent. The wonderful part is that the story is left up to the player to figure out. \n\nThere are secrets to uncover: hidden films and the prince’s memories to unlock. Every subsequent area adds a new mechanic to work with, or around, to the puzzling (such as pink pant that doesn’t allow you to switch to your reflection, or broken glass that your reflection can actually touch). \n\nThe game is very reminiscent of Braid, and considering how mind-blowing and phenomenal that game was when it was originally released in 2008, it’s fantastic to see another game following in those creative footsteps and create such a stellar experience for gamers everywhere. \n\nI would recommend this game to anyone who likes puzzle games, a challenge, or a heart wrenching story.",

      "[b][u] TL;DR[/u] [/b] Finally finish the fight on PC after 13 years.\n[b][u] Long version: [/u] [/b]\n[h1] Halo Combat Evolved Anniversary: [/h1] The very first halo with remastered visuals but the same gameplay. 20 years old now, the level design can sometimes become repetitive. Especially on the library mission. The remastered visuals look nice but I find that it deviates way too much from the original vision of Bungie. You can switch between the old and new graphics with a press of a button. \nOverall a smooth [b][i] Wort out of 10 with a touch of \"this cave is not a natural formation\".[/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Halo 2 Anniversary: [/h1] The second game in the series and the last one for the PC until 15 years later with the release of MCC. The game has remastered visuals as well as fully CGI remastered cutscenes. The remastered visuals are really well done and true to the original artwork and the CGI cutscenes are top notch with quality that can easily surpass the CGI level of some movies. Same gameplay from 15 years ago but it surprisingly holds up pretty well. I did experience some stuttering on this game ever so often but that could just be my system. Again you can switch between the classic and remastered graphics with the press of a button. Even during cutscenes. Just don't shake the light bulb. \nIn summary, I'd give this game a [b][i] Wort Wort Wort out of 10 with a slight slight tinge of heresy. [/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Halo 3: [/h1] The magnum opus of Bungie and the big final conclusion to the halo trilogy. The port to PC was a decent port (well it better be after 13 years!) with little to no technical issues. I faced a desync issue during co-op play on a specific mission until I locked my framerate to 60 fps. I tried to replicate the issue again later on but I had no luck reproducing it. If only were it so easy.\nThe gameplay is similar but sometimes bigger in scale than halo 2 and holds up well. The visuals have not been remastered for halo 3 but they still look good for what they are. \nI give this game a [b][i] Wort in the Wort out of 10. Wake me when you need me. [/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Halo 3 ODST: [/h1] Halo ODST takes place during the events of Halo 2 and follows a squad of Orbital Drop Shock Troppers that get deployed to New Mombasa. It uses the same engine as Halo 3 and so the fidelity isnt much a leap from Halo 3 but the art style is drastically different and takes on a noir style with washed out colors. Kinda reminds me a little bit of Deus ex Human Revolution tbh. Even more so because of its semi open world/hub design.\nThe PC port is as good as Halo 3 if not better and I didn't face any issues. \nThis is a solid [b][i] how many engineers did you murder before dare asked out of 10. [/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Halo Reach: [/h1] Halo Reach would be the final halo game that would be developed by Bungie. Ironically, this game was the first to release for the MCC on PC and is also chronologically the first in the timeline of the main series. Quite frankly the port was not very good. It had audio issues, visual downgrades and many more problems. However in time, 343 has corrected almost all of these issues and now it is a great port to PC. Reach takes place before the events of Halo Combat Evolved and is a prequel to the entire series. It puts you into the shoes of Noble Six, a member of Noble Team that are tasked to... well I wont spoil everything here. Just know that you're stepping into some shoes the rest of the squad would rather leave unfilled. \nThe artstyle is a grittier and more grim depiction of the halo universe and fits well within the narrative of the game. \nThis game gets a [b][i] pair of gúta out of 10 from me. [/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Halo 4: [/h1] After Bungie stepped down as developers of the halo franchise, the mantle was given to 343 industies to carry on the legacy of Halo. The very first game by 343i came in the form of Halo 4 and would be a direct sequel to the conclusion of the Halo trilogy in Halo 3. \nThe change in team came with it, the change in art style, level design and gameplay loop. I will just call this change \"different\". \nThe port to PC is pretty decent aside from some stuttering I faced during coop play. \nOverall this game is a [b][i] 343 out of 10 unless you get on the bad side of Cortana. [/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Multiplayer, Firefight and Spartan Ops: [/h1]\nEach game has its own multiplayer except for Halo 3 ODST. The multiplayer itself is fun and they have enabled cross-play between platforms making finding matches easier.\nThere are so many multiplayer game modes within each game and covering them all is beyond the scope of this short review. :) \nThere are your traditional TDM, Big Team Battle, Capture the flag and such; but there are also interesting and odd game types which are a good change of pace.\nAs for the multiplayer progression, there is a battlepass system in place where you can unlock various cosmetics such as armor parts, gun skins and vehicle skins for each game.\nThe game is updated with seasons that add more features and cosmetics.\nAlthough the idea of a battlepass may put some of us off, the system is completely free and you dont miss out on previous seasons as they are all accessible indefinitely.\nYou can even pick and choose which seasons to progress in.\nIf you want some co-op within multiplayer, then Halo Reach and Halo 3 ODST have a mode called firefight where you have to fend off wave after wave of enemies with changing modifiers or mutations. \nAn alternative to firefight is Spartan Ops, a game mode exclusive to Halo 4. It is a cooperative campaign(you can solo) where you get to use your customised spartan from multiplayer. Keep in mind that although there is a set narrative here, the quality of production in spartan ops is nowhere near the level as that of the main Halo 4 campaign.\n\nOverall the multiplayer, firefight and spartan ops are solid additions to the already superb collection of 6 campaigns. The only thing missing right now is a custom server browser which I believe is in the works. \nEDIT: They have added in a custom server browser for Halo Reach, Halo: Combat Evolved, Halo 2 and Halo 3! :D\n\n[h1] Forge and Theatre: [/h1] \nForge is where you can fool around with various kinds of halo props and items within maps and make your own creations that you can share with others. It has basically endless content.\nJust a cherry on top over all the other content that you are getting with the collection. Forge is available for Halo 2 anniversary, Halo 3, Halo Reach and Halo 4.\nTheatre mode is exactly what it sounds like. Record clips from the game and play them back later with a free form camera. Perfect for content creation. \n\n[h1] Modding: [/h1]\nAs if there wasn't already so much content in the vanilla game, Halo MCC allows you run the game in anti cheat free mode, where you can install and play community created mods.\nGoes without saying that this will only age like fine wine.\n\n[h1] Well that's it folks: [/h1]\nYou mad lads that made it up to here; thank you for reading the ramblings of a mad man. \nDustin Echoes will forever watch over you.",
      "Mysterious, claustrophobic, and psychedelic --- this is undoubtedly the most unorthodox game in The Legend of Heroes series. This game is basically what you get when you put The Legend of Heroes, Shin Megami Tensei and a certain Silent Hill title [i](which I won't specify for a good reason)[/i] into a blender machine. Nonetheless, it is still very much an LoH game at its core, though its semi-fandisc nature holds it back from being as coherent of an overall package as its two predecessors.\n\nI cannot stress this enough: [b][u]If you were a big fan of the previous two games, you will not necessarily like this game; on the other hand, if you didn't hold them in high regard, this game is still worth trying out due to its stark contrast in tone and structure from its predecessors.[/u][/b] There is a good reason this game is named [u][b]\"the 3rd\"[/b][/u] instead of \"Third Chapter\", because it is definitely not a direct continuation of SC (i.e. Trails in the Sky Second Chapter).\n\nIf you want more of the upbeat, kingdom-trotting adventure of the previous two games, you're not going to find it here.\n\nIf you want towns full of vibrant NPCs, you're not going to find it here (at least not in the main story).\n\nIf you want a protagonist who wears their heart on their sleeves and acts like your typical spunky JRPG hero, you're not going to find it here.\n\nThis game is first and foremost [u][b]a gameplay-heavy dungeon crawler[/b][/u], one that is light on (main) story but carries some very heavy themes. The most interesting aspect of the game to me is that [i][b]the protagonist Kevin Graham is not a hero[/b][/i] (which is ironic considering the name of this series). This game is his harrowing personal journey, one in which he doesn't set out to save the world, his homeland, or anyone for that matter.\n\nThere are initially only two playable characters, but more and more join your party at a steady pace throughout the game [b](16 in total)[/b]. Be sure to talk to these characters when you swap them out of your party; they are ironically the only source of \"NPC dialogue\" for the majority of the game, and their dialogue updates after every plot point like in most other Falcom games. You know Falcom has done their NPCs justice in FC&SC when their complete absence here creates an uneasy sense of isolation.\n\nThere are visual-novel-like sidequests (called Memory Doors) which serve to further flesh out the characters and setting of this series, giving all the playable (and some non-playable) characters their own spotlight to shine in. To this day the cast of Trails in the Sky still remains my favorite cast of any RPG, and I have to give a good chunk of the credit to this game's characterization of them.\n\nThese sidequests take up a sizeable chunk of the game, which one might argue distract from the dungeon-crawling main game. Fortunately, they don't expire like in FC&SC and can be accessed at any point in the game before the final dungeon (with convenient fast-travel to boot), effectively enabling the player to pace the game themselves. \n\nWord of warning though, some of these sidequests take on a much darker tone than one would expect: there's a very good reason why the console versions of this game was censored [i](don't worry, the Steam version isn't)[/i]. Please be mentally prepared for the final sidequest you come across in the game, i.e. [spoiler]Star Door 15[/spoiler].\n\nThere is also plenty of foreshadowing for the rest of the series littered throughout the game, some obvious and some very subtle [i](I'm looking at you Mr. N)[/i]. Needless to say, this game gives you lots to think about if you are into the lore of this series, especially if you have played some of the later Trails games.\n\nOh, and did I mention that the soundtrack is widely regarded as the best in the trilogy?\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nTo end on a more critical note, I'd like to elucidate the \"semi-fandisc\" nature of this game:\n\nThere is severe disconnect between the main story and side content, with the latter adding nothing to the former for the most part; the sidequests are more of an anthology of supplementary material for the entire Trails series and are only tenuously tied to the main campaign, which by itself is sparse in story.\n\nThere is also an egregious amount of asset recycling from the previous two games. Although this is mostly justified within the context of the story, it's still vexing and makes the devs look lazy. They had the opportunity to add a lot of interesting new locales, especially those pertaining to Kevin and the church, but they chose not to for the majority of the game. Get ready to traverse through lots of familiar looking areas and dungeons...\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nP.S. Advice for 1st playthrough: If you are here mostly to enjoy the story, don't play on Hard; if you value your sanity as a gamer, don't play on Nightmare. Seriously, don't.\n\nP.S.2 When you first open up the game, don't skip the \"Falcom\" logo animation; just sit back and watch. There's a bit more after that.\n\nP.S.3 If you're really curious as to which Silent Hill title I was comparing this game to, potential spoilers if you are familiar with the SH franchise: [spoiler]Silent Hill 2[/spoiler]. Just how deep the similarities run between these two games, I'll let you find out for yourself.\n\nP.S.4 A bit more on the censorship of this game: Falcom cut out large chunks of the aforementioned final sidequest when porting the 3rd from PC to the Sony consoles (PSP, PS3, and PSVita). They did this in order to keep the age rating consistent across the Sky trilogy; the PC version of the 3rd would undoubtedly have been rated \"M\" had it gone through ESRB.

      "Playing this game instantly brought back memories of me playing TMNT, Battletoads, Double Dragon, and Streets of Rage, with my little brother on the NES and Sega Genesis in the early 90s. Luckily this game doesn’t feature TMNT’s ridiculous water level or Battletoads' sadistic peed bike level. The graphics are perfect, the controls are great, the soundtrack is awesome (especially the Wu-Tang stage, and the Shredder stage), and the levels and overworld map are fun to navigate. I’ve played through the story mode with all 7 characters and have played through the arcade mode multiple times solo and many times in multiplayer and I’ve enjoyed every bit of it. This game is so much fun.\n\nThere are a few things I wish existed though. I wish there were more playable characters. I wish that you did not lose your 7 character’s progress in story mode when you start a new game. I wish you could see the difficulty level of the online arcade game you are joining. I wish there were cumulative stats you could see for arcade and story mode that showed the number of times you completed a stage, how many enemies you knocked out, objects you’ve destroyed, stage times, combo streaks, times taunted, etc. I wish you could create your own turtle and assigned moves, specials, jumps, taunts, and colors.",

      "Deathloop is definitely not your average video game.\n\nYou'll either love it or hate it.\n\nThe first few hours are the weakest. You, as a new player, don't know what to do, what's important and you never keep what you find. Only after completing several mission objectives you get the ability to collect residuum and actually infuse your found items for later use in later loops or after you die. That's why it's always better to just go straight to the objectives and not explore the map at all, otherwise it's just gonna be a big time waste.\n\nAfter you acquire the ability to make permanent items (character and weapon trinkets) which you'll be able to use in future runs and collect some crucial weapons (like silent gun) and abilities ([in-game slabs] like Shift that allows you to teleport short distances) - then the game fully opens up. \n\nReal fun begins after you learn all maps and shortcuts and how to toy with your enemies (but it takes quite a lot of time to get there).\n\nStealth is very easy, the enemy AI is dumb at best. The more trinkets and slabs you get - the more variety in gameplay opens up. \n\nAction is very smooth, Abilities are strong and versatile, that's where this game shines to be honest. \n\nThere are 4 different areas and all of them change depending of the time of the day (morning, noon, afternoon and evening). Depending of the time of the day - some areas become accessible, some become closed, The enemies and items also change their locations and sometimes you'll be able to encounter bosses (in-game they are called visionaries). They are not hard to kill, but it's quite hard to get to them. That's the fun part of this whole game. The more you replay all areas, the more information you'll acquire about visionaries and their behaviour. It's possible to deal with them all without killing a single other enemy.\n\nBut with all that comes the not so fun part - exploration and doing the same thing over and over and over again. It's gonna be hard at first, every area is very detailed and it's really easy to miss a code written on a desk or a wall, A lot of sniffing around is required for clues and multiple times per map. It definitely makes repetition your new best friend.\n\nThere are a lot of puzzles and challenges. If you are not shooting dumb NPCs - you're definitely trying to crack a solution to a puzzle. Sometimes you'll need to visit several maps on the exact time of day at which events occur and find the exact required item or piece of information in order to solve a puzzle. Yeah. It's a big hassle, but that's how this game is and how it functions. If you like puzzles, you'll enjoy Deathloop. But be prepared to use a guide or two for some of them and a lot of patience.\n\nDuring some objectives it's very easy to make mistakes and fail. Several challenges require you to be pixel perfect in execution. Didn't notice that mine placed on a generator? Too bad, you'll gonna have to restart or try in another loop.\n\nI disliked that once you find a new weapon, you have to take it with you and drop one of your 3 weapons. You will never be able to use the dropped one for the rest of the loop. Considering that you'll always find a new toy to play with - your loadout will always be half-baked. It's actually extremely annoying, the same can be said about your slab abilities too (only after you find them all, then the ability upgrades will go straight into your inventory after finishing a level).\n\nAnd of course, there is Julianna. She is your \"buddy\" the whole game and she talks to you at the start of every level and well... she is always trying to kill you. It's fun when she invades and disrupts your chill Groundhogday experience. You can even let other real players invade you as Julianna. Fun, if you like to fill yourself with some adrenaline. Either you kill her, or she kills you and you'll have to start over the whole loop ^^\n\nFunny, but Colt reminded me of Draymond Green from Golden State Warriors. In some instances he looks exactly like him haha.\n\nThere are some AI bugs and the game starts to stutter the longer you play. Kinda strage, but it was for me. Occasionally framerates can go from smooth to choppy quite fast.\n\nDeathloop is a decent game overall. Idea is good, but works much better in movies, because there you don't have to sit through the same routines every single time and you get to the next big reveal a lot quicker. \n\nI think Julianna was a bit underused. Imagine how awesome this game could be if Deahtloop worked similar to The Lost Vikings where you control 3 characters at the same time. She could have had different abilities, different strengths. A duo trying to break the loop! Pretty cool, eh? Anyway, That's just my 2 cents.",
      "The EOS stands for End of Service. I am sure someone has fun with this or there wouldn't be a reason to keep bringing it back. Right? The usual Tab Target MMO.

      "I've been playing this game since it was in Kickstarter! It is the best Story Rich game that I have ever played and the most unique. I have played through maybe 7 times and it's different every time. The ability to replay this game countless times is what makes it such a great game. Tons of questions that change based on the questions you've asked, you see a question that might not be there after you ask another question instead. Every version of this game that I played kept my interest and had me sitting on the edge of my seat waiting for more. I have reached 2 endings so far and I can't wait to see what happens next. The Developers are great, I can't wait to see what they create next.",
      "This game was so much fun but it's borderline unplayable a lot of the time due to no region lock. You get a lot of players from china playing on NA servers and they're basically untouchable due to ping. I genuinely think this game has fantastic game play and the characters and customization are top notch but spawning and dying to untouchable Chinese players every match just ruins the experience no matter how much I try to enjoy it. Not worth until they region lock the game or unless you want maybe a few hours of fun until you run into 我操你妈 every game and die to reasons out of your control.",

      "An Excelent, well polished shmup(except for one technical fault) with great graphics and music.\n\nNot much to say other than it has fun boss fights with some creative bullet patterns, you have a gauge that fills up and when activated it doubles your fire power, and also you have bombs. If you have bombs and you get hit, you lose all of your bombs instead of just dying straight out, so you essentially have 2 hit points. You have a graze meter as well, meaning that if bullets pass by you it fills that meter up, when it is full, all bullets around you are basically nullified, and any enemy you kill, any bullets it fired at you will also get nullified. When you pass through the nullifeid bullets, it will fill the first gauge I mentioned so you can go ape s**t more often.\n\nIt's fairly simple, but the pace of the game takes a little while to get used to, the speed of your ship releative to the bullets is a little too slow but it's not game breaking. The only major issue is that my controller is not detectable by the game so I have to use joytokey, so I can't make full use of my controllers analog controls.",
      "A lot of people's main complaint's seem to be about microtransactions. The game is perfectly playable without spending a dollar other than what you spent on the base game. And it's really not P2W. mostly aesthetic. Dedicated servers would be nice. but I feel they could fix this by better host migration. It is rather annoying when in a 4v4 and the host gets tilt and breaks the match by leaving, losing all the exp earned.\n\nTL;DR people are mad about spending extra money but want dedicated servers for free? =/\n\n*EDIT* after spending a few hours practicing, I now get told to kill myself on a regular basis in duels.\n\n11/10 Git Gud",
      "[h1]Press F11 for Fullscreen and know that your inventory has two parts[/h1]\n\n\nThe Steam version seems like an improved version of the mobile version. I got stuck and looked at screenshots and guides and none of them were helpful (I've never played the mobile version just in case you were wondering. A guide I saw mentioned only 5 endings but this version features more than that)\n\nI got over my block when I realized that there were another set of items in my inventory (I didn't notice that it said 1/2 at first)\n\nI haven't finished the game yet though, so I might update my review, but so far, everything looks good!",
      "[h1] 8.5/10 [/h1]\n\n[b] Please note that The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles is a very independent entry in the Ace Attorney series in terms of plot. Even if you have not played any of the Ace Attorney titles before, it will not affect your understanding of the game's plot. [/b]\n\nThis courtroom text adventure game in late 19th century Japan and British have a lot of features, even with the previous Ace Attorney works are very different. With the detailed character costumes and backgrounds, the strong sense of history and atmosphere, the majestic music, and excellent characterization, along with the game's detailed 3D character animation, players can experience an unprecedented adventure. In the plot, The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles presents a layer-by-layer, cocooning type of plot development, each chapter of the story is closely linked, and ambiguous, no chapter is meaningless, and in the final unraveling of all the mystery, the feeling of shock and excitement brought to the player is unprecedented in any text adventure game.\n\nThe reviews of The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles tend to be polarized, and not without reason. The progression of the plot brings with it an overwhelming lack of tension in the first and middle stages of the game. The design of many of the cases in the game seems rather undisciplined, neither interesting nor deep... The Great Ace Attorney: Adventure, as the first half of the game, though the development of the subsequent plot paved a lot of ambushes, the design of the plot and puzzles makes it less interesting and often difficult to motivate players to continue playing. The climax of the game comes too late, whether the player can persist to this point is a huge problem. At the same time, the Steam version of the game globally locks 30 frames, and can not set the Japanese voice is also a very huge drawback, and very damaging to the player's gaming experience.\n\nThe quality of The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles is actually not that bad. But this can only be concluded after you have experienced the entire game in its entirety... And I think this is actually the biggest drawback of this game because the ability to keep the player until the climax of the plot is the biggest pain point of this work. If you are very patient, love the Ace Attorney series, and love the suspenseful story of players, then The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles will not let you down. If you do not have any of the above elements, perhaps The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles will not give you a memorable experience.",
      "It's hard to recommend Spelunky 2. Not because it is a bad game, but because it can be frustrating. As with most roguelikes, dying means going back to the beginning. In Spelunky however, nothing carries over to future runs. All you get to bring in to your next run is your own experience and knowledge; And when half the things in the game kill you instantly or stunlock you to death, having a great run end in a quick death can be damaging to one's will.\n\nThankfully, your own experiences count a great deal towards your progress. Most hazards and enemies in Spelunky 2 have a very simple and predictable behaviour. But keeping track of everything on the screen is still a challenge. Enemies and traps will also work together (or against each other) and still bring your demise somehow. Either by bumping your helplessly stunned body into other enemies and traps, or enemies having their own flaming corpse launched towards you and your flammable jetpack. It's actually quite funny sometimes. A good deal of entertainment can be had recording your own amazingly nonsensical deaths.\n\nSpelunky 2 improves upon Spelunky HD's gameplay by adding split paths, which allow for more variety and decision-making in your runs while staying true to the feeling and style of previous entries. It also adds a back layer to each level, allowing for more secrets to be kept. After successfully completing your first run, you can try to discover these secrets and find hidden bosses and areas and even different endings!\n\nAnyway, you might enjoy the game if you're a masochist or something.",
      "Undoubtedly one of the best if not THE BEST modern video game remaster out there. I will summarize the pros and cons of this remaster into the following:\n\n[b]The Good:[/b]\n\n- Totally seamless transition into the new modern 4K visual from the old classic Win95 at a push of a key\n- Extremely faithful to the original titles (some might say that it is perhaps TOO faithful)\n- Game \"installation\" screen when you first boot up for both Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert is filled with God tier nostalgia \n- New UI with a complete revamp of the sidebar complete with higher quality artwork that totally feels in place\n- Plethora of never-before-seen bonus contents including exclusive missions and cinematic cutscenes for Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert that was only available on certain console platforms\n- You can queue multiple units while in production now\n- New multiplayer features and service is great. Finally you can now play 1v1 ranked and spectate any previous matches that was played including spectating ongoing games in the lobby\n- You can add, remove and create your very own custom music tracks in-game for both Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert however you want\n- All of Frank Klepacki's overly iconic classical and remixed tracks are here including various modern remixed that was composed solely for this remastered collection!!!\n\n[b]The Bad:[/b]\n\n- Minor bugs (though not a real dealbreaker)\n- The gameplay meta among factions/units remains as unbalanced as ever. Kinda of a tradeoff for being too faithful to the original titles\n- Multiplayer is still officially limited to a maximum of 4 players total per map in Tiberium Dawn, while in Red Alert the limit is a maximum of 8 players total\n- FMV cutscenes are all still heavily compressed in SD resolution extracted from the Playstation home console version and further artificially enhanced via AI upscaling due to the fact that the original master footage tapes for both Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert are still yet to be found\n\n[b]The Kinda Ugly:[/b]\n\n- Certain mission on hard difficulty are completely unbalanced. This is already another insult to injury as the AI blatantly cheats when it comes to resource procurement and unit build time. The fault of a clear lack of playtesting",

      "From my og demo feedback, not much changed sadly:\n\nOh boy....\n\nI will start with the most glaring issue:\n-It's friggin IMPOSSIBLE to find an online match\n\nNow some other stuff that I found odd or bad:\n-The camera.... oh god.... I get it, it's supposed to \"limit\" the playing area (specially for local gameplay) but it punishes people in first place... that's friggin dumb in a RACING game, also also if you go under other track sometimes you can't see sh*t (the going under other track piece seems to be fixed in the final release)\n\n-The car randomly drives itself ???? (maybe it's the antenna thingy I chose at car selection.... would be good a tooltip or SOMETHING so I know wtf is that about)\n\n-NO CONTROL REBINDING OPTIONS..... in 2023 \n\n-If you \"die\" near a checkpoint, though luck pal you WILL miss the next section too cause you won't respawn in time... that's.... just unfun and dumb.\n\n-The \"shortcut\" option definetly does not work, I intentionally crafted a track with cuts and the game will kill you if you try to do those..... good job devs. (This seems to be fixed or working properly in final release)\n\n-Since I couldn't find an online match EVER, I played only in local lobby or vs AI, now here comes the issue, the \"placing\" round locks everyone to the same \"screen\", there is no zoom, you can get trolled by another player preventing you to move to a place to connect track or hazards, rendering your placement turn void and useless, I don't know if this is intentional or just a downside of playing on local mode, you may have free cam in multi, but alas I couldn't try that. BTW.... WHY THERE IS NO ZOOM OPTION\n\nThe good:\n-The games runs smooth as butter, with everything maxed on my midend rig, good one devs\n\n-The cars seem to be varied and with some gimmicks, alas you have NO TOOLTIPS or info what that possible gimmick may be..... why ?\n\n-The track pieces, hazards and weapons are quite varied and some weird shennanigans are ensured to happen, feels like a Trackmania troll track being build in real time 10/10\n\nThe \"mehhh\":\n\n-The weapons/items some of them are mindbogglingly hard to understand wtf they do, there is a grey metallic ball even that seems to do nothing or I haven't figured out how to use it... again... a tool tip maybe ? a section about weapons/items in the main menu mayhaps ?\n\nAnd that's that, sorry if my writing seems a bit aggresive, I just was kinda hyped about the game and it feels a bit of a let down so far. But, IT HAS POTENTIAL.\n\nSadly, another case of developer with TONS of feedback delivering an undercooked mess. Stay away from it.",
      "Ok so let me start off by saying that I absolutely loved the first game in this series. I loved the subtle changes when you compared character interaction throughout the game as you progressed playing non-lethally/lethally. Now I never buy games at launch, I always wait for sales. When I got Dishonored 1 for $2 I was blown away and mad at myself for waiting for such a sale. I would've happily spent more on that game, it was worth it. Now all that said, here we are at Dishonored 2:\n\nPros\n- Mechanics have been vastly improved upon and the gameplay is just so much more fluid. As much as I loved the previous game I can't deny it was somewhat clunky.\n- Customization is so much better! The upgrades are plentiful and the bonecharm crafting system is awesome once you realize what you are doing. It really expands on how many options you really have at your disposal.\n\nCons\n- The difficulty still just isn't there for me. I LOVED that there was a custom difficulty mode, but even making things harder than the 'very hard' difficulty I still completed the game using no powers and never getting detected with relative ease(I did save A LOT obviously). The only things that really present a challenge are the clockwork soldiers, and as the plot of the game makes evident, you really don't encounter those enough to really present a big challenge.\n- The story is weak, plain and simple. It was like you were on a storyboard that used the same format as the previous game. The story, especially the universe and how you were immersed into it, was a big part of the why I loved the first game.\n- How low vs high chaos is handled. It isn't like there are no changes, in fact I was surprised a few times in my 2nd playthrough which I was doing as a hardcore murderer of every man, woman, and child(if there was any) that crossed my path. It just never really changed the dynamic enough like Dishonored 1 did. The way the final mission in the first game played out when comparing no killing playthroughs with bloody ones was VASTLY different right from the start of the mission.\n\nAll in all it wasn't a bad game. I still definitely enjoyed it for being a niche genre game. Just maybe I would have liked the game to stand out more like the first did.",
      "I'm a bit torn on giving Guacamelee! Super Turbo Championship Edition (STCE) a thumbs down, but I feel it's important for prospective buyers/players to know that STCE is significantly worse than Guacamelee! Gold Edition. \n\nSTCE brings a number of modifications to Guacamelee, all of which are negative (apart from the 4P support). First, there are two large new areas, both of which serve as filler, breaking the flow of the game while not introducing any new concepts. Arguably the best part of the second area is the new character that serves as a boss, but said boss fight is relatively simple and the character takes focus away from the stronger original cast. Secondly are the combat changes: the \"rebalancing\" of enemies and the Intenso power. Javiar Jaguar, the stand-out boss from the original game, has been nerfed to an absolute pushover. Moreover, the Intenso power is absolutely game breaking, making every combat encounter in the game a joke. That wouldn't be so bad if you could ignore it, but the developers added certain combat encounters where the difficulty goes through the roof if Intenso isn't used (rooms with multiple enemies with white shields, hitstun-immunity, and/or non-dodgable attacks).  These rooms generally feature Intenso-refilling barrels or enemies as well, so the intention is clear. Of course, there's plenty of Intenso to go around even for easier rooms and bosses, trivializing combat entirely. \n\nIn short, STCE is still a good game, but the original release was a GREAT game, without the broken combat \"rebalancing\" and padding. Please buy/play Guacamelee! Gold instead.",

      "We need a 60fps patch ASAP. Having 30fps content on PC in [current year] is not acceptable.\n\nOther than that the game is pretty solid! It looks great, it plays great, the story was good imo, the characters are interesting and the amount of solo content is decent.\n\nHowever, the gear system is not as elaborate as in Mk11 and the microtransations are NOT a welcome sight. Denuvo also has to go. If Harada agreed that the addition of Denuvo in Tekken 7 was a mistake, so should NetherRealm.\nI also don't like that 2 characters that are going to be in the Kombat Pass are already in the game (Ermac and Quan Chi). Just give us these characters and come up with other ones for the KP. This is super greedy and lazy.\nIt's even worse than Sektor and Cyrax in MK11, at least you didn't let us play them, period. this time you decide to not make them playable (even thought they work for the AI) AND sell them at a later date? That's awful.\n\nThe game is good but needs improvement and shouldn't ship with performance issues, 30fps content, microtransactions, Denuvo and greedy DLC tactics. I would put a \"meh\" review if I could because of the negatives but for that reason I have to say \"no\".",
      "Like many games in my library, [i]Iconoclasts[/i] has been gathering dust in my backlog for a long time. And, like many games in my library, I should have played this one much, much sooner. \n\nAs my 40ish shared screenshots of this game suggest, the pixel art in this one is fantastic. Each area, set piece, character, or enemy the player comes across was painstakingly crafted to be as visually striking as possible. I don’t normally gush about graphics in games, but some of the scenes in this one will stick with me for a long time. Of course, screenshots don’t do the game justice; one has to see it in motion to really appreciate it.\n\nBut I don’t personally believe that a metroidvania can be carried by its graphical style alone. Luckily, this game was fun as all hell to play! But, while there are a lot of standard metroidvania traits here (exploring, upgrading, backtracking, etc.), I can see how it might not be someone’s cup of tea… This one is extremely puzzle-heavy and story-driven.\n\nIt might be saying a lot about me, but some of the puzzles really twisted my brain into knots. I found them to be very clever, even when finding the solution had me slamming my head against the wall. The few puzzles I felt I needed to google never left me crying “bullshit” – the answer was in front of me all along and I was either too dense or too many beers deep to see it.

So, you know, if a story that critiques theocratic authoritarianism that threatens planetary devastation would get you hot under the collar, you should probably steer clear. \n\nAnyway, as always, if those things didn’t turn you away, this one is absolutely worth your time.

      "The latest S tier Deckbuilder Roguelike, joining the ranks of Slay the Spire and Monster Train for me. I think that's all that really needs to be said.\n\nIt leans heavily into kiss/curse type effects, if you like the ability to manipulate rng and do some busted stuff with your sequencing you will love it. It is more of a thinker on a turn to turn basis than other games of this genre, but if that isn't a turn off then it's a really solid game with some unique characters/mechanics that feel fresh.",
      "Her story starts you off in an old looking computer with what looks like Windows 95, or perhaps a previous version. Once there you are presented with a database of footage from a 1990s, where you must piece together what happened.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\nWithout spoiling anything, since this game is all story based, you are revisiting video clips of seven separate interviews trying to piece together what exactly happened. When you start off, you are placed in front the pc with the word “murder” already typed in. With this simple word, you are given, you must, delve deeper into the story, and form your own conclusion as to what happened, but the more you go deeper into the mystery, the more confused you may become; perhaps even discarding your previous assumption many times before coming to a conclusion that does not go against her story.    \n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nThis game is not a conventional game in terms of gameplay. Instead, you are watching videos and finding potential terms that could lead you to more videos which will reveal more as to her past and what, and who was involved in this incident. Some might not like this, so if the idea of an exclusively story based game does not appeal, do not bother. It is an interesting concept, and very captivating if you play it without any distractions, perhaps more interesting if you play it with a friend and try to piece the mystery together (much like I did).\n\n[h1]Verdict: 8.5/10[/h1]\n\nIf you enjoyed this review, or found it helpful, please feel free to follow our curator [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/WeLoveKawaiiNekos#curation]here.[/url]",
      "One of the best platformer/Beat-them-up just got upgraded. new attacks, new enemies, new bosses, new levels, new modes, new skins and a graphical improvement, this is really worth getting if you didn't play the original version. if you have the original you get a 66% discount which is good but i still think it should be an optional DLC that sells for 2 Dollars. of course i understand many people won't buy it because they played the original and they shouldn't buy it, but as for me its just that i wanted a reason to replay Guacamelee again so i bought this.",

      "The game is a masterpiece, just like the first one. After finishing PoE 1, I immediately started with the second one and I was treated to another marvel of a game. Here are some of my thoughts:\n\nThe Good:\n-Very good main story but the side content is what made this game great\n-Interesting and deep characters, both new ones and some returning from the first game, including companions\n-The story picks up after the events of the first game and is a direct continuation of the first game (just like with Baldur’s Gate 1 and 2)\n-If you still have the savegame-files from the first game, your decisions and consequences from the first game will carry over\n-There is so much lore, if you are into reading and listening to stories\n-A lot of voice-acting\n-A lot of pets you can collect and the equipped one has a small benefit to your party\n-Interesting races and sub-races, each with its own boons and downsides\n-Interesting classes and sub-classes, including the possibility of multi-classes\n-You can retrain your characters\n-You can make a new character to join your party at any time at tavern\n-Item and weapon diversity (including pistols)\n-You have the option to play the game as either turn-based (like divinity original sin) or real time (with game pause, just like Baldur’s Gate)\n-You can sail the seas as a pirate and attack any ship you meet without consequence. The ships on the map will respawn endlessly so you will never run out, which makes them a real great source of income.\n-Besides the ship you are given at the beginning, there are a few others you can buy. Each has its own benefits\n-Ship, crew and sailing require some management, but if you like this sort of stuff you can get real invested in it \n-Exploring the map by ship, if you are into that kind of stuff\n-When engaging other ships, you have a choice between boarding or naval combat\n-Endurance is no longer a thing so you only need to manage your Health during fights. You will like this if you were not a big fan of the Endurance vs Health system from the first game\n-The resting system has improved. Besides taverns, now you can rest anywhere you want as long as you have food\n-No inventory management is necessary. Your inventory is infinite so just pick everything up because sooner or later you might need things like explosives, potions, tools etc.\n-Choice matters, and boy are there a lot of different paths you can choose from\n-Romance options\n-Bounties are fun and offer good experience and money\n-DLCs are a bit shorter than the one from the first game, but they are just as good (will not describe them to avoid spoilers)\n\nThe Bad:\n-Loading screens are too long and too many\n-Just like in the first game, I reached max level at about 2/3 of the game(max level 20) so any experience gathered beyond that was pointless. By the end of the game could have easily reached level 30 if that was a thing\n-Naval combat is scripted, so it might not be as spectacular as you might imagine\n-Exploring islands on foot isn’t so much fun\n-The idea of factions might not be to everyone’s liking\n-After playing for a few hours, the game performance seems to decrease and my pc struggled with running it. Maybe the game has an optimization problem but it’s possibly that this one is on me and the game is fine. This might not be the case for other users.\n\nAdvice:\n-In the beginning of the game, try to reach Neketaka asap and do as many quests there as you can before heading out on your ship exploring the seas\n-Pick everything up. Your inventory space is infinite and you will end up needing diverse items like explosives, traps, tools etc.\n-Always have tools with you: hammer and chisel, prybar, lockpicks, grappling hook. You will really need them from time to time\n-Plundering other ships is a great source of experience, resources and money but be careful not to burn yourself out if you do it for too long\n-If you get stuck on a quest, just do some online research\n-Invest money in your ship and crew as soon as you can\n-Always have a tank and healer in the party\n-Make sure to diversify the skills of your party. It’s always good to have someone with Mechanics, Religion, Athletics or Diplomacy most of all\n-Enchant your items\n-When you get the white/grey colored legendary items, make sure to bind them to the character you equip them on and do the mini-quests inscribed on them to unlock new powers and features\n-Use summons, as they are great for distracting enemies. They can take a lot of hits and also dish it out\n\nMy game experience:\nI played on the classic (normal) difficulty, just like I do with every new game I start, and found the game not very hard but fun. I played the game in real time, because turn-based takes too long. As soon as I got my first ship working, I sailed to Neketaka, found the last companions I knew I wanted on my permanent team (Maia and Pallegina) and just quested away in the city until I had enough money and levels under my belt to start exploring the seas and attack other ships. I never did the scripted naval combat because I was having too much fun boarding the ships and watch my characters fight. My party consisted of my Watcher (Moon Godlike, Chanter, specced in summoning), Eder (because he’s a beast of a tank and has some fun interactions with others), Xoti (gotta have a healer, she’s also fun to have around), Maia Rua (very good ranged DPS and she comes with a pet cause she’s a ranger) and Pallegina, who is an excellent off-tank and support character. Once I took to the seas, I made my fortune by plundering ships, equipped my ship and characters with the best money could buy and then just catered to the different existing factions in the Deadfire, while not loosing sight of my main mission.\n\nI had a great time playing Pillars of Eternity 1 and 2. I consider they offer some great replay value and are great fun if you are into this style of RPG games. If you are a fan of games like the Baldur’s Gate, Icewind Dale, Diablo, Dragon Age, Neverwinter Nights and Divinity Original Sin series, you must try PoE 1 and 2.\nI really hope they make Pillars of Eternity 3.\n",
      "I'm seeing a new trend in gaming here: A studio wants to port an oldie but goodie to consoles, so polishes it up a bit, releases the new version on console and gives it as a free upgrade to the PC boys. It benefits everyone, but don't get too excited.\n\nIt's not a stunning remaster, because Mark of the Ninja looked damn good to begin with. To this end, everything only got tweaked a [i]bit[/i]. The backgrounds are a [i]bit[/i] more detailed, the cutscenes are a [i]bit[/i] sharper and more fluid-moving, the lighting effects have a [i]bit[/i] more dynamic range, and the resolution is a [i]bit[/i] better. Less a remaster and more a cleanup. Most of the changes are so subtle and detailed you won't even find them by actively looking for them, but they're there.\n\nIt costs exactly the same as the special edition of the original, and includes the SE content, and if you already own the original's SE, you get the remaster for free. So basically, if you want the full MotN package, there's no reason not to pick this up. I'm just playing through it mostly because Mark of the Ninja is a kickass game with or without 4K. There is no downside to picking this up if you want the base game. Do it.",
      "Gone are the days of mindless building and fun. Power grids? Taxes? Intense accounting and counter-intuitive path building. A pre-built zoo for tutorials. I actually felt MORE stressed after playing this game. If you're looking for something to flex that brain, perfect. If you're looking to release the cougars and create chaos, you can do that in sandbox I guess. You could also just not connect power grids correctly. Works like a charm. Honestly who thinks of these things",
      "I'll preface this by admitting that it makes sense for so many of the \"helpful\" reviews to be negative; it's good to warn customers of a game they won't enjoy, and The Witness definitely isn't for everybody.  That said, this is among my favorite games, and I was looking forward to The Witness for a very long time, so the fact that it lived up to my expectations says a lot.\n\n(You may find it helpful to know my preferences, so here are some of my other favorites: Fez, Portal, Infinifactory, LIMBO, The Beginner's Guide, and of course, Braid.)\n\nAs other reviewers have pointed out, The Witness isn't \"fun\"; that's not a criticism, it's just an accurate observation.  The Witness is treading unfamiliar territory, but only for a video game: most other artistic mediums have been used to explore themes other than \"fun,\" and it makes sense that this medium can be used similarly.\n\nInsofar as objective criteria exist for judging the quality of a video game, The Witness meets every standard I can think of: the game runs smoothly, the team have been timely about patching bugs, the visuals (gorgeous and stylized) and audio (understated and lacking music) are expertly executed, and the design of the world and puzzles is meticulous (and ambitious).\n\nThe only objective drawbacks I can think of are:\n\n1) The absence of an FOV slider (important for those who suffer from motion-sickness), which the developers have hinted may be added in a future update. UPDATE: this has been added, along with some other configuration options.\n\n2) Some of the puzzles are impossible to solve if you're deaf or color-blind.\n\nFrom what I can tell, The Witness is about making your own observations and forming your own theories about how the game mechanics work (the title of the game is relevant to its content); it's partly about solving puzzles, but more so it's about figuring out what the puzzles even are and how they work in the first place; given that, it's easy to see why The Witness fails to provide players with a clear goal or feedback: that would undermine the core of the game.  Patient curiosity is the best mindset with which to approach The Witness; it's like a piece of cloth with a loose thread: you pull it, and it keeps unraveling, and unraveling, and unraveling...\n\nThe intrigue of The Witness stems from constant and subtle revelations about how the game functions, which tend to overturn your previous theories and force you to let go of your presumptions, all without ever jumping the shark.\n\nThe Witness is slow to get rolling, patiently waiting while you adjust yourself to the mechanics and freely allowing you hold on to your false sense of comprehension.  You might expect a game like this to be eager to shove its paradigm-shifting revelations in your face, but it generally isn't: The Witness makes no effort to divulge its secrets, and when you peel back another layer, you can take comfort in the fact that it's a real accomplishment on your part.\n\nThe island is dense with puzzles (more so than it appears at first), and each of the nearly 700 puzzles (according to the developers) presents its own unique challenge, and a peek into the mechanics of the game (if you're paying attention).  The puzzles are each short, but satisfying and interconnected, so it's easy to leave the game at any time, and they're grouped into areas, where each area explores a particular game mechanic.\n\nBecause you're free to wander the island, you can walk away from one area if you get stuck and try a different one.  I usually had two or three areas I could choose between at any time.  If you try to play through each area, beginning to end, one at a time, I imagine you'll not enjoy yourself very much.  Once you get stuck on a puzzle, rather than continue banging your head against it, I recommend venturing off to find a different one; returning to a puzzle with a fresh palette and new mechanics under your belt may shake something loose.  The puzzles generally shouldn't require guesswork, and all of them are fair.\n\nThere's no narrative in The Witness.  You'll find recordings scattered around the island, which contain quotes from people throughout history, generally on the topics of awareness, discovery, investigation, and the monotheistic concept of a god.\n\nBeing an atheist, some of these fell flat for me, while others less concerned with theism hit hard, and one even had me teary-eyed.  Each one rang with the sort of sincerity that will either move you, or make you very uncomfortable, depending on how it plays against your own life and beliefs.\n\nIf I'm to be honest, I think The Witness has affected me on a personal level: its themes of exploration and discovery, and its quiet faith in your capacity to unravel its mysteries are comforting.  If you're in the mood for some introspection, you'll probably enjoy it as I have.",
      "I would give this a mixed rating if I could. \nThe story is told in such a boring way that it's hard to stay invested. You run to one person, listen to a cutscene, or more likely read a cutscene, than go to another person to talk to. Sometimes you fight one guy but mostly it's pretty dull. There is very little gameplay in the overland content and everything plays like a bad visual novel.\n\nAAR, the first MSQ is just one fetch quest after the other with little story in it. Oh there is some story there, but it's not great. The characters are shallow with few expectations, both the supporting cast and villains. \n\nHeavensward, the expansion I got through before my time ran out, is better than ARR but not that enjoyable. There were parts I like (not to give spoilers, it was the part where you go on a “journey”) Sadly, that part of the expansion was far too short. Than the story precedes to shove itself up it’s own ass as it becomes fixated on one part of the lore. [spoiler]I don’t give a damn how the war started! It was a thousand years ago.[/spoiler]\nPro:\n-If you like story, and only story, you will like this game.\n-A lot of content\n-Trial fights. (Good boss fights without the boring part of dungeons)\n\nCons:\n-Little in the way of gameplay outside of dungeons and trials \n-ARR is a slog and not worth reading. Skip as fast as you can and just watch a recap video.\n-dungeons are locked behind the story and not unlocked as you level up.\n-The story is on the lower end of other final fantasy games.\n-Lalafells are in the game. People who play this race are degenerates.",
      "A criminally underrated game, I have seldom seen a developer take their original hit which was already almost perfect, and actually manage to improve on it in every way shape and form. You do not need to have played the original to play or enjoy this game. Their stories are completely seperate.\n\nThe game itself is much less linear than its predecessor. The best way I can explain the feeling of going through the environments without referencing Grimrock itself is by saying it felt an awful lot like Myst to me, just with combat. Required puzzles for progression were challenging but not impossible, some of the secret challenges were much more difficult. I admit I used an online guide more than a few times, but it did nothing to diminish my enjoyment of the game. It is immersive, challenging, and satisfying. \n\nThe only drawback I can think of is the difficulty. It feels like you cannot win with any group composition, I suggest no more than 2 of any class or weapon/armor type user. I went with a warrior, two rogues(one range), and a mage, this way you as well makes you unlikely to complete a difficult fight or puzzle and be rewarded with something you cannot use. Combat itself can be challenging as I said, but you will rarely feel like you are simply incapable of winning. There are obvious ways to optimize the way you approach an encounter the second time if you die the first.\n\nBe prepared to immerse yourself, you must pay attention to your surroundings, read and remember notes you find, explore every nook and cranny you can find, and you will be rewarded. Good luck!\n",

      "This is a review about the port, not the game. The game itself is fantastic. I reference Moguri Mod throughout the review - this is a fan made mod that aims to improve the visual quality of the port.\n\nThe port is a lazy outdated mess:\n- It's lacking visual FX present in the original, such as the mist in the overworld of the Mist Continent. [b]This was fixed in a patch.[/b]\n- There is no way to restore the original font. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- Dialogue is rendered at a static pace, unlike the original. In the original game, lines of dialogue would show up on screen depending on how fast the character was talking. In this port, there is no distinction. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- There are multiple problems with the battle UI:\n-- It takes 40% of the screen. Square Enix patched this in the console versions, but the PC version was never patched. [b]This patch was released on PC in an update on the 6th of August 2020.[/b]\n-- It's rendered at what feels like 15fps, making navigation feel extremely clunky. In the original game, all menus were rendered at either 30fps interpolated or 60fps (don't know which one exactly), which made the browsing very fluid. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- All menus are clunky to browse because of the crippling low framerate. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- It's missing sound effects from the original. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- Despite porting the game to Unity, Square couldn't be bothered to re-write the animation code to speed up battle animations independently of buff/debuff tick timers, arguably the original game's biggest problem. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- The music in this port is a lower sample version of the original. [u]This is fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- The backgrounds clash horribly with the new character models. [u]This is fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n\nThe ONLY positive of this version is that you can skip the introduction to every battle. Except not really, because the option doesn't work half the time.\n\nThanks to the Moguri Mod, it is arguable that this version comes close to the original. Regardless of my opinion though, I'm not about to praise Square Enix for a port that the fans patched up. Moguri Mod is the only reason to buy this game on Steam.",
      "Like many games in my library, [i]Iconoclasts[/i] has been gathering dust in my backlog for a long time. And, like many games in my library, I should have played this one much, much sooner. \n\nAs my 40ish shared screenshots of this game suggest, the pixel art in this one is fantastic. Each area, set piece, character, or enemy the player comes across was painstakingly crafted to be as visually striking as possible. I don’t normally gush about graphics in games, but some of the scenes in this one will stick with me for a long time. Of course, screenshots don’t do the game justice; one has to see it in motion to really appreciate it.\n\nBut I don’t personally believe that a metroidvania can be carried by its graphical style alone. Luckily, this game was fun as all hell to play! But, while there are a lot of standard metroidvania traits here (exploring, upgrading, backtracking, etc.), I can see how it might not be someone’s cup of tea… This one is extremely puzzle-heavy and story-driven.\n\nIt might be saying a lot about me, but some of the puzzles really twisted my brain into knots. I found them to be very clever, even when finding the solution had me slamming my head against the wall. The few puzzles I felt I needed to google never left me crying “bullshit” – the answer was in front of me all along and I was either too dense or too many beers deep to see it.

      "This review only relates to the single player campaign. At 50 years old I have zero interest in multiplayer.\n\nAfter playing Gears of War 4, I was looking forward to this title. I wasn't disappointed. I found the new upgrade system with Jack enjoyable. The campaign was fun to play with minor exceptions. Graphics, sound, and voice acting were amazing. Campaign took me about 11 hours to beat. I consider that well worth the $60 I paid for the game.\n\nMy only real gripe about the single player campaign:  As a father of 3 girls, I'm all for strong female leading characters. Kait just isn't it, though. I didn't care for her in 4 and that didn't change in 5. For me she seems out of her league and just isn't believable as a team member. She's like Elizabeth Swan, the governor's daughter in Pirates of the Caribbean. She's a kidnapped damsel in distress in one movie, and the Pirate King in the next. It just doesn't work, for me anyway.",
      "EDIT: I nominated this game for game of the year (2023)\n\nLong ago I had heard about this game and how detailed and intricate it could be, and how you could spend hours upon hours building the massive empire of dwarves only for it to all come crashing down in some spectacular but unforeseen way.  Then I got into Rimworld briefly and thought it was ok, but it tended toward chaos a bit too much for my liking.  THEN I heard this game was coming to steam and I eagerly awaited it.\n\nIt's not necessarily that I was too good to play a game with mostly ascii/character graphics (I used to play them a lot back in the 1980s).  I was more intimidated by the depth of the game and not knowing if there was a wiki for it (there is) or how I'd find help if I needed it (I'm sure there's a ton of communities JUST for this game).  I expected that when it came to Steam, it'd be beefed up and worth the wait.\n\nWell it finally arrived and I think I'm STILL a bit intimidated by the sheer amount of options you have... mostly because it's not just me that I have to worry about, but a whole community of dwarves.  In the case of something like minecraft, I could dig a whole intricate tunnel and if stuff starts to go bad, I just high-tail it out of there and recover until I can go back and finish it.  In Dwarf Fortress though, if stuff starts to go bad, you can't just leave.  You are encouraged to deal with the adversity and push onward in the name of greatness... or something.\n\nIn a way it's like role playing, except you don't have to roll character sheets and you don't really control any of the characters directly.  You make decisions about where to mine, what trees to chop down, what to build, what to trade, what to plant, and for every thing there is a season (turn turn turn).  You're forced to deal with death, birth, attacks, sickness, madness, and a ton of other things that I have no idea are coming.  \n\nI keep thinking \"I could do better\" and I start a new game, but then I start to realize that no matter what I do, I'm never gonna have a perfect game, or a game where everything goes exactly according to plan.  I am eventually going to have to buckle down and stick to one game save to see it through.\n\nIf you're like me and starting something new holds a lot more interest than continuing an existing project (ADHD?) you may have difficulty with this game.  At the same time you may become so engrossed in it that you lose track of time and suddenly it's 6am and you wonder why you stayed up all night digging holes.  I'm starting to feel a bit of the madness myself.  (it's almost 4:30am as I write this)\n\nIn any case, it's probably not for everyone, but I'd say if you're unsure, find the non-steam version and try that, and if you can grok what's going on and it interests you, definitely buy this and support the developers... OR buy this and try to stay under the 2 hour refund  limit while you learn the basics (Good luck with that, it'll be 6 hours before you know what happened).  I believe this game is worth the money though (full price).  If you were going to wait for a sale you'd be waiting a long time anyway.  \n\nTL;DR If this looks interesting to you, don't wait! Buy now.  If you aren't sure, do a bit of research and come back and buy it.",
      "I am a Filthy Casual (tm) who plays games like Mass Effect and Fallout 4 on easy and still die over and over. I got my \"you died\" achievement in Dark Souls 2 before the tutorial and stopped playing after like forty minutes with zero qualms. I have rage quit every single platformer game I have ever touched, and just sort of despise brutally hard things that feel like chores.\n\nBasically, I am not exactly sure why I decided to buy Dead Cells in the first place. Sure, I love the look and one of the few platformers I've ever 100%'d was Super Metroid (with a LOT of swearing and rage quitting), so 'Metroidvania' is an appealing term to me, but it is still inherently marketed as a game that is not for me, or people like me.\n\nThis game is hard. I have 11 hours on it and I can't get past the third area on any given path. I die for stupid reasons and lose all my stuff and... I don't care. I haven't rage quit once; in fact, I have to force myself away from the game after a death so I can do things like eat. I find the combat engaging and entertaining, the progression satisfying and there's something really solid about being forced to start from square one (ish) every single time, in a way I've just never experienced.\n\nSo, sure, buy this if you love hard games/Dark Souls/no checkpoint kind of games. Absolutely, I'm pretty sure you've alreeady heard this is likely to be up your alley.\n\nBut even if you're a dirty rotten casual gamer who button smashes in any game approaching action, and panics when the screen flashes red around the edges... give it a try if you get the opportunity.

Especially for an MMO, the lighting in particular is amazing\n- Sound track is great and ambience adds personality to the zones\n- Some really cool zones to explore, feels as though you can get lost when you start\n- Controls/Keybinds are already really good imo, I only changed a few\n- Tutorial/Starter Quest chains do a great job of introducing you to the game without being too slow\n- Combat (when it works) Is really fun. Lots of action based fights\n- Wars are a really cool mechanic, they are ultimately flawed but are still a lot of fun\n\nCons:\n- Game is extremely shallow. It is borderline addicting for the first few levels, this soon dies off. When (If) You reach lvl 60, you ask yourself what do you do now?\n- As beautiful as the game is, a lot of it is copy and pasted. Literally. There are zones, towns, dungeons that are almost identical. Ruins immersion\n- Quests are extremely repetitive and boring. They consist of kill mobs, loot mobs, loot chests and that’s about it. No diversity\n- Combat can be laggy, you weapon swap and it doesn’t register sometimes. Wars can be a PowerPoint Presentation at times\n- Guild UI is awful. There is no guild bank, treasury ledger so you cannot monitor who donates money for wars etc. Makes running a guild a nightmare\n- There are countless exploits and duplications that have been abused upsetting economies, player numbers and the general integrity of the game\n- Server population has been decimated since launch leading to many dead servers. They’re merging already\n- There are some very worrying patch notes/future releases that are changing fundamental mechanics of the game. In some cases nerfs which punish players who didn’t rush to level cap\n- Watermark is a stupid progression system for gear. It forces you to run daily elite zone farm chains which get extremely repetitive\n\nIf this was a small indie dev company, I could give them the benefit of the doubt. However this is frickin’ Amazon. This product is totally unacceptable and needs to go back in the oven.\n",
      "I did everything right[spoiler]and ended up in a relationship.[/spoiler]\n\nAccidently said one tiny lie.\n\nEverything in my life crumbles apart.\n\n11/10 Real Life Simulator",
      "As a historical novelist and former high school English teacher with over 700 books in my home devoted to ancient Greek literature, history and culture I had to try this game.\n\nI should mention that I am pushing 60 years old and although I like strategy games like Creative Assembly’s Rome II, I’m not a fan of ‘gopher’ games that make you run around collecting items, rescuing damsels in distress, delivering messages, and murdering politicians to level your character.  The whole premises seems rather tedious and unimaginative.  \n\nSo right from the start I expected to hate Assassin’s Creed Odyssey.  Combine that with the fact that I’d never played an Assassin’s Creed game before, and I am not the most nimble finger clicker, I was prepared to spend a good portion of my playing time getting my head lopped off.  \n\nNone of that happened.  Well, yeah, there is a pretty steep learning curve here.  I did spend a lot of my initial hours zigging when I should have been zagging, and with my opponent’s spear in my head, but I stuck with it and eventually even an old poop like me was able to figure out the mechanics.\n\nWhat kept me going was the sheer majesty of the game and the beauty of the surroundings.  \n\nI’ve been to Athens, Sparta, Argos, Mycenae, Delos, Aegina, Hydra, Crete, Melos (now Santorini), and dozens of other locales on the campaign map multiple times.  I’ve walked around the ruins at Delphi, strolled the docks of Piraeus and walked through valley of Laconia for research for my books.  I wanted to see these places at they might have looked 2,500 years ago and that for me is the true joy of Assassin’s Creed Odyssey.\n\nThe team at Ubisoft deserves a lot of credit.  They did their homework.  Sure, you’d expect to see historical figures like Pericles, Socrates, Alcibiades and Archidamas in a game about the Peloponnesian War.  But that anyone outside of academia even knows who Brasidas, Aspasia, Herodotus and Pausanias were, is impressive.  Kudos to you.\n\nI’m probably an oddball gamer because I was not motivated by stabbing people in the back to gain levels and steal loot.  The entire idea of stabbing people in the back goes against the grain of the Greek ethos of ‘kleos’ or honor.  What kept me going was the desire to see more of the world that Ubisoft created.  \n\nI wanted to visit the Athenian Acropolis and see the Propylaea, Erechtheion and Parthenon as they were shiny and new, instead of in piles of rubble.  I wanted to gaze up at Phidias' statue of Zeus in Olympus (one of the wonders of the ancient Greek world that no longer exists), speak to the Pythia at the temple of Delphi, and see the five villages of Sparta as they might have looked.  Getting to walk the streets of Athens, Argos and Elis was like taking a trip back in time.  Magical.\n\nOkay, the game isn’t perfect.  The pronunciation of common names like Pericles and Socrates and the character’s accents were maddening.  I can only guess that Ubisoft believes we’ve Americanized the real pronunciations, or at least I hope that’s what they were thinking.  Ultimately it’s a minor annoyance.\n\nThe hoplite battles were a major disappointment.  The Greeks fought in a phalanx formation.  Shoulder to shoulder.  Shield to shield.  The battles here are a 300 movie style free for all.  Oh well, guess you can’t have everything.  \n\nAlso I could not fathom how Alexios and Kassandra could be descended from Leonidas, but have no connection to the Agiad royal family.  By rights they should have been Pausanias’ cousins, but they’re not.  I don’t know who they are. The whole Pythagoras-is-my-father thing is rather bizarre and makes no sense at all.  \n\nI won’t go off the charts here listing the historical inaccuracies that drove me batsh!t crazy, as it serves no purpose.  Suffice it to say that I enjoyed the game.  \n\nIf you ever wanted to unravel the labyrinth of the minotaur beneath King Minos palace at Knossos, get drunk and sing songs with Socrates at an Athenian symposium, feel the Aegean Sea roll beneath your feet on the deck of a  trireme, or stare out in wonder at the lights twinkling over Attica at twilight, try this game.  You won’t be disappointed.",
      "Finally, a video game that is everything televangelists in the 90’s said that video games were. Exactly what my Christian mother would love to catch me playing.\n\nIt’s like Animal Crossing and Doom\nEternal had a son… as was foretold when they released on the same day.\n\nThis game really makes you FEEL like you’re sacrificing your friends to an almighty force. Would I really just sacrifice 5 of my friends  again for some loot chests? I’m a gamer, of course I would.\n\nI fell in love with the aesthetic of this game instantly. It was brilliant when the gameplay held up to those expectations.  \n\nI loved it. I loved the art. The humor. The theme. The premise. The combat. The cult management. Sacrifices. Collecting the bones of my enemies. The juice visual effects. Most of all I loved feeding my followers bowls of poop.\n\nThe combat is fun but definitely not the meat of the game. Building your cult and just upgrading stuff is quite satisfying.  There's some goofy stuff to laugh at and it's quick and responsive. There’s something about the music that makes you feel relaxed and in terrible danger all at the same time.\n\nThis is not a game that you're gonna put 50-100 hours in either.  Which to me is a big plus.  Most of the runs don't take you more than 15 minutes.  So it's an easy game to pick up and play for a bit and jump back in later. It's like Vampire Survivors in that regard.\n\nIt's basically Animal Crossing with a roguelite twist. I could say it's almost original how those elements were combined.\nIt's great entertainment, all around. You could even say the game is bound to become a cult classic…\n\n10/10",
      "I wish there were a \"mixed\" option for recommending this game, as I think for a lot of people out there, this is a fantastic game, and it's definitely well made with a lot of love and attention to detail in many respects. I really like puzzles and problem solving, so part of my disappointment with The Witness is that I really thought I would enjoy the game. Myst was one of my favorite games growing up, and I was extremely excited to see a well-reviewed game in the Myst genre surface after far too long. \n\nThe problem for me was that The Witness is very much a game about the journey, and not the destination. It turns its head on the genre as it's less a game about solving puzzles within a set of rules, and more about discovering what those rules are. And for the most part, it does that well. Instead of the usual game conventions, rewards for solving hard puzzles weren't any kind of story unlock, more just to give you a harder puzzle. That approach was fun for awhile, but some story unlock would've been appreciated, especially because there is so much mystery and it's such an immersive world that was clearly built for a reason and has a fascinating backstory. \n\nSome of the mechanics also just seem arbitrary, or at the very least, not quite obvious enough. Sometimes perspective puzzles require you to either take a screenshot or jot down on pencil and paper the answer, then transfer it on screen. That seems like lazy game design and worst of all, takes you out of the immersive experience. It's possible I'm mostly tone deaf, as some of the sound puzzles seemed almost impossible to me, despite numerous listens. There's also just the repetitiveness of the \"pathfinding\" puzzles, which range from challenging (and satisfying) to punitive in their difficulty spikes. It's in these difficulty spikes where I think the core game mechanic of pathfinding lets you down, as it requires you to be much more of a planner than a \"hands on\" problem solver. In a game like this, I would think it would accommodate multiple approaches, but really there's a right way to approach this game, and a wrong way. Unfortunately for me, I think the way I approach puzzles (trial and error) is strongly discouraged, at times in punitive ways. \n\nThe philosophy from the audio/video portions will likely be appreciated by some, and for some come off as the worst kind of douchey-hipster nonsense. Had they been delivered in shorter pieces, I might've fallen into the former. But as rambling as some of them are, I found them more annoying than enjoyable unfortunately. \n\nI don't know, I'm really torn on this. It's a well made game, and while it seems so open and non-confined, I found the game to be far too linear in mechanics and how to approach problem solving. At times it actually made me feel like a lesser thinker because I have a different approach to puzzles than what the game designer prefers. What I'm sure is a really fun journey for some, left me disappointed with the destination. \n\nAm realizing this reads a lot like an apology for not liking this game, which I think it is. I really, really wanted to love The Witness, but in the end, not only was this game not for me, but I genuinely feel lesser for that fact because I feel like I should have loved it, and just didn't.",

      "Oh boy. DoDonPachi Resurrection.\nI love this game. Its loads of modes, tight controls, great bullet patterns, and fun gameplay and scoring mechanics make it an awesome shooter. \nThat being said, this game is tough as nails. Even the novice mode is hard as heck and definitely isn't novice-friendly. I reccomend having one or two shmup clears under your belt before you try to tackle DoDonPachi. (Crimzon Clover's novice mode is a good introduction to shmupping) You need some skill to get the maximum amount of enjoyment out of this game.\n\nStill, though, It's awesome! DoDonPachi Resurrection is a very fun experience, even with it's difficulty.\n",

      "[I received this product for free from a giveaway]. Only played for a short time, but sheesh, it's a bit of a mess both visually and gameplay wise. There's not much I can really say that would differ from what's shown in the trailer (rather crude MS-paint looking drawings with a few short looping backgrounds). You jump when moving right or left, flappy-bird esque, you dodge stuff going across the screen and from the top, which is a bit boring to me, but some may enjoy it more. You also have to go out of the screen to dodge sometimes, but also if you go too far out (who knows how far) you'll die as well. It might be an okay time waster for free (like old flash games), but I wouldn't recommend spending your money on this.",

      "I appreciate the sincerity of Jusant. You can tell its creators have placed genuine care into their product, which has made the experience of playing it joyful and kind.\nThe visuals are stunning, the mechanics are not overwhelming, the soundtrack is soothing, and the puzzles are not frustrating. A great climbing game all around with an easy-to-follow yet gripping narrative. \nHopefully, Ukrainian localization will also be added soon.\n",
      "Overall, there's just too many things about this game that rub me the wrong way.\n\nFirst of all, I definitely like the art, visuals, music, voice acting, and writing. They don't hold your hand when it comes to explaining the story and it forces you to pay attention and also encourages you to try lots of different function combinations so you can learn more about the characters, if you care to.\n\nOther than that, though, there's not much I like. The most important aspect of games to me is whether the gameplay is fun, and honestly transistor's gameplay isn't that much fun for me. Like others have said, not being able to do anything after you pause time and plan out a sequence of moves just sucks. They don't even give you enough mobility to dodge shots. All you can really do is try to get to cover and hide out until your meter replenishes. And if you opt to instead play without using turn (or using turn to pause and think and then unpausing and simply executing your actions manually), you'll probably disappointed by that experience when comparing it to the action oriented gameplay of bastion. One of the worst things, in my opinion, is that you lose access to functions when you lose all your health. Honestly I'd rather just die and restart from checkpoint. I can see that they're trying to encourage you to try different combinations of things, but it still just frustrates me losing the build that I was in the process of learning. And when your options are limited the gameplay just gets more and more boring because you might have to resort to gimmicky tactics depending on what functions you are left with. Overall, it's certainly a unique idea to blend the turn-based with real-time combat, but, in practice, it ends up just not being all that fun to me. I'd rather play a turn based game or an action game. My brain doesn't like switching between the two so rapidly.\n\nI would say get this heavily discounted and play it for the uniqueness and aesthetics. Don't come here expecting something very heavy or that you're going to really want to sink countless hours into or replay. My first playthrough was done in 6 hours and I was glad to be done with it. I have to complement them for not dragging it out or having some frustratingly long and tedious boss fight at the end. If the story went on even an hour longer I might've just gotten sick of it and given up.\n\nIf you're into experience games more along the lines of how you experience art or other aesthetic experiences (and not necesarilly for the thrill of challenge and victory), you should definitely consider this game. There's a lot there to process. I personally don't care much about that sort of thing when it comes to games, though.",
      "When I say this game changed the way I thought about life, I mean it. And before you say this game isn't worth 44 dollars, you are wrong. I would pay more than double just for this once in a lifetime experience.\n\nWhile this game may look like a stupid bishoujo romance game, it is so much more. Don't let the weird artstyle or obnoxious eyes fool you, this game will make you laugh. cry, depressed, happy, and everything in between. It is so extensive, so great, that there are over 13 character routes and stories to play in this game, all of which are good (some are incredible) and have some of the best, most fleshed our characters I have seen. This game is about life, change, friends, love, and most importantly, family. Every route in this game has a connection to family. (Clannad is a close-enough translation of family in Irish)\n\nIn case it helps, I'm a grown man who had a rather negative outlook on life, and this game me cry buckets. If you ever have thought about getting married and having kids, this game will MAKE you want to have a family. The clever writing and how the protagonist, Okazaki, changes throughout his life is all done so well. It made me realize how much we complain about our lives, but we don't need much to be happy or be motivated. In case it helps again, my mom loves this game, she connects with it quite a bit. Yet again, nothing bad to say here, only to say that Key is incredible and I will be reading some of their other works like Little Busters and Kanon.",
      "Really didn't plan on reviewing, but noticed a lot of people asking if this is worth $15 on sale. Short version - definitely yes. Now onto specifics...\n\nOffline modes are very much improved. Expansion teams for MyGM/MyLeague, with expansion draft of course, and customization options for those are really cool, for example if you're looking to create a legitimate historic team court and things, you can actually get pretty close using just in-game editor. Only bad part is that you can only create 2 custom jerseys (home and away) per team. MyCareer is a vast improvement over last year, specifically due to absence of the Spike Lee story. There's a new \"story\" so to speak, it irks some people, but it's not too bad and you still have control over the entire season. One downside is due to new player archetypes, you're effectively reduced to a role player even when you reach your maximum. Personally I can still hit triple-double average on Hall of Fame difficulty with my primary player, but the new stat caps severely limit the player potential. Ironically, you can't at all play some of the iconic player archetypes such as true all-around, 3 and D, or Dunker/Defensive Specialist.\n\nOnline modes on PC are... disgusting. First off there's a smaller player base, so you're bound to run into some queue times, or a completely dead queue very late in the night. Also, the game is susceptible to cheats, for example, only couple of months ago they blocked one particular cheat from MyTeam auction house, which was blatantly obvious and apparent and had very bad impact on economy. I won't go into details here as I don't want to be seen as advertising cheating, but I think it's very obvious they are weak on the ban hammer side, and the game itself is weak on protection. Also there is the unavoidable server lag for online modes, couple of sources close to the company explained that all servers are in Virginia, US, even the EU or Asian servers.\n\nGameplay is improved over the last year, primary addition being various types of Pick and Roll defenses, you can literally see different teams using different defenses and things like that. However I feel it's important to note that stock difficulty settings are sorely lacking in realism/simulation aspect. They are all very much arcade. However, there are lot of simulation slider settings listed at OperationSports for example, and once you tweak them, the game really shines. Of course, there are still couple of bad animations that can't be completely avoided, but custom sliders help out a lot in this regard. I should note that by default MyCareer doesn't allow custom slider settings, but there's a mod tool that can be used to accomplish this.\n\nGraphics of course you can easily see in any random gameplay video - they are obviously improved over last year(s). One part that sort of falls into this category that is dramatically worse are the replays. About 50% of the time, the replay will use the silly rim camera, and you won't be able to see the play at all.\n\nIn summary, as you can probably tell from the hours I played, I find this to be a great game, not like we really have a choice on PC when it comes to basketball. After thoroughly playing most of the game modes (except Play Now Online & All Star Team-Up), I'd easily recommend this to any basketball fan. However, keep in mind that online modes can be very frustrating, and if that's your primary reason for purchasing, it might be wise to wait and see how 2k18 turns out in that regard.",
      "I like the game, but I'd recommend waiting for the full release.\nDon't get me wrong, the game is beautiful and it's got great potential. The problem with it is, mostly, the keybindings.

      "[H1]At this price point it's hard not to recommend it, but there's a lot -better- bullet hell games out there...[/H1]\n\nDanmaku unlimited as a series is great. Don't get me wrong. It really is. But it suffers the curse of being put in with a field on Steam that is made up of even greater company. Bug Princess by Cave has the brutal difficulty angle sewn up, Ikaruga has the absolute classic angle nailed, Jamestown has the glorious pixel-art sorted. In order to stand out in this genre, you absolutely have to bring something new to the table.\n\nAs good as Danmaku Unlimited is, it does not bring anything new to the table. It brings a lot of -good-, but nothing -new-. The greatest sin here is that if you've played a lot of bullet hells, this is going to feel immensely familiar, and you're going to blast through it fast, nothing is prone to catch you out. At all. Now that may be a plus point, if that's what you're after, but if you're seeking something to change up the formula? Yeeeeee-no.\n\n[H1]So it's the Bullet Hell version of Destiny?[/H1]\n\nMechanically, it works great. You have a ship with a teeny tiny hitbox, same as most \"Eastern\" BHell games, you have anywhere between \"Mildly offensive\" and \"Absolutely terrifying\" levels of hostile fire coming toward you, and you pump out similarly scary levels of fire back, with your only choice generally being \"Do I spam the screen with lots of little beams or do I fire ONE BIG BEAM at something that needs cracking open like a walnut.\"\n\nIt has good Bullet Hell music, albeit not outstanding music, it has good graphics, albeit not outstanding graphics, you see a pattern here? If a game could ever nail what I'd define as the absolute essence of an \"8 out of 10\", this would be it. The problem is there's games out there such as Revolver360 Re:Actor that do -better-.\n\nThe problem is that for all the good it does, it's been beaten to it by other games, maybe not in every field, but in each area I can name at least two or three games that stand above it. The one area it does win out on is bang for the buck. It's kinda hard to argue with this kind of quality at this kind of price point. It's a very, very solid return on investment, particularly if you're a bullet hell fan.\n\n[H1]Closing Thoughts[/H1]\n\nDoes that make this a \"Do not buy\"? Far from it. If you're a fan of bullet hells, chances are you already own it. If you don't, eventually you should, but I'd genuinely suggest you look around first, there's a decent market now on Steam for this genre, and there's more innovative and interesting options around. If however you've already consumed them and you need a fix of something fairly solid and fairly entertaining, then sure, this works, it will scratch the itch quite nicely.\n\nVerdict : [b]Buy, definitely worth grabbing on a sale, if only to put in the \"To do\" list,[/b]",
      "Overall its a great hunting game. The base game is good enough on its own to give you an enjoyable experience hunting several varieties of animals. \n\nI feel that some of the best content is in the DLC's. I dont mind the price tag for maps are they are just a large and some of them have a truly diverse animal population. \n\nThe Weapon Packs have some items that really should have been available in the base game (.22 rifle).\nTripod stands, Tents and ATV's are also DLC items that i feel should have been included in the base game. \n\nThe cost for these packs are not huge, and I have bought them, but they really do impact your play in a meaningful way so it is hard not feel like they were left out on purpose. \n\nBeing a former hunter in real life I would say that the realism of it is pretty good. Lung shots and heart shots drop animals quickly and using the right ammo along with good aim greatly influences this. A poor shot will leave you tracking this wounded animal across the map till you sneak up on it again or just give up. \n\nThey have a system called Tru Racks (sumthn like that) that simulates different qualities of animals. So you end up with little bucks, average bucks, and monster bucks. Weight and coloration plays a part in this too. In short every animal has a trophy of some kind and they are varied by what must be some sort of RNG. \n\nAll that having been said, this game can devolve into a shooting gallery were you kill everything on sight as there in no real incentive not to. You get money and experience for every kill you claim and wiping out a heard of deer with your DLC M1 Garand on your DLC Tripod Stand becomes the quickest way to bypass the grind.\n\n It feels like the game starts as a \"hunting sim\" and becomes a \"poaching sim\" once you realize the progression system is going to take a long time to do...\"ethically?\".\n\n\nAgain, this is a game i would recommend, but it is just that, a game. \n\n",

      "The Witch's House has been my most favorite RPG Maker horror game for years and now I have the remaster which I can buy to directly support the developer. Needless to say how good it is so I will only talk about what is changed and what still remains.\nThe game is still suspenseful and very atmospheric. Some people may worry that the updated graphic and engine may take that away but trust me it is still there and not going anywhere.\nSome sound effects/dialogues have been changed beside the graphic which I am not against it at all. Still very like the remaster.\nThe control is still the same which is as clunky as before when you are not used to. I think the developers know that and decided to not change it so I won't complain. Just say it out for you to know because the game is very old so the control is still there in the past with many other RPG maker games.\nI very like the new graphic and I think they deserve much more compliments for this. However, I like the weird-big-eye Viola model and her less hair skinny portrait more. It look weird and funny at the same time. The new model makes her more beautiful but the portrait makes her kinda fat (at least to me).\nThe new hard mode is.... hard that all I can say without spoiler.\nI don't know whether or not I should calll this a remake but at least it is done better than DSR.

It's not as shiny as some other 4X games so if pretty graphics are what you prefer you may be disappointed.\n3. The game can be demanding even on high end PC's if you run really large galaxy.\n4. Unfriendly UI. If you run huge resolution you will have problems to read the text.\n5. The learning curve... you will spend hours getting into the game. But don't be afraid, huge automation can be set up to help you.\n6. No multiplayer. I don't mind it but maybe you do?\n\nThe Pros:\n\nEverything else. It's the most complex, never ending fun 4X game I have played. Just the way how the AI is done hooked me up. But to make it fair here are some picks for you.\n\n1. Huge amount of races that actually play in character. It's not like in other games where every AI plays the same way but has different stats. Here the AI behaves in the ways how they are described. They play in character like in RPG game.\n2. HUGE galaxies. Trust me you never saw something like this before in other 4x games. Each game can last for dozens of hours if you want.\n3. Set up your game to the last possible thing you can imagine. The start up set up is just incredible.\n4. Automation ... don't like research, or ship design, or diplomacy, or anything else you can imagine? You can automate it. You can focus only on the one thing you like the most!\n5. Pirates ... you can even play as one.\n6. Mods ... do you want 10 more races or to play Star trek 4x? ... You can have it. \n7. Micromanagement ... it can be endless.\n8. The complexity, you can spend hours in design tables that make sense in comparison to Moo3 for example.\n9. Battles, there is very few games that can simulate such large scale engagements over the whole galaxy.\n10. Play it your own way. You can win the game without any battle if you want. On the other side waging wars is FUN.\n\nDo you need to know more? Watch some videos on YouTube from Das24680. He has also full tutorials for those who would need them.\n\n*Update - I have added more Pros as this game deserves it and I have forgot to mention them.",
      "Horrible FOV, glitchy looking graphics, everything is blurred even with motion blur off, absolutely no chance of that multiplayer mod, shoddy PC port... Pretty boring and clunky tbh. Don't buy this.",
      "Absolutely amazing. PLEASE don't judge this game based on how it looks. You must try it yourself! I thought it would be terrible but a friend convinced me to try it, and I'm glad he did. I haven't had so much fun in a game in a long time.",

      "When reading reviews for this game you'll generally find two camps. There are people who find DW:U incredibly deep and engaging, and there are those who find it incredibly obtuse and frustrating. The problem is they're both right. The game does feature a wealth of features, and you will almost certainly never experience them.\n\nEven for a player like me who is used to impenetrable strategy games like Europa Universalis this was difficult to play. Income see-saws drunkenly from crippling deficit to fabulous surplus and back again depending on what's happening this exact second. Land combat units are jam packed into impossibly tiny UI bars. AI factions have reams of vague, undefined character traits. The encyclopedia technically gives information on everything but is so poorly organized and unsearchable as to verge on useless.\n\nWith time, practice, and a lot of time spent researching on independent websites you can have fun with this game. But for sixty dollars you shouldn't have to, and quite frankly, don't. Find yourself one of the many excellent 4Xs in the store and pass over this ambitious but ultimately flawed gem.",
      "This is the best Civilization up to this point, and the DLC just made it even better. I will grant that the with all the add ons it would feel a tad crowded to anyone who hadn't played it before, but you have a crazy amount of options. The game series tagline of \"one more turn\" could not be more applicable.\n\nYou can strive for one of several victories: diplomatic, cultural, technological or domination. Each has its unique challengers to overcome and create a lot of the fun of the game. They are also not necessarily mutually exclusive and after completing one victory, you can go for the others. Each AI opponent has their own personality, and are pretty predictable in how they behave. Any one who has started the game next to Neopoleon or Ghengis Kahn knows they immediately have to have a decent military to repel invasion, while Ghandi will to muscle you out with religion and culture.\n\nThere are some important changes between Civilization IV and V. One of the most notable is that wars are plausible again as you dont constantly lose health in enemy territory and cities are easier to conquer. Additionally, culture doesn't automatically take over neighbor's cities anymore. \n\nThis game is easily worth the money. I'm not entirely sure how it stacks up to Civilization VI, but any game that I log 200+ hours on over a period of years and still haven't come close to doing everything is doing something right. A great game from a great series.",

      "Alright. Reviewing a free to play game once again.\n\nThis is a game created by a game lover. RPG lover to be precise. \n\nIt's a very simple Action RPG. The whole game is quite straight forward with minimum amount of puzzle and Mazes. \n\nThere are a few secret chest that's a bit hard to find. \nBut generally it's a very relaxing and non-demanding game.\nThe game itself is very short, 3-4 hours worth but you can possible play longer if you want to.\n\nMusic is basic and okish with no voice acting. (small indie game after all).\n\nThe biggest + for this game are two:\n1. Wonderfully touching story with multiple ending.\n2. Interesting designed boss with 3 different difficulty. \n\nFor some challenge and extra intense action i recommend everyone to beat all 3 boss on hard difficulty.\nThe last one is very hard but just ignore the chaos and act quickly and decisively.\n\nOne extra hint/recommendation i have for everyone is go to keyboard setting and disable sticking key for the final boss.\n(so you have more percision on control when you move around. You want to click up key to move 1 up. To avoid holding up too long and move up 2 square.).\n\nfor Freebie... 9/10.\n\nIf it wasn't free to start i would pay 1-2 dollar for this game and rate is 7/10.",
      "My gambling addict friend said if I post a review on this game and it gets 150 likes and 25 Awards that he will buy me a case of beer. So I'm just gonna leave this here",
      "EDIT: I nominated this game for game of the year (2023)\n\nLong ago I had heard about this game and how detailed and intricate it could be, and how you could spend hours upon hours building the massive empire of dwarves only for it to all come crashing down in some spectacular but unforeseen way.  Then I got into Rimworld briefly and thought it was ok, but it tended toward chaos a bit too much for my liking.  THEN I heard this game was coming to steam and I eagerly awaited it.\n\nIt's not necessarily that I was too good to play a game with mostly ascii/character graphics (I used to play them a lot back in the 1980s).  I was more intimidated by the depth of the game and not knowing if there was a wiki for it (there is) or how I'd find help if I needed it (I'm sure there's a ton of communities JUST for this game).  I expected that when it came to Steam, it'd be beefed up and worth the wait.\n\nWell it finally arrived and I think I'm STILL a bit intimidated by the sheer amount of options you have... mostly because it's not just me that I have to worry about, but a whole community of dwarves.  In the case of something like minecraft, I could dig a whole intricate tunnel and if stuff starts to go bad, I just high-tail it out of there and recover until I can go back and finish it.  In Dwarf Fortress though, if stuff starts to go bad, you can't just leave.  You are encouraged to deal with the adversity and push onward in the name of greatness... or something.\n\nIn a way it's like role playing, except you don't have to roll character sheets and you don't really control any of the characters directly.  You make decisions about where to mine, what trees to chop down, what to build, what to trade, what to plant, and for every thing there is a season (turn turn turn).  You're forced to deal with death, birth, attacks, sickness, madness, and a ton of other things that I have no idea are coming.  \n\nI keep thinking \"I could do better\" and I start a new game, but then I start to realize that no matter what I do, I'm never gonna have a perfect game, or a game where everything goes exactly according to plan.  I am eventually going to have to buckle down and stick to one game save to see it through.\n\nIf you're like me and starting something new holds a lot more interest than continuing an existing project (ADHD?) you may have difficulty with this game.  At the same time you may become so engrossed in it that you lose track of time and suddenly it's 6am and you wonder why you stayed up all night digging holes.  I'm starting to feel a bit of the madness myself.  (it's almost 4:30am as I write this)\n\nIn any case, it's probably not for everyone, but I'd say if you're unsure, find the non-steam version and try that, and if you can grok what's going on and it interests you, definitely buy this and support the developers... OR buy this and try to stay under the 2 hour refund  limit while you learn the basics (Good luck with that, it'll be 6 hours before you know what happened).  I believe this game is worth the money though (full price).  If you were going to wait for a sale you'd be waiting a long time anyway.  \n\nTL;DR If this looks interesting to you, don't wait! Buy now.  If you aren't sure, do a bit of research and come back and buy it.",

      "Ok so... \n\nFar From Noise is a narrative game in which you play a woman stuck in its car, balancing on the edge of a cliff. \n\nIt's about life, death, nature, purpose, creativity, dreams, stars and badgers. \n\nThe thing about Far From Noise is that it'll ask you something very special, something that we all forget to do nowadays, something that I've forgotten. This game will ask you to take your time. Don't rush things. Sit down and relax as you'll be forced to follow the slow pace of the game, but you'll enjoy it, for sure.\n\nThis game is for you if you come home after a rough day at work. This game is for you if you're searching for a meaning, a purpose in your life. This game is for you if you just want to experiment something new.\n\nBecause Far From Noise is offering you something new. It gives a vibe that is between Firewatch and Life is Strange, but without all the forced action, stress, adrenaline those game wanted to give. Don't misunderstand me, I loved those 2 games, but Far From Noise chose a direction more... pure. It's just you and the nature that evolves around you.\n\nI've finished the game within 90 mins, but I heard they were several endings, so I might as well try to get some more (but the one I've got fully satisfied me, to be honest).\n\nBeing more pragmatic, the art and sound coincide perfectly. The visuals are gorgeous and the musics hit just right where it needs to. You'll be lifted by the compositions as you'll stare into the beautiful sunset, and the dark starry sky.\n\nYou may find it expensive, as the game costs 8$ for one hour and a half of experience, but hey, think about a cinema ticket. Far From Noise is cheaper and the experience you'll live in it is wayyyyy more unique than most of the movies you go see. \n\nI recommend it. Play it. It'll put your mind at ease.\n\n\n\nPS: the main character is one of the most well-written i've seen in video games.",

Let's compare w Mario Maker, the most similar game to this one:\n\n[edit: Updated to compare to SMM2 instead of 1]\nWhat Mario Maker 2 Does Better\n- Mario\n- Different themes/gameplay physics across multiple mario games\n- Much larger playerbase\n\nWhat Levelhead Does Better\n- Oh my god the search functionality\n    - Search by creator, difficulty, tags, what's popular, etc.\n    - TL;DR you can find the awesome, and avoid the crap\n- Level discovery\n    - Can actively advertise my levels\n    - Get rewarded for playing people's levels\n- $20\n- Dying doesn't take 12 years to respawn\n- Fun, short campaign to slowly unlock more creative tools after seeing how they are used\n- Local Co-op (or online with Parsec)\n- Leaderboards (if you care, I personally don't)\n\nI cannot stress enough how AMAZING it is to not have to suffer through crap levels. The search functionality is soooo good; as a casual player, it is the sole reason I stopped playing Mario Maker 1. Mario Maker 2 is better, but it still falls terribly short. I think the best part is that Levelhead gives people control over the visibility of their levels, as well as incentives to play other peoples, and that is something that SMM2 unfortunately lacks.",
      "[i]While the artwork and combat remain enjoyable, the story, writing, and pacing were a major letdown.[/i]  \n\n***\nMINOR SPOILERS BELOW. If you're going to play the game, play before reading.\n***\n\n[b]The mature storylines, hard-hitting decisions, beautiful worldbuilding, and tight writing that made the first two so immersive is not present in this game.[/b] (You'll notice immediately that the writing for the caravan in the capital is [i]particular[/i] trite, awkward to read, and uninteresting.)\n\nUnfortunately, it's not just the writing that's weak. [i]The pacing is off.[/i] Antecedents are confusing, characters you'd expect to speak don't, events that should have been foreshadowed come out of nowhere. More frustrating are the serious character continuity \"errors,\" and arcs that disappear, change, or go nowhere. [i]In short, the events, decisions, and conflict from the previous games do not appear or resolve in a way that was suggested by the previous two[/i].\n\n\nHere's one example. In Banner Saga 2, Fosolt is unexpectedly rescued by Bolverk. [i]\"I have a message for Alette from the dead varl king,\" [/i]he said. That's pretty intriuging! Maybe there's a mystery, an oracle, an item, or just cool information about the Varl and their strange king? Maybe there'll finally be context about the bridge decision!\n\n[i]No! He has nothing interesting to say or add, and then his storyline just gets dropped and forgotten.[/i]\n\nWell, Bolverk's been possessed by Bellower! Gosh, who knows what Bellower will say? In fact, I can't wait to find out what happens to Bellower's body! \n\nWell, actually, Bolver's [i]not[/i] possessed, not really, certainly not like it was implied last game, and Bellower's body -- [i]a primary focus of the first two games[/i] -- isn't mentioned [i]once[/i]\n\nOr how about how they casually mention that Eyvyn is not only the [i]head[/i] of the Valka order, but also that he's had periodic bursts of hereditary madness all along? That's... odd. And it's not presented as an well-thought out [i]reveal[/i] or anything. It's presented matter-of-factly, like they were trying to ret-con in a less interesting story, or were tone deaf.\n\nYou'll notice that all the characters are underutilized and have unfulfilled storylines/tensions. Hakon has hard choices to make; Canary's a little crazy; Yrsa is mysterious; Gil's in love with Alette, etc. Will these build into choices? Reveals? Dependent endings based on choices? Will there be discussions referencing the past? Reflections on travels? Hints of despair?\n\nNo. In mine, Gil was [i]murdered[/i] and no one even bothered to reference it. Canary's situation never comes to a head. You never have to choose between Varls and Humans. Murdering people doesn't make people threaten to leave. Ubin returns randomly as an uber Varl and he's... learned the horseborne's language? Travelled the southlands? In like, a month? In a way that doesn't advance the plot? It's just... weakly done.\n\n\nThere are [i]so many[/i] examples like this, where the stories don't quite fit correctly, where what you picked up on in the early games about the [i]mysteries[/i] and the [i]world[/i] and what made it a [i]vibrant[/i] place were forgotten about by the writers. [b]The result is that it the game plays out in unsatisfying ways, in tenseless scenarios made vapid by watered-down morality, an inability to leverage the situation in fun ways, and low-quality writing, paucity of choice-making, a lack of exploration, lack of plot twists, simplified overworld mechanics -- all culminating in an almost staggeringly one-dimensional and shallow ending.[/b]\n\nThe Banner Saga series was always an experience that was greater than the sum of its part. An [i]experience[/i]. Of being [i]riveted[/i] to the computer, checking the map, worrying over supplies, guessing at mysteries, having my breath taken away at each hill. Unfortunately, that's not the case in this game. \n\n\nGameplay-wise, it's also a bit of a letdown. Combat is fun-ish, but you can make invincible character combinations and the mechanics don't even try to deal with this. There's an interesting new reinforcement mechanic that's not used heavily, and never pushes you like you think the end of the world would. You never really have to split up your forces. There's no novelty. Like maybe using a hero in a battle makes them fatigued, so you have to switch them up? Maybe you can station them different places, making them unusable for combat? Maybe you need to choose eight for a secret mission caravan? Maybe dream sequences? No, nothing like that. \n\nThe overworld gameplay had some changes that never really felt significant. Moreover, quite a bit felt taken away. You can't rest, do training missions, no longer weigh food vs upgrades. One example of all thise tone deafness was Iver's march through the destroyed world was consistently at \"Great Morale!\"\n\nThere didn't seem to be many flavor choices (\"Do we hang the criminals or let them join us?\"), including much less on social themes (\"Should women fight, if it disturbs the traditionally-minded men?\" \"One clan's rowdy, what do we do?\" \"They threaten to leave if so and so isn't banished\"), and less delayed results and fewer significant decisions, including among the game's built-up tensions among the factions. \n\n\nThere's also some cases of development [i]feeling[/i] cheap. Remember opening Banner Saga 2, and feeling that it was [i]fresh[/i], and [i]upgraded[/i]? There's little to make you feel that way here. The artwork is okay, but the environments feel more generic, with less variety, and the surreal landscapes in the darkness aren't especially interesting to look at for long periods of time. Iver is voiced by Bolverk's voice actor, and they sound exactly the same. The new title system is a fun idea, but is visually integrated into the game's menu system with the finesse of a cheap mod. \n\nThere's a moment in the game where the screen goes black for scrolling text and voiceover narration explaining the upcoming mechanic. Um, a character can't explain that? It was similar how the many two second animations are used, not to supplement the story, but to [i]replace[/i] written portions, making you feel unsure about what's going on. And finally, the game's pretty short, without fun combat challenges or interesting newgame+ challenges. \n\n\nWhat's [i]particularly[/i] frustrating is that the game's release date was moved forward four months. I don't know the story why, but I do know that a few more months of polish and story embellishment might have delivered the beautiful, grippingly interactive story we were hoping for. Because this is a watered down version of the previous two in just about every way.\n\nThis negative review is for whatever processes lead to this mediocre finale.\n\n---\n\n[i]Here's a plot that would have made more sense. Zephyr arrives and speaks to you secretly. There's a god that's still alive! Neat, now we'll finally get more story on that. Yay, fun caravan mode, now we need to take longships somewhere interesting!\n\nBut uh-oh! There's a Sundr villain going there as well, with an army of dredge! But at least now we'll finally get more story about the Sundr! \n\nThe god reveals something interesting, talks about Juno, the sun, gives a means to protect the city and help Iver. But when you return to the city, now the king and rugga and the factions have devolved into fighting based on your choices. How are you going to handle this? Which of many possibilities will ascend to the throne? How will you defend the city? And what mystery lies beneath the mountain of the city...\n\nFor Iver's caravan, there should be pockets of dredge villages kept alive by Spellsingers. Now you need to decide to plunder them or not! More stuff to do! Maybe go to the remains of the Varl capital first? Fight warped Valka? Realize deceptions, machinations, corruption, hear stories? Find new characters, have old ones die?\n\nInstead there... wasn't a plot?[/i]",

      "[h1]Dishonored 2.[/h1]\n[i]If old Samuel could see me now...[/i]\n\n[b][u]Introduction[/u][/b]\nAt its core, Dishonored 2 is little more than a mechanically and narratively contiguous continuation of the Dishonored formula. This isn't a bad thing - the first Dishonored was one of the best stealth-action games of all time - but innovation is too often overlooked in the games industry. DH2 does bring some nuance to the franchise, but new drawbacks are packaged in as well. Put plainly, Dishonored 2 is a game I adore just as much as the original, but there are aspects that certainly left me wishing for better.\n\n[b][u]Plot[/u][/b]\nThe game begins 15 years following Empress Jessamine's assassination, and her daughter, Empress Emily Kaldwin, has ruled the isles since that time. Her father and Lord Protector, Corvo Attano, advises and keeps close watch over her at court. Quickly after Dishonored 2's opening however, the Duke of Serkonos, Luca Abele, comes to Emily's royal tower - bearing a gift. He brings Emily's supposed long lost aunt, Delilah Kaldwin, who then immediately stages a coup in a bid to take the throne. She is successful, and you must escape the city of Dunwall as either Emily or Corvo (more on that later). You then travel to Karnaca, the capital of Serkonos, where you begin a personal crusade to [i]take back what's yours.[/i]\n\n[b][u]Technical Revamp[/u][/b]\nShifting focus for a look at DH2's presentation, the game is gorgeous. There's a hint of the old, comic-book-like aesthetic that was present in the original game, but the graphical fidelity has been greatly improved in this sequel. The textures, lighting, animations, visual effects, and environments are all elegantly rendered. It's easily one of the most beautiful games of 2016. As for the audio; sound effects and voices are realistic, and the OST is as iconic, if not more so than the first game's. Although, when it comes to performance, Dishonored 2 clearly falters. DH2 was a technical mess on launch, and while it runs decently now; some bugs, stutters, and crashes still persist. Overall the presentation is good, but the performance is surely sub-par.\n\n[b][u]Setting & Exploration[/u][/b]\nAs stated earlier, Dishonored 2 is set in Serkonos's city of Karnaca; known as The Jewel of the South. Gone are the dark grays and subdued browns of Dunwall, as Karnaca replaces them with bright, pastel blues and yellows. The metropolis has distinct cultural differences from Dunwall as well, whether it's the widespread use of wind-power over whale oil, or Karnaca's reliance on silver mining to employ its working class. In terms of level design, DH2's stages are much more expansive than anything seen in the first game too. There's lots to explore in every district of Karnaca, especially when verticality and hidden locations are taken into account. There's several routes toward all objectives as well; emphasizing Arkane's \"play your way\" motto. All considered, Dishonored 2's game world is exceedingly well-built.\n\n[b][u]Depth in the Details[/u][/b]\nOne of the most effective ways DH2 differentiates itself from its predecessors is through what I'd call 'structural gimmicks.' To break up the standard pacing, a couple of the game's missions have special set-pieces which can completely turn gameplay convention on its head. An example of this is the 'Clockwork Mansion' on the fourth level. This inventor's home has levers in essentially every chamber that reconfigures a room's layout - such as turning a trophy room into a grand hall. These levers can be used to access new areas or evade enemies, and even reveal traversable spaces behind the walls. It's this degree of imaginative design depth that distinguishes Dishonored 2 from most other games in its genre.\n\n[b][u]Stealth & Combat[/u][/b]\nMoving over to the core gameplay loop, not much has changed from the first game. The stealth and combat are still just as exquisitely implemented as before, with only a couple of refinements. The deviations that come to mind are that drop-assassinations can now be used non-lethally as drop-knockouts, and assassination animations are a much more brutal (but cathartic) spectacle to watch than before. Dishonored 2's central mechanics are near flawless to be sure, but this sequel suffers by adding few new gameplay elements to the mix. Except - well - there is one big feature I've neglected to elaborate on as of yet.\n\n[b][u]Emily [i]or[/i] Corvo[/u][/b]\nIn Dishonored 2, you can play as either Emily Kaldwin, [i]or[/i] Corvo Attano. When Delilah first takes the throne you get a moment to choose one or the other, after which the character you don't pick is turned into a cold, stone statue. Both Emily and Corvo have separate voice actors and personalities, but they share the same goal throughout the game's duration: to save the last of their family, and reclaim the throne for the true Kaldwin heiress. After receiving the mark of The Outsider, Emily and Corvo have different magical abilities too. Where Corvo has blink, Emily has far reach; or where Corvo can stop time, Emily can chain together the lives of her enemies, and kill or incapacitate several people at once. All in all, the decision to allow the player to progress the campaign as either Emily or Corvo was a stroke of brilliance in my estimation.\n\n[b][u]Main Story[/u][/b]\nReturning to the main story - it's another point of criticism for me. There are some magnificent aspects; such as the nostalgic callbacks to events in the first Dishonored or reappearances of some of the original game's best characters, but all considered most of the writing is retreading a beaten path. Just as in Dishonored 1, the game flows from mission to mission where the chief objective is simply to eliminate a key player obstructing your path to the throne. This is perfectly fine from a gameplay perspective, but it can lead to a bit of déjà vu from a narrative outlook. Dishonored 2's writing quality isn't poor, but it doesn't distance itself from the comfortable story-staging of its predecessor, making it feel slightly lazy.\n\n[b][u]A Reactive World[/u][/b]\nOn the other side of the same coin, the narrative reactivity of Dishonored 2's world to your choices is truly admirable. Playing DH2 in high chaos; where you murder many people throughout the game, results in huge environmental storytelling changes compared to low chaos. Here's an example. If you flood the streets of Karnaca red with blood, subsequent levels show you've harmed the city's inhabitants before you even arrive. Citizens’ moods and perceptions will have soured as they become depressed or monstrous in the wake of their crumbling city - causing suicides and murders to spike throughout Karnaca. And corpses bring bloodflies, which further tarnishes The Jewel of the South in a vicious cycle. You can, of course, avoid all this... by showing a whole lot of care in your actions toward others.\n\n[b][u]Conclusion[/u][/b]\nWhen all is said and done, the Dishonored formula is a fantastic one that it's hard to not have fun with. Karnaca is riddled with environmental detail, the stealth mechanics are flawless, combat is devilishly enjoyable, and the game judges you intelligently on your choices. The Dishonored IP is incredibly strong... The tweaks provided are appreciable; I just wish DH2 had made a concerted effort to make it even stronger. But, god-dammit, I enjoyed Dishonored 2 way too much over it's 20+ hour campaign to critique it any longer. Get the game and play it - despite all my pissy complaints, you won't be disappointed.\n\n[h1]Personal Rating: 9/10 - Absolutely Outstanding[/h1]",
      "This game is far away in another galaxy from being anything but a 3/10 in my book. \nGame consists of a tack on level system with a few skills, corny jokes that make you cringe, copy paste worlds with sliding on ice, mud, or leaves depending on the world your on with vines to climb certain walls again....depending on the world your on, no dismemberment except on animals and main characters. Further all planets feel the same and after quite a few hours in the game I struggle to continue playing because of the cut and dry gameplay to where you will fight a couple animals, do some very linear parkour, then do a puzzle that will most likely include a sphere that you need to put into said location to unlock a door as such. graphics are eh..and I have to say the battlefront 2 campaign had more thought than this garbage. save your money and don't buy this",
      "[b][i]AMID EVIL[/i] is very much [i]Quake[/i] 1 level design in a [i]Hexen[/i]/[i]Heretic[/i] universe.[/b] It's well done. We're a bit spoiled this year with outstanding '90s FPS shooters. Personally, I prefer both [i]Ion Maiden[/i] and [i]DUSK[/i] over this title for the following reasons:\n\n1) I find [i]AMID EVIL[/i] to be a bit generic in terms of theme; the fantasy setting could use a bit more to set it apart.\n\n2) I prefer real or low fantasy weapons/guns over wands and totally high fantasy weapons. Now, don't get it twisted - I appreciate that these high fantasy weapons exist, but yeah, they leave something to be desired. I miss reloading and all of that. \n\n3) The level design in [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is much more 'sprawling' (for lack of a better term) just like the original [i]Quake[/i]. Most levels are indoors in what feels like an underground compound (at the time of writing this review). I personally like the backwoods feel of [i]DUSK[/i], or the dystopian cityscape of [i]Ion Maiden[/i] far more. I want to look up at the sky in most levels.\n\n4) The enemy design is different than the other two games I mention, which is good - but they all mostly have a 'same' kind of feel. The enemies are all super fast, so most of your efforts are focused on running backwards while fending them off. It's fun, but gunplay isn't quite as fun as the other two games for this particular reason.\n\n5) The font and overall menu system definitely feels 'Early Access'. I know the font is being worked on, which is desperately needed. \n\n6) My favorite way to play the game is Endless mode - and I feel like that's a flaw in itself. It's the opposite for me with [i]DUSK[/i]. I want to fall in love with the campaign, but eh, there isn't really any story or anything all that interesting to suck me in. The secrets are super easy to find compared to the other two games, too.\n\n7) No multiplayer. Now, I really don't care about this - but who designs a game in this genre without building this in from the ground up? You know the community is going to whine about this. Questionable design decision to say the least.\n\n[b]Well, it sounds like I just dumped all over the game.[/b] Please don't get me wrong. [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is a welcome addition to the genre. The *great news* is that this is not just some reskin of [i]DUSK[/i] - it certainly is it's own thing. And that's really important. \n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+Fairly polished game for Early Access\n+It's the most modern version of the original [i]Quake[/i] we've seen this year\n+Well optimized\n+Lots of content right now\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-The universe is generic\n-No multiplayer\n-The font is too hard to read\n-Music is nothing to write home about\n-The secrets are easy, and there really aren't all that many of them\n-Weapons could use more 'oomph' to them; also we should be able to use the special ability when we want to as opposed to it autotriggering\n\n[b]I was psyched out of my mind for [i]AMID EVIL[/i] - and while it is certainly good - I think I'll be focused more on [i]DUSK[/i] and [i]Ion Maiden[/i].[/b] Because, let's face it, gaming time is valuable and we can't play everything.",
      "A criminally underrated game, I have seldom seen a developer take their original hit which was already almost perfect, and actually manage to improve on it in every way shape and form. You do not need to have played the original to play or enjoy this game. Their stories are completely seperate.\n\nThe game itself is much less linear than its predecessor. The best way I can explain the feeling of going through the environments without referencing Grimrock itself is by saying it felt an awful lot like Myst to me, just with combat. Required puzzles for progression were challenging but not impossible, some of the secret challenges were much more difficult. I admit I used an online guide more than a few times, but it did nothing to diminish my enjoyment of the game. It is immersive, challenging, and satisfying. \n\nThe only drawback I can think of is the difficulty. It feels like you cannot win with any group composition, I suggest no more than 2 of any class or weapon/armor type user. I went with a warrior, two rogues(one range), and a mage, this way you as well makes you unlikely to complete a difficult fight or puzzle and be rewarded with something you cannot use. Combat itself can be challenging as I said, but you will rarely feel like you are simply incapable of winning. There are obvious ways to optimize the way you approach an encounter the second time if you die the first.\n\nBe prepared to immerse yourself, you must pay attention to your surroundings, read and remember notes you find, explore every nook and cranny you can find, and you will be rewarded. Good luck!\n",

      "Is Duskers a fun game? Yes. Would I recommend it? No, because of one simple reason:\n\nA lack of content with no mod support.\n\nDuskers is a little like No Man's Sky in the sense that the first few hours are filled with fun and wonder, but everything afterwards becomes a disappointment because the game turns out to be far more shallow than it initially seemed. As a player, I yearned to explore more of the randomly generated galaxy in Duskers because I wanted to see what other horrors, mods, and derelict types I would encounter in the empty universe - but in the end, it turned out that there was really very little else to see besides what you find in the first couple of hours. \n\nHere's a quick rundown of where the content was most lacking:\n\n--Enemy types: there's only 4 different enemies. FOUR. They also behave pretty much identically with the exception of the last one.  This was definitely the biggest interest-killer for me. \n\n--Derelict types end up mattering very little. Government A? Salvage C? Military B? It really doesn't change the layout in a particularly noticeable fashion, with the only differences being 1-2 extra ship defense turrets or something like that. \n\nI really, really wanted to give Duskers a thumbs up - I loved the aesthetic, I loved the atmosphere, and I loved the unique command line interface - but unfortunately, after a few hours, I came to realize that there's really just not enough actual content here, and that's heartbreaking for fans of this niche genre like myself.\n\n",

This game needs another 6 months in EA.",
      "\"The good things, the happy things, all of it changes. Nothing can stay the same forever. Still...can you find it in your heart to still love this place?\" (paraphrase)\n\nClannad . . .\n\nOH Clannad . . .\n\nI remember watching the anime in high school, and absolutely falling in love with it. Upon realizing the REAL story was told in a visual novel...I HAD to get my hands on it. I almost died of a joy-induced heart attack when a legitimate English version of the game was released on Steam.\n\nThis game bro. This f***** game. When I was a senior in high school back in the day, this game was my refuge. I was mostly friends with older kids back then, so by the time I was a senior I didn't really have anybody to chill with cuz all my friends already graduated. Its kinda hard for me to make new friends, then and now if I'm being honest. I related to Nagisa a lot for that reason. \n\nI mostly related to Tomoya and Sunohara tho. One of my best friends growing up really reminded me of Sunohara no cap lol. Type of dude who was the comic relief/brunt of everyone's s*** talking but w/ a mutual understanding its done in jest and love. And when things ever got serious we always had each others' backs, and even tho he's a goofball and kind of a meme, he's seriously loyal and a true ride or die.\n\nMany times when Tomoya was expressing himself in this game, I had to almost pinch my face and remind myself I'm not the one thinking these thoughts: I'm playing a VN lol. That's how much I seriously related to Tomoya. In so many aspects and ways that would make my review even longer than it is now if I were to attempt to explain why I relate to Tomoya so much. Yeah, sure that could just be shrewd character design from Maeda Jun's part, but it was almost uncanny how many of the things Tomoya went thru when he was younger/issues with his father/intimacy issues he develops later on in adulthood etc. almost perfectly mirrored what I was struggling with irl. It gave me something to relate to. It expressed emotions I was having trouble even admitting were present in my own self. Maybe that's the real reason I love Clannad so much, and maybe because of that I sit here biased with rose-colored nostalgia goggles. But even if I type this review with a tinge of rose-coloring obstructing my critical eyes, I can say with confidence that Clannad is more than a game. More than an anime. \n\nClannad is an experience. An experience I wish I could forget all about...just so I could experience it anew all over again. Whether you experience Clannad thru the anime, VN, movie, whatever...Clannad is an experience in a league of its own in my book. And the best way to have your Clannad experience is by playing this masterpiece of a Visual Novel. Hands down. \n\nHonestly, I'd ideally have all Clannad virgins go straight to the VN and play it to completion but that's just not a realistic request as this game takes the average player 80+ hours to complete just the main story apart from optional achievements haha. If you're a fan of the anime...why haven't you played the VN yet!? Lol. If you've never seen the anime or movie I'd STILL recommend playing this game. Just keep in mind to use a guide (just trust me on that. please) and be willing for it to be a bit boring at first. If you stick with it, believe me...it's not gonna stay boring for long.\n\nIf you liked the anime but hated the anime ending, PLAY THE VN. No spoilers, but trust me when I say the VN ending is the true conclusion of the Clannad experience. You'll find out what I mean if you stick with the VISUAL NOVEL to the end.\n\nI didn't go to my senior prom. I spent it playing this game. And I don't regret that decision one bit to this day. I experienced this game, standing in similar shoes as Tomoya at that time irl: rebellious kid about to graduate high school with no real goals or aspirations, struggling to find it hard to \"love this place\" or truly find something passionate to live for. I didn't want to go to college. There was nothing I wanted to do there. Most of the people in my grade back then thought I was quiet and lonely freshman-sophomore, then bad news junior-senior when I started acting out. I was just, lost. \n\nExperiencing Clannad helped me find what I was truly passionate about in life. Family. Friendship (as corny as that may sound). Being able to step up for what only YOU can protect when life is calling you to maturity.\n\nClannad helped me see that even though things can get dark... even though tragedies will happen regardless of our efforts to keep them from happening... even though things can never, and will never, ever stay the same in this life...and even if you lose your way eventually... and sadly reach such a lost and depressed state in life, that you mistakenly conclude for a short while you'd rather sever all your connections and ties with the world and everybody in it... in an effort to try to prevent experiencing even more pain... \n\nThat \"loving this place,\" loving this world, loving people, and forming deep, lifelong and lasting connections with this world and its people, NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS, is ALWAYS, ALWAYS, worth it in the end. Especially when it matters the most.\n\nNow I'm not gonna front: Clannad isn't for everybody. Some people just can't get into the moe art style. Some people may find it a bit too melodramatic at times. Some people may find some of the comedy or bits of the story weird, or just not their cup of tea. Some people may find it hard to relate to all of the characters, and for some people it won't have a Cindarella's slipper level of relatability like it did for me. For those people who are kinda feelin \"ehh idk if i'll really like this game\" I'd say it'd be smart to watch the anime first. But if you're feeling good about it and wanna experience Clannad the BEST way: cop this VN. Just wait for the good bits to slowly boil. Patience is a virtue :) And save yourself hours of rage by using a guide from the beginning until the after-story credits roll. With Clannad I'd say its almost always recommended to use a guide.\n\nAnd if you love the anime and haven't played the VN... you're weirdo number 1, 2, 3, 4 and even 5. Haha I'm playin but srsly get the VN already you owe it to yourself to experience the VN. Knowing what happens in the story and getting some events \"spoiled\" doesn't detract from the VN experience. That I promise you. As someone who watched the anime before playing the VN, who's now such an obvious fanboy of the Clannad VN as demonstrated by my wall of text of a review (lol), trust me: I'd bet money you'll love this game just as much as I do.  \n\nTo Maeda Jun, and all of the brilliant writers of this quintessential, modern classic of a story: thank you. Thank you for gifting all of us the experience that is Clannad. Because of your labours, you've helped a wayward knucklehead like me finally be able to declare this in spirit and in truth:\n\n\"I love this place.\"\n\nLong live Kazamatsuri!",

      "I have a hard time recommending this game because even though I liked it, I know it's the kind of thing that can only appeal to a very small demographic :/ Anyway, I believe small devs who try weird things deserve all the exposure they can get, so here's a review. This is the second episode of a series (the first one can be found [url=https://etherane.itch.io/hello-charlotte-ep1]here[/url] - it's free - and the last one is [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/760890/Hello_Charlotte_Childhoods_End/]on Steam[/url]). It's recommended to play them in order unless you don't want to understand anything in a story that's already pretty confusing in itself.\n\n+ Very original visuals. The artwork is mostly composed of cute characters, but there are writhing masses of eyes and flesh everywhere (guro fans rejoice). Areas are arranged into colorful, geometrical patterns similar to Mondrian's paintings.\n\n+ The setting is extremely strange. It's definitely dystopian, but it can go from completely silly to incredibly tragic in a matter of seconds.\n\n+ Production values increase with each episode. I wasn't very impressed with the first game (apart from its artwork, which I loved, and its ending, which... opened interesting possibilities), but starting from this one the writing gets way better, the characters are more developed, and the gameplay feels more focused.\n\n+ - Hello Charlotte is more or less Trigger Warning Land. This series is among the most disturbing things I have ever played, and it's not because of the omipresent gore (most of it being used for aesthetics or comedy instead of shock value). It deals with heavy themes (mental illness, social pressure, bullying, suicide, the value of life and death - from what I could gather, a lot of these come from the author's personal experience) and it felt so suffocating sometimes I had to play in short bursts to give me time to recover. I note this as both a positive and a negative, since I consider games that can make me uncomfortable are valuable - but don't play this if you're not sure you can handle it.\n\n- The gameplay mostly consists of going back and forth to the same locations, and can sometimes feel tedious. Sadly I don't really think this can be improved unless the game is changed into a full visual novel, but it would mean losing the environments.\n\n8/10 It's a weird game made for weird people.",
      "The good news is the driving physics, fuel and tire mechanics, and multiplayer design are the best the series has ever been. However, the overall package, performance, and presentation are significantly lacking in this game at launch. Unless you're desperate, hold off on purchasing this game until the developers have had time to put in additional content and fix the numerous bugs and the odd design choices they've made that I think may need to be changed. There's a lot of work that needs to be done on this game for it to be considered a complete racing game.\n \nThe performance on an 8700K+RTX4070 has been inconsistent at 1440p. While playing with frame rate unlocked at a mix of ultra and high settings I can get FPS into the high 80s but this is accompanied by regular drops of about 20 FPS so I felt it required the 60 FPS lock setting which was a bit disappointing. The other disappointment comes in how the game looks, which frankly is not visually pleasing even at the highest possible settings and generally just not a sharp enough picture no matter what you adjust.\n\nSo overall it’s a bit of a mixed bag. The racing itself is engaging and fun but the choices the developers have made with this game for presentation and functionality leave much to be desired. If it receives good post-launch support it may correct a lot of those issues but at launch it’s a bit disappointing and I do not recommend buying it.",

      "Ratchet & Clank is always fun. The older games are clearly better, as it feels like the more modern they get, the shallower and simpler they become. They now feel almost like a demo of a game - you just get to dip your toe into each of the systems, never really fully engaging with any of them. New abilities are just thrown at you with no fanfare, and then you only need them 3 times, and it never asks you to combine them in new ways. Everything feels underwhelming and tossed aside shortly after being introduced. That's almost the theme of the game - they even have Ratchet meeting a fellow Lombax for the first time ever, the thing he has been focused on since game 1, and it's pretty much just \"hi, let's go do the next thing.\" The series has been casualized, just as neutered as their formerly innuendo-laden titles. \n\nBut it's still fun to play, it's just lacking the magic it used to have.",
      "I have never cried so damn much at a game",
      "Play this game in roguelike mode (no extra lives) as that seems to be how it was designed. By letting objects of the same type touch each other you will be able to deal damage to or destroy them all with one move! Attacking enemies will damage you back so you have to use potions that also drop down to heal.\n\nI see some of the reviews here saying this game sucks and it's all randomness. It's a roguelike though, so there is a good deal of randomness but the fun comes from gaining skill with the mechanics and making the right decisions. If you can carve out lone pieces and allow a bunch of the same object to get into a big cluster, popping that huge chain is super satisfying. \n\nThe game was very intimidating at first and I would die in the first 2 stages over and over, but I eventually got the hang of things and beat the game for the first time pretty quickly. This game requires patience to get a hang of the mechanics but once you do it's a fun little time waster to open up every once in a while. There are lots of characters to unlock too and they all bring their own strategies to the table.",

With a world filled with charming characters, vicious foes, and bakers that use wood as an ingredient, you will fight in turn-based combat utilizing a complex equipment and skill system to fend for yourself. Chained Echoes also features a customizable airship, tons of items to loot and craft, a 30-40 hour playtime, no random encounters, and a fantastic soundtrack inspired by the PSX era. Will you be able to bring peace to Valandis?\n\nHonestly, I absolutely love this game. The 16-bit style graphics, the attention to small little details, the woven in humor, and the combat mechanics all shine bright here. The combat doesn't feel sluggish and I actually felt a desire to talk to the NPCs sprinkled across the world, which is not a normal feeling for me. I also liked that, if I started a conversation with a NPC, I could still walk away. I wasn't forced to hear everything that they needed to say. Overall, as a game, I can't recommend this one enough!\n\n\n[h1]Steam Deck Performance:[/h1]\n\n\nYeah it runs near perfectly here. Without any changes, you can keep 60 FPS with 6.5 - 7 hours of battery on a full charge. It may not come as a surprise based on the game's graphical quality, but it is still wonderful.\n\nI did encounter a couple stutters here and there, which stalled the game for a solid 1 second, but that was it. This tended to happen on the first attack in combat or entering into a new place, but it wasn't consistent or enough to stop me from enjoying the game.\n\nChained Echoes brings back a lot of memories when playing it. Not because it is something I played before, but because it reminds me of the good times I had with older JRPGs. Chrono Trigger is a big one that I loved from the SNES era and this game gave me those same feelings I had playing back in the day. On top of that, the game performs beautifully on the Deck without any setting changes. I am happy to say it gets our Best on Deck rating! If you enjoy the SNES JRPG era, this is an easy must-buy.\n\n\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th] [url=https://steamdeckhq.com/]SDHQ[/url] is a website made for curating Steam Deck news, guides, and providing optimization/builds for games on the Deck.\n[/th][/tr][/table]",
      "When I originally watched the anime, I heard a number of comments to the effect of 'this was kind of a bad adaptation, the visual novel is a lot more complete' Having completed it, I'm now of the opinion that both the show and the VN are a complete mess.\n\nSpoilers!\n\nGranted, I know WHY zero exists, it makes sense. The ending of the original VN and show needed justification, in some sense they are a great, unearned leap forward. A different Okabe had to go through a lot of character development, growth and maturing to become the person who could create the plan that would lead them all to the world line where no one suffers, that would let the original Okabe deceive the world, change the future without changing established details of the past.\n\nTo that end, SG0 aims to show that growth, to show the necessary suffering of the world, of his friends, of himself that allowed for him to become the person that could reach that future, that could make the right choice.\n\nAt its core, there's a meaningful message about generational suffering, about the meaning of history, about (stepping out of the fictional paradigm of world lines and time travel) how all of the past is needed to create a better future. Daru and other characters help Okarin realize this truth, that the world lines where they've suffered aren't wasted time, doomed worlds, that they were necessary steps toward reaching a better future.\n\nThat's all really great, honestly, so why do I so dislike SG0?\n\nWell, about 5% of the show and VN is about these themes, is about the necessity of growth, about accepting yourself, about the character development that's needed for Okabe. The conflicts are there, they're established, it's all set up, but then what does SG0 do with most of its time? \n\nFunctionally, nothing, it's full of dumb filler, harem tropes, and undeveloped characters that still get a lot of time spent on them. I'm talking about you, Kagari!\n\nThe original VN and show are, at first, a slow-burn mystery with rising tension as SERN closes in and chuunibyou fantasy becomes nightmarish reality. It becomes thrillingly-paced while simultaneously reflective and philosophical about its themes and the events that have unfolded, about the dangers of time travel, about the problems with altering established reality to suit one's whims. Okarin eventually undoes most of his meddling in time, and his final goal is NOT to change the past, but to trick the world that a better future might be made possible, that no one be a slave to fate.\n\nWhat the fuck is SG0 by comparison? It's such a monumental, frustrating mess.\n\nThe conflicts in the beginning are Okarin having PTSD about Kurisu and time travel, Suzuha being angry at him for giving up, Maho and Leskenin bringing Kurisu back into his life through Amadeus, Okarin's communicating with [Kurisu] being kept a secret, Maho's wanting to know more about what Okabe knows about Kurisu, about his time-traveling past. New world line shifts giving Okarin glimpses into horrific potential realities and reminding him that he can't run from his fears forever.\n\nSo much good setup! All the right themes are here! \n\nNaturally, you want these conflicts to lead to confrontations between the involved characters that force them to make hard choices, move the plot forward, and naturally lead to the resolution that we see by the end, with Mayuri going back to slap Okarin, with him rescuing Mayuri and Suzuha from the wastes of the past, with everything linking back up with the ending. \n\nYou want these conflicts to perfectly accentuate the primary themes and purpose of this show, to organically prod at the viewer's mind.\n\n(The VN even has some good ideas to this end, like perspective shifts away from Okabe to other characters. Honestly, great idea. Not even remotely used to the extent it needed to be to help SG0 accomplish its goals, though.)\n\nNone of this actually happens though.\n\nIf I'm giving a generous reading, I'll grant the following interpretation: Kagari is a sort of victim of Okarin's inaction, a living example of his failures. That's what she could be. What is she in practice, though? She's melodramatic and unnecessary. She adds more artificial conflict to the plot that isn't needed. \n\nWe have all the conflicts we need already, we don't need 'Amnesiac girl needs help recovering her time traveling memories, reuniting with Suzuha only to realize that, really, she was brainwashed and is going to kill them all' What the fuck does any of this serve?\n\nIn practice, a lot of these initial conflicts are set on the backburner, or bluntly resolved with little fanfare or zero meaningful thematic movement. Remember, the conflicts I listed as starting SG0 off are really all the show needs to propel its characters forward thematically and narratively toward the end. \n\nYet, we end up chasing Kagari's memories, reuniting her with Mayuri, dressing her up, having her faint, having people try to kidnap her, guarding her. None of it meaningfully moves us closer to the goal than we would've otherwise been had she not existed.\n\nOther themes are left on the table somewhat half-baked. Amadeus and Salieri obviously references the semi-historical fiction of Amadeus Mozart and Salieri's rivalry, well-known for the movie based on their relationship. \n\nMaho feels like the Salieri to the Mozart genius of Kurisu. So, that's a setup for some arc of finding value in yourself, believing in your ability to rise to the occasion, not framing yourself as only being worthy in light of others' accomplishments, etc etc. But, neither the VN nor the show really give these ideas full thematic completion, even if Maho vaguely mumbles to herself about her feelings of inferiority.\n\nThink about how the slow-burn of the original S;G, all the choices the characters make, the themes and ideas naturally flow into the second half, with everything that's happened having meaningful connections to the first half, everything making sense as a coherent whole.\n\nSG0 lacks this coherency completely. It has all its good ideas on the table, ready to play out through character choices and interactions, leading to conflicts, leading to choices, leading to climax, leading to natural resolution. \n\nInstead, it gets bogged down in artificial conflict, fan service, and dumb tropes until the end sort of just arrives, Okarin just kind of up and realizing what he needs to do without much character development having happened at all.\n\nYou'd get the complete experience just playing (or watching the equivalent episodes) the 1st hour of the game, then skipping to the ruined city chapter where he time leaps 2,000 times back to the past, gets punched by Suzuha, seeing Hououin Kyouma reawaken, and then seeing the ending play out. \n\nBasically, watch the very beginning, then watch the very end. Everything else is a complete waste of time.\n\nI don't know how they screwed it up this badly, their work was basically cut out for them, they had the opportunity to make something truly masterful, something that meaningfully added to the contextualization of the original VN and show, made it better.\n\nIt's truly disappointing, and I hope that someday, someone talented enough comes back, retcons the VN and the anime and rewrites them completely.",
      "First off, just want to say this isn't a Metroidvania. This is a Zelda clone. And a good one!\n\nI bought this game because I heard it really put stress on you. You have limited time to complete the game and NPCs will begin dying if you aren't fast enough. Pretty crazy, right? Well, I do have a few gripes with that, but let me point out the good stuff first:\n+ Amazing combat. You have access to both guns and swords, but most of your damage will likely come from melee weapons since they have the ability to do an extremely-easy-to-pull-off PARRY! Parrying an enemy stuns it and gives your next attack against it a massive damage multiplier. All enemies, all bosses, and most projectiles are parryable, so this is what combat ends up revolving around. Even though I call it easy, you still get that cool feeling when you walk into an ambush and clear it without taking a hit, so it never gets dull as you go through the game.\n\n+ Good dungeon design. Since this game takes after Zelda, it's not shy about inserting a few puzzles into its dungeons. The overworld as well has quite a few surprising secrets and side quests that you won't be expecting when you play for the first time.\n\n+ Sequence breaks. This is mostly for New Game+ (or New Game Extra, a separate mode where you have access to major exploration items from the start, but not your whole endgame inventory), but it was interesting to find out how many secret paths and shortcuts there were, and how tightly they were managed. The devs thought of everything!\n\nSo now for the bad stuff.\n- Underwhelming story. Guess how much is really explained over the course of this story. If you guessed \"all of it\", you would be completely wrong and here's your dunce hat. Unsighted ends up spending so much of its time on the protagonist's relationships that it fails to answer several of the more important questions concerning the game's backstory. Why was there was a war? Who started it? Where are the humans now? Why are they so disorganized? Why do they seem to have no chain of command whatsoever? How did the automatons ever win anything at all at any point when they seem so extremely outclassed? I guess it doesn't matter. Look, there's two robot-girls kissing.\n\n- Fake pressure. I heard there was going to be pressure before I started the game, so I decided to go DEFCON 1 from the get-go and rush everything. I ended up completing the game in 10 in-game days and I felt pretty good about it. Zero NPC deaths! Zero! I'm a super awesome amazing hero, right? Well, credits roll and... the only achievement I get is the one for beating the game. No one really cares and apparently you're meant to play through multiple times anyway. So... why did I ever care? Why is this mechanic even in the game? All it did was make me shy away from general exploration and side quests since all of those things are less important than, ya know, saving the world. You can call that interesting, but when it has no payoff, it ends up being frustrating.\n\n- No post-game. Did I mention, if you bumrush the game and finish with just hours left on everyone's timers, you don't get to do any extra no-timer exploring afterwards? No, the game's over. Load the save and you get set back to where you were before fighting the final boss. If you want to do any actual exploring, that's what \"Explorer\" mode is for. You know, that mode that makes you feel like you're cheating?\n\nBasically, Unsighted is another game filled with missed opportunities. I recommend this game because the core gameplay and level design is very well done and very well executed, but you should probably know this before you start:\n\nThe only pressure here is the one you imagine. Since the game does nothing to acknowledge your successes, just play it at your own pace and don't be shy about using Explorer. Shame on the devs for hailing the agony of defeat, but not the thrill of victory.",
      "11 Jun 2023 Purchased the game again.  The weird distorted things are significantly reduced. The flight physics are improved. There are many mods and payware add-ons available. This is an excellent game for pilotage. There is a huge well mannered diverse community and the use of YourControls allows for a decent shared cock-pit experience.\n\nI recommend buying this game for the serious flight simmer.\n\n\n22 Jan 2021 Stunning graphics. mostly, with some really weird distorted things.   This is a very interesting game for those who are not very focused on real world aviation.  The airports are not accurately represented and the aircraft do not respond realistically, unless you are not interested in detail.   I think that it is an interesting product for casual entertainment, but serious flight enthusiasts will likely be disappointed.  I expect that with time users will create mods (aircraft and airports) to repair the inaccuracies, and fix the lack of detail, but I doubt that the weird graphics will ever be fixed.",
      "I am over 50. \nI have played a lot of games.\nThe Return of the Obra Dinn is one of the best games I have ever played.\n\nIt is one of those rare cases (though certainly by design) where everything comes together.  Story, game play, graphics, challenge level, feeling of accomplishment on advancement. Simply an outstanding piece of work that I enjoyed every moment (even when frustrated) and will remember fondly.",
      "I'm not a fan of visual novels.  I hate pixel graphics.  I played all games by these guys and wept like a baby every single time.  More than every single time.  This time, even more than more.  What a masterpiece",
      "A solid \"Get Va11HallA instead, unless this is on sale. Otherwise, maybe.\".\n\nCoffee Talk: Fantasy Coffee-brewing Action, is a day-by-day visual novel with slight coffee-brewing mechanics on the side. Its storyline is broken up into several days, of which customers visit your coffee shop and talk. The first few days are rather short: no longer than a few minutes, but as the story advances the days become more packed with story. The game as a whole is rather short, less than 3 hours to complete the main storyline. Overall, generally a well rounded game, but not $15. On the other hand, it compares rather poorly to Va11halla, a game with a nigh identical format, but has more characters, story, and charm. If you liked Va11halla, and really can't wait for N1RVAnnA, then get it on sale. Otherwise, just get Va11halla. But I'm still recommending it because steam doesn't allow maybes, and there's very little competition for this niche of VN.",
      "Yume Nikki is a game that is better spent playing blind through. If you are thinking of playing this game, DO NOT LOOK AT YOUTUBE FOR ANY HINTS. There is no losing the game, and there is no winning the game, but if you look at youtube, you will lose a lot of the thematic feel of the game.\n\nI REPEAT, DO NOT LOOK AT YOUTUBE OR ANY OTHER GUIDE. YOU WILL MISS OUT ON AN EXPERIENCE.\n\nSaying that, Yume Nikki is a interactive experience following a young woman's dreams. By sifting through her dreams, you may come to conclusions about the player character's life, or you may find yourself reflecting on events in your life. I heartily reccomend this game to those who like mystery and speculation.",

      "A Visual Novel meets The Stanley Parable by way of Disco Elysium. This game contains a shocking amount of depth of content and thematics behind it's excellent voice acting and 3-colour sketchy visual style. Well worth a play if you're intrigued.",

      "For those of you with controllers:\n\nPress B to quack. \n\nPress Left Trigger to change the pitch of your quack; the more pressure you put on Left Trigger, the higher pitched your quack will be. \n\nThe more you know.\n\n\n\nDuck Game is an awesome game where a group of up to 4 ducks are pitted amongst eachother with a plethora of unique weapons. Matches are fast paced, with the only goal being \"stay alive longer than your friends\". It almost reminds me of a competetive version of Super Crate Box (the gunplay feels similar). \n\nIf you're looking for a goofy game to play with some of your friends, whether locally or online, pick this game up.",
      "For every like this review gets, I will consume 1 spoonful of mayonnaise",
      "I didn't want to review this until I was completely done. I've now 100%'d the game. Quite simply, I think everyone should play this game! It's perfect for puzzle players with easy and difficult puzzles, most of which feel very satisfying to solve, has fantastic commentary about all of the perspectives of today's society (it's not just a one-sided view!) and is a genuinely well-crafted game.\n\nMost facets of the game are positive so I have to point out the negatives in the game.\n1: There is no save/load system, it's all automatic checkpoints and you have to go and back up the files manually if you want to see the results of different choices.\n2: The choices you can make, or miss, have some light dialog consequences but they occur over many hours of time. This is something I don't really expect from a puzzle game that used to always tell you \"you can return to any place you want at any time.\" In this game, you can't. The time of day and weather of locations can irrevocably change, the ending itself has some major changes, yet there's no way to see it all without replaying the game (a tough pill to swallow for a puzzle game) or watching the results on YouTube. I'm kinda against that sort of thing unless your game can be played multiple times and be different each time, which this won't be, because it's the same puzzles each time.\n3: The engine is Unreal 5 and it's very unfortunate. Although the game may have been easier to develop for multiple platforms in a faster time via doing this, but it has proven that Croteam's old Serious Engine was a much better engine. Unreal 5 has horrible eye adaptation, anti-aliasing, lighting, and geometry options that are all proven to be horrible via this game. Don't get me wrong, the game runs and looks fine for the most part, but all of it could look better and run better had it been built on any other engine. Yes, *any* other engine. I'd sooner have played this on the Source engine. Epic's Lumen and Nanite technology is still too unproven, early, and crappy to be the generational leap they claim to be. I hope the developer can better tune this stuff so players can have better framerates, less ghosting, better lighting, and eliminated distant object pop-in.\n4: The game's pace at the start and end are worse than they could be. The beginning spends too long (and a lot of later optional dialog depends on your exploration of this) in an open world without puzzles while the end has a final puzzle that includes a frustratingly tedious walk-about aspect that needed to be shortcutted somehow. Everything in between (including the breaks you get back in the open world bit) is perfectly crafted and paced, though.\n\nThese things said, I still insist that if you enjoy any form of puzzle game, like Antichamber or Portal, you play this game. You will enjoy it!",
      "In less skilled hands, throwing about terms like 'nostalgic' and 'cosy' could easily be turned into negatives when describing 'VIDEOVERSE'. However, Lucy Blundell, the sole developer behind Kinmoku and 'VIDEOVERSE' has improved upon every aspect of her first title, the still very enjoyable 'One Night Stand'. The two games have little in common, but it is clear from the outset that it is a passion project of the developer, with many aspects of herself cleverly interwoven into the characters and the setting. Playing as Emmett in the early days of online forums in a world very close to the real one, the user can choose to make the community a more pleasant and safer space for fellow Shark owners, or do the precise opposite and add to the trolling and profanity that coarsened even forums 20 years ago and is certainly far more prevalent in today's (deliberately) polarised social media.\n\nThe soundtrack complements the environment and narrative design, with some neat musical segues at particularly dramatic moments between the main characters. The art is very expressive where it makes sense for it to be, and purposefully Miiverse adjacent and equally expressive with the avatars. The characters themselves are plausible and interestingly flawed as teenagers are when discovering their own selves and the world around them. There are multiple endings to discover that hinge on choices made throughout each chapter, including how close Emmett is to his friends.\n\nI'd recommend this game to anyone who believes in seriously supporting indie game development, wants a fresh take on visual novels, and/or is of a certain age like the developer and myself who remembers what the internet was like at the turn of the century.\n\nFor total transparency, I did do some beta testing on the game as a fellow narrative designer working in the industry, but all of these thoughts are my own. I also paid for a full release copy on the day it came out (today!) and I sincerely believe it's more than worth your time and money.",
      "The demo was a lot of fun and the early access launch game which is more of that  was a lot of fun big surprise!\n\nOverall I would really recommend this game if you loved or enjoyed games like Warstride Challenges, Neon White, Speedrunners From Hell and other games with a focus on very short concise levels that are made for speedrunning. I will say while it looks off in the trailers the gun controls pretty nicely in the game no complaints there for me with this style of game. \n\n\nWhat I liked\n\n-controls feel great and very fast, you always feel in control and everything including enemies are very visible and have extra outline to help highlight them when in hectic combat\n\n- most levels are just the right length to not feel like you complete them before you even start them but not tedious to retry to get a better ranking\n\n-much improved optimization and performance wise from the demo, even on my laptop not really made for gaming got a easy 100 fps if I put all settings on low\n\n-Ranking system is pretty cool, you get extra points if you kill enemies, head shot them for critical damage, if you never get hit etc and more and of course ranked on time. There is a separate ranking for total points so say for killing a lot of enemies and in a row and then a separate ranking just for times for levels\n\n- Enemy A.I seems improved form the demo and they try to roll out of the way of gunfire or go behind kinda cover from the environments at times.This isn't a big thing since your flying through levels super fast anyway but nice to see\n\n-Decent number of standard guns and they are fun to use without trivializing using telekinesis and vice versa\n\n-Some stages focus on a large arena to fight waves of enemies and others don't so feels like game has decent level variety/variety in obstacles in levels\n\n-okay variety of enemies to fight so far\n\n-kinda humorous the odd time and there are stupid items to pick up with telekinesis and use like a live rat, a toy hammer, giant tennis ball etc.\n\n- telekinesis feels very seamless fast and fun/easy to use in combat, chucking random objects at enemies its a lot of fun\n\n- most levels are open enough to allow multiple paths to get through levels and you can usually skip fighting some enemies if you want to only go for a faster time in most levels \n\n\n\nSome Suggestions/Issues I had\n\n-maybe I missed it but no instant retry button if I want to retry a level instantly but haven't died\n\n-boss difficulty kinda feels a bit all over the place although there is not much boss fights, first boss feels way too easy, second one was fun and maybe just right although maybe on the side of   too easy from not having enough health \n\n-the second last level in this launch early access version \"\"\"\"\"stealth\"\"\"\"\"\" feels far too long and far too hard and full of way too much elite enemies and then it even has a boss fight to do in it too in the level all in one go without ever stop moving! \n\n-just a note when I played the demo version before the last boss fight in that felt like it should have either been a level with just the enemies and then a second separate level with a arena for the  boss fight not both that you have to do in the one attempt in a bigger level just kinda tedious imo\n\n-music isn't bad here but it feels like there is very little music and the music that is there kinda blends together a lot\n\n-hopefully this game can develop a big following community and maybe get a level editor down the line!\n\n-feels like you go in the 2 second slow motion mode when getting a critical hit on a  enemy or breaking glass a good bit too much in levels.\n\n- would be nice down the line to get bonus challenge levels, shorter much more difficult ones like how NeonWhite and War stride Challenges have bonus levels \n\n- for replay value might be nice to have 3 unique goals for a level e.g beat the level in under 40 seconds, only kill a certain number of enemies, kill no enemies etc.This is kinda in the game but levels don't seem to have specific or unique extra goals its the same ones for every level.\n\n- not a complaint but maybe later add a grapple hook, grapple hooks are always fun in first person shooters!",
      "***NEWBIES*** At least 50%, if not more, of this game is map knowledge. So don't beat yourself up if you're  super lost and everyone is yelling at you over game chat. Just mute the salty people and report them if they TK. Trust me there are a lot of people in the game that will back you up and want to help, so don't let one bad experience make you quit the game for good.\n\nThere are a LOT of maps to learn and a lot of small details in every one. It's going to take the average person until your siege level is at LEAST 50 before you really start recognizing map layouts and details on all maps - including room orientation, call outs, soft wall, hard wall, what should be reinforced in each site, common paths of travel, etc..  And then probably until 75 until you're actually comfortable with most maps and operators. I'll give 15% to your own gun skills, 20% to team work and communication (call outs call outs call outs, people. Don't be that guy that just looks at memes after dying. Unless it's casual.), and 15% to your knowledge of the operators and ability to utilize their gadgets. \n\nMore tips:\n-There are a lot of Diamond/Plat smurfs in newcomer that like to make new accounts and s*** on actual new players because it makes them feel good for some reason, so you're better off playing quick match. \n-To learn maps faster, make your own custom games and run around in them. \n-When you die, make sure you watch the replay so you know what cheeky angle the enemy was holding and then don't do what you did next time, or use it to your advantage when you switch sides. \n-If you're not on cams, watch teammates. Look at the places they check as they sweep rooms. Watch the paths they take. Look at how they engage in gun fights and how they rotate around the map. \n-Spend the extra few dollars to buy a version with some operators - it'll make game play more fun for you and you'll have an easier time finding operators that work best with your play style. \n-Squad up with friends - being able to communicate and laugh in a discord can really improve the game experience, even if it's just one other person.\n-Best way to really understand an operator is to play them, so take advantage when there are siege events that allow you to play whoever you want. Use this information to purchase your next operator with the game currency. \n\n",
      "Overrated. \n\n\nFirst half of the game is amazing. You start out with nothing, enter a mine and slowly progress, get new tools, upgrade existing ones and collect resources for one of the progression types. Platforming and digging smart (so you don't lock yourself out of resources) is a huge part of the opening experience. \n\nLater in game you get a grappling hook and rocket shoes and that's when the game loses its identity. The the game shifts its focus towards puzzles and platforming while making you deal with hordes of annoying enemies. Mining no longer requires any attention and becomes more of a chore. Most tiles become impossible to break. Most enemies have gimmicks that make them a nuisance. Areas where you'll spend most time have mostly unbreakable tiles. Even if you find destructible ares, hook and rocket shoes ensure you don't have to think too much (unlike in first half of the game).",

      "[b]Content Warning[/b]: Discussions of mental illness, attempted suicide, cyberbullying, toxic gamer culture, manipulation/gaslighting\n\nThe protagonist is chosen to be an esports team manager and must make difficult decisions while trying to keep everyone on the team happy. In a society that tells people that winning and success are what give us worth, it can certainly be a struggle to accept a loss. However, if someone is surrounded by healthy friendships and perhaps even a lover, their perspective can be changed, and then it turns out, losing isn’t so bad, actually. \n\n[u]Information[/u]\n    • This is a sequel to Arcade Spirits, but someone can understand this story without knowing the first one. They just wouldn’t get some of the references, as some characters from the first game do make an appearance. \n    • The mini-game is super easy. If you fail, just reload (on the first playthrough). After the first playthrough, a new feature is unlocked to simply scroll back to try a different choice.\n    • The Rival can be friendly or hostile. \n    • Romantic scenes are tame. Implied sex only. The Rival’s romance route is definitely the most risque in terms of dialogue. \n    • 7 romanceable characters: 3 women, 2 men, 1 enby, and the Rival (any gender). \n\n[u]Praises[/u]\n    • Elaboration on the AI Iris’s origins that players probably wondered about in the first game.\n    • Neat character creation setup. Protagonist & Rival.\n    • Several pronoun options. \n    • Indicates whether a choice influences romance or not.\n    • Personality traits like in the first game are back: quirky, steady, kind, gutsy, and flexible.\n    • Amusing effects that company ridiculous jokes.\n    • Disabled character representation. A [i]romanceable[/i] character who’s a gorgeous goth.\n    • Characters are pleasantly racially diverse. \n    • Polyamory route.\n    • Critiques of societal pressures and what exactly “success” means.\n    • Various discussions of having toxic parents and other relatives.\n    • Throughout the story, various social issues are brought up related to the gaming scene: from capitalist ventures like loot boxes to branding.\n    • The game touches heavily on depression and suicide. As someone who has struggled with depression her whole life and, once upon a time, had suicidal tendencies, I found the ways those topics were integrated into the story to be helpful. (There many instances in media about “Shadow Selves” but it reminded me of Persona 4, when characters have to face the parts of themselves they want to deny.)\n    • There is a cat and there is an option to pet it.\n\n[u]Complaints[/u]\n    • Thicc body types for the protagonist/rival are drawn awkwardly and sloppily. I also feel that the devs took a step back on thicc representation in this game vs the first one. While Zapper (a romanceable character) is slightly plump, I wouldn’t necessarily categorize her as “thicc.” There were two genuinely thicc romanceable characters in the first game.\n    • Only one afro-textured hairstyle in character creation, while straight hair has several.\n    • Beginning of the game is a bit rushed. I think it’s because it’s expected of the player to have played the first game and know all about the AI Iris. \n    • I figure the devs wanted to demonstrate what disabled people go through in terms of discrimination and disrespect from others, but I feel they could’ve done better. They gave the protagonist [i]forced[/i] problematic lines and players aren’t gonna feel great about being an a$$hole to a disabled character. \n    • Sometimes, there’s too much telling and not enough showing.\n    • More resource links should be added to help people with depression and suicidal thoughts than the hotline listed after [spoiler]Coda tries to kill himself[/spoiler]. I think it would also be better if those resources were listed in the credits as well. \n\nIt seems like the most common thing people complain about in the other reviews is political preaching being in the game. I agree: things should be shown rather than told, in this case. On the other hand, I’ve literally known gamers who talk about the issues brought up in the game. I didn’t find it [i]that[/i] unrealistic. I think it’s just that a lot of it is condensed into one story, whereas, in real life, these types of subjects come up every now and then over the course of knowing people for years. \n\nDespite the flaws mentioned, I really liked the game. I do believe I liked the first one a bit better, but I’m happy with the sequel overall. It was a lot of fun and very geeky.\n\n[quote] Please follow our curator page,\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/4680120/]Otome Lovers[/url], if you'd like to see\nmore reviews like this one!

      "I cannot help myself but to notice that this game has a failed Kickstarter campaign behind - which is why I was especially surprised and happy at the same time to find out it has been released no matter the odds. \n\nTo keep it short and simple: \"Think outside of the box\" is this game's motto. And it actually gives you an ability to rotate this box. \nCreator put a lot of effort in it. To say that this game is \"short\" is something I cannot do. While it is somewhere around 5 hours long - all those hours are filled to the brim with creativity, surprises, charming voice-over; it does not get repetitive and neither it gets overcomplicated. It is a great mix of involvement through thinking and relaxation. \n\nDefinitely worth it's money.",

      "I reviewed the original Mark of the Ninja more than 4 years ago. I liked its stealth-based gameplay approach and praised the learning curve experienced throughout the story. I bought the [i]Special Edition[/i] which practically meant an add-on with some more levels, a custom and the option to replay the entire game in commentary mode. \n\nYou know some games get re-released due to the availability of a new console generation. This [i]Remastered[/i] edition is what was made available for PS4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch users not long ago. We, PC gamers (who already own the original Mark of the Ninja), can get this version free-of-charge in our library.\n\nThere's not much to say, really. I do not have a 4K display so this higher resolution I cannot enjoy. Compressed in-game art or not the original already looked very good. But the creators confirmed this will give us an enhanced experience even under 1080p resolution. \n\nWell, I did complete the game once again as this is how much I love MoN. I recommend that you do the same.\n\nPS: It may be possible that you are required to have the special edition of the original version to get the remastered version.",
      "Emily is Away Too is the sequel to Emily is Away.\n\nThe first game, which was free to play, was absolutely fantastic, especially because of its finale: [spoiler] no matter what you felt or what you wanted to do, your choices would always bring the same conclusion of you unable to say to Emily that you wanted to be more than friends, and her spending the summer with her boyfriend. [/spoiler]\nBut that was not because of \"lazyness\" by the developer: it was intentional, and in fact, towards the end of the game, [spoiler] even if you try expressing your feelings your character would delete what you wanted to say replacing the messages with generic questions [/spoiler] . In my opinion, the intention was to deliver the message that [spoiler] sometimes in life, especially when dealing with relationships with other people, there is simply nothing you can do except accepting other people's choices and move on [/spoiler] .\nIt was a very powerful ending that left me thinking about it for days after finishing the game, even if it was a short experience.\n\nUnfortunately, while playing this game I did not feel the same, powerful emotions that I did with the first one. This is because the game features several different endings, this time with two girls instead of just Emily, which isn't a bad thing per se, but it contrasts with the power of the message of the first one. Moreover, here [spoiler] you can actually achieve not one, but several \"good\" endings [/spoiler] .\n\nI liked the integration with your desktop and browser, plus the many different references to artists, TV shows and movies from 10 years ago.\nThere are still some \"twists\" present here, and if you make certain choices you will encounter situations similar to what you do in the first game, but as I said, I feel that they are not as effective as the original game.\n\nThat does not mean this is a bad game by any means: I would still recommend it, especially for its low price, but make sure to download and play the previous one first. It's free, too!\n\nRating: 7.0/10",
      "*LOOK INTO SAFETY/SECURITY RISKS BEFORE BUYING THIS GAME*\n\n     Playing this game online can be risky as hackers are able find your IP address, mess with your in-game / weapons / health / money, find out your personal information, install rats on your PC & even get into your computer. Although this isn't super common it's still a legitimate thing that people need to know about & should look into before spending their money on this game. It doesn't happen as much to random players but Streamers have to play this game in offline mode whenever they stream themselves playing otherwise the hackers will mess with whatever they're doing by trying to get them banned. \nPlease google \"Black ops 3 PC security risks 2022\". It really is a shame that Treyarch isn't coming back to fix this very serious problem in their game, but let's be real Activision  more than likely isn't letting them. \n\nTL;DR: Be cautious of potential security issues, but I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes Call of Duty Zombies / zombies in general or who wants to get into the Call of Duty Zombies franchise.\n\nNow for my review:\n     Best call of duty game ever for Zombies. Definitely can be a challenge to find multiplayer matches nowadays but zombie matches aren't hard to find as long as you're playing the \"popular\" maps. The \"less popular\" maps are more difficult to find a match on but it's still possible, especially if you search for a match at the right time of day. This goes for multiplayer as well, if you search for a match during specific times you will be more likely to find matches (I'm not entirely sure when these times are so I wont even leave my guess here). This is likely because of people in different time-zones getting up / getting off work or school and getting on the game.\n     This game is the best thing to ever happen to the Zombies series in terms of gameplay, storyline, progression & more. There are endless tasks, items & surprises in each map that keep you coming back for more and having a different experience each time! It truly is a wonderful & fun game that has offered me more re-play ability than any other game I've ever experienced, especially with custom zombies/mod tools. With community made maps there's literally endless maps/levels to play on, & because of mod tools we not only have the remakes that come with Zombies Chronicles but we also have the visually stunning remakes of Mob of the Dead, Call of the Dead & Town, with Buried as well as Die Rise on the way for 2023/2024! I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes Call of Duty Zombies / zombies in general or who wants to get into the Call of Duty Zombies franchise.",

Adds just enough on to the original game's mechanics to justify itself. The length is a good bit shorter than the first but the price is reduced to completely make up for it. All around great buy if you enjoyed the first.\n- I wish there were a \"mixed\" option for recommending this game, as I think for a lot of people out there, this is a fantastic game, and it's definitely well made with a lot of love and attention to detail in many respects. I really like puzzles and problem solving, so part of my disappointment with The Witness is that I really thought I would enjoy the game. Myst was one of my favorite games growing up, and I was extremely excited to see a well-reviewed game in the Myst genre surface after far too long. \n\nThe problem for me was that The Witness is very much a game about the journey, and not the destination. It turns its head on the genre as it's less a game about solving puzzles within a set of rules, and more about discovering what those rules are. And for the most part, it does that well. Instead of the usual game conventions, rewards for solving hard puzzles weren't any kind of story unlock, more just to give you a harder puzzle. That approach was fun for awhile, but some story unlock would've been appreciated, especially because there is so much mystery and it's such an immersive world that was clearly built for a reason and has a fascinating backstory. \n\nSome of the mechanics also just seem arbitrary, or at the very least, not quite obvious enough. Sometimes perspective puzzles require you to either take a screenshot or jot down on pencil and paper the answer, then transfer it on screen. That seems like lazy game design and worst of all, takes you out of the immersive experience. It's possible I'm mostly tone deaf, as some of the sound puzzles seemed almost impossible to me, despite numerous listens. There's also just the repetitiveness of the \"pathfinding\" puzzles, which range from challenging (and satisfying) to punitive in their difficulty spikes. It's in these difficulty spikes where I think the core game mechanic of pathfinding lets you down, as it requires you to be much more of a planner than a \"hands on\" problem solver. In a game like this, I would think it would accommodate multiple approaches, but really there's a right way to approach this game, and a wrong way. Unfortunately for me, I think the way I approach puzzles (trial and error) is strongly discouraged, at times in punitive ways. \n\nThe philosophy from the audio/video portions will likely be appreciated by some, and for some come off as the worst kind of douchey-hipster nonsense. Had they been delivered in shorter pieces, I might've fallen into the former. But as rambling as some of them are, I found them more annoying than enjoyable unfortunately. \n\nI don't know, I'm really torn on this. It's a well made game, and while it seems so open and non-confined, I found the game to be far too linear in mechanics and how to approach problem solving. At times it actually made me feel like a lesser thinker because I have a different approach to puzzles than what the game designer prefers. What I'm sure is a really fun journey for some, left me disappointed with the destination. \n\nAm realizing this reads a lot like an apology for not liking this game, which I think it is. I really, really wanted to love The Witness, but in the end, not only was this game not for me, but I genuinely feel lesser for that fact because I feel like I should have loved it, and just didn't.\n- When I first played Battlefield 1 it literally sent me to the hospital, cause you’re supposed to seek immediate medical attention if your erection lasts longer than 4 hours.\n\nThis is easily one of the most badass games  in history. The music, the landscape, the gunplay, the hit register and the satisfying kill effect, EVERYTHING is just amazing. The last true Battlefield game. I enjoyed every second of this amazing game.  \n\nBF1 isn’t fully historically accurate but it is historically immersive. The war stories in this game genuinely made me emotional sometimes and I’m not ashamed to admit that. \n\nAs someone who is more on the “historical accuracy” side of games, I can say without a doubt that Battlefield 1 did an incredible job. Hell, they were even able to be diverse without pandering to anybody! The 1st Russian Women’s Battalion of Death, the Harlem Hellfighters, people from French-occupied northwestern Africa, the list goes on. What sets this game’s inclusivity of a variety of people and groups from other games is that it does so when it has a reason to and is still accurate to the time and setting. \n\nThat’s one of the main reasons why Battlefield 5 pissed me off so much. Instead of a British woman with a prosthetic arm wielding a cricket bat in WW2, why not include Lyudmila Pavlichenko, aka Lady Death, a female Russian sniper who had 309 confirmed kills? What about the French women who fought? They were in extremely small numbers, but they were a thing. Historically accurate inclusion is fucking awesome, and I love when games do it. But inclusivity for its own sake is terrible and it cheapens said character’s presence in the game’s setting. \n\nEven the DLC are fantastic. I remember how amazing I felt when the “for the Tsar” DLC came out and I first played it. I have never seen people fight so hard to the death in a video game without a whole lot of rage. It was amazing. I felt like I was part of the Russian revolution. Please do yourself a favor and buy this game.\n\n9/10\n\nOnly gave it a 9 ‘cause the 1 is already there…\n- Lemme give it to y'all straight, who are on the fence;\n\n- Yes, the game is very much worth it at full price.\n\n- One of the first games in a long while, that has kept me up until 5 A.M. in the morning, because of how lost I get myself into it.\n\n- Doesn't do dumb jump scares, save for a VERY FEW TIMES, and each one counted.\n\n- The game is maybe one of the best zombie based games out there, so long as you do enjoy it with action.\n\n- Parkour in the game is AMAZING. Sometimes I like just playing the game, so I can run\naround, across roof tops, and attacking zombies while talking to friends.\n\n- Co-op in story mode. Freaking amazing. No dumb lobby. Just click 'Join game' and bam,\nyou'll be thrown a few feet away from a friend without them sometimes even noticing you joined!\n\n- Single play and Co-op have a huge impact; co-op feels fun, slightly safer, and adds a lot in the form of friendly rivals! Single player feels way more tense and everything you do counts, making you second guess some choices, for fear or death. Night time in either mode is fun as heck, though four co-op makes it pretty easy.\n\n- Night and Day feel almost like two different modes. In the day, zombies shuffle around, falling off rooftops, being dumb, easy to avoid and kill. Night time? Get those UV Flares ready, and be ready to flee if they catch sight of you.\n\n- Even after beating the story, I keep coming back for more, as it's super fun.\n\n- Took me around 30 hours to do the story, which also included only HALF of the side missions. Still got a little over 50% left to go, and looking forward to it!\n\nTL;DR - Get the game, find friends to play with, enjoy the hell out of one of the few games worth it at full price.\n- As i previously stated, i was going to play through metro fully and i have done so, so here is my update to this review. \nThis game is not the best selling triple A game in the world and it may have some bugs (like a table that wasnt solid or the objects in that room lol) however it is a decent game. the story is decent and the characters voices are way off but they sorta make up for it with their personalities. \n\nExploration in this game is by far one of the most interesting in my opinion and the way your character acts in the enviroment makes it more interesting aswell, for example wiping your visor when it gets dirty (wasnt that helpful for me in my play through but it was a nice touch) and your visor taking damage in combat adds to the immersive feel of this wasteland/paradise almost. Scavenging weapons and parts and combining them to make better equipment is quite intriguing and quick to do if you can find the parts. \n\nat the end of the day my final review of this is its a good game i would play it again even if it is a bit clunky sometimes (atleast it was for me lmao)\n\n\n\n\n\nOh and hopefully my punctuation is good enough so no one passes out this time lmao\n- Game really falls off after Anor Londo. The difficulty starts to come more from tedium, shitty terrain/hitboxes, and cheap shots than any test of reflex or strategy. Bosses can be total snoozefests (Ornstein and Smough, Four Kings, Quelaag) or relentless, cheap bastards (Gwyn, Sif) or even dumb puzzles that rely on at least one death to figure out (Discharge, Bed of Chaos, Gaping Dragon). Actual fun bosses are few despite the total number of boss fights. Try not to fall asleep while waiting for the boss to do the one attack you can actually punish without getting hit by the patented zero frame windup or retarded delayed backswing. Marvel at how touching the air 1 foot away from the boss kills you after he does his big EPIC swing because silly player, you should know the exact dimensions of the hitbox surrounding the 20ft tall demon and his 2 ton hammer. Sigh as you run past all the enemies and time-wasting obstacles again as you try to figure out the one stupid gimmick you need to master.\n\nNow, this game isn't all bad. The game's artstyle and atmosphere are pretty cool and the voice acting is good. Some of the levels are also really interesting and well-designed (Undead Burg and Parish, Sen's Fortress, Anor Londo) even if there are also some really shitty ones (Tomb of Giants, Blighttown through Lost Izalith, Crystal Cavern). Play after the second bell only if you want to see whether you can \"git gud.\" I got gud but I see that this game was popular mostly because AAA games were shit when it came out and because of the multiplayer gimmicks.\n- Great story, great features. But in my honest opinion unless your going for a nostalgia trip, give it a pass. The gun play and AI alone is enough for me to justify a refund, I mean shit cops hear the sounds of gunshots right next to them and act like nothing is happening. Immersion 0/10 sorry. I must admit I really enjoyed this game on console, but I am gonna have to take the money and run. Notice how almost all of the reviews just say All YOU haD to do Was FoLlow The DAmn Train cj or Ill HAve TWo NumBER 9s. I cant say I didn't expect this game to be a little shit judging by how old it is, but I will NOT suck it off and say buy it, the actual game play is PATHETIC. In all honesty I think this game remastered with gta v's physics and polish would be SOOO much better than gta v. They really captured the hood life in this one, damn shame it fucking sucks. This game's age sadly isn't up to par and sadly, it's getting a fat thumbs down from this boomer.\n- I like furry art, but first and foremost im a RPG gamer, and as such I will rend judgment impartially. \n\nThe story is not bad, but still falls in the average category and it is predictable, gameplay is the same as the first Fuga (I have no problems there) but there are few new enemies,  so the strategy to beat the regular battles is very repetitive. My biggest complain remains the same since Tail Concerto and it is the dificulty... which is way too easy, there is no hard / nightmare mode for veteran players, Im not asking to die repeatedly like in dark souls but Cyberconnect2 needs to understand some players like a challenge in their games.\n\nMusic is ok and Hack is the best character of the lot (Tah tah tah tah  taaah!!!!!) I would play Fuga 3 just for him.\n\nIt pains me to give the thumbs down, but Cyberconnect2 needs to work a little harder.\n- More broken than Cyberpunk could ever dream. Sure the game has nice graphics but the game play, toxic online players, and poor physics make this one of the most frustrating games I have ever played. Dont even bother using the stable either your game will glitch and youll be stuck looking at you player stuck in the stable and nothing more causing you to reset the game or the rogue horses that will drive by kick you in the face. Good luck if you play.\n- This is more than a game for me.  It has become a hobby.  What started as a random purchase for myself last Christmas -- I had an old electric guitar I never played in the closet, so this gave me an excuse to see if I can learn -- has become an expensive obsession for me.  Warning -- but a good warning -- you'll find that you're learning guitar very quickly on this game, and it will become the start of an expensive habit!  I have downloaded hundreds of dollars worth of songs, bought a brand new guitar, I've signed up for music theory and guitar lessons at the local county college ... this has become a genuine hobby for me.  Literally, it is one of those rare games which has genuinely made an impact on my life.  Six months later, and the game has not gotten old.  I look forward to new songs, I laugh when a new chord I've never seen magically appears on the song that I've practiced the hell out and achieved a new difficulty.  The game is, most importantly, fun.  It remains fresh and only gets better as you get better.  I highly recommend.\n- very fun there is lots to do \nit runs well\nglitches are very funny\nable to download community made maps and mutators from workshop\ncan unlock different mutators as you play\nyour a goat\nyou do goat things\nyou can do non goat thing such as being a shopping cart or a microwave\nyou can also be a goat\n**Spoiler**\n[spoiler] Im a goat [/spoiler]\n\n GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!\n- An amazing game, you can go from doing great and having a full and maxed level crew, and end up fighting the wrong guy as they systematically destroy your ship systems leaving your weapons and shields off-line as your crew burns to death while suffocating. Very fun and has endless replayibility\n- I technically got this game for free, as it was bought for me from a friend. And honestly, I didn't really like it. She got it for me, as a means to help with some of my mental health issues I suppose? But it just was very big miss for me, and kinda made me feel worse. A bit anxiety inducing for me, just given the circumstances, talking about life and death. Just not my personal cup of tea.\n- Great game... who need 1 or 2 years of development. tl;dr: mid game turn into a micromanagment hell.\n\nThe game is fantastic until a certain point. You start as a mercenary, one party, 50-150 soldiers doing missions, small battles or bigger fights joining armies. Good graphics, brutal engagments with 200-1000 units at the same time if your computer can handle, playing as a soldier is a blast.\n\nThe problems start when you get a few towns and a bigger family, the micromanagement never stops and gets worse overtime. You have to physically move your party to towns to fix their issues. When your lords get captured & escapes, they'll go into a random town until you pick em again, then you'll have to reform the party. Same with caravanes for trading, if they get captured, you'll have to go in his town and recreate the caravan. You have to partially fill towns with soldiers, manually, from your own soldiers. All the little fun things of the beginning soon become a hassle, as you can't delegate. Messengers are not a thing.\n\nYou can't manage a town at a distance, you can't tell a party member to move to a location or guard a territory, they do whatever they want if they're out of your army / party, so you have to do it yourself. Either you're leading your huge army to fight what is basically an enless war mid game, or you take care of your cities while the rest of your faction fight... with various success. Some commanders are pretty good, other will throw waves of recruits at highly trained arbalists in the open backed with cavalry. Protip: don't be a recruit in an imperial army.\n\nYou can't tell a party you created to guard an area or to kill all bandits attacking your villagers, it's up to you, or the IA if it feel like it. Worst, if you let the parties you created roam around (parties = group of 70-200 soldiers under a lord) they can be (temporarily) drafted in other armies of your kingdom... and you'll have to physically move to the army, talk to the leader and pay some reputation to get them back. Of course, large armies are slow. This leads the the next problem, swarms.\n\nMy worst fear is not a massive army, it's an army disbanded in the middle of my territory. The small parties usually start raiding all villages in the vicinity while being too fast to be catched by a big army. Raided villages impact your town / castle loyalty and gold quite heavily. Sure, you could disband your army and hunt them yourself... but that makes you take a step back, and all your parties would reform under another army you can't control. And man, some army commanders are really, really stupid. Verdun style charge in the open against walls of archers, cavalry in a forest vs pikemens, you name it. I can't count the time i had parties wiped in someone else army. But let's say you managed to capture the lords burning your villages.\n\nThe capture system is broken. Captured lords escape A LOT. I had some escape 20 seconds after being captured. They never stay in a jail for more than a few in game days. Once they escape, they magically teleport to their hometown, rebuild a fast 80 mens army in the blink of an eye and go back to raiding villages. AI \"cheat\" with recruits, they will always find soldiers in town, even if they're empty for you. Executions you say?\n\nIf you execute a lord, no matter how much of an A-hole he/she is, the whole faction will hate you. He raided dozens of villages and killed hundreds of peasants? Still not good enough. You just can't kill a lord without suffering heavy consequences down the line, and you'll need those lords to be friendly later. Worth to mention, capturing the leader of a faction won't stop a war.\n\nLast - peace / war is on/off. I had 600 days of continuous war, followed by 600 days of complete peace in the entire map (due to a bug apparently), and i'm now back at 300 days of war. Not a single day of peace, when one war stop another start immediatly. They will just never, ever stop fighting. Can't catch a breath, can't leave the front of your lose towns.\n\nOh and the main quest randomly failed after 875 days or so.\n\nI would still recommand the game, it's really fun for a while but it need a HUGE QoL update.\n\n- [h1] 9/10 [/h1]\n[h1] As a sequel to Steins;Gate, you won't be able to understand the content of the game without playing the previous game. [/h1]\n\nThe sequel to the famous visual novel game Steins;Gate. Although some people think that Steins;Gate 0 is not as good as its predecessor, I think this game is a well-deserved excellent sequel.\n\nA change from the witty and relaxed game style of the previous game, the overall atmosphere of this game is heavy, and personally I prefer this kind of visual novel work. The plot of the game is naturally wonderful, so I won’t comment here to avoid spoilers. If you are deeply attracted by the game’s background settings and characters before playing Steins;Gate, then this work must be worthwhile. The music of this game is also very beautiful, and it will never disappoint the players. The only shortcoming of it is that the description of some characters is too sloppy and the characterization is insufficient, such as Kagari.\n\nIn any case, this one is definitely a must-try work for players who love Steins;Gate, and it is an important addition to the series of plots. As a related supplementary sequel, its nature is also destined that players must play the previous game in order to understand the content of this one.\n- No one sees \"Purchases made in this region will only receive the Russian language.\" before the release data\n\nThis really kills me.\n\nThey didn't say there would be a region lock before.\n\nBut today, the release date, there is one.\n\nWell the fxxk done Ubsoft\n- It's hard not to compare this with Divinity: Original Sin. Both were funded on Kickstarter, both have a 91% score on Steam, both are rich, engaging cRPGs, and they were released months apart. It's fair to say both games have been wild successes that have surprised even the developers. If you had to pick ONE of these to invest time in which should it be?\n\nTurn-based vs. Real-time with pause: I eventually came to accept and even enjoy the real-time with pause combat of Pillars, though I much prefer turn-based. Real-time combat presents many problems that aren't the result of player mistakes. On numerous occasions I'd have characters stuck in place because the pathfinding didn't work right. The real-time combat often felt like a jumbled, chaotic mess instead of the tactical plan I had set out. Divinity is much cleaner in this respect and offered a much better experience, especially with respect to using the environment as a weapon. With Divinity I felt each power had a time and place, whereas with Pillars I ended up spamming the same powers and hoping for the best.\n\nStory: Pillars of Eternity definity wins out here. While the story in Divinity:OS wasn't bad, I would call it playful to the point of campy. Pillars had a deep, mature fantasy story worthy of a novel. While it was almost too much reading at times, the story was serious, dark, and dealt with real themes. \n\nArt: Pillars harkens back to the golden age of Infinity Engine games like Balgur's Gate, Icewind Dale, Planescape Torment, etc. The scenes are appealing, but prerendered and they felt a little static. This helps stoke the nostalgia for the late 90s, but Divinity feels up-to-date and immersive. Couple the art style of Divinity with it's highly interactive environments, and the world of Original Sin ends up feeling much more alive. \n\nMusic: Both were great soundtracks but Pillars feels just a bit derivative of the Lord of the Rings movies. They aren't bad at all, but almost generically fantasy at times. Music is important here because when you spend tens of hours in these worlds, you're gonna get this music stuck in your head.\n\nIn short, you should play both if you love deep, isometric, high-fantasy, western computer RPGs. If you MUST pick, consider the following choice. Choose Pillars of Eternity if you favor story and choose Divinity: Original Sin if you prefer combat. Both are hallmarks of a great RPG and each specializes beautifully.\n- Alright. Time for a review.\n\nThe launch on this game has been absolutely horrible. Day-zero patch, day-one patch, none of 'em did nothing. My rig is running a 10-series i9 and a 4090 Suprim X GPU. Along with 64 GB ram that should be more then enough. However, it was not. Frames between 10 and 30 fps, with a resting 30-40 when in smaller areas, has been quite common for me. As others have noted, the framedrops appeared to happen when changing \"zones\" in maps, and not when there are many enemies, demanding light-sequences, etc. This made my initial experience a living nightmare, as some fights especially are depending on quick reactions. Try quicktiming a block with 10 fps.\n\nThis has been my experience, and it was horrible. I stared off into the sunset. I cried. I questioned my existence. I murdered people (in real life, as i couldn't kill anything in-game). Until 2 hours ago. Because then, a wild 3,3 GB patch appeared.\n\nThe game is now running smoothly at 150 fps. I have no lag whatsoever when changing zones or being in separation areas, and no issues with combat. Finally the game runs as it should. The story is great, gameplay is better. Combat is more immersive and diverse, and somehow the creators made the game in a way that gives you a ton of new skills and equipment as you play, while still letting you start off with the stuff you had in Fallen Order. Its legendary.\n\nThat sound too good to be true? Well, it kinda is, in a way. Cause i have one more thing to add. People have been reporting game crashes. I have had a total of two crashes in 19 hours, until this patch appeared. Now I've had 9 crashes in 19 minutes. However, the reason I'm saving this for last and don't really care that much is that the crashes are completely connected the archive base on Jedha. This is a small area, and not one you have to spend much time in.  It is, however, quite critical when you do have to go there. As things stand now, i have to reboot the game once or twice to get in, deliver a quest and get back out again. The crashes always happen upon entering or exiting the area, not while inside. So until they fix that... well. I can deal with that.\n\nAll in all, it's a great game, and if you're way too obsessed with this game the way that I am, i'd chance buying it now :) If you have self-control (self-respect...?) you might want to wait a bit more, but I'm pretty confident that the next patch will fix the remaining serious issues for most people.\n\nTLDNR: Game bad then. Game much gooder now. Game goodest next week ish. Caveman out.\n- Great game, Horrible new publishers who stole the IP from the original creators. Do not support these thieves\n- Gone are the days of mindless building and fun. Power grids? Taxes? Intense accounting and counter-intuitive path building. A pre-built zoo for tutorials. I actually felt MORE stressed after playing this game. If you're looking for something to flex that brain, perfect. If you're looking to release the cougars and create chaos, you can do that in sandbox I guess. You could also just not connect power grids correctly. Works like a charm. Honestly who thinks of these things\n- Loved the original, and this updated version is just as good.\n\nThe additions along the way are very nice, and the improved graphics are noticeable. \nBeing able to converse with your partners whenever you want is also amazing.\n\nHowever...\n\nWas disappointed to have a few areas and puzzles removed. Since those were the more difficult parts of the original game, I assume this was done for a more streamlined experience. \nInstead of your flower wilting to represent your life, it is now replaced by more accurate \"points\". Although this makes it easier to tell exactly how many hits you can take, I miss the more original old design.\nAn iconic music track was also changed, likely due to licensing issues...\n \nCan't completely replace the original for me, but it's still a very worthwhile experience! \nStill wishing for a sequel a decade later.\n- First I thought this game is WAY TOO COMPLICATED.\nNow I still think the game is very complex for beginners. And I'm still a newbie.\nI had to watch several youtube videos to get the hang of it.\n\nBesides that, the game is really awesome!\n- [h1]Old, but has massive depth of content // Recommended for immersive role-players[/h1]\n\n+ Combat in general, and melee combat in particular, is very polished and open for an older title; everything can be controlled, such as directional blocking, without overcomplicating the mechanics involved\n+ Character creation is meticulously in-depth; initial backstory creation works seamlessly with selection of primary attributes in a way that makes the final product always feel refreshingly unique\n+ 'Story' is about as open-ended as can be, to the point where the game essentially has no story, and is something of a thirteenth century sand-box title; the player has complete, unadulterated freedom\n+ The game encourages the player to recruit and build a personal army as he/she progresses, and the mechanics put in place for doing so are well-rounded and complex\n+ Extremely easy and satisfying to mod; highly recommended\n+ Sorting and commanding one's troops is key, and the player would do well to benefit fromt he excellent command mechanics of the game; strategy is massively important and competently implemented\n+ Economics of the game add another layer of challenge to the game; trade and balancing one's income against one's expenses are both crucial elements to consider\n+ Multiplayer is fairly standard, run-of-the-mill stuff, but it's still densely populated and everything seems to connect well; the charm of the game, and its solid combat system, keep the players coming back in droves after more than five years\n\n- Politics, which are interesting and engaging in scope, end up being a somewhat weaker feature in practice, as NPCs are largely static during negotiations; this does break the immersion slightly, as it seems that your successes are based purely on stats, and not on the actual implications of one's choices\n- Quests often become tedious and repetitive\n- Tutorial is underwheling and largely insufficient to introduce the more in-depth mechanics that will be used outside of combat\n- Visuals are outdated and didn't stand well the test of time; even for the year of release, the textures and polygon counts are well below par\n\n[h1]LockeProposal's Big Day Out[/h1]\n\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/bigdayout#]Community Group[/url]\n[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/7611703/]Curator Page[/url]\n[url=https://www.reddit.com/r/SeriousSteamReviews/]Serious Steam Reviews subReddit[/url]\n- a catgirl, a femme fatale, a japanese idol, a doctor, a chinese soft boy, a religious twink, a merchant and an autistic university professor walk into a bar\n- the game itself is pretty ok and fun for what it is, and runs great on deck. but man, F**K THE ALWAYS-ONLINE-DRM WHICH AT TIMES TAKES AGES TO CONNECT, GETTING THE GAME STUCK IN THE MENU WITH NOTHING TO DO!!\n\n>> Update after 20h played:\nI really enjoy playing the game. It is good, it is fun and runs great on the Steam Deck, which is especially important to me, as I tend to travel a lot as part of my job.\n\nThat being said, however, is core of the issue: The Always-On-DRM actually prevents me from playing this game on the go. Having this sort of DRM is, in my opinion, only predatory and inexcusable in any way. I get that the online-components of the game will not work when I am on the move, but I am mainly interested in the single player experience, from which I am also locked out. I am even locked out of the main menu without a stable internet collection, which is just ridiculous.\n- Undoubtedly one of the best if not THE BEST modern video game remaster out there. I will summarize the pros and cons of this remaster into the following:\n\n[b]The Good:[/b]\n\n- Totally seamless transition into the new modern 4K visual from the old classic Win95 at a push of a key\n- Extremely faithful to the original titles (some might say that it is perhaps TOO faithful)\n- Game \"installation\" screen when you first boot up for both Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert is filled with God tier nostalgia \n- New UI with a complete revamp of the sidebar complete with higher quality artwork that totally feels in place\n- Plethora of never-before-seen bonus contents including exclusive missions and cinematic cutscenes for Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert that was only available on certain console platforms\n- You can queue multiple units while in production now\n- New multiplayer features and service is great. Finally you can now play 1v1 ranked and spectate any previous matches that was played including spectating ongoing games in the lobby\n- You can add, remove and create your very own custom music tracks in-game for both Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert however you want\n- All of Frank Klepacki's overly iconic classical and remixed tracks are here including various modern remixed that was composed solely for this remastered collection!!!\n\n[b]The Bad:[/b]\n\n- Minor bugs (though not a real dealbreaker)\n- The gameplay meta among factions/units remains as unbalanced as ever. Kinda of a tradeoff for being too faithful to the original titles\n- Multiplayer is still officially limited to a maximum of 4 players total per map in Tiberium Dawn, while in Red Alert the limit is a maximum of 8 players total\n- FMV cutscenes are all still heavily compressed in SD resolution extracted from the Playstation home console version and further artificially enhanced via AI upscaling due to the fact that the original master footage tapes for both Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert are still yet to be found\n\n[b]The Kinda Ugly:[/b]\n\n- Certain mission on hard difficulty are completely unbalanced. This is already another insult to injury as the AI blatantly cheats when it comes to resource procurement and unit build time. The fault of a clear lack of playtesting\n- Ok, so... one of my favourite films of my childhood. HOWEVER; not being able to start in SANDBOX mode from the start almost INSTANTLY put me off this title, I mean, really? So you have to complete the in-game island tasks/missions (***)*)*)*)*). And after only 4 hours of play through.... \n\nSPOILER ALERT: Dinosaurs escape their enclosures!! ALL THE TIME, its frankly trying to emulate the movie (Jurassic Park 1) as where the DIno's always escape and again SPOILER ALERT: THE INTROS TO EVERY PART OF THE GAME BASICALLY TELL YOU THIS IS DEFO GOING TO HAPPEN.\n\nTo conclude:\n\n1) There is a heavy lean on the movies (I personally don't think that's bad)\n2) It offers a SANDBOX within the opening screen however then informs this is blocked (WHICH IS ANNOYING) until certain missions have been completed.\n3)  DINOSAURS ESCAPE CONSTANTLY\n4) DINOSAURS ESCAPE CONSTANTLY\n5) The game is more interested in visuals rather than content\n- I realise this is intended to be a darkly humored game, but it is still fucked up nonetheless. I just can't fathom how such degraded humor can be seen as funny.\n- Good game that flips the p2w/f2p mobile ideas on its head, and succeeds. It's totally free to play, and actually encourages playing to improve over buying. Other mobile developers should take notice. Especially if it still makes money through Season Pass and cosmetics. I'm buying a few passes just to support their f2p model.\nIt also helps that the game is fun and addicting. There's always a 'one more game' feel...\n- Ib manages to do for me what so few horror games manage to accomplish, and that is to actually give a sense of unease and dread. Without going into spoilers, it's only a few minutes into the game that things start to tread the path of uncomfortable surrealism, with the art growing considerably more disturbing in how Ib interacts with it, and how the art interacts with her.\n\nWith all due respect to more conventional horror titles, say, Dead Space or The Evil Within, Ib maintains a feeling of dread and discomfort. Enemies can be evaded, yes, but there's a feeling of being stalked while trapped in a world you can't possibly fully understand. \n\nContrast Dead Space remake, where soon enough the horror gives way to cutting off an abomination's arm, then using telekinesis to impale it or another horror with said arm, then simply setting fire to the more mobile enemies.\n\nThis is not, I repeat, not to disrespect games in which reducing enemies to a smoldering heap of charred body parts is an acceptable tactic- there is a time and a place for the cathartic destruction of the nightmares that haunted our closets and lurked under our beds. Ib, however, leans firmly towards the horror and self-preservation of being in a hostile and unknown environment, where the only feasible option is to run, hide, and hope whatever nameless horror eventually loses track of you.\n\nAnd let's face it- some modern art galleries are creepy enough already, even in the daylight.\n\n- This might literally be the coolest game I've ever played, and possibly the best game that I've played in the last 10 years.\n\nThough, I might be the wrong person to ask though as Earthbound is my favorite game, and this game is obviously heavily Earthbound inspired. Stylistically and comedy wise anyway. The story is much darker than anything in Earthbound, but it's all buried underneath some of the funniest writing I've ever seen in a game. The writing start to finish is amazing, I'm only dissappointed that the game wasn't longer as there's a few questions left unanswered.\n\nI did normal mode, first run, collected all characters and beat the game in 12-13 hours. For 10 dollars, that's pretty alright. The fights are pretty open ended as there are like 20+ characters you can choose from, but I ended up using Rage, Bottles and Mad Dog. I found it wasn't the hardest game I've played, but I also haven't tried pain mode yet.\n\nAnyway, if this game interests you at all, buy it. You won't regret it.\n- Playerunknowns Battlegrounds\n\n\nIn my opinion hands down the best Battle Royale game released.\n\n\n+Built on a very flexible engine that is built to handle games of the FPS genre\n\n+Core mechanics of the game are solid and function with little to no bugs (In my experience, I've personally only encountered 2 bugs)\n\n+Vehicles that have good physics and good controls to them\n\n+The game in most aspects visually looks great\n\n+Plenty of weaponry (For release)\n\n+Gun mechanics themselves feel very solid and fluid, weapons have recoil to them and for me feel \"weighted\" \n\n+Nice animations for all weapons currently in game\n\n+The map size in my opinion is perfect. Large enough that you aren't always on top of another player (Unless you purposely land in an area with others), vehicles are useful, while also being small enough that generally it's not a painful chore to run somewhere \n\n++SPECTATOR MODE IN TEAMS (No more sitting staring at a death screen for 20 minutes waiting for your teammates, while also making your teammates feel guilty for \"leaving you behind\" ) \n\n\n\n-Server stability (There are semi frequent heavy lag spikes that can affect the entire server, from what I heard this wasn't as bad in the closed beta, hopefully this will be resolved soon) \n\n-Performance/Optimization is quite bad (For many, many people) in this, IF you don't apply some commands/launch parameters to the game. (I personally went from 25-40 fps on medium and very low, to 55-65 by inputting a simple launch parameter, this command/launch parameter \"fix\" does NOT work for everyone) \n\n\nAside from those 2 negatives I cannot think of anything else that's bad enough to be worth mentioning. \n\n\n\nOverall this game is great, even if doing solos, but is even more fun when playing with friends, I would entirely recommend it to a friend, so long as their PC is capable of handling it, or if the launch parameter works for them\n\n\n\n\nSystem specs the game was played on:\n\nIntel Core i7 6700 HQ Skylake 3.6 ghz\n\nNvidia GTX 960m 2GB \n\n16gb's DDR4 2133mhz\n\nWindows 10 \n\n(System was an ASUS ROG gaming laptop) \n\n\n\nEDIT: For those who may be looking for the launch parameter me and friends used:\n\n\nNavigate to the game in your library\n\nRight click and go to properties, click \"Set Launch Options\" and enter the following command\n\n\n\n-USEALLAVAILABLECORES -malloc=system -sm4\n- At a first glance I thought I would hate [b]Human Fall Flat[/b]. \n“Oh, this is another one of those wonky psychics ragdoll games that are obnoxiously hard to control,” I thought. \n...\nAfter playing it, I can now confidently say that my first impression was spot on. The only surprise was how much I enjoyed playing it. \n \n[h1][u]Positive:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]I can’t fully explain why but I found Human Fall Flat charming. The “human” is adorably simplistic and can complete daunting tasks despite only being able to jump and grab onto things. It reminds me of a very energetic toddler, especially when you raise your arms and jump - [b]it’s so cute[/b]. Something about an awkward “human” taking on challenges makes me feel warm inside [i](is it weird that I feel like I’m watching a baby grow up?)[/i]. \n[*]The levels gradually get larger and the puzzles more complex. I find that this works well with the awkward movements of your character, as you progressively learn how to better control him/her. It’s almost as if you start off as a clumsy baby, learning how to move and perform simple tasks, and end up as an awkward adult, still clumsy but expected to complete harder tasks. \n[*]I’m impressed at how many interactable objects are included in this game. Paired with a pretty good physics engine and you can really have a blast. Swing on a vine like Tarzan? Why not. Row a boat? Sure. Shoot yourself out of a catapult? No one’s stopping you.\n[/list]\n\n[h1][u]Neutral:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]It’s not always clear what you are expected to do, but I guess that’s kind of the point of Human Fall Flat? From what I could tell, you can get past the obstacles in whatever way you like. Sure, there’s the intended way, but if you want you can just climb over things and rush to the end of the level. Or you can just fool around to your heart’s content. It’s essentially one big playground with a goal at the end. \n[/list]\n\n[h1][u]Negative:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]It can be frustrating when things don’t go as you expect. Since your character has the structural rigidity of jelly, you’re constantly battling the floppiness of your character. My advice is: don’t expect to move with precision and you’ll have a good time. I also encountered a few bugs, like my arms or legs getting stuck in an object. Luckily there are many checkpoints and it’s relatively quick to reload.\n[/list]\n \n[h1][u]Conclusion:[/u][/h1]\n[h1]★★★✬☆ Surprisingly fun[/h1]\nI was honestly surprised at how much fun I had playing Human Fall Flat. I tend to avoid ragdoll/physics-y games - Getting Over It, for example, looks like an absolute nightmare to me - but I don’t regret playing Human Fall Flat at all. \nHuman Fall Flat is an absolute blast if you don’t take it too seriously or just like goofing around. I wouldn’t recommend it if you prefer serious games, as it’s very likely that you will just end up getting frustrated. The choice is entirely yours. \n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th][h1]If you enjoyed this review please follow me on my [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/26827738-%27b-Reviews/?appid=241930]curator page[/url] and [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/breviews]group[/url]. Your time and support is greatly appreciated![/h1][/th]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n- Lots of people parrot the \"tech demo\" or \"benchmark of the singularity\" lines without forming their own opinions.\n\nMe personally, as a fan of Supreme Commander, I enjoyed this game more then I thought I would. I only played the single player campaigns and haven't touched multiplayer. \n\nThe gameplay is exactly what it should be for this kind of game. When I first saw this game I didn't like how every unit was a hovering unit, but it makes sense with the class system the game has. Frigates are basically infantry, Cruisers are tanks, Dreadnauts are hero/high tier. The game borrows from Dawn of War with the territory control mechanic.\n- So, I only found this game because my favorite Vtuber Miilkywayz on Twitch played it. It seemed pretty interesting but when she started making her own cards. As an IRL witch I was WAY more interested. The game itself is great, I love making cards and learning their meanings and seeing how how the story changes changes based on your deck and the cards drawn. And the replaybility of it is amazing given its price. 10/10 from me. Need more games like this.\n- Did you lost faith in parkur adventure, horror and stealth genres? Did you lost hope to see realistic, immersive and HARCORE AAA game without press x to win killstreaks and cluttering UI? Outlast will restore your faith in everything mentioned and game industy! It also will prove you that indie team of 10 men can do AAA-Indie titles without greedy publishers that killing their creative freedom and forcing them to make a Call of Duty and Gears of War accessible for wider re-tar-ded audience. No no no, this game is not accessible to wide audience, it will scare shit out of most players not only because its good horror, but also because it realistic and hardcore stealth just like Thief was and its damn hard for braindead Call of Duty Xbox 360 generation, thats why its damn pleasant for old school gamers such as me who loved realism and challenge in older games before its almost gone from modern games.\nIf you love hard chellenge, innovative, realistc and purely immersive games such as Alone in Dark 2008, and if you hate YOBA call of duty style FPS games, you will love this one! If you love true surival horrors where survival is very hard because you cant even fight back, and if you love Amnesia you will love this game as well, and if you love old Splinter Cell up to Chaos Theory and loved Thief and remember that scarry part in catacomb,  you will love this game too!\nI love this game, its not perfect however, but its almos what i dreamed about for many years. Oh yeah, did i tell you that its one of rare games with full body awareness and every action in game totally animated?\n\nWhat you waiting for ? BUY THIS GAME ALREADY! I cost twice cheaper than most of recent Mediocre AAA games like Tomb Raider 2013, Bioshock Infinite, Resident Evil 6, Splinter Cell Blacklist, Call of Duty BO2, Metro Las Light, Far Cry, Assassin's Creed 3 and so on, but it brings more fun and joy than all of them together. Before this game 2013 year was a year of dissapointment (if you count only AAA type of games), but Outlast  game changed it for me! 10 men can do job better than over 100 men in big companies, and glory of  this game puts all big companies to shame! \n\nAnd a bonus: no precut DLC, no season passes, no achivements and stupid unlocks that turns game intro retarded grind, and most importan -  this game is MOD-FRIENDLY and allows to tweak AI and Difficulty a lot, nothing locked, and critical patches was released just next day after bugs was reported! Trully oldschool PC-specific way of doing business with respect to customers!\n- a very interesting FPS multiplayer and co-op, It would be better if it was still in development like early access because it needs some work. shorter spawn times, vehicles , larger and more varied maps, what this game has that no other FPS has is realistic weapons. you will not find another game that models modern military grade firearms more realisticily in terms of what they sound like ,recoil, look, feel ( to the extent that a pc game can offer) they are amazing and I would buy this game for 8 bucks just for that alone. But it does need work , this game could be a great title to rival Battlefield and COD franchises ( maybe not Advanced Warfare) it may not surpass those titles but it could give them a better run for the money.\n- I'm severely disappointed whenever a game points at the stands and intends to hit a home run, and then instead smashes the pitcher out after the bat flies out of their hands.\n\nIt looks wonderful, it's relentlessly and uncompromisingly unique, and it plays like complete hell.\n\nUnreasonable difficulty, bordering on sadism, a unique idea let down by just-so-imprecise hitboxes and the feeling of being far too weak to take on anything.\n\nI haven't enjoyed this game, I can't recommend it to anyone else, if you buy it and find favour with it then bully for you, but I'll never understand how.\n- After almost 300 hours in-game, I might be qualified to review this. I'll start by saying that Larian has really got something special here. I'm glad that the work is ongoing, but the progress is palpable. I've broken down my review into a couple sections to hopefully give you a better idea of what you can expect.\n\n1. Graphics\nBG3 has the best graphics in any CRPG I've played up until this point. The animations still need work, as there are a number of cutscenes where things and characters are misplaced. However, environments, spell effects, equipment, characters, etc., are all meticulously designed and you can rest assured that Larian has painstakingly made even the most inconsequential NPC stand out.\n\n2. Sound\nThe sound design is fantastic. Each spell and weapon attack has a unique sound. The ambient sounds are distinct with each area you are located in, as well as the soundtrack. The soundtrack, in general, is well composed. I could sit on the title screen and just listen to the opening song for a long time. The voice acting is fantastic, especially the narrator. The only issue that I've found with the sound is similar to that of graphical bugs: cutscenes need polish. Sometimes characters don't properly voice their lines when cued. If there is a large fight going on with many different effects at once, some new effects may not properly play either.\n\n3. Story\nNot a whole lot of tied up loose ends story-wise as of yet. However, the intro scene is phenomenal. Probably the best intro cutscene in just about any game I've played. From there, the story picks up on a grand scale, then drops you off in the  starting area. You then begin to pick up the pieces to figure out what is going on and how to best solve your little problem. The storyline so far as what's available in EA isn't overly complex, but the particularly enticing part about it is the number of other smaller plots and characters which lend to the main. Over the course of my playthrough, I've picked up several potential paths which could ultimately be taken probably closer to the midpoint of the finished game. \n\n4. Characters\nI'll keep this one brief, but I just want to take a second to say that all of the characters are very well fleshed out and distinct. Even simple NPC's have personalities which, for the most part, don't strike me as cookie cutter in any way. Care has been taken into writing seemingly each and every character, even many animals and corpses. Many actions you take have an effect on your party's opinion of you, but each character has different preferences. Some party members, however, are a tough to nail down as to what makes them happy, even after almost 300 hours. The personality differences between what is expressed through character dialogue and what changes their opinion of your character can feel a bit inconsistent.\n\n5. Combat\nThe combat is fun and rewarding. Each action you take feels as if it has a distinct impact on the battle. This is partially due to the aforementioned animation and sound effects, very punchy and flashy, lots of pretty colors. This is also thanks, in part, to the combat system adopted from 5th ed. D&D. The die rolls, while not visible during combat, add quite a bit of tension and strategy to a fight. You can't just fling cantrips and spells willy-nilly at random enemies and expect to come out on top (for the most part). The balancing is done well enough to allow for a fair fight, but one that doesn't hold your hand throughout and is rewarding when you win. The world design is also done so well that, anywhere a fight could possibly break out (you can attack/kill anyone), the environment lends a lot of variation and strategy to the fight. The enemies are also very smart, to the point where they will flank and take the high ground on you. Stay frosty!\n\n6. Exploration\nExpanding on the final point of the Combat section, the world design makes Faerun feel alive. There is usually something to find around every corner; exploration is very rewarding. Exploration is rewarded in a few different ways. You can get unique loot (while not necessarily as distinct as titles such as Elden Ring, there is a good variety of equipment to find), find interesting social encounters, or battles. Furthermore, battles can be turned to social encounters or vice versa. The versatility in how the player overcomes different situations is very well thought out. My main grip with the exploration is a personal one, but it's the map. It can get sort of tedious trying to navigate the world using the map. But, the exploration area is not particularly sprawling, so you won't be caught wandering around looking for a particular area for too long. A few important items for side quests also come to mind as being particularly hard to find, as they don't really stand out from the background. But, holding Left ALT will bring up titles for items lying around the area if you want to go that route.\n\n7. Races/Classes\nThe current races available are as follows: drow, human, githyanki, dwarf, elf, half elf, halfling, gnome, and tiefling. The classes are fighter, wizard, rogue, ranger, cleric, warlock, druid, sorcerer, warlock, and bard. Larian has done a good job distinguishing each race and class from one another, whether the customization options or progression. The only issue that I have is that the full PHB selection is not yet available. There are subraces available for each race, each with differing characteristics from another. The subclasses are all very self explanatory, if you are familiar with the 5th edition Player's Handbook. A few names had to be changed for certain things within classes, probably due to licensing issues. Also no multiclassing as of just yet. Curious to see if they decide to patch that one in.\n\n8. Character Creation (Visual)\nKind of simplistic at this point. There are no sliders which allow to you to sculpt the face or body, although there are a fair number of preset faces. A good number of hairstyles and facial hair options, as well as colors to apply. And yes, you can apply beards to female dwarves (lookin' at you, Rings of Power).\n\n9. Progression\nSimilar progression to 5e, except that there are several events which grant XP other than just slaying your enemies. Now comes the main problem I have with EA, the level cap. The world is very well designed and very dense, each action you take for the most part feels well rewarded with XP. But, a full playthrough of all the content could see you sitting at 4th level for several hours before completing. This is especially frustrating because 5th level is when you get your second attack and 3rd level spells. But the loot in the game still allows for a little more variety as it does continue to progress in power/utility even up until the end.\n\n10. Optimization\nI run this on a pretty mid-system (Ryzen 5, 1660ti, 16gb RAM) and I can hold between 50-60 fps when exploring on high settings. When in a busier fight, my fps ranges from 35-45 ish. There are a few bugs which impact functionality (dialogue not displaying during conversation, getting stuck on a character's turn during combat, random crashes, etc.). Luckily, these have all vastly reduced in frequency. While the gameplay is by no means flawless, it has reduced frequency enough to where it's not so bothersome as to ruin the game for me. Just depends on your bug tolerance. If you're a Bethesda fan, you'll be just fine.\n\nJust a final thought before I end this thing. If you just want to experience something different and don't mind playing a work in progress, this game is for you. Larian is fantastic at listening to user feedback for optimization to things as small as simple tooltips. If you want a full experience (and I 100% would not blame you if that were the case), just wait until it comes out. Hoping for early-mid '23.\n- EDIT: they made putting easier!  I can finally shoot even and below on the first few courses.  Ignore my complaints about impossible putting below.  I'm back playing this again and enjoying it much more since the putting changes.\n\nI have a love/hate relationship with this game.  It's the closest thing to an enjoyable disc golf game on the PC that I've ever seen, and on that basis I recommend it.  Unlike most sports games, where I can play better on the computer than I can in real life, in this game that's not the case.  After six miserable hours of failure in this game I can safely promise you that I'm wildly better at real life disc golf than I ever will be with this game.\n\nPositives:\n\n- Discs mostly work the way they should (assuming you understand from IRL play how a particular disc should  behave depending on speed and throwing angle) though I feel like flight paths when you're throwing up or down in elevation are off sometimes, but if you throw a fast understable disc at too low a speed it will tail off into the left immediately and when you want to crank up and hyzer bomb the same disc at high speed it gives you the long S you expect and so forth\n- No bugs really (a couple of times the character model went wonky when a disc landed on/next to a rock wall)\n- Graphics are fine by me\n\nCons (possibly only for me, you may not suck at this):\n\n- The entire game is based on a \"stop the tick mark on a spot as it circles a ring\" type swing meter, and I'm absolute trash at it\n- Feels like no progress, other than buying discs--I've upgraded the three skill meters a lot and it has never felt like game play changed much (lol, it certainly hasn't gotten any easier!)\n- Putting is im-fucking-possible, at least for me, it's way too hard--putts that would be gimmes for a novice in real life are a crapshoot, especially if there's any elevation difference\n- After six hours I have only unlocked the first course and half of the second course . . . I may try to go back to this at some point, but for now I've given up on this sucker which is a shame--there are a bunch of other courses that I will never see (my fault, to be sure--I'm terrible at that stupid swing meter)\n\nI haven't played any better options, so while I'm probably giving up at six hours in I'd still recommend it to anyone who's into disc golf.  It's clearly too hard for me, but assuming you're not a complete klutz you will probably have better luck with it.\n- One of the hardest game I've ever played, also the most fun. Satisfying gameplay + pretty cool visuals and story. The moment the game clicks for you is like crack. Finishing the game gave me a better feeling than that one time I escaped child services by immigrating to Argentina\n- This game is great for young kids. By that I mean my 6 yo daughter.\nAs an adult, it kept me entertained for about 10 minutes.\n\nThe controls took only a few minutes to work out, and there's not too much motion, nor too much text on menus, which has encouraged her to read the menu herself.\n\nWhilst the content is light on, she really seems to enjoy it. I put this down the the way the dragons are interactive and respond to her actions. This supports the way she has imaginative play with her stuffed toys.\n\nShe does stuff like:\n- makes up names\n- feeds her dragons\n- pets her dragons\n- playing throw/fetch\n- tells the dragons off for bad behaviour like stealing food\n\nWhen playing shes constantly chatting to the dragons.\n\nI'd love to see stronger personalities show up.\n\nFor example dragons wanting particular props more than others, and a little more interacting between the dragons.\n- *selects waifu*\n*waifu dies*\n*selects next waifu*\n*next waifu dies*\n*select husbando*\n*husbando dies*\n\nI LOVE THIS GAME!\n- This game has (while this review is being written) 10076 reviews. 221 of these reviews are negative. I think this ratio of reviews is deserved and here's why:\n\n- It's a fun story, but not something outstandingly new or anything\n- No one ever can deny that it has an amazing soundtrack\n- The combat is a bit bland, but this is compensated by the fact that the game is pretty short\n- It's a short game, but definitely worth it\n\nOverall: it's just a fun short game to play on a day off. Also, I can't get this soundtrack out of my head! PLEASE SEND HELP!\n- I am a day one player who quit the game within a few days. After coming back after almost 2 years, I am shocked and surprised. The overall improvement is great, quests are not bothering you. Story and atmosphere is hooking you up and the overall experience is good. Leveling up is easy and also you are not struggling as in most MMOs.\n\nDespite the past of the game, I think it is worth trying.\n- First of all, i'd like to mention that i found this game by chance. But it's surprisingly better than some RPGMaker game i've tried and it's not your typical RPGMaker which is surprising since it's developed by one person.\n\n[h2]Story/character[/h2]\nOverall the story is good enough to keep myself immersed with the game. However the story and characters aren't really memorable. For lack of better comparison, it's similar with movie which entertain you but you won't remember it for long time. Although it's probably because i've played many top-rated RPGMaker game which have more budget/resource.\n\n[h2]Gameplay[/h2]\nWhile the developer emphasize this game is story-focused game, i would also describe this game as puzzle-focused RPGMaker game. Store page mention 3 hours, but it took me 9.5 hours to beat this game. Although if i never experience bug (mentioned below) and stuck at one puzzle (where i asked help on Steam discussion), i expect i would spend 7.5 hours.\n\nThe amount and variety of puzzle presented on this game is surprisingly very diverse. Some of them are the best puzzle I've experienced even though I've played fair amount of RPGMaker game. Although few others feels repetitive, difficult due to lack of hint or force you to walk around if you miss/skip something. Lack of option to run/always run is also mildly annoying for me.\n\nAnd since the puzzle of this game is rather challenging/tricky for RPGMaker game, here are few general hints from me in case you're stuck,\n[list]\n    [*]Check for hidden/invisible wall.\n    [*]Try to use items on your inventory.\n    [*]Some interactive object have no impact to solve the puzzle.\n    [*]The game show some hint, usually by highlight/flicker certain object.\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Graphic/music[/h2]\nNothing much to say here. There's few usage of stock RPGMaker asset which used accordingly. The music is nice. While the artstyle/visual is on good side, personally i feel it doesn't match very well with space/sci-fi theme. The cutscene CG also looks good.\n\n[h2]Misc.[/h2]\nThis game runs well on Linux with only minor problem. I experienced one bug which makes me unable to continue the game (not caused by Linux, since it also happen on device which use Windows OS), but the developer fixed it after some time. The game only offer single save file which is annoying to me since i experienced a bug and few puzzle are very tricky.\n\n[h2]Conclusion[/h2]\nOverall Mihirha's Legacy is nice RPGMaker despite few hiccups I've mentioned above. The developer is also responsive to my query which is also plus point. If you're RPGMaker enthusiast, you might want to try this game.\n- Played the original back in 2017/2018, and I must say what a hell of a remaster, everything is enhanced, the visual the UI the user experience, its amazing to see this game in a fullscreen i can finally see the tiny details!\n- First steps:\n-set nioh.exe and nioh_launcher.exe to win7 compatibility (if you experience crashes).\n-first level (London) is poorly optimized, so better rush through it and judge the next.\n-experience this game as Nioh and not as a \"Souls\" game, tho I draw comparisons here\n\n\n[h1]Good[/h1]\n\nCombat\nBy far the best thing about the game. You get 7 weapon classes + 3 ranged weapons, and each of the 7 weapons has it's own unique skillset accompanied by 3 different stances. On the fly switching between 3 stances and 2 weapons, or even both at the same time allows for a ton of combinations to chain different attacks and combos. On top of all that you get magic, spirit guardians and ninjutsu. Sky is the limit if you're willing to experiment.\n\n\nBosses\nThe game comes with roughly over 30 unique bossfights, some of them will reappear or be demoted to regular enemies over the course of the game. There are only very few bosses I didn't like. Most of them are going to be human, but that doesn't mean they are boring. Most have sick movesets that make them very engaging and fun to fight, especially the DLC bosses. \n\n\nDifficulty\nJust like Dark Souls the game is as difficult as you want it to be. This means you get alot of tools that allow you to cheese the game. Like summons, or certain character builds centered around spirit guadians and op magic like sloth talisman which makes enemies move in slow motion. \nThe difficulty curve is a falling one, aka the game is more difficult in the begining when you're figuering things out, then it remains on a steady level with occasional spikes upwards. Disregarding bs like sloth talisman I would say the game is overall more difficult than Dark Souls. Combat is faster and mistakes are punished severly, even human fodder enemies can 1-shot you if you happen to take swings when they are in heavy stance.\n\n\nStory\nIt's decent, but nothing special. Nerds interested in the sengoku period to early edo period \nwill probably appreciate the characters and their interactions.\n\n\nWorld\nIt's not an interconnected world like DS1. It is mission based where you pick main or side missions from a map, personally I don't mind the \"arcade\" style. Main missions themself are big levels with multiple shortcuts that loop back to shrines (bonfires). Those levels are bigger than most designated areas in DS3, my guess is like 1.5x-2x the size. If I had to rank the level design... DS1 >>>> DS3 > Nioh >>>>>>> DS2 \n\n\nReplayability\nThe game offers 4 NG difficulties which spice things up by switching enemy placements or giving enemies (and bosses) status effects and new moves. Other than that you get Abyss mode which is most comparable to DMC's bloody palace. \n\n\nMultiplayer/Netcode + pseudo PvP\n3 ways to play mutiplayer: as summon/summoner, co-op missions where both players make progress at the same time and PvP (which is dead).  The Netcode worked quite well for me, even over wide distances like brazil-germany. I never had to adjust for delay and could parry attacks just like offline.  The netcode is quite good imo compared to DS3 where I did lots of co-op at Champion Gundyr and parrying was totally out of the question.\n\n\nThe other \"pvp mode\" is the faction/clan system. You get multiple clans that belong to 1 of the 2 factions. A clan gives you 2 passive buffs that can compliment your playstyle. You obtain glory by killing revenants, succesfull co-op or pvp for your clan. The more glory you obtain, the higher the rank of your faction, clan and yourself. Glory acts as another currency and can be used to buy npc skins, gestures or items.\n\n\nFashion Souls\nLike the look of a particular light armor set but hate getting insta killed by radroaches? No problem, at the blacksmith you can transform any weapon skin or piece of armor, and keep the stats of your preferred equipment. If you get tired of playing as William you can buy npc skins for glory at the teahouse (unlocks at roughly 33% of the game) which is the only way to play as a female as there is no character creation.\n\n[h1]Bad[/h1]\n\nEnemy Variaty\nThe games biggest weakness in my opinion.  Enemy \"species\" come in different flavours, e.g. humans can wield any of the 7 weapons, however this doesn't realy trigger the visual stimulation of seeing something new. Saving grace: the game throws you into different 1vsX situations, so the combination of enemies keeps things interesting, kinda like DMC4 which also has wack enemy variety. I think they could've done much more in terms of creativity when it comes to the yokai/oni realm given the huge amount of lore.\n\n\nRepetition\nSide missions take place in mostly the same batch of areas or in parts of main missions. \nThey try to keep things fresh by switching enemies and spawn points. But they still feel kinda tedious because skipping them isn't realy an option as you can't deny yourself the experience, rewards and loot.\n\n\nMusic\nGood but gets repetitive as only few themes are shared across bosses.\n\n\nFunky Optimization\nSelf explainatory. FPS tanks in London and I had random crashes. The later were solved by the tips mentioned at the top of the review.\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nI found the combat mechanics to be more than able to compensate for the games weaknesses (repetition, enemy variety). This means you've to take up responsibility and be creative yourself. If you're the type who doesn't like experimenting and spends 90% of his time with spear in mid stance, and plays like its DS (dodge > R1 > R1 > dodge > R1 > dodge...), then you're gonna get bored quickly. Although, I've seen those guys during co-op all the way up to NG3-4, so who knows... .\n- After around an hour and a half of bad spawns, scarce resources, and short-lived ventures into the more inhabited areas of the map, I ran into the first friendly player I had met in Rust. I had initially spotted him pretty far away, but I paid no real notice to him as he had a rock equipped. Eventually he got close enough for us to clearly see each other and, upon the realization that neither of us were hostile, we both pulled out torches as a mutual sign of peace (or the highest possible level of non-aggression that can exist in Rust). I dropped my old hatchet for him as I had just finished crafting one with metal, and he gave me some food as a sign of good faith. After nearly 30 minutes of searching and scavenging, we had pooled enough resources to craft us each some minimally decent gear. We knew that if we wanted to progress any further we would need to mine boulders, and a lot of them. I used what remaining materials we had to put together a 9mm handgun and several bullets, though I reminded him it was only in case we really needed it. I had decided earlier during my many unwanted experiences with bullets to the face that I would try my hardest not to run around slaughtering every newly spawned player that I came across. A few minutes out from camp we had encountered a player with a hunting bow. I had been running with my hatchet out, so I quickly took out the handgun in my inventory and pointed it in his direction, attempting to scare him away. When the player was far enough away we continued up a road towards a few stones. The area was surrounded by trees so I opted to stand guard with the handgun while my friend mined. Just as we were moving on to the next boulder, I heard the gunfire start. I turned around to see a player with an assault rifle gunning down my friend, and before I could land any shots on him he had already begun shooting me. It was at that moment that I remembered I hadn't even crafted a sleeping bag for the camp, as that was one of the objectives of the trip we were taking. I typed into the chat, thanking the friend I had made for all of his help and asking the player who had killed us if we had been intruding in his area or something along those lines. He simply wrote \"Sorry guys :D\" This is the single problem that I have with games like this. Why does it have to be \"shoot-on-sight?\" That player had obviously taken us by surprise and was better equipped than us. Even if he had a justifiable reason for approaching two very poorly equipped players (which he really didn't considering we were in the middle of the woods and he had pretty much all of the gear you could need in this game) he could have easily told us to cooperate by either putting away our weapons or just leaving the area. But of course, he comes around, sees some players trying to gather enough supplies to get to a stable point in the game, and decides to go out of his way to approach us and use unecessary ammo for a hatchet and a handgun with four bullets. Then, to add even more of an insult, he adds an apology at the end, as if he had no choice but to shoot two unexpecting, half-naked, unprepared players. \n\nAll in all, though, I do see a lot of potential in this game, and the good in the community does shine through every once in a while. I just wish that people would realize that they don't need to go around killing players who haven't had the chance to experience the game. People like that are the single reason why so many players on steam feel that they wasted money on what would otherwise be a great experience.\n- To be honest, I could've typed this review up years ago when I got this, but I never knew how to make a review. But I'm here now, and I'm doing this... Okay, here we go...\nThe Good(AKA:Everything):\n-Cars go crunch here so you don't have to crash IRL(Though I know that won't stop all of you...).\n-Great cars and maps with nice little details.\n-An INCREDIBLE modding community. There's and ENDLESS supply of content coming out all the time from hard-working individuals, all so we can take your masterpieces and turn them into heaps of scrap.\nThe Bad(AKA:What bad?):\n-This is on me... but it can get a little boring, as your mostly just crashing cars. There are so challenges to do in game, and there are so many things you COULD do... but I guess I don't have the imagination to do that. Like I said, this is bad on me. No fault of the game.\n-Game is really graphics heavy, so a higher-end PC is recommended. Nothing too fancy, but RAM and GPU are hardest hit... maybe processor too...(I'm not that smart with tech...) But this isn't truly bad, as you probably already have good spec if you're looking to play a physics-heavy game.\n-Load times... They used to be bad, but they've gotten considerably better in recent updates. But... the more mods you get, the more it'll have to load. A good PC should be able to handle it, but just keep this in mind.(I have 100's of mods, and it's not too bad...)\nAnd well, that's it. Sorry this it so long... One of my first reviews, after all. But this game deserves to looked at in detail. If you play it once, you'll come back to it here and there to have more fun. So, in short, I HIGHLY recommend this game!\nIf you read this far, thank you so much! I tried my best here!\n\n- i would say yes there are many bugs especially in the ne update where the cell doors remain open in normal mode and the guards take the new prisoners in the new cells and leave them there handcuffed forever. however this is one of the funnest games iv'e ever bought and it has brought me countless hours of enjoyment, the bugs might be annoying at times but mostly a good restart should do it :). overall i think this game is very worth getting, it lets you play the game how you want to play it and doing so will give you hours of fun as theres always something to do wether its create mor cells or make a execution room. and the mods are great you can really see the creativity in the prisons people have made i would definantly reccomend the checkpoint charlie military prion texture mod too.\n- Do you have friends? Do you want to play games with your friends?\nBuy this game!\nDo you not have friends? Are you in need of consolation due to the endless lonely Friday nights spent playing Solitaire? \nConsider playing Dwarf Fortress.\n- You can do anything in this game. Spawn a ton of teletubbies and grab a nuke to blow them up? You can do that. Get a gun and kill your friends? You can do that. Fly around? You can do that. Anything? You can do that.\n- + The amount of stuff to grab and to do, insane\n+ New engine blows the old Isaac out of the water (fire effects, shadows, etc.)\n+ Game is amazingly smooth and clean\n+ Too many achievements to count for\n+ Too many hours spent in perspective\n+ Best poop simulator EVER!\n\n- Incompatible with social life outside the PC.\n- UPDATE: Had the music on the \"+\" but moved it here. Sounded incredible on the first run but on the long run it's kinda grating. Makes me miss Danny's amazing soundtrack.\n- The amount of love and fun that went into this game is astounding. If you like minigames, memes, fun, and a challenge, check this game out. The “ending” was a bit lackluster, in my opinion, but it did not taint my views on the game and I had an overwhelmingly fun time with it. Definitely recommend!\n- It's illegal that this game is free.\n- Beautifully drawn and atmospheric\n\nAmazing sound\n\nSimple to play yet gives just the right amount of challenge without being frustrating\n\nI played and finished it in one sitting, Mainly because I was riveted from start to finish\nYes its 3-4 hours long but you will enjoy every minute of it\nI don't think I will ever understand whats going on with the story...but somehow I think that was the intention\n\nHighly recommended and definitely best indie game of the year, perhaps the last 5 years\n- So um, I don't usually write reviews like this or much at all really. I mostly make unfunny jokes and call it a review or something super generic. I guess I'll just write whats on my mind.\n\nI really liked this game.\nI felt like I was a kid again playing Super Mario 64.\nSometimes I get tired of shooting guns. Or slashing fantasy monsters with some shiny sword. Or saving the magic land from evil. Or using hyper combos I never remember. Or collecting resources to build a quirky town. Or time managing some distant farm. Or driving some tricked out vehicles. Or investing in status points to make super strong characters. Or following a long and convoluted plot with crazy lore.\n\nSometimes I just wanna run and jump around while I pick up some cool looking stuff.\nI, uh, had a lot fun playing this game. \nThanks.\n- tldr:\nits sniper elite 3,5.\nnot all that bad but then i look at good vs bad, bad wins.\nsince valve/steam still cant be bothered to implement a neutral thumb, its thumbs down from me.\nbuy it on sale if you must, not worth an AAA price tag for sure.\n\n--------\n\nsniper elite 4 is what sniper elite 3 should have been.\nthe maps are much bigger, the melee is far better/fluid, the xray cam is how you wanted it to be and it looks and feels overall pretty nice.\n\nso why didnt i like it, no thumbs up?\nbecause it also feels like its an update to sniper elite 3, nothing more and nothing new. at all.\nand there a re few things that really stuck out and which are just a big NONO:\n\n- the campaign is shockingly short. i read in someones review that they finished it in 6 hours. and i needed 10 or 11. disappointing\n\n- multiplayer is medicore.still.\nit feels half done; copied over from sniper elite 3; and i can never play more than 3 rounds before getting bored. \nand i dont think im alone because most of the time you find as average 3 lobbys for team deathmatch game types.\nbut multiplayer being multiplayer, everyone feels different about it so you may disregard this point if you wish.\n\n- the voice acting is one of the worst you will ever hear. the italian mobster you talk to sounds so bad that i literally started laughing.\nthe lady who gives you intructions via radio before each level sounds like someone working at a XXX hotline.\n\n- i have yet to encounter the high praised AI.\nthey are decent, yes, slightly better than sniper elite 3, on close and mid range... but if you actually manage to get to a high vantage point and snipe across the map, say 400,500m+? , (which is extremely rare btw), then the AI fails horribly.\nyou kill 2 people far away, the AI goes into alert and then calls the search off 5 seconds later because the game realizes you are far, far away and the alerted soldiers would need 5 minutes to get to you, kinda.\nso you can snipe at your hearts content, just wait every so often between shots.\ni have actually cleared an entire level that way. i didnt even move, never got spotted and no one ever knew where the shots came from. \nonce everything was dead, i just visited the objective checkpoints.\n\n- a sniping game that considers shots 100m+ \"Long Shots\" .\n... wut?\n\n- one of the things that bugs me most. dont let the big maps fool you. you only can ever go two ways, on one map 3.\nand finally it doesnt matter which way you go because you have to do all checkpoints anyway, which are both ways.\nthe majority of the map is covered with obstacles and terrain that can not be passed/traversed, forcing you on pre-determined paths.\nits a real themepark where you are forced to go where the developers want you to go. \nit becomes painfully obvious when there are high grass patches strategically placed along your way where the devs think that you should hide there because there you have an opportunity to stealth something for a bit.\nthere really is no freedom of choice when it comes to the map,how you approach things etc.\nall you can do is...left or right? and all guns blazing or try to stay semi-hidden.\nmeeh...\n\n- i remember watching a dev stream that introduced the game ,way before release. i already noticed a DLC button in their alpha client. i knew that was a bad sign...\nright after game release i found half of the items locked for DLCs that havent even been released yet.\ntake that plus very short campaign and below medicore multiplayer and you have zero reason to ever buy any DLC. \njust doesnt make any sense. \nwhy would you, what for?\n\n- releasing a game together with seperate dlcs the same day?\ni didnt expect that from rebellion.\nvery.shabby \n\nnow, having ranted like this....it is not a terrible game all together.\ni had fun while it lasted but it does not justify the price tag,ever.\nit could have been so much more but i guess greed and publisher pressure won at the end.\ni was looking forward to it and left disappointed.\n\nthe ending of the campaign already suggests there will be a sniper elite 5 but this time i shall wait until its on an 85% sale.\n- 1. What is \"Pyre\"?\nThe game \"Pyre\" was made by Supergiant Games and was released on the 25th of July in 2017. After \"Bastion\" and \"Transistor\" this is their third game. \"Pyre\" is an indie-action-rpg, which story is mostly told in form of a novel. The gameplay is very different to the experience you probably made in \"Bastion/Transistor\", which lead a few people to put a negative review on steam. Now you will no longer play as one single character like before, but you are responsible for a group of exiles. The gameplay at it´s heart can be declared as 3 parts:\n \npart 1 contains travelling/exploring the world\n\npart 2 contains social interactivity with your group (talking/trading/decision-making)\n\npart 3 contains to take part in the rites, that means a fast-paced action ball game (3 vs 3) without        a planning phase (like in \"Transistor\")\n\n\n2. Technical details\n-the game runs fine on my windows 10 64 bit machine and it needs about 8.2 gb space of your hard drive. Unfortunately the game runs bad on old machines, because you need about 4 gb ram to run it without an error (my other 3 gb ddr2-system couldn´t run it, I received a ram-error-message when starting the game).\n\n-controls with mouse+keyboard or gamepad are good and well implemented.\n\n\n3. What does the game do right?\n-great rpg-novel-mixture as a whole unique and emotional experience\n-despite the linear progression (mentioned \"phases/parts\" above) the game stays interesting enough to continue\n-a colourful and fantastic world to explore (no open-world)\n-great character-design and a good variety of different creatures, which affects the gameplay during the rites\n-beautiful artstyle with a lot of detail and smooth animations \n-believable and fleshed-out storyline (NOT \"black and white\") with a personalised ending! \n-wonderful soundtrack (mostly ambient)\n-the creatures of the world speak their own language, subtitle is displayed in old-fashioned English\n-rites: the thrilling-faced-paced-action-game has a lot of depth to it (skill tree/character selection/items/area of the rite)\n-selectable difficulty level (rites can be optionally restartet), which can be changed during the game (+ \"titan-mode\": advanced challenges you can add separately like in \"Bastion/Transistor\")\n-meaningful and emotional decisions to be made (I´m looking at you mass effect), thankfully there are no dead-ends but different endings (personalised!)\n-\"Pyre\" is \"2-3 times\" longer compared to \"Bastion\"/\"Transistor\" without getting boring\n-good mouse+keyboard and gamepad support\n-\"versus-mode\": you can play against friends together on your pc or alone against CPU (with all the characters in the game!)\n\n\n4. What does the game do wrong?\n-the fast-paced-gameplay during the rites can be very fast and too stressful at times (I experienced some unfair situations here and there)\n-controls are sometimes not precise enough, especially when the gameplay is getting hot\n-hardware requirements (like \"Transistor\") with 4 gb ddr-ram are over the top regarding old rigs with dual-core cpu´s \n-some minor bugs during the rites (ball gets stuck, switching between characters over distance, bad camera angles over distance)\n-\"versus mode\" can only be played as local multiplayer\n-no bonus material for fans at all \n\n\n5. tl;dr\nPyre offers a fantastic but linear action-rpg-experience with a great story, which is told in form of a novel with a personalised ending. The gameplay is a mixture of exploration, social interactivity and a 3 vs 3 ball-sports-game. The level of creativity considering world-building, character design, music and the way the story is being told is on an insanely high level. If you liked \"Bastion\" and \"Transistor\" you need to know that you don´t play just as one character anymore. But what you can expect is a game with a heart, just like their games before. Pyre is in my opinion a masterpiece and the best Supergiant game so far.\n\n\n6. Final thoughts\nAs a child of the 80´s I played a lot of pc games. Sometimes I look back and remember how I bought game boxes from a company called \"Lucas Arts\". There were times I didn´t even inform myself about the upcoming games, I just bought them because I loved their games I purchased before. For me Supergiant reached that status in the present time. \n\n\n\nUntil the stars align!\nIf you liked this review be sure to hit the like button to help other players with helpful reviews. Thanks!\n- Yeah sooooo I went 1k words past the max...had to pare this down...it's ok...I'm mentally stable...\n\nCrossCode is a top-notch indie in its genre. I'd mention it in the same breath as Celeste, Hades, and Outer Wilds. (guess I just did.) If you can at least enjoy both puzzles and real-time combat, this game is for you; it's not as much of a JRPG as it might look. The only real flaw I care to levy is that it isn’t incredible out of the gate; it’s merely good, and gets much better. I was going to summarize my reactions and add a \"what is the premise/gameplay loop\" section and have longer sections but I had to cut it all out so have _/5 ratings on the section titles instead. It's fine. I'm fine. Everything is fine.\n\nOk, review time.\n\nSTORY 4/5 NEATO\n\nThe story is great, and not quite what you might expect. It starts pretty light and cozy, with solid (and often meta) humor interspersed with cryptic moments. I like how casually the in-universe MMO is treated by the players. I enjoyed all the characters, including our mostly-mute but personable Lea. Once it ramps up, the story takes some exciting turns, too; the devs really know how to do drama without doing overdrama. I didn't relate too much to the story but I think it was told quite well. I like the portrayal of the antagonists for the most part, though I wish I could have felt their presence more often. The lore is also fascinating, if occasionally hard to grasp because the line between real and virtual is very thin due to the game’s particular premise. (The difference between real people and NPCs is sometimes unclear, for instance.) The ending was good, but I think the DLC epilogue wraps the game up far better.\n\nCOMBAT 5/5 WOWIE\n\nWhen you start out, combat feels almost hack-n-slashy. You can spam melee attacks and bullets for days, but you also have a charged projectile, a dodge-dash, and a shield. The elemental modes are absolutely the highlight due to the way enemies work, and the sort of limiter gauge they have forces strategy. Special moves are stylish and borderline absurd at higher levels. A huge skill tree controls them and much more; unlike some skill trees, this one requires choices, which is always a good sign. Oh and consumables are your main source of healing and buffs, and they aren't overpowered! Balancing win.\n\nThe enemies are really what make the combat fantastic. Almost every enemy has at least one gimmick and one visible weakness. The stun gauge mechanic is vital to all battles, forcing you to exploit those weaknesses to stun enemies and give you time to use your extra-long special moves. Bosses love to give you iterative micro-puzzles to fill their stun gauges, while minibosses are comfortably in-between. Bosses commonly have armor or invulnerability when not stunned, forcing even overleveled players to figure out the micro-puzzles to hit hard. (More great balancing.) Most weaknesses involve the element system, eventually encouraging you to swap elements multiple times mid-fight. The micro-puzzles will build on what you’ve been learning in a dungeon if it’s a dungeon fight. I'll mention that some normal enemies do feel like damage sponges at first, but you'll get used to this; the simple enemy design in the early game makes it seem worse than it is imo.\n\nPUZZLES 5/5 FUN COOL\n\nFor puzzles you've got your common environmental \"platforming\" puzzles, your specialized quest puzzles, your dynamic mini-puzzles in battles, and your iterative puzzling gauntlets in dungeons. Also almost everything is secretly part puzzle? Like, everything. They're an invasive species. They draw most of their complexity from the element system too. Each element has its own effects on certain objects and structures, and mainly you use charge shots to interact, though each attack has its own uses. Not much to say here; they're great puzzles. A couple may stump you for a while, but that's impossible to avoid, and I think CrossCode strikes a perfect challenge balance.\n\nQUESTS 5/5 WHEEEEEE\n\nWhile some quests conform to the typical hunting/gathering quests of MMOs, most boast some entirely unique content. Challenges range from unique bosses to puzzles to platforming to other familiar gimmicks that are secretly also puzzles. I won't spoil them. Quests generally use mechanics you have seen already in new, often very different, scenarios. NPCs are mostly there to be amusing or set up the gameplay, and that didn't bother me tbh.\n\nITEM MANAGEMENT 5/5 AAAAA\n\nItem and equipment acquisition? Engaging? WTF? Technically you get them like you do in any RPG. But, rare plants have high rare item drop rates, so if you know the platforming puzzle to reach em you don't have to waste much time. Enemies' drop rates rise with a high Combat Rank, which you get by killing many enemies in a row before the post-fight cooldown period ends and you get to heal to full and level up. This is tough until you're very comfortable with the area. Once you are, it's a whole new way of battling, using area knowledge to string together sequential fights. And what does the game do but give you a piece of upgradable equipment that grants the Combat Rating bonus to plants too?\n\nI actually cared about the equipment in the game too! *kisses Life Fiber Uniform* (yes they really make this reference) Equipment also matters more than level so the devs can control your power level better. Most times you can buy some basic equipment to explore, then return with items to trade to NPCs for stronger gear. Stronger gear has unique traits and you might prefer one over another, so it's nice that with trading you get to focus your resources on what you want. Sometimes you can trade some enemy drops for other ones, as I recall, which is a nice...uh, trade-off to get to make.\n\nQUALITY OF LIFE 5/5 HELP\n\nCONVENIENCE REIGNS in CrossCode. Text log like in visual novels? Check. Encyclopedia of story recaps, character summaries, CrossWorlds lore & terminology, etc.? Check. Enemy index? Check. Item drop rates? Check. Available trades? You beck. This is EXTREMELY helpful for an RPG, which otherwise would require a guide or plain luck to find rare item drops. Oh yeah also there's UI? I forgot about it cuz it's really good. Also the keyboard controls for swapping elements are a bit janky but I managed.\n\nAesthetics 3/5-5/5 SUBJECTIVITY WOOOOOO\n\nYeah if ya like what you see in the trailers and screenshots, that oughta be enough. I thought the art was average-good in the beginning, but like everything else the art improves as you go. They must’ve gone back and worked on old stuff, but not too much. The music is great. No complaints there. My one objective critique is, Lea has no depth perception -- the art makes similar-height platforms look identical. I ran into so many walls and stared at so many small flat gaps I thought I couldn't cross. I'm not a fool! It's the game's fault! But actually this time!\n\nA NEW HOME DLC 6/5 WTF OMG\n\nThe paid DLC is The Culmination of CrossCode. The epilogue is complex and fascinating and rewarding. The dungeon is an incredible all-elements send-off. I adore the new quests. And the art?? The environments, the enemies, the NPC portraits are all so pretty. Don't be fooled by the letters \"DLC\": this is not Discretionary Leisure Content. If you liked the base game, this is...Deluxe...eLite...C-content??? look these are not great letters to work with ok\n\nCONCDLUDSIONO\n\nWhat else to say? CrossCode good. Buy it. Do the thing. Also, look out for Project Terra, Radical Fish's next project. It translates their current style into a 3D environment with dynamic lighting. It’s pretty & it reduces that height perspective issue. There isn’t much info about it out yet, but keep your eyes out! (figuratively pls) I'm excited for what they'll come up with.\n\nHOLY **** I MADE IT AND WITH CHARACTERS TO SPARE YESSSS — ohnowai\n- I hated Undertale.\n\nIt was, pretty clearly, a game about sexy skeletons. I did not care about sexy skeletons. I refused to play a game about sexy skeletons.\n\nThen my friend made me listen to the soundtrack, and I decided I could deal with a few hours of sexy skeletons if I got to listen to the best video game music I had ever heard while doing it. \n\nI played Undertale. It's not a game about sexy skeletons. It's a game about choices, maybe, or morality, or curiosity. It's a game about pushing the limits. It's a game about experiences, about \"what would happen if I did this?\", about storytelling so intricate and complex and raw that it shouldn't be able to fit into seven hours of bullet hell and pixel graphics. But, somehow, it does. Every choice you make has an impact. Every object you check has a story. The soundtrack, the witty yet profound writing, the simple pixel graphics, and even the menu screens and bullet patterns themselves all intertwine in order to tell a story that only you decide the ending of.\n\nAlso, the skeletons aren't even sexy.\n\nMy advice to you: Go in as blind as you can. Don't read walkthroughs. Don't watch playthroughs. Don't prepare yourself. Don't even look at overviews. Hell, don't even read the Steam page description. Just buy the game (and give some well-earned money to a little white dog), and, as it were, climb the mountain yourself. Don't let anyone backseat. Don't listen to people who tell you there's a right way to play.\n\nAnd when you think you've reached the end, just think--what other choices could you have made?\n\nSo, yes. I hated Undertale.\n\nAnd then I played it.\n- It looked old when it was released. Now it's downright ugly. The gunplay is clunky. The physics are terrible. The bugs are ever present.\n\nThe RPG mechanics are top notch. The choices you make matter.\n\nOne of the greatest games ever made.\n- Joined the Discord Server to get a sense of the toxic, immature, insulting community. If the Discord server is not moderated, which is the first impression for new players, then you know in what state the game is.\n- Wanna spend 20% of the time scared, 60% of the time confused, 15% of the time infuriated, and 5% of the time laughing your ass off? THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU!\n\nFor the rest, save your money.\n\nIt's so buggy, dark, poorly optimized, and confusing; you'll spend more time pulling your hair out than the rare moments that it actually manages to pull off a jumpscare. Also, it is NOT procedurally generated at all. Watched a YouTuber play this game and got the exact same map and jumpscares... er... \"jumpscares\" as they did. Not worth $10. If they can fix the bugs and tweak a few things, though, it'd at least be worth 5.\n\n- I didn't like the FPS section; was honestly pretty repetitive and gratuitously violent. Also the 8 hour sex scene was a bit out of nowhere, but after like hour 3 you understand why they devote so much time to it. Overall game was ok I guess\n- My profile pic is the reaction i have towards the game devs that made this game.\nVisually disgusting, gameplay wise impossible and over all terrible.\nWhile it's possible to beat it and get all the achievements it's difficult and also the space level is actually visual aids it's so disgusting to look at that you can't even focus on the gameplay.\nNot worth it even for free which is how i probably got it i can't remember and i don't want to...\n- theres 2 options with this game, either you play the original without mods wich is still a very good game\nor you have the untitled goose, matt from wii sports, sans undertale, and barack obama fight on top of a mcdonalds\n\n10/10 game\n- Unfortunately Flatout 3 is a big disapointment for me and many fans of previous parts. \nWhat went wrong? \nGameplay has lost this \"catchy\" spirit making this game addicting. Controls has changed and physics as well. You don't have any feeling of the vehicle You driving. The game seems to be at faster pace. Too fast form me :) Too many explosions and destructions out of a good taste. Soundtrack is flat and colorless. It isn't bad but... There is no tracks of some famous rockbands as previously. Graphisc has not made any progress. It has made a step backwards as it stay in place.\n Flatout3 has a lot of game modes some of which are not playable at all. \n\nI like SPEED Mode it has something good :)\n\nThe rest is kind of fun ... for about 5 minutes. There is no career mode :(\n\nTo be honest : Flatout 1 & 2 have their own style and leave in gamers' minds an unique impresion and lots of good, warm memories. FO3 does not...\n- [h1]Gameplay : 9/10\nGraphic : 9/10\nCommunity : -25/10 ( updated, people see this wrong and keep asking me.   \nI wrote\" negative 25.\")\n\n\nPlaying with friends: 11/10\nCompetitiveness&balance: 11/10\n[/h1]\n----------------------------------------INTRO--------------------------------------------------\n\n         For those of you who aren't familiar with the MOBA genre, here's a quick explanation. There are two bases, each on opposing corners of the map, and one for each team. The objective is to destroy the opposing team's base. Three roads, or lanes, connect the bases. Low-level units automatically and periodically spawn from each base in groups, and these soldiers travel down the three paths between the bases. As a result, there is always a battle going on in the trio of lanes.\nIn addition, each team has three defensive towers in each lane on their side of the map, totaling nine towers per team. These structures deliver powerful attacks against enemy soldiers and players, but they can be destroyed through significant effort. Because of this, fights tend to center on the towers.\n\n         All of this happens automatically. Unlike in typical RTS games, you don't have to collect resources, build structures, or train units. You only control your hero, which can level up and acquire a range of upgradeable powers. However, its role might best be described as support for the A.I. soldier units. Players help control the battlefronts and destroy enemy towers in the lanes. The idea is to to open your opponent's base up to a direct attack by the A.I. and hero once the towers in a lane are gone. There are five players per team, which of course doesn't divide into the three lanes equally. When a player dies, he respawns at the team's base after a penalty period.\n\n\n[h1]Overall:\npros: A much better game than lol\ncons: A much harder game than lol\n\nLMAO\nquit playing trash game plz[/h1]\n\n----------------------------------------Pro&Con---------------------------------------------\nPROS\n\n1,   All At Your Fingertips – players have access to ALL of the game's heroes from the start. No need to unlock or purchase heroes. ( poor LOL)\n2,  Snowball Easily – dying results in a loss of gold, can magnify the effects of snowballing(Buyback system can make sure you don't lose a game with just one mistake).\n3,  Huge Variety of Cosmetics and Skins – players can customize individual parts of their heroes from both valve and community. (weapons, armor, helmets, etc.).\n4,   Custom Game Support – players can build their own custom games within Dota 2 (Pudge Wars, Tower defenses, Racing, Battleships, and more!)\n5,   Skill-Based and Competitive – similar to LoL, Dota 2 is heavily reliant on a player's skill, is very competitive, and has a large e-Sports scene.\n\n\nCONS:\n\n1 , Dota directly affects on your life (social life) \n2 , Time consuming( Avg about 45 min per game + additional queuing time(about 3-10 mins depends on your region))\n3 , Hard for newbies ( up to 500 hrs bot practices at least ---usually about 800 hrs)\n4 , hbp due to rage (you may having 3 r e t a r d s and peru feeder/feeders on your side of team)\n[spoiler]5 , Addiction(the true e-drug)[/spoiler]\n\n---------------------------------------ADDITIONS---------------------------------------------\n\nDon't spend too much money on treasures. All the rare items can be purchased through community market if you feel like you are not gonna get any of rare sets.\n- I haven't played a game that manages to make me cry and fill me with courage this fiercely in a long while. You should definitely play this if you are looking for a good story. You are going to love it.\n- I got this game for $12 off humble bundle. Me and my friends play it for hours on end. This game honestly feels like the perfect fighting game for me because there is no set style. I don't have to remember specific combos or any crazy inputs. It's just simplicity. Unless you want to do that in which you can. But it's fun for anyone. If I were you I would get it off of humble bundle for $12.\n- coffee talk 2 is out and now everyday i look forward to making myself a cozy drink and playing my daily session of it, just like i did with the first game. it makes my day so much better☕🤎\n\nMohammad Fahmi, the creator and the writer of the first game who passed away at 32, is always in my thoughts. thank you for creating this gem.\n\nthe game is currently \"playable\" on steam deck, but in my opinion it deserves to be deck-verified. i've had no problems on the deck at all. the reason for \"playable\" status seems to be the small text, but i've also had no difficulty reading anything. it's one of those games that is better experienced handheld, curled up on the couch with a nice blanket ♡ so don't be fooled by the \"playable\" status, it works 100% fine and you don't have to tinker with anything.\n- If you somehow don't know what this is: It's a meta-narrative focused walking sim with a funny narrator. Only you know if that kind of thing sounds like a good time to you.\n\nSubtract about 26 hours from my playtime because I'm a lunatic who left the game running for a whole day to get a silly achievement.\n\nI loved the HD remix (never played the og mod), and I really liked this one too, but I will say that a lot of the commentary the original offered doesn't hit as hard or hold up as well almost a decade later, just because the narrative structure and how narrative is tied to gameplay of many story-driven games has changed in that time (because of course it has), as well as the mindset of a lot of players being different. So I think that it's worth keeping in mind the cultural moment the original was made during... if you're the thinky type who likes to overthink things. You massive nerd.\n\nStill, it felt nice to jump back in and spend a little more time with the narrator, and there were some legitimately striking moments in the new content that I found to be quite powerful and engaging. Overall, though, having played the original, getting all the new stuff (and revisiting the old) felt a lot more like checking off a to-do list than active exploration teasing at the boundaries of the game and it's layout than the first one.\n- A Short Hike is a relaxing, casual game about exploring an expansive, mountainous island park and eventually making your way to its summit so you can get cell phone reception.\n\nYou play as Claire, a bird who can climb, glide, and flap to great heights using a stamina system based upon how many golden and silver feathers you’ve collected. Along the path to the mountaintop you’ll encounter Animal Crossing-style characters who are friendly, punny, and usually have some minor task for you to solve, ranging from finding lost items to making deliveries.\n\nHelping residents of the island is completely optional, as is just about every activity in the game other than locating a few feathers and reaching the summit; as a result, length can range from an hour if you don’t stop to smell the roses to a few hours if you decide to make friends with everyone and see all the park has to offer.\n\nActivities include filling out a fishing journal by trading in your catches, digging in suspicious spots, solving treasure map clues, parkour racing, and opening up shortcuts by breaking blocked entrances and watering bouncy flowers. \n\nA Short Hike has a charming aesthetic and a lovely, peaceful soundtrack. I felt driven to see everything the game had to offer despite not being forced into any of it and never lost interest until I did so. It’s a beautiful little world that will make fans of Animal Crossing feel right at home.\n- Started strong, ended annoyingly.\n\nMoral of the story? People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.\n\nIt paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that \"routine\" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.\n\nI liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters. But it all fell apart and tries to teach a very vapid moral that someone in their early 20's who has never had a meaningful relationship would idealize.\n\nAt least it was short.\n\n- This was a impulse buy for me just have seeing the new \"Fury Road\", but its a great game so far was kinda shocked it ran smooth right out the gate seems like today you gotta wait a week or month before a game can run proper though. Anyways beatufiful lighting, models / textures look good, vehicle combat / driving is fun, and vehicle customization is cool too. The on foot combat feels a little too straight foward though, the gore animations are kinda boring though, like feels like its a Xbox/360 game in that way, and collecting scrap can get a little repetitive. My final thought yea this game is worth getting but if you haven't played id's \"RAGE\", I'd reccomend getting that first, it's a extremely simmilar although kinda diffrent scenario game that will quench your Mad Max thirst.\n- [h1]A game meant to bring back memories that is similar to Super Mario World on the SNES and it does this with relatively few gameplay and gimmick elements.

After all, it has to be ready for take-off in order for children everywhere to receive their presents on schedule. But a wicked troll blasts us out of the sky just as the test drive is about to end. He went over the line and wants to ruin Christmas for everyone on Earth. It is up to us to bring the troll to his senses and save Christmas for everyone.\n\nTLoS brings players to one world and six levels of great platforming that are reminiscent of Super Mario World (SNES) but simplified. There are only six levels total, one of which is a castle, before the final battle with the troll. The only difference is that we will be collecting chocolate cookies rather than the traditional yellow coins. We also lose part of our cloak when we are injured, so it's not uncommon for you to find yourself jumping through the levels wearing nothing but red boxer shorts. For instance, red blocks can give you a new coat, which means extra life, or Santa socks and hats, which give a power-up or simply chocolate cookies. The power-up allows you to throw stones as if you had collected the Fire Flower from Super Mario, and that's about it. TLoS also offers a 2-4 co-op player mode, in which players will be able to work together to complete this short and family-friendly adventure.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3009359595\n\nSimilar to Super Mario World, you walk to a level to choose them in the Overworld. Once we reach a certain level, we are allowed to walk, leap, and even sprint. Additionally, there are other indications on the screen that show you how many cookies you have already gathered and how much time is remaining to finish the level. We get an extra life when 100 cookies are collected. We can activate a checkpoint about halfway through the level to pick up exactly where the checkpoint was reached, instead of having to do the entire level all over again. The game also features side-scrolling and underwater levels. The only problem is that if you quit at level three, close the game and start again, you have to start from level one, so you have to play the game in one go. This means that there are no save points or \"save states\". Considering the length of the game, this is not a big deal, but it's still \"annoying\".\n\n[h3] My Specs [/h3]\n\n[code]CPU: i9 9900k\nGPU: RTX 2080 Ti\nRAM: DDR4 32 GB RAM\nOS: Win10\nResolution: 1440p @144hz\n[/code]\n\n[h3] Conclusion [/h3]\n\nWe are all hoping that Nintendo will release their IPs on Steam so that we can play with them one more time. We may all agree, based on experience, that this is probably never going to happen, but Indie developers are there to make it happen. To avoid the tedious teachings at school, you used to be able to play these types of games in class on the usual Flash Player websites, and now you can play them on Steam. Though it's not a masterpiece, it's extremely minimalistic, and it's unquestionably too short, the 20 minutes I spent playing it were nevertheless a lot of fun, especially because the platforming is accurate and not wonky at all. Just remember, it's very minimalistic and may be too minimalistic for some, but if that doesn't bother you, feel free to go ahead and try it out.\n\nIt would be my personal highlight if there were additional levels, more secret exits, more power-up alternatives, and more hours of overall playtime.\n\n[h2] Final Verdict: 8/10 A typical gas station snack that turns out to be a surprisingly good one.🎅 [/h2]\n- I am a Filthy Casual (tm) who plays games like Mass Effect and Fallout 4 on easy and still die over and over. I got my \"you died\" achievement in Dark Souls 2 before the tutorial and stopped playing after like forty minutes with zero qualms. I have rage quit every single platformer game I have ever touched, and just sort of despise brutally hard things that feel like chores.\n\nBasically, I am not exactly sure why I decided to buy Dead Cells in the first place. Sure, I love the look and one of the few platformers I've ever 100%'d was Super Metroid (with a LOT of swearing and rage quitting), so 'Metroidvania' is an appealing term to me, but it is still inherently marketed as a game that is not for me, or people like me.\n\nThis game is hard. I have 11 hours on it and I can't get past the third area on any given path. I die for stupid reasons and lose all my stuff and... I don't care. I haven't rage quit once; in fact, I have to force myself away from the game after a death so I can do things like eat. I find the combat engaging and entertaining, the progression satisfying and there's something really solid about being forced to start from square one (ish) every single time, in a way I've just never experienced.\n\nSo, sure, buy this if you love hard games/Dark Souls/no checkpoint kind of games. Absolutely, I'm pretty sure you've alreeady heard this is likely to be up your alley.\n\nBut even if you're a dirty rotten casual gamer who button smashes in any game approaching action, and panics when the screen flashes red around the edges... give it a try if you get the opportunity. It is seriously fun.\n- Damn this game is so unexpectedly good i can't believe it.\nThe setting is perfect. The idea behind the game is awesome.\nThe graphics are so atmospheric.\n\nThank f*ck that this isn't published by EA.\nStay indipendent Crytek, listen to the Community and the Profit will rain.\n\nRating: FUCK YEAH DUDE!!!!\n- Absolutely Don't understand all the negative reviews for this game. \n\nFirst off: this game is a RogueLite in that death is permanent, be prepared for this. Death is a part of the game and you are NOT losing progress by dying.. it's death mechanic is very much like Rogue Legacy in that you keep progress that carries on to your next character when you begin again. Dying also isn't like you lost more than 45 minutes of your time. Every single game in this genre will have plenty of deaths involved before you FINALLY get that first win (in most cases). Some people are going to need to spend some time grinding levels, dying and repeat until they have enough sticker slots open to overpower things. Keep that in mind going into it. You retain your level and any big upgrades you acquire when you die so you are NOT starting from scratch every single time like you would in most rogue likes. \n\nI normally wouldn't review a game so early but I saw the negative reviews pouring in and felt I needed to add some counters to it. \n\nThe second thing: the art/music/atmosphere is absolutely brilliant for a game in this genre where most games of this nature tend to be relatively grim. As with most roguelike/lites its procedurally generated so the map, enemies and what have you will be different each time. \n\nThird: the forced timer before you have to fight the boss is a bit jarring at first as i've never played a game of this type where I have limited time to actually get there.. but it's kind of brilliant really because it adds a completely different layer to the game in that you have to manage your time very well. What do you think you have time to do before the inevitable? Do you want to run around and grind exp killing trash mobs? Or do you think that time could be better spent knocking some dungeons out (time halts when in dungeons so take your time in these) and getting some gear and arguably more exp than you would just wandering the map. Also, you absolutely have plenty of time to explore the map as there are shrines (you have to find them but the map isn't huge), that you can pay a special currency to add another day of time to the clock. If you see a review complaining about the timer and they have less than an hour in the game... take that with a grain of salt. \n\nFour: The combat is pretty simple but well done. There is a surprising amount of depth to it as well when you start buying and finding more powerful weapons (toys) that can do a variety of things and synergize pretty well together. Enemy variety is pretty good so far, each time you level up it adds more enemy variety to encounter around the map. \n\nFive: dungeons are fairly simple and a good mix of mini puzzles and fun combat encounters. \n\nIf you enjoy roguelike/lite games DEFINITELY give this a spot in your library to see what it has to offer. So far I'd put it 8-9/10 but I don't quite have the amount of time necessary to feel comfortable ranking it against other rogue games. I may edit this once I get to a point to see how much replayability it has but until then I'm eager to keep sending swords into a meat grinder and just adding to my power each time. Please look at how much time people have in a game before rating their reviews and taking their word. .5 hours is not enough time to really warrant a helpful review... nor is 6 in my case but I really don't want this game to be DoA\n\nEdit: Just beat Mormo for the second time.. trust me when i say you can make the timer go on infinitely. I Don't want to spoil anything BUT head to dungeons and kill as many enemies as you can to save up gold and another currency, and make a good loop around each area of the map and you'll find all sorts of neat things. As for bugs, I've had none and I'm at 13 hours of steady play. Don't waste time killing EVERY enemy that's in the open areas cause that will eat too much of your time, but focus on finding dungeons and the hidden npc encounters. I had my timer extended to approx. 8 days in game time and I also found a way to permanently increase the amount of time I have on subsequent runs. Give it a chance, learn how the game works before being upset about the timer.\n- DON'T BUY THIS GAME!\nThis is one of the best games I've ever played. It is quite possibly the best and most detailed Choose-Your-Own-Adventure novel ever written and if you buy it now the creators will receive *NO COMPENSATION* for their work. I am thankful i bought it when I did, while they were still involved, but due to contracting and political differences (ironically fitting for the content of the game) the 2 or 3 writers who pioneered this project were cut out and can't receive royalties anymore.\nThis is a game about the inherent flaws in dogmatic political ideologies, all ideologies including centrism and being a moderate, and it was essentially stolen by capitalists.\nI love this game with all my heart. It is a beautiful story about loss, depression, and finding meaning in a chaotic and absurd reality. Anything more is kinda spoilery so I'm gonna stop myself there. It is all narrated so you dont have to read the enormous amount of text on your own and it is HILARIOUS. Depressing at times but always that spark of humor lingers.\nDON'T BUY THIS GAME. And *DEFINITELY* don't *PIRATE THIS GAME*. Even though it is totally in line with the messaging of the game, would be a HUGE middle finger to the corporation that cut the writers out of their own creation, and is super easy to do with like an an hour of searching Reddit or something, *YOU SHOULD* not *PIRATE THIS OUTSTANDING GAME*. Thank you for reading this, I hope you do the right thing, and you should totally hit on that girl at the beginning she is super into you and there will be no repercussions. Peace.\n- Hi dev, if you were wondering whether anyone would actually use your HDR feature, I am. thanks\n- HAHAHA THIS GAME IS FREAKING PILE OF POOP. 20 FPS. the zombies can go trough walls and cars.  i would just rather buy PoR%n Hub subscription with that money. or i can wipe my own pille of sh/it and give it to someone that needs like like battlefield 2042\n- !!!!READ TO THE BOTTOM OR SCROLL!!!!\n       !!!!69 FREE PACKS + MORE CARDS AND COSMETICS CODES!!\n                        \n I did this for the NEW community:)         \n !!MAKE SURE TO UPVOTE AND OR AWARD SO EVERYONE NEW CAN SEE!!\n\ni have played almost all the MTG online iterations, MTG 2012 2013 2014, DUEL, MTGO, Magic the Gathering Online \nTactics, and now Arena. \nMTG 2012-2014 were fun but they were limited to the cards released those years\nMagic the Gathering Online was cool, you could trade and sell cards, do actual cube and draft with bought packs, but the interface was dated even after the update..\nMagic duels was sold to us as the end all, going forward no new program just duels and they would add sets as they released..(It wasn't, they didn't)\n\nMTG Arena (this one) has done everything they said and they did not abandon it after a few years. It may have just arrived on steam but it has been a beta then stand alone client for years (i was accepted into the beta 3/2018 and beta wrapped up 9/25/2019 to give an idea) They are releasing sets and keeping in line with standard releases, they offer a ton of formats and you can earn your cards and decks. i have earned thousands of cards and hundreds and hundreds of packs for free, 1-2 packs per day is easy, and yes it takes time but each month the ladder resets and you work your way up in ranked or you can just play another format or unranked to earn gold/xp,coins which translate into packs, save your gold for drafts and open packs and pick cards or just buy a ton of packs and earn them for free with exp! Also every 6 packs you open you get a choose your own blank rare gold wild card, and every 30 packs a mythic wildcard , also you get blank commons and uncommons in packs and by playing.  and PS there is a ton of people playing all the time, you never have to wait long for a match or even a draft to kick off.\n\n(New Account info and Instructions)\nNew Accounts have to play and complete 5 mini matches to unlock 12 free cards and 5 free starter decks, then upon completion you will enter into the client and see color challenges..skip that, click on the mail icon (top right) to claim 21 free packs (as of writing) from different recent sets, then click the home button (top right) to get out of the color challenge screen to the actual deck builder and match entry\n\nHere is a list of codes that will give you a ton of packs, cards and cosmetics, the packs, also count toward your free rare and mythic wildcard count you get by opening every 6 packs. by opening these you should have enough to craft your own starter decks and even pick quite a few blank rare mythic and common uncommon wild cards ( i just tried to make a new account and i got 69 free packs total that translated to 18 common 25 uncommon 12 rare and 4 mythic wildcards and a ton of actual rares mythics and hundreds of other cards (your mileage may vary depending on how many wildcards you find in the packs as well) \n\n(enter these in the store, top right \"redeem code\" field) \nIM SURE THERE ARE MORE CODES OUT THERE THESE ARE THE ONES I KNOW WORK IN 2023\nFree Booster Pack Codes ( 48 packs from these code alone for a total of 69 with the free mail claims at time of writing)\nPlayBRO\nPlayDMUAlchemy\nPlayDMU\nplayHBG\nPlayAlchemyNewCapenna\nPlaySNC\nPlayNEOAlchemy\nPlayNEO\nPlayVOW\nPlayMID\nPlayDND\nPlayKaldheim\nPlayZendikar\nPLAYM21\nPlayIkoria\nPlayTheros\n\nEXP CODES:\nThreads\t1,000 XP\n\nCOSMETIC CODES:\nFNMATHOME\nInformationIsPower\nCrimeIsAnArtForm\nAlwaysFinishTheJob\nFunIsntFree\nReadTheFinePrint\n:updated:\n\n*REMEMBER TO UPVOTE THIS POST AND SHARE WITH OTHERS, MORE PLAYERS THE BETTER:)*\n- Should you buy this game? So glad you asked. Yes!\n\nShould this be your very first JRPG? Yes, [i]but...[/i] read on.\n\n*\n\nMy recent gamplay was a 90+hr adventure (some offline) that was well worth the discounted price (-50% = 8€). The game's positive reviews are well-deserved, but tell little of actual gameplay to someone who might be interested in this kind of RPG, but never did play a JRPG/SRPG. \n\nThis was may be your case, too, so here's what I learned... \n\n***** [b] World of Zemuria[/b]: thoughtful, detailed, infinitely rich. (5/5)\n\nFor this installment in the popular franchise we get to adventure in Kingdom of Liberl, discovering a wide-reaching plot and tackling some mysteries. Cliché much?\n\nThis game does not shy away from the overused concepts, but delivers them with fresh spins, and gives them some unexpectedly serious reasoning. Talking to various NPC's, including random household members, paints the game's stage a somber shade of grey - with much emphasis on recently fought war and new orbment technologies available. (You'll be amazed at how many NPCs stress over a family member unable to get or hold a job.) As you march on, you'll learn that beneath all the apparent sweetness lies a serious, compelling narrative. Its logic includes economy, psychology and strategy and favours realism + logic to drive and resolve many conflicts. The overwhelming cuteness and apparent anime-aesthetics serve as a visual counter-point and a fun diversion for the consumer - as ever.\n\nXSEED did a wonderful job on translating and adapting the game. [url=xseedgames.tumblr.com/post/92769039590/xseed-blog-the-legend-of-heroes-trails-in-the]With the problems they faced[/url] and work ahead of them, this needs to be stressed.\n\n[i]Warning for the easily offendable:[/i] This RPG follows the tradition of amalgamating many diverse cultural and historical influences in a distinct blend of East & West. When the Gospel and an Apostle make an appearance, they singify something else from what one might expect. Also, while loved and cared for, children of Liberl do get exposed to real danger. That orphanage you helped? Burnt to the ground. The grand-daughter wanting to help her grandpa? Gets sternly warned, but ultimately joins for an incredibly dangerous infiltration mission to rescue him.\n\n***** [b]Playable characters[/b]: varied, with very flexible builds, require some system mastery. (5/5)\n\nYou get to make a party of up to 4 PCs and as the story goes on, more people join the Bright kids. The Bracer Guild they're a part of provides them with much quest fodder and some plot protection, but ultimately, they're on their own. Their companions are darn well excellent and come in very handy: if you can't fight through an area, wait until your ranks well. Of the 6 available, Schera's and Oliverier's antics made me giggle ever so often, and they are my favourites. In lieu of an old favourite of mine, imagine a game where most of in-game banter has Sands pitted against Neeshkas... You'll love it.\n\nSo what's with the builds? They are limited, but not in a bad way. The character level-ups are automated, abilities are unlocked intermittently and vary greatly (each character has a different build, but no class). You get a pick of 5 equippable items + some slots to fill wil crystals which are more than wondrous items, because they synergize. You may play around for a bit and just pick anything to wear/slot, because there's always a reload/retry or flight from a battle... I've actually made it halfway through the game before I read up on those orbal crystals and made my first optimized builds. \n\nAll in all, the character building is very beginner-friendly, which helps a lot. And there's ample room for experiment, which is great. Strategic value of turn-based combat is best described elsewhere, but let's just say it doesn't disappoint.\n\n[i]Warning for the lazy:[/i] The characters need to be fine-tuned, eventually. Final chapter presents a tournament which requires a higher level of orbal system mastery, while the final battle sequence ranges from enjoyable (if you got the combinations right) to downright enfuriating (if you didn't).\n\n[i]Warning for time-constrained:[/i] Beware the walls of text. Seriously. It's a living book.  It eats players.\n\n[i]Warning for the romantically inclined:[/i] There is much in-game talk about the nature of Joshua and Estelle's growing relationship, yet not one NPC seems to mind the fact that they're officially siblings (Estelle is Cassisus' daughter, and Joshua's his ward/stepson). Which is fine by me, because the two couldn't be more opposed than they are, and their confusion about life & love is delivered tactfully and with much wit. \n\n*** [b] The gameplay [/b]: a rocky ride to get through the story. (3/5)\n\nWhat I didn't miss here was a feeling of game being rushed and some content dropped because of time constraints - something my favourite Western RPGs chronically suffer from. The main narrative is one of adventure, with walls of text hinting at massive spoilers. I enjoyed it immensely, and can't wait for the sequel!\n\nWith that said, there are some glaring issues with gamplay and story presentation. The one thing I did have a problem with were wildly varying secret quests one can discover along the way (you'll need to consult a [url=www.gamefaqs.com/psp/933329-the-legend-of-heroes-trails-in-the-sky/faqs/62079?single=1]guide[/url] to get them). In-game Junior Bracer Journal served me well as an agenda, so that's a plus. \n\n[i]Warning in general:[/i] achievements such as best rank/weapon take a lot of time and effort, so be warned and grab a guide BEFORE starting the game properly. As TvTropes put it, my playthrough suffered a heavy case of Guide Dang It!\n\n[i]Warning for time-constrained:[/i]  I didn't mind all the grinding, but you can't escape it. Especially if you want the best gear the game's got or insist on micro-managing stuff. The difference between starting the Chapter 1 as L14 (my first try) and L18 (the second playthrough I finished) taught me to grind as I save: at every opportunity, as much as I can. And also, the railroading, apparently a traditional facet of the JRPG genre. Finally, hasty decisions versus small time windows. You can miss so much with only a click. I re-did the Prologue because I was merely getting to know the ropes and I missed two books I wanted to collect. The re-run was worth it.\n\n*\n\n[b]TL;DR[/b]: Very good game, with some issues for the uninitiated. Merits a sequel (localization's in the works!) and a second playthrough (especially for achievements).\n\n*\n\nThank you for reading this review. It was my first, and I hope it served you well. =)\n- From my nine year old: \"We like that every screen you can stop and color, and if you don't want to color there is a story part to it. We really like to do both; there are puzzles, different colors and different sections. I would definitely recommend this game for five and up year olds.\"\n- Guys this game is brilliant!!\n\nIf you have the chance and you like nostalgic and engaging exploration and mystery solving, I promise you won't regret buying this one.\nI honestly kept searching for more games like this at Steam and I was not able to find any that were this good.\n\nThe pixelated artwork is >very< detailed.\nI don't know how to describe it, but every scene feels like it's straight out of a framed vintage painting that you'd see in a farm cottage made by the grandfather of the previous owner. It just has this vibe, and I love it.\n\nAll characters are voiced and the VAs did a really great job, especially the main VA. Sarcastic, funny and witty lines are all over, as well as capturing the weight of each life, of their memories, and when they share their stories.\n\nYou won't regret playing this one! Go ahead, and have a great excavation...\nDon't forget: the answer lies in the soil...\n- Falcom's Action RPG Masterpiece.\n\nbest story in the series. it follows the latest adventure of Adol and his companions, stranded in an island and slowly uncovering their secrets. the tight, but well developed cast are absolutely the best written characters in the series. from party member to your fellow castaways all have developed motivation, personality and charm. \n\nalot of the horribad translation and voice acting have been fixed, and it finally got the treatment it deserve as a masterpiece. \n\nthe gameplay is an evolution of the modern Ys game. at its core, ys 8 is an action RPG where you control adol and several other party members with unique set of skills, moveset, weapons and super attack. each character represent an attack type (slash, pierce, smash) that are pitted against various enemies with certain weaknesses. great variety of enemies, amazing boss battles, music and story. \n\non release, there seems to be a big problem for the port, but as far as i know, everything has been patched to very good level of stability. over 70 hours, the game crashed twice (and saved by the intuitive autosave system), run flawlessly 60 FPS and 1440p without a single slowdown. \n\n10/10 game go buy so we get monstrum nox on PC.\n- VIDEO REVIEW: https://youtu.be/DzdF-i2drLs\n\nI loved this game!  It was a worthy prequel to Cthulhu Saves the World!  If you’re a fan of the games from this company I recommend playing it!\n\nIf there is one downside to the game, it’s that it’s very linear. Every game day you just make a selection to the R'lyehtionships options, a cutscene occurs and you get a reward item. Do that for a few in game days than the next level plays. These levels are just as linear as there’s very little deviating. \n\nHowever the rest of the game makes up for that short coming. The R'lyehtionships choices give great replay value, the writing is spot on, and the fighting is just as good.\n\nAlso the addition of a “skip incoming random battle” option was refreshing. \n\nSo overall i say that the game is another Zeboyd games classic that is perfect for the holiday. \n\nPRO\n+Great funny writing as per Zeboyd Games\n+Amazing graphics on par with Cosmic Star Heroine\n+Great music\n+Combat is easy simple and fun\n+Challenging but fair\n+ R'lyehtionships gives clever replay value \n\nCON\n-Game is painfully linear.\n-Very little places to wonder around in gameplay\n-R'lyehtionships causes Uber simplified “quests” to be glorified cutscenes\n-Needs more interactive items in the maps for more funny writing \n\nI’d give the game an 8/10! It’s highly recommend it if you’re a long time fan and it’s worthy a purchase during a sale if you’re unsure.\n- [h1]8/10[/h1]\nThe Long Dark has somewhat stylized graphics, giving it a small pseudo-2D impression that plays very well with warm shades in light and cold shades during dusk also staying outside to scavenge, hunt, fish and get firewood for cooking, heating and melting/boiling snow for drinking water while also tending to your clothes, tools and potential medical conditions isn't easy\n- Dear Dev, \nI love this game, if you're reading reviews, please consider some ideas to make it better:\n-  Level designing: Add more ways to choose, and different endings. Right now SoR4 is flat from A to B, it made me feel down compare to SoR3.\n- Alternate customs, and playable same characters: Floyd is overrated and all my friends want to pick him. Make a game with 4 Floyds running sound fun. Use lifetime score to unlock customs.\n- 2v2 Battle! WHY NOT?\n- Shiva (new), Max (new), Roo, Estel (Badass Woman Cop)\n- Steam trading cards: I know it's not importance, but who doesnt want some badass backgrounds on steam profile?\n- Do NOT buy this game! This game does not even have a minimap/GPS/coordinate system. You will definitely get lost.\nMultiplayer is fully of bug and lags so much.\nDo NOT buy this game!\nDo NOT buy this game!\nDo NOT buy this game!\n\nThis game is so f*** stupid\n- This game taught me about the diversity of cultures that our small little corner of the universe offers.\n\nThen it taught me to hate them all.\n- [b][i]AMID EVIL[/i] is very much [i]Quake[/i] 1 level design in a [i]Hexen[/i]/[i]Heretic[/i] universe.[/b] It's well done. We're a bit spoiled this year with outstanding '90s FPS shooters. Personally, I prefer both [i]Ion Maiden[/i] and [i]DUSK[/i] over this title for the following reasons:\n\n1) I find [i]AMID EVIL[/i] to be a bit generic in terms of theme; the fantasy setting could use a bit more to set it apart.\n\n2) I prefer real or low fantasy weapons/guns over wands and totally high fantasy weapons. Now, don't get it twisted - I appreciate that these high fantasy weapons exist, but yeah, they leave something to be desired. I miss reloading and all of that. \n\n3) The level design in [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is much more 'sprawling' (for lack of a better term) just like the original [i]Quake[/i]. Most levels are indoors in what feels like an underground compound (at the time of writing this review). I personally like the backwoods feel of [i]DUSK[/i], or the dystopian cityscape of [i]Ion Maiden[/i] far more. I want to look up at the sky in most levels.\n\n4) The enemy design is different than the other two games I mention, which is good - but they all mostly have a 'same' kind of feel. The enemies are all super fast, so most of your efforts are focused on running backwards while fending them off. It's fun, but gunplay isn't quite as fun as the other two games for this particular reason.\n\n5) The font and overall menu system definitely feels 'Early Access'. I know the font is being worked on, which is desperately needed. \n\n6) My favorite way to play the game is Endless mode - and I feel like that's a flaw in itself. It's the opposite for me with [i]DUSK[/i]. I want to fall in love with the campaign, but eh, there isn't really any story or anything all that interesting to suck me in. The secrets are super easy to find compared to the other two games, too.\n\n7) No multiplayer. Now, I really don't care about this - but who designs a game in this genre without building this in from the ground up? You know the community is going to whine about this. Questionable design decision to say the least.\n\n[b]Well, it sounds like I just dumped all over the game.[/b] Please don't get me wrong. [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is a welcome addition to the genre. The *great news* is that this is not just some reskin of [i]DUSK[/i] - it certainly is it's own thing. And that's really important. \n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+Fairly polished game for Early Access\n+It's the most modern version of the original [i]Quake[/i] we've seen this year\n+Well optimized\n+Lots of content right now\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-The universe is generic\n-No multiplayer\n-The font is too hard to read\n-Music is nothing to write home about\n-The secrets are easy, and there really aren't all that many of them\n-Weapons could use more 'oomph' to them; also we should be able to use the special ability when we want to as opposed to it autotriggering\n\n[b]I was psyched out of my mind for [i]AMID EVIL[/i] - and while it is certainly good - I think I'll be focused more on [i]DUSK[/i] and [i]Ion Maiden[/i].[/b] Because, let's face it, gaming time is valuable and we can't play everything.\n- (If you're past a certain age, I can just say that this is Take Two Interactive's \"Bureau 13\" game, except actually done WELL. If not, keep reading.)\n\nTechnobabylon was one of the best games I played in 2017 (yeah I know it came out in 2015, shh). Wadjet Eye has done it again with Unavowed, one of the best games I played in 2018 and an amazing capstone to all of their work so far. You can play this game without having played the Blackwell series, but you'll get a little more out of it if you have.\n\nIt's also a rather dark piece of work, with a tone somewhere between Sleepy Hollow (the TV show) and something like Buffy. Your character (whose gender and former profession are chosen by you) gets possessed and goes on a year-long murderfestival rampage across New York City. Eventually the Unavowed, a brave supernatural-evil-fighting duo show up, and with the body back in your own control you sign up to fight evil with them. \n\nAs the game goes on, you recruit more characters in Bioware style, solve mysteries (all of which center around that year of hell your character went through), make Tough Choices and work to make the city a better place. All in absolutely gorgeous 640x480 resolution pixel art. \n\nThere were a couple of puzzles that slowed me down (the word \"LEGS\" is going to cause me to make faces for weeks) but this mostly flowed very smoothly. If you're at all a fan of past Wadjet Eye creations, this game needs to be in your life. If you're not, it's a good starting place, maybe the best starting place except that its quality might spoil you for the rough patches of past games.\n\nThis game contains some gore, some body/existential horror that might be jarring to some, and a lot of swearing.\n- For context, I played it on PC for 77 hours including the post-game content which I presumed to be obligatory to complete. I highly recommend to use a gamepad or other controllers instead of K+M controls because support is bad in the ported version.\n\nNow, to start with: Undernaut: Labyrinth of Yomi is a first person dungeon crawler at first, then a horror game second. To my surprise, the game remarkably managed to show the correct way to set an ominous tone and a gritty narrative of a sick and twisted world with the story pulling-no-punches when it's required which I personally absolutely enjoyed. You, as the main protagonist will be subjected to numerous morally dubious acts to survive under the whims of otherworldly beings whether you want to or not. And adding that, the somber visual style captures perfectly the way the story should be told. And I simply adore the art directions and the representations of the characters in-game such as the Mad King and The Divine Child which I noticed to be quite different from the other characters' design of which heavily came from the Spirit Hunter series artist. Different from the other games, ULoY is a reverse-isekai game where the world takes place in Yomi Ward - Japan during the Showa period. It's a very interesting take on the trope and one I thoroughly enjoyed.\n\nFor the gameplay section, you have the freedom of choice to role-play as either Male or Female MC, as well as choosing a multitude of charming portraits for your subordinates with the ability to add backstories and backgrounds for the full immersion. You have 8 classes to choose from, with each diverging into Specialized and Comprehensive jobs. In my opinion, Experience Inc had done a wonderful job of not overpowering one class to another, instead adding great complimentary skills i.e buffs that lasts until returning to base, withstanding K.O etc. Not to mention, fine-tuning the equipment system such as weapons, armors, and accessories having elements of diversity to effectively and efficiently killing enemies and dungeon-crawling.\n\nBut there are two gameplay elements that I absolutely enjoyed using. The first being the \"Flowers\" mechanic to build ladders, bridges, fast-travelling and much more to progress in-game, connecting shortcuts or finding secrets. It's very interactive and simple in design but contributes extremely well for the overall dungeon puzzles in the game. Next is the \"Switch Boost\" mechanic during battles, allowing you to select 3 wonderful benefits such as \"No skill consumption\", \"Damage halved & HP recovery\", and \"First initiative + raised accuracy and evasion\" to maximize your strategy. There's also the added benefit of speeding through battles if you want to which is a plus for me.\n\nThere's also the \"Talk System\" where you could either Talk, Attack or Use Item to glean information and lore of the game as well as multiple-choices in the dialogues that implies your MC as being money-loving or having a dry sense of humor. Earning money is not a problem in this game, since you will be selling quite a lot of items and junks (which I did) that you could use to upgrade equipment, buy flowers and create items. It's a neat thing to have, that's for sure.\n\nAs for the music direction, there's quite a number of reused tracks from Experience Inc's older games such as from Stranger of Sword City and the Spirit Hunter series which while I appreciate they're being used effectively, I hate that they didn't have much variety and lacking impact in certain areas of the game. Though admittedly, I have found myself quite fond of the Mad King's theme and Kenji Yazawa's \"Namennayo!\" as well as certain bosses and dungeon themes.\n\nSpeaking of variety, the dungeon and enemies designs quality compared to other Experience Inc's DRPGs are somewhat lackluster. Lackluster is an understatement, they really do pales in comparison to Demon's Gaze and SoSC in terms of innovation and atmospheric sense. Whether they have the lack of production values which you could definitely notice since the game doesn't even offer voice-acting or simple battle cries for your party or being simply plain lazy I don't know.\n\nFor the main cast, I'd say they are amazingly done with great personalities, no cap. Hanba is your self-centered supervisor, grounded in nature but kind nonetheless. President Kaori is your money-loving mysterious female supervisor, a very cool one at that. The Divine Child is...your main driving purpose in the entire section of the game, at least from my perspective. Her presence and representations are very emotional, depressing and tragic. Which ties very well with the Mad King with his grand delusional obsession to his dream that makes her life a total suffering. The Cyborg, my personal favorite, is your reality-check being made form. I love them all though, really digging their art styles and backstories.\n\nThough some of their flavor text including the equipment and dialogues hint of their world spiritually connected to Demon's Gaze, SoSc, SoSW and so forth which is a pleasure to know. But ULoY is a standalone game with its own self-contained story, so you don't need to play older titles to understand the plot.\n\nOverall, while I'm happy I got to enjoy this game and invest in its world, I do think Experience Inc should've ported with good K+M support, charge a well-deserved price tag instead of ripping their consumer off as well as implementing prime QOL updates i.e permanent SAVE OPTIONS so I could save and backtracking my choices or place in game, fixing text that's not running their usual lines going outside the text box and adding simple battle cries to your party (like they used to do in past titles).\n\nI paid, played and enjoyed it immensely. ULoY is a game that you should not skip if you're a fan of DRPG since the story is a true gem in this genre, however niche it is. Paying a premium price (60$) for a game that's not triple AAA quality is my way of supporting the devs, but for those interested to play do not follow my example and wait for a sale or something.\n\nOnto my closing thoughts, I truly think Experience Inc. have great potential, and I wish more quality DRPG games from them while maintaining the same dark narrative they are known for. Overall a solid DRPG experience 8.9/10.\n- It is a very good game, some people complain about how there are no checkpoints in levels, but fear not, as they can all be beaten in a couple of minutes, and some people complain about how its repetitive because you need to do everything over and over if you keep dying, but if that happens, its clear you are missing something, so by heading to the IEYTD website, you can see tips for every level (secrets are not included, only how to beat the level itself), and if the tips dont help, after 2 tips you can just choose to reveal the answer, so those negative reviews are no reason to not buy this amazing game, this is the game trilogy i recommend every VR player to play ATLEAST once\n- Okay this is a weird situation. I personally don't like this game all that much, but I do still recommend it nonetheless. That's because despite me not being personally huge on it, I can't deny that it is a very well-crafted game that definitely will give people the experience they want if this is the type of game they're looking for. I, turns out, am not part of the crowd that is targeted for said experience. I just found the whole trial and error stealth RTS style of this game to just not be my cup of tea, but again I can't deny its very well-crafted. I also think the art style and voice acting and story are all very well done as well. So yeah, if you're fond of games of this type, then go for it. I'm sure you won't be disappointed. I, for one, don't think I'm entirely sold on it though.\n\n【グループB】\n- Not For Broadcast is in the simplest of terms, a multi-tasking simulator.\n\nYou sit in a news control room and you have to keep track of multiple things: censoring curse words, switching between cameras, playing ads at the right time, ensuring your broadcast frequency isn't disrupted, as well as keeping an eye out for a bunch of other strange things that appear later in the game.\n\nThis isn't the easiest of games as it requires a good deal of attentiveness. The description isn't joking when they call this \"high-pressure\". You have to rely heavily on both audio and visual cues to make sure your broadcast doesn't get screwed up. As this is the news (and live), there is no rewind or undo button. If you mess up and want to get a good performance grade, you'll need to redo the entire news segment. \nIf you're a perfectionist like me, a 10 min segment can end up turning into an hour of trying to perfect that news segment. As such, I do hope an option to quick save, or at the very least, save and quit, can later be put into the game. It felt rather taxing having to keep an eye on so many things for so long. But as with any game, excellence isn't an art, it's a habit. You'll find yourself turning into a multitasking expert eventually.\n\nThankfully, the actors in the game do a great job of making the experience an entertaining one. There is a good amount of humour written into each broadcast, although I must admit I wasn't quite able to pay attention to all the dialogue, as I was too busy trying to switch to the right cameras whilst ensuring my electricity didn't get cut out. Luckily, the game does have an archive which allows you to playback the broadcasts. Without that, I'd probably be missing out on 70% of what was going on.\n\nThere is also a text narrative, choices matter portion in between news segments. As of now, it feels a little out of place and incomplete, but then again, this is an Early Access review.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that at the time of writing this review, there isn't really any \"propaganda\" aspect to the game yet.\n\nPerformance-wise, the game runs pretty smoothly. I did encounter occasional crashes if I looked left or right and back and forth too quickly, but other than that, the game is pretty much bug-free. Also, this game has my RTX 2070 Super running at rather high temps for some reason. Rather surprising for a game that doesn't appear to have particularly high-end graphics.\n\nAnyway, I'll be looking forward to see what comes next for this game. Definitely worth the buy despite being Early Access.\n- One of the few exceptions of \"dont buy games on Early Access\".\n\nThis game, on early access, has more gameplay value than a lot of games on full access + 5 dlcs.\n\n- From afar, the life of royalty can seem very glamorous: the lavish lifestyle, the royal finery, fancy food and drink. However, the life of a prince can be very difficult and traumatic, when your very birth was a disappointment to the king. \n\nUGLY is the fragmented story of a prince who was considered by his father, the king, to be much too ugly to show his face. Forced to wear a mask and bear his father’s unfair demands, we wake up amongst the ruins of what must have been a rather fantastic palace. \n\nThe main mechanic in UGLY is the magical mirror that the prince receives at the beginning. This mirror allows him to create a reflection of himself within the space that you can switch between. You can place the mirror either vertically or horizontally, allowing you to enter rooms that may be blocked by impassable walls, or reaching platforms high up in hard to reach areas.\n\nThere are several different areas, each locked by a door with a particular coloured gemstone. To progress you must find the special key for each door, and inside clear out all of the rooms by, again, finding keys and unlocking every door. Once you’ve cleared an area, and collected the next coloured-gemstone-key, you will be confronted with that area’s boss. \n\nThe boss battles are extremely fun, and are like a much more intensified puzzle than a “fight”. Some of the puzzle rooms are real mind bogglers, and it will take all of your ingenuity to flip the switch in your brain to maximize the mechanics and figure out all of the puzzles. Each room is different and challenging, and the background design is chalk full of visual storytelling. \n\nFrom drawings and pictures on walls, to very interesting machines, to a whole theatre room where you can tell the little prince used to put on puppet shows for his loving mother and all of his stuffed animals.  The story is a treatise to what can happen to a child who’s tenderness and creativity is stifled by the unseemly and unreasonable demands of a narcissistic parent. The wonderful part is that the story is left up to the player to figure out. \n\nThere are secrets to uncover: hidden films and the prince’s memories to unlock. Every subsequent area adds a new mechanic to work with, or around, to the puzzling (such as pink pant that doesn’t allow you to switch to your reflection, or broken glass that your reflection can actually touch). \n\nThe game is very reminiscent of Braid, and considering how mind-blowing and phenomenal that game was when it was originally released in 2008, it’s fantastic to see another game following in those creative footsteps and create such a stellar experience for gamers everywhere. \n\nI would recommend this game to anyone who likes puzzle games, a challenge, or a heart wrenching story.\n- B4B - 59.99 euro. You recieve:\nBad AI, bad animations, online only*, no mod support, no varying sound cues, music where??, characters with zero personality, tacked on weapon modding with guns that all feel the same, no environmental physics, unfair director (spawning 40 tallboys at start of map)\n(*otherwise no progression)\n\nL4D1 & 2 - 8.19 euro each (often on sale for 1.99-2.99 each). You recieve:\nGreat companion & enemy AI, memorable dialogue (I hate hospitals, grabbing pills), motion capture, great music & cues, overwhelming mod support, all weapons have a purpose and vary nicely, incredibly memorable characters, actually good director, etc etc.\n\nObvious choice.\n- I highly recommend this game for the atmosphere alone. It's worth learning the ins and outs of the combat just to explore the wider world of this game.\n- Alpha, Beta, Finished Product... I hear lots of Blah blah blahs complaining about this game not being out of Alpha after years and years, but it isn't like we've been paying a monthly fee for it.  I paid one time to support this game and I've got years of play out of a product that I enjoy.  There aren't too many games that scratch an itch like this game for me... Open World, completely editable/buildable environment and zombies!  One of my biggest issues with a game that I like is that after I buy it, they release a few DLCs and then move on to their next product.  Alpha, Beta, Finished or Not... the developers have given me years of standing by their product and many updates with new content and mechanics.  For that alone, I love their game!\n\nGraphics: 3 outta 5 graphics, she looks a little dated but they keep updating it... It looks better than it originally did.  There's growth\nReplayability: 5 outta 5\nGameplay:3 outta 5... sometimes she's a little clunky\n\nI definitely still believe that this game is worth buying and that they devs and their product is worth supporting.  Hopefully this is helpful to someone.\n- Pros\n\n- No crates which you can waste your money.\n- You don't pay for the extra maps.\n- Less Russians.\n- Less cheaters.\n- Very alive game (after 16 years).\n- More than 11, 000 active servers (according to Gametracker). \n- You don't need actually PC to play this (you can run it on a Calculator).\n- More mods than games on Steam.\n- You can spray in the game.\n- You can buy MP5.\n- You can use Flashlight and Nightvision.\n- You can choose a character.\n- You can play Assassination mod.\n- You can use Bunnyhop.\n- You can play CSGO MOD.\n\nAnd other stuff I can't remember....\n- [b][u] TL;DR[/u] [/b] Finally finish the fight on PC after 13 years.\n[b][u] Long version: [/u] [/b]\n[h1] Halo Combat Evolved Anniversary: [/h1] The very first halo with remastered visuals but the same gameplay. 20 years old now, the level design can sometimes become repetitive. Especially on the library mission. The remastered visuals look nice but I find that it deviates way too much from the original vision of Bungie. You can switch between the old and new graphics with a press of a button. \nOverall a smooth [b][i] Wort out of 10 with a touch of \"this cave is not a natural formation\".[/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Halo 2 Anniversary: [/h1] The second game in the series and the last one for the PC until 15 years later with the release of MCC. The game has remastered visuals as well as fully CGI remastered cutscenes. The remastered visuals are really well done and true to the original artwork and the CGI cutscenes are top notch with quality that can easily surpass the CGI level of some movies. Same gameplay from 15 years ago but it surprisingly holds up pretty well. I did experience some stuttering on this game ever so often but that could just be my system. Again you can switch between the classic and remastered graphics with the press of a button. Even during cutscenes. Just don't shake the light bulb. \nIn summary, I'd give this game a [b][i] Wort Wort Wort out of 10 with a slight slight tinge of heresy. [/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Halo 3: [/h1] The magnum opus of Bungie and the big final conclusion to the halo trilogy. The port to PC was a decent port (well it better be after 13 years!) with little to no technical issues. I faced a desync issue during co-op play on a specific mission until I locked my framerate to 60 fps. I tried to replicate the issue again later on but I had no luck reproducing it. If only were it so easy.\nThe gameplay is similar but sometimes bigger in scale than halo 2 and holds up well. The visuals have not been remastered for halo 3 but they still look good for what they are. \nI give this game a [b][i] Wort in the Wort out of 10. Wake me when you need me. [/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Halo 3 ODST: [/h1] Halo ODST takes place during the events of Halo 2 and follows a squad of Orbital Drop Shock Troppers that get deployed to New Mombasa. It uses the same engine as Halo 3 and so the fidelity isnt much a leap from Halo 3 but the art style is drastically different and takes on a noir style with washed out colors. Kinda reminds me a little bit of Deus ex Human Revolution tbh. Even more so because of its semi open world/hub design.\nThe PC port is as good as Halo 3 if not better and I didn't face any issues. \nThis is a solid [b][i] how many engineers did you murder before dare asked out of 10. [/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Halo Reach: [/h1] Halo Reach would be the final halo game that would be developed by Bungie. Ironically, this game was the first to release for the MCC on PC and is also chronologically the first in the timeline of the main series. Quite frankly the port was not very good. It had audio issues, visual downgrades and many more problems. However in time, 343 has corrected almost all of these issues and now it is a great port to PC. Reach takes place before the events of Halo Combat Evolved and is a prequel to the entire series. It puts you into the shoes of Noble Six, a member of Noble Team that are tasked to... well I wont spoil everything here. Just know that you're stepping into some shoes the rest of the squad would rather leave unfilled. \nThe artstyle is a grittier and more grim depiction of the halo universe and fits well within the narrative of the game. \nThis game gets a [b][i] pair of gúta out of 10 from me. [/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Halo 4: [/h1] After Bungie stepped down as developers of the halo franchise, the mantle was given to 343 industies to carry on the legacy of Halo. The very first game by 343i came in the form of Halo 4 and would be a direct sequel to the conclusion of the Halo trilogy in Halo 3. \nThe change in team came with it, the change in art style, level design and gameplay loop. I will just call this change \"different\". \nThe port to PC is pretty decent aside from some stuttering I faced during coop play. \nOverall this game is a [b][i] 343 out of 10 unless you get on the bad side of Cortana. [/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Multiplayer, Firefight and Spartan Ops: [/h1]\nEach game has its own multiplayer except for Halo 3 ODST. The multiplayer itself is fun and they have enabled cross-play between platforms making finding matches easier.\nThere are so many multiplayer game modes within each game and covering them all is beyond the scope of this short review. :) \nThere are your traditional TDM, Big Team Battle, Capture the flag and such; but there are also interesting and odd game types which are a good change of pace.\nAs for the multiplayer progression, there is a battlepass system in place where you can unlock various cosmetics such as armor parts, gun skins and vehicle skins for each game.\nThe game is updated with seasons that add more features and cosmetics.\nAlthough the idea of a battlepass may put some of us off, the system is completely free and you dont miss out on previous seasons as they are all accessible indefinitely.\nYou can even pick and choose which seasons to progress in.\nIf you want some co-op within multiplayer, then Halo Reach and Halo 3 ODST have a mode called firefight where you have to fend off wave after wave of enemies with changing modifiers or mutations. \nAn alternative to firefight is Spartan Ops, a game mode exclusive to Halo 4. It is a cooperative campaign(you can solo) where you get to use your customised spartan from multiplayer. Keep in mind that although there is a set narrative here, the quality of production in spartan ops is nowhere near the level as that of the main Halo 4 campaign.\n\nOverall the multiplayer, firefight and spartan ops are solid additions to the already superb collection of 6 campaigns. The only thing missing right now is a custom server browser which I believe is in the works. \nEDIT: They have added in a custom server browser for Halo Reach, Halo: Combat Evolved, Halo 2 and Halo 3! :D\n\n[h1] Forge and Theatre: [/h1] \nForge is where you can fool around with various kinds of halo props and items within maps and make your own creations that you can share with others. It has basically endless content.\nJust a cherry on top over all the other content that you are getting with the collection. Forge is available for Halo 2 anniversary, Halo 3, Halo Reach and Halo 4.\nTheatre mode is exactly what it sounds like. Record clips from the game and play them back later with a free form camera. Perfect for content creation. \n\n[h1] Modding: [/h1]\nAs if there wasn't already so much content in the vanilla game, Halo MCC allows you run the game in anti cheat free mode, where you can install and play community created mods.\nGoes without saying that this will only age like fine wine.\n\n[h1] Well that's it folks: [/h1]\nYou mad lads that made it up to here; thank you for reading the ramblings of a mad man. \nDustin Echoes will forever watch over you.\n- Mysterious, claustrophobic, and psychedelic --- this is undoubtedly the most unorthodox game in The Legend of Heroes series. This game is basically what you get when you put The Legend of Heroes, Shin Megami Tensei and a certain Silent Hill title [i](which I won't specify for a good reason)[/i] into a blender machine. Nonetheless, it is still very much an LoH game at its core, though its semi-fandisc nature holds it back from being as coherent of an overall package as its two predecessors.\n\nI cannot stress this enough: [b][u]If you were a big fan of the previous two games, you will not necessarily like this game; on the other hand, if you didn't hold them in high regard, this game is still worth trying out due to its stark contrast in tone and structure from its predecessors.[/u][/b] There is a good reason this game is named [u][b]\"the 3rd\"[/b][/u] instead of \"Third Chapter\", because it is definitely not a direct continuation of SC (i.e. Trails in the Sky Second Chapter).\n\nIf you want more of the upbeat, kingdom-trotting adventure of the previous two games, you're not going to find it here.\n\nIf you want towns full of vibrant NPCs, you're not going to find it here (at least not in the main story).\n\nIf you want a protagonist who wears their heart on their sleeves and acts like your typical spunky JRPG hero, you're not going to find it here.\n\nThis game is first and foremost [u][b]a gameplay-heavy dungeon crawler[/b][/u], one that is light on (main) story but carries some very heavy themes. The most interesting aspect of the game to me is that [i][b]the protagonist Kevin Graham is not a hero[/b][/i] (which is ironic considering the name of this series). This game is his harrowing personal journey, one in which he doesn't set out to save the world, his homeland, or anyone for that matter.\n\nThere are initially only two playable characters, but more and more join your party at a steady pace throughout the game [b](16 in total)[/b]. Be sure to talk to these characters when you swap them out of your party; they are ironically the only source of \"NPC dialogue\" for the majority of the game, and their dialogue updates after every plot point like in most other Falcom games. You know Falcom has done their NPCs justice in FC&SC when their complete absence here creates an uneasy sense of isolation.\n\nThere are visual-novel-like sidequests (called Memory Doors) which serve to further flesh out the characters and setting of this series, giving all the playable (and some non-playable) characters their own spotlight to shine in. To this day the cast of Trails in the Sky still remains my favorite cast of any RPG, and I have to give a good chunk of the credit to this game's characterization of them.\n\nThese sidequests take up a sizeable chunk of the game, which one might argue distract from the dungeon-crawling main game. Fortunately, they don't expire like in FC&SC and can be accessed at any point in the game before the final dungeon (with convenient fast-travel to boot), effectively enabling the player to pace the game themselves. \n\nWord of warning though, some of these sidequests take on a much darker tone than one would expect: there's a very good reason why the console versions of this game was censored [i](don't worry, the Steam version isn't)[/i]. Please be mentally prepared for the final sidequest you come across in the game, i.e. [spoiler]Star Door 15[/spoiler].\n\nThere is also plenty of foreshadowing for the rest of the series littered throughout the game, some obvious and some very subtle [i](I'm looking at you Mr. N)[/i]. Needless to say, this game gives you lots to think about if you are into the lore of this series, especially if you have played some of the later Trails games.\n\nOh, and did I mention that the soundtrack is widely regarded as the best in the trilogy?\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nTo end on a more critical note, I'd like to elucidate the \"semi-fandisc\" nature of this game:\n\nThere is severe disconnect between the main story and side content, with the latter adding nothing to the former for the most part; the sidequests are more of an anthology of supplementary material for the entire Trails series and are only tenuously tied to the main campaign, which by itself is sparse in story.\n\nThere is also an egregious amount of asset recycling from the previous two games. Although this is mostly justified within the context of the story, it's still vexing and makes the devs look lazy. They had the opportunity to add a lot of interesting new locales, especially those pertaining to Kevin and the church, but they chose not to for the majority of the game. Get ready to traverse through lots of familiar looking areas and dungeons...\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nP.S. Advice for 1st playthrough: If you are here mostly to enjoy the story, don't play on Hard; if you value your sanity as a gamer, don't play on Nightmare. Seriously, don't.\n\nP.S.2 When you first open up the game, don't skip the \"Falcom\" logo animation; just sit back and watch. There's a bit more after that.\n\nP.S.3 If you're really curious as to which Silent Hill title I was comparing this game to, potential spoilers if you are familiar with the SH franchise: [spoiler]Silent Hill 2[/spoiler]. Just how deep the similarities run between these two games, I'll let you find out for yourself.\n\nP.S.4 A bit more on the censorship of this game: Falcom cut out large chunks of the aforementioned final sidequest when porting the 3rd from PC to the Sony consoles (PSP, PS3, and PSVita). They did this in order to keep the age rating consistent across the Sky trilogy; the PC version of the 3rd would undoubtedly have been rated \"M\" had it gone through ESRB. If you need a list of potentially distressing content in this game, feel free to PM me.\n- Playing this game instantly brought back memories of me playing TMNT, Battletoads, Double Dragon, and Streets of Rage, with my little brother on the NES and Sega Genesis in the early 90s. Luckily this game doesn’t feature TMNT’s ridiculous water level or Battletoads' sadistic peed bike level. The graphics are perfect, the controls are great, the soundtrack is awesome (especially the Wu-Tang stage, and the Shredder stage), and the levels and overworld map are fun to navigate. I’ve played through the story mode with all 7 characters and have played through the arcade mode multiple times solo and many times in multiplayer and I’ve enjoyed every bit of it. This game is so much fun.\n\nThere are a few things I wish existed though. I wish there were more playable characters. I wish that you did not lose your 7 character’s progress in story mode when you start a new game. I wish you could see the difficulty level of the online arcade game you are joining. I wish there were cumulative stats you could see for arcade and story mode that showed the number of times you completed a stage, how many enemies you knocked out, objects you’ve destroyed, stage times, combo streaks, times taunted, etc. I wish you could create your own turtle and assigned moves, specials, jumps, taunts, and colors.\n- 69 % of your time you spend walking around the forest, \nblowing in the animal whistle without actually seeing any animals\n\n10 % of your time you spend carefully approaching the animals you have spotted in the far far away distance\n\n1 % of your time you spend aiming, fireing your gun and missing all the significant organs of the animals\n\nThe last 20 % of your time you spend running after the animals you have wounded without ever seeing them again\n\nMost realistic hunting experience ever\n- Deathloop is definitely not your average video game.\n\nYou'll either love it or hate it.\n\nThe first few hours are the weakest. You, as a new player, don't know what to do, what's important and you never keep what you find. Only after completing several mission objectives you get the ability to collect residuum and actually infuse your found items for later use in later loops or after you die. That's why it's always better to just go straight to the objectives and not explore the map at all, otherwise it's just gonna be a big time waste.\n\nAfter you acquire the ability to make permanent items (character and weapon trinkets) which you'll be able to use in future runs and collect some crucial weapons (like silent gun) and abilities ([in-game slabs] like Shift that allows you to teleport short distances) - then the game fully opens up. \n\nReal fun begins after you learn all maps and shortcuts and how to toy with your enemies (but it takes quite a lot of time to get there).\n\nStealth is very easy, the enemy AI is dumb at best. The more trinkets and slabs you get - the more variety in gameplay opens up. \n\nAction is very smooth, Abilities are strong and versatile, that's where this game shines to be honest. \n\nThere are 4 different areas and all of them change depending of the time of the day (morning, noon, afternoon and evening). Depending of the time of the day - some areas become accessible, some become closed, The enemies and items also change their locations and sometimes you'll be able to encounter bosses (in-game they are called visionaries). They are not hard to kill, but it's quite hard to get to them. That's the fun part of this whole game. The more you replay all areas, the more information you'll acquire about visionaries and their behaviour. It's possible to deal with them all without killing a single other enemy.\n\nBut with all that comes the not so fun part - exploration and doing the same thing over and over and over again. It's gonna be hard at first, every area is very detailed and it's really easy to miss a code written on a desk or a wall, A lot of sniffing around is required for clues and multiple times per map. It definitely makes repetition your new best friend.\n\nThere are a lot of puzzles and challenges. If you are not shooting dumb NPCs - you're definitely trying to crack a solution to a puzzle. Sometimes you'll need to visit several maps on the exact time of day at which events occur and find the exact required item or piece of information in order to solve a puzzle. Yeah. It's a big hassle, but that's how this game is and how it functions. If you like puzzles, you'll enjoy Deathloop. But be prepared to use a guide or two for some of them and a lot of patience.\n\nDuring some objectives it's very easy to make mistakes and fail. Several challenges require you to be pixel perfect in execution. Didn't notice that mine placed on a generator? Too bad, you'll gonna have to restart or try in another loop.\n\nI disliked that once you find a new weapon, you have to take it with you and drop one of your 3 weapons. You will never be able to use the dropped one for the rest of the loop. Considering that you'll always find a new toy to play with - your loadout will always be half-baked. It's actually extremely annoying, the same can be said about your slab abilities too (only after you find them all, then the ability upgrades will go straight into your inventory after finishing a level).\n\nAnd of course, there is Julianna. She is your \"buddy\" the whole game and she talks to you at the start of every level and well... she is always trying to kill you. It's fun when she invades and disrupts your chill Groundhogday experience. You can even let other real players invade you as Julianna. Fun, if you like to fill yourself with some adrenaline. Either you kill her, or she kills you and you'll have to start over the whole loop ^^\n\nFunny, but Colt reminded me of Draymond Green from Golden State Warriors. In some instances he looks exactly like him haha.\n\nThere are some AI bugs and the game starts to stutter the longer you play. Kinda strage, but it was for me. Occasionally framerates can go from smooth to choppy quite fast.\n\nDeathloop is a decent game overall. Idea is good, but works much better in movies, because there you don't have to sit through the same routines every single time and you get to the next big reveal a lot quicker. \n\nI think Julianna was a bit underused. Imagine how awesome this game could be if Deahtloop worked similar to The Lost Vikings where you control 3 characters at the same time. She could have had different abilities, different strengths. A duo trying to break the loop! Pretty cool, eh? Anyway, That's just my 2 cents.\n- The EOS stands for End of Service. I am sure someone has fun with this or there wouldn't be a reason to keep bringing it back. Right? The usual Tab Target MMO. I do like that you can teleport to quest givers and mobs instead of the usual auto or manual run. Aside from that there isn't anything modern here.\n- I've been playing this game since it was in Kickstarter! It is the best Story Rich game that I have ever played and the most unique. I have played through maybe 7 times and it's different every time. The ability to replay this game countless times is what makes it such a great game. Tons of questions that change based on the questions you've asked, you see a question that might not be there after you ask another question instead. Every version of this game that I played kept my interest and had me sitting on the edge of my seat waiting for more. I have reached 2 endings so far and I can't wait to see what happens next. The Developers are great, I can't wait to see what they create next.\n- This game was so much fun but it's borderline unplayable a lot of the time due to no region lock. You get a lot of players from china playing on NA servers and they're basically untouchable due to ping. I genuinely think this game has fantastic game play and the characters and customization are top notch but spawning and dying to untouchable Chinese players every match just ruins the experience no matter how much I try to enjoy it. Not worth until they region lock the game or unless you want maybe a few hours of fun until you run into 我操你妈 every game and die to reasons out of your control.\n- Pros:\n> Decent selection of interior desing elements\n> Uncommon but interesting gameplay idea if you're into interior design and building\n> Fair price for amount of activities you get in base game\n> Gameplay leght\n> Regural updates\n\nCons:\n> You can't change location of windows in the house - some are placed in awkward places thus creating decent rooms becomes difficult\n> Game optimisation is questionable for such graphics  -  with RX vega 56 I barely get 60 fps \n> No replayability on same save file - once you sell property you cannot do it again\n> Once property is sold there's only some screenshots but no actual way to look around again\n> No steam workshop or mods\n\nIdeas for possible future updates:\n> Add floor plan design feature - building and demolishing walls 10 times is frustrating\n> Add ability to build custom houses and change locations of windows\n> Add ability to enter sold properties\n> Increase game performance\n\nDLCs:\n> HGTV DLC adds moderate amount of additional jobs\n> Garden DLC adds alot of activities outside the house but is a bit buggy. In my opinion some features should be in base game\n- An Excelent, well polished shmup(except for one technical fault) with great graphics and music.\n\nNot much to say other than it has fun boss fights with some creative bullet patterns, you have a gauge that fills up and when activated it doubles your fire power, and also you have bombs. If you have bombs and you get hit, you lose all of your bombs instead of just dying straight out, so you essentially have 2 hit points. You have a graze meter as well, meaning that if bullets pass by you it fills that meter up, when it is full, all bullets around you are basically nullified, and any enemy you kill, any bullets it fired at you will also get nullified. When you pass through the nullifeid bullets, it will fill the first gauge I mentioned so you can go ape s**t more often.\n\nIt's fairly simple, but the pace of the game takes a little while to get used to, the speed of your ship releative to the bullets is a little too slow but it's not game breaking. The only major issue is that my controller is not detectable by the game so I have to use joytokey, so I can't make full use of my controllers analog controls.\n- A lot of people's main complaint's seem to be about microtransactions. The game is perfectly playable without spending a dollar other than what you spent on the base game. And it's really not P2W. mostly aesthetic. Dedicated servers would be nice. but I feel they could fix this by better host migration. It is rather annoying when in a 4v4 and the host gets tilt and breaks the match by leaving, losing all the exp earned.\n\nTL;DR people are mad about spending extra money but want dedicated servers for free? =/\n\n*EDIT* after spending a few hours practicing, I now get told to kill myself on a regular basis in duels.\n\n11/10 Git Gud\n- [h1]Press F11 for Fullscreen and know that your inventory has two parts[/h1]\n\n\nThe Steam version seems like an improved version of the mobile version. I got stuck and looked at screenshots and guides and none of them were helpful (I've never played the mobile version just in case you were wondering. A guide I saw mentioned only 5 endings but this version features more than that)\n\nI got over my block when I realized that there were another set of items in my inventory (I didn't notice that it said 1/2 at first)\n\nI haven't finished the game yet though, so I might update my review, but so far, everything looks good!\n- [h1] 8.5/10 [/h1]\n\n[b] Please note that The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles is a very independent entry in the Ace Attorney series in terms of plot. Even if you have not played any of the Ace Attorney titles before, it will not affect your understanding of the game's plot. [/b]\n\nThis courtroom text adventure game in late 19th century Japan and British have a lot of features, even with the previous Ace Attorney works are very different. With the detailed character costumes and backgrounds, the strong sense of history and atmosphere, the majestic music, and excellent characterization, along with the game's detailed 3D character animation, players can experience an unprecedented adventure. In the plot, The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles presents a layer-by-layer, cocooning type of plot development, each chapter of the story is closely linked, and ambiguous, no chapter is meaningless, and in the final unraveling of all the mystery, the feeling of shock and excitement brought to the player is unprecedented in any text adventure game.\n\nThe reviews of The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles tend to be polarized, and not without reason. The progression of the plot brings with it an overwhelming lack of tension in the first and middle stages of the game. The design of many of the cases in the game seems rather undisciplined, neither interesting nor deep... The Great Ace Attorney: Adventure, as the first half of the game, though the development of the subsequent plot paved a lot of ambushes, the design of the plot and puzzles makes it less interesting and often difficult to motivate players to continue playing. The climax of the game comes too late, whether the player can persist to this point is a huge problem. At the same time, the Steam version of the game globally locks 30 frames, and can not set the Japanese voice is also a very huge drawback, and very damaging to the player's gaming experience.\n\nThe quality of The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles is actually not that bad. But this can only be concluded after you have experienced the entire game in its entirety... And I think this is actually the biggest drawback of this game because the ability to keep the player until the climax of the plot is the biggest pain point of this work. If you are very patient, love the Ace Attorney series, and love the suspenseful story of players, then The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles will not let you down. If you do not have any of the above elements, perhaps The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles will not give you a memorable experience.\n- It's hard to recommend Spelunky 2. Not because it is a bad game, but because it can be frustrating. As with most roguelikes, dying means going back to the beginning. In Spelunky however, nothing carries over to future runs. All you get to bring in to your next run is your own experience and knowledge; And when half the things in the game kill you instantly or stunlock you to death, having a great run end in a quick death can be damaging to one's will.\n\nThankfully, your own experiences count a great deal towards your progress. Most hazards and enemies in Spelunky 2 have a very simple and predictable behaviour. But keeping track of everything on the screen is still a challenge. Enemies and traps will also work together (or against each other) and still bring your demise somehow. Either by bumping your helplessly stunned body into other enemies and traps, or enemies having their own flaming corpse launched towards you and your flammable jetpack. It's actually quite funny sometimes. A good deal of entertainment can be had recording your own amazingly nonsensical deaths.\n\nSpelunky 2 improves upon Spelunky HD's gameplay by adding split paths, which allow for more variety and decision-making in your runs while staying true to the feeling and style of previous entries. It also adds a back layer to each level, allowing for more secrets to be kept. After successfully completing your first run, you can try to discover these secrets and find hidden bosses and areas and even different endings!\n\nAnyway, you might enjoy the game if you're a masochist or something.\n- Undoubtedly one of the best if not THE BEST modern video game remaster out there. I will summarize the pros and cons of this remaster into the following:\n\n[b]The Good:[/b]\n\n- Totally seamless transition into the new modern 4K visual from the old classic Win95 at a push of a key\n- Extremely faithful to the original titles (some might say that it is perhaps TOO faithful)\n- Game \"installation\" screen when you first boot up for both Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert is filled with God tier nostalgia \n- New UI with a complete revamp of the sidebar complete with higher quality artwork that totally feels in place\n- Plethora of never-before-seen bonus contents including exclusive missions and cinematic cutscenes for Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert that was only available on certain console platforms\n- You can queue multiple units while in production now\n- New multiplayer features and service is great. Finally you can now play 1v1 ranked and spectate any previous matches that was played including spectating ongoing games in the lobby\n- You can add, remove and create your very own custom music tracks in-game for both Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert however you want\n- All of Frank Klepacki's overly iconic classical and remixed tracks are here including various modern remixed that was composed solely for this remastered collection!!!\n\n[b]The Bad:[/b]\n\n- Minor bugs (though not a real dealbreaker)\n- The gameplay meta among factions/units remains as unbalanced as ever. Kinda of a tradeoff for being too faithful to the original titles\n- Multiplayer is still officially limited to a maximum of 4 players total per map in Tiberium Dawn, while in Red Alert the limit is a maximum of 8 players total\n- FMV cutscenes are all still heavily compressed in SD resolution extracted from the Playstation home console version and further artificially enhanced via AI upscaling due to the fact that the original master footage tapes for both Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert are still yet to be found\n\n[b]The Kinda Ugly:[/b]\n\n- Certain mission on hard difficulty are completely unbalanced. This is already another insult to injury as the AI blatantly cheats when it comes to resource procurement and unit build time. The fault of a clear lack of playtesting\n- Deathloop is definitely not your average video game.\n\nYou'll either love it or hate it.\n\nThe first few hours are the weakest. You, as a new player, don't know what to do, what's important and you never keep what you find.

A duo trying to break the loop! Pretty cool, eh? Anyway, That's just my 2 cents.\n- From my og demo feedback, not much changed sadly:\n\nOh boy....\n\nI will start with the most glaring issue:\n-It's friggin IMPOSSIBLE to find an online match\n\nNow some other stuff that I found odd or bad:\n-The camera.... oh god.... I get it, it's supposed to \"limit\" the playing area (specially for local gameplay) but it punishes people in first place... that's friggin dumb in a RACING game, also also if you go under other track sometimes you can't see sh*t (the going under other track piece seems to be fixed in the final release)\n\n-The car randomly drives itself ???? (maybe it's the antenna thingy I chose at car selection.... would be good a tooltip or SOMETHING so I know wtf is that about)\n\n-NO CONTROL REBINDING OPTIONS..... in 2023 \n\n-If you \"die\" near a checkpoint, though luck pal you WILL miss the next section too cause you won't respawn in time... that's.... just unfun and dumb.\n\n-The \"shortcut\" option definetly does not work, I intentionally crafted a track with cuts and the game will kill you if you try to do those..... good job devs. (This seems to be fixed or working properly in final release)\n\n-Since I couldn't find an online match EVER, I played only in local lobby or vs AI, now here comes the issue, the \"placing\" round locks everyone to the same \"screen\", there is no zoom, you can get trolled by another player preventing you to move to a place to connect track or hazards, rendering your placement turn void and useless, I don't know if this is intentional or just a downside of playing on local mode, you may have free cam in multi, but alas I couldn't try that. BTW.... WHY THERE IS NO ZOOM OPTION\n\nThe good:\n-The games runs smooth as butter, with everything maxed on my midend rig, good one devs\n\n-The cars seem to be varied and with some gimmicks, alas you have NO TOOLTIPS or info what that possible gimmick may be..... why ?\n\n-The track pieces, hazards and weapons are quite varied and some weird shennanigans are ensured to happen, feels like a Trackmania troll track being build in real time 10/10\n\nThe \"mehhh\":\n\n-The weapons/items some of them are mindbogglingly hard to understand wtf they do, there is a grey metallic ball even that seems to do nothing or I haven't figured out how to use it... again... a tool tip maybe ? a section about weapons/items in the main menu mayhaps ?\n\nAnd that's that, sorry if my writing seems a bit aggresive, I just was kinda hyped about the game and it feels a bit of a let down so far. But, IT HAS POTENTIAL.\n\nSadly, another case of developer with TONS of feedback delivering an undercooked mess. Stay away from it.\n- Ok so let me start off by saying that I absolutely loved the first game in this series. I loved the subtle changes when you compared character interaction throughout the game as you progressed playing non-lethally/lethally. Now I never buy games at launch, I always wait for sales. When I got Dishonored 1 for $2 I was blown away and mad at myself for waiting for such a sale. I would've happily spent more on that game, it was worth it. Now all that said, here we are at Dishonored 2:\n\nPros\n- Mechanics have been vastly improved upon and the gameplay is just so much more fluid. As much as I loved the previous game I can't deny it was somewhat clunky.\n- Customization is so much better! The upgrades are plentiful and the bonecharm crafting system is awesome once you realize what you are doing. It really expands on how many options you really have at your disposal.\n\nCons\n- The difficulty still just isn't there for me. I LOVED that there was a custom difficulty mode, but even making things harder than the 'very hard' difficulty I still completed the game using no powers and never getting detected with relative ease(I did save A LOT obviously). The only things that really present a challenge are the clockwork soldiers, and as the plot of the game makes evident, you really don't encounter those enough to really present a big challenge.\n- The story is weak, plain and simple. It was like you were on a storyboard that used the same format as the previous game. The story, especially the universe and how you were immersed into it, was a big part of the why I loved the first game.\n- How low vs high chaos is handled. It isn't like there are no changes, in fact I was surprised a few times in my 2nd playthrough which I was doing as a hardcore murderer of every man, woman, and child(if there was any) that crossed my path. It just never really changed the dynamic enough like Dishonored 1 did. The way the final mission in the first game played out when comparing no killing playthroughs with bloody ones was VASTLY different right from the start of the mission.\n\nAll in all it wasn't a bad game. I still definitely enjoyed it for being a niche genre game. Just maybe I would have liked the game to stand out more like the first did.\n- I'm a bit torn on giving Guacamelee! Super Turbo Championship Edition (STCE) a thumbs down, but I feel it's important for prospective buyers/players to know that STCE is significantly worse than Guacamelee! Gold Edition. \n\nSTCE brings a number of modifications to Guacamelee, all of which are negative (apart from the 4P support). First, there are two large new areas, both of which serve as filler, breaking the flow of the game while not introducing any new concepts. Arguably the best part of the second area is the new character that serves as a boss, but said boss fight is relatively simple and the character takes focus away from the stronger original cast. Secondly are the combat changes: the \"rebalancing\" of enemies and the Intenso power. Javiar Jaguar, the stand-out boss from the original game, has been nerfed to an absolute pushover. Moreover, the Intenso power is absolutely game breaking, making every combat encounter in the game a joke. That wouldn't be so bad if you could ignore it, but the developers added certain combat encounters where the difficulty goes through the roof if Intenso isn't used (rooms with multiple enemies with white shields, hitstun-immunity, and/or non-dodgable attacks).  These rooms generally feature Intenso-refilling barrels or enemies as well, so the intention is clear. Of course, there's plenty of Intenso to go around even for easier rooms and bosses, trivializing combat entirely. \n\nIn short, STCE is still a good game, but the original release was a GREAT game, without the broken combat \"rebalancing\" and padding. Please buy/play Guacamelee! Gold instead.\n- Damn, deeply devoted developer designed Death's Door.\nDiscover dungeons, divine drama, delightfully depicted Death [b]:D[/b]\nDark daw's daunting duels demand deft digits.\nDynamite deal definitely does deserve desire!\n- We need a 60fps patch ASAP. Having 30fps content on PC in [current year] is not acceptable.\n\nOther than that the game is pretty solid! It looks great, it plays great, the story was good imo, the characters are interesting and the amount of solo content is decent.\n\nHowever, the gear system is not as elaborate as in Mk11 and the microtransations are NOT a welcome sight. Denuvo also has to go. If Harada agreed that the addition of Denuvo in Tekken 7 was a mistake, so should NetherRealm.\nI also don't like that 2 characters that are going to be in the Kombat Pass are already in the game (Ermac and Quan Chi). Just give us these characters and come up with other ones for the KP. This is super greedy and lazy.\nIt's even worse than Sektor and Cyrax in MK11, at least you didn't let us play them, period. this time you decide to not make them playable (even thought they work for the AI) AND sell them at a later date? That's awful.\n\nThe game is good but needs improvement and shouldn't ship with performance issues, 30fps content, microtransactions, Denuvo and greedy DLC tactics. I would put a \"meh\" review if I could because of the negatives but for that reason I have to say \"no\".\n- Like many games in my library, [i]Iconoclasts[/i] has been gathering dust in my backlog for a long time. And, like many games in my library, I should have played this one much, much sooner. \n\nAs my 40ish shared screenshots of this game suggest, the pixel art in this one is fantastic. Each area, set piece, character, or enemy the player comes across was painstakingly crafted to be as visually striking as possible. I don’t normally gush about graphics in games, but some of the scenes in this one will stick with me for a long time. Of course, screenshots don’t do the game justice; one has to see it in motion to really appreciate it.\n\nBut I don’t personally believe that a metroidvania can be carried by its graphical style alone. Luckily, this game was fun as all hell to play! But, while there are a lot of standard metroidvania traits here (exploring, upgrading, backtracking, etc.), I can see how it might not be someone’s cup of tea… This one is extremely puzzle-heavy and story-driven.\n\nIt might be saying a lot about me, but some of the puzzles really twisted my brain into knots. I found them to be very clever, even when finding the solution had me slamming my head against the wall. The few puzzles I felt I needed to google never left me crying “bullshit” – the answer was in front of me all along and I was either too dense or too many beers deep to see it. But the puzzles aren’t just limited to static environmental stuff: every boss is treated like a puzzle, too, making each one unique and memorable. I really loved the way they made me recall and use all the tools at my disposal in order to defeat them.\n\nThen, there’s the story. I was absolutely a fan of the narrative: it was kind of nice to see a game in this genre really dive in and explore the themes it presents instead of delivering them in abstract ways and letting the player piece everything together themselves. In other words, it’s lousy with longwinded characters. On top of that, it has some strong opinions about religion and government. It’s literally the name of the game, after all. So, you know, if a story that critiques theocratic authoritarianism that threatens planetary devastation would get you hot under the collar, you should probably steer clear. \n\nAnyway, as always, if those things didn’t turn you away, this one is absolutely worth your time. I think I’ll end up throwing on my growing list of favorites when I’m done typing this up.\n- The latest S tier Deckbuilder Roguelike, joining the ranks of Slay the Spire and Monster Train for me. I think that's all that really needs to be said.\n\nIt leans heavily into kiss/curse type effects, if you like the ability to manipulate rng and do some busted stuff with your sequencing you will love it. It is more of a thinker on a turn to turn basis than other games of this genre, but if that isn't a turn off then it's a really solid game with some unique characters/mechanics that feel fresh.\n- Her story starts you off in an old looking computer with what looks like Windows 95, or perhaps a previous version. Once there you are presented with a database of footage from a 1990s, where you must piece together what happened.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\nWithout spoiling anything, since this game is all story based, you are revisiting video clips of seven separate interviews trying to piece together what exactly happened. When you start off, you are placed in front the pc with the word “murder” already typed in. With this simple word, you are given, you must, delve deeper into the story, and form your own conclusion as to what happened, but the more you go deeper into the mystery, the more confused you may become; perhaps even discarding your previous assumption many times before coming to a conclusion that does not go against her story.    \n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nThis game is not a conventional game in terms of gameplay. Instead, you are watching videos and finding potential terms that could lead you to more videos which will reveal more as to her past and what, and who was involved in this incident. Some might not like this, so if the idea of an exclusively story based game does not appeal, do not bother. It is an interesting concept, and very captivating if you play it without any distractions, perhaps more interesting if you play it with a friend and try to piece the mystery together (much like I did).\n\n[h1]Verdict: 8.5/10[/h1]\n\nIf you enjoyed this review, or found it helpful, please feel free to follow our curator [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/WeLoveKawaiiNekos#curation]here.[/url]\n- One of the best platformer/Beat-them-up just got upgraded. new attacks, new enemies, new bosses, new levels, new modes, new skins and a graphical improvement, this is really worth getting if you didn't play the original version. if you have the original you get a 66% discount which is good but i still think it should be an optional DLC that sells for 2 Dollars. of course i understand many people won't buy it because they played the original and they shouldn't buy it, but as for me its just that i wanted a reason to replay Guacamelee again so i bought this.\n- \"It has guns, swords, sexy characters, cheesy dialogues, and a whole lot of action. What more do you want?\" somebody posted and is recommending this pile of poo. How about not some random boring braindead splatterfest like this crap? Apparently a good lot of people actually have a need filled with this random gore generator. Should have bought some dinner instead of wasting money on this bollox.\n- The game is a masterpiece, just like the first one. After finishing PoE 1, I immediately started with the second one and I was treated to another marvel of a game. Here are some of my thoughts:\n\nThe Good:\n-Very good main story but the side content is what made this game great\n-Interesting and deep characters, both new ones and some returning from the first game, including companions\n-The story picks up after the events of the first game and is a direct continuation of the first game (just like with Baldur’s Gate 1 and 2)\n-If you still have the savegame-files from the first game, your decisions and consequences from the first game will carry over\n-There is so much lore, if you are into reading and listening to stories\n-A lot of voice-acting\n-A lot of pets you can collect and the equipped one has a small benefit to your party\n-Interesting races and sub-races, each with its own boons and downsides\n-Interesting classes and sub-classes, including the possibility of multi-classes\n-You can retrain your characters\n-You can make a new character to join your party at any time at tavern\n-Item and weapon diversity (including pistols)\n-You have the option to play the game as either turn-based (like divinity original sin) or real time (with game pause, just like Baldur’s Gate)\n-You can sail the seas as a pirate and attack any ship you meet without consequence. The ships on the map will respawn endlessly so you will never run out, which makes them a real great source of income.\n-Besides the ship you are given at the beginning, there are a few others you can buy. Each has its own benefits\n-Ship, crew and sailing require some management, but if you like this sort of stuff you can get real invested in it \n-Exploring the map by ship, if you are into that kind of stuff\n-When engaging other ships, you have a choice between boarding or naval combat\n-Endurance is no longer a thing so you only need to manage your Health during fights. You will like this if you were not a big fan of the Endurance vs Health system from the first game\n-The resting system has improved. Besides taverns, now you can rest anywhere you want as long as you have food\n-No inventory management is necessary. Your inventory is infinite so just pick everything up because sooner or later you might need things like explosives, potions, tools etc.\n-Choice matters, and boy are there a lot of different paths you can choose from\n-Romance options\n-Bounties are fun and offer good experience and money\n-DLCs are a bit shorter than the one from the first game, but they are just as good (will not describe them to avoid spoilers)\n\nThe Bad:\n-Loading screens are too long and too many\n-Just like in the first game, I reached max level at about 2/3 of the game(max level 20) so any experience gathered beyond that was pointless. By the end of the game could have easily reached level 30 if that was a thing\n-Naval combat is scripted, so it might not be as spectacular as you might imagine\n-Exploring islands on foot isn’t so much fun\n-The idea of factions might not be to everyone’s liking\n-After playing for a few hours, the game performance seems to decrease and my pc struggled with running it. Maybe the game has an optimization problem but it’s possibly that this one is on me and the game is fine. This might not be the case for other users.\n\nAdvice:\n-In the beginning of the game, try to reach Neketaka asap and do as many quests there as you can before heading out on your ship exploring the seas\n-Pick everything up. Your inventory space is infinite and you will end up needing diverse items like explosives, traps, tools etc.\n-Always have tools with you: hammer and chisel, prybar, lockpicks, grappling hook. You will really need them from time to time\n-Plundering other ships is a great source of experience, resources and money but be careful not to burn yourself out if you do it for too long\n-If you get stuck on a quest, just do some online research\n-Invest money in your ship and crew as soon as you can\n-Always have a tank and healer in the party\n-Make sure to diversify the skills of your party. It’s always good to have someone with Mechanics, Religion, Athletics or Diplomacy most of all\n-Enchant your items\n-When you get the white/grey colored legendary items, make sure to bind them to the character you equip them on and do the mini-quests inscribed on them to unlock new powers and features\n-Use summons, as they are great for distracting enemies. They can take a lot of hits and also dish it out\n\nMy game experience:\nI played on the classic (normal) difficulty, just like I do with every new game I start, and found the game not very hard but fun. I played the game in real time, because turn-based takes too long. As soon as I got my first ship working, I sailed to Neketaka, found the last companions I knew I wanted on my permanent team (Maia and Pallegina) and just quested away in the city until I had enough money and levels under my belt to start exploring the seas and attack other ships. I never did the scripted naval combat because I was having too much fun boarding the ships and watch my characters fight. My party consisted of my Watcher (Moon Godlike, Chanter, specced in summoning), Eder (because he’s a beast of a tank and has some fun interactions with others), Xoti (gotta have a healer, she’s also fun to have around), Maia Rua (very good ranged DPS and she comes with a pet cause she’s a ranger) and Pallegina, who is an excellent off-tank and support character. Once I took to the seas, I made my fortune by plundering ships, equipped my ship and characters with the best money could buy and then just catered to the different existing factions in the Deadfire, while not loosing sight of my main mission.\n\nI had a great time playing Pillars of Eternity 1 and 2. I consider they offer some great replay value and are great fun if you are into this style of RPG games. If you are a fan of games like the Baldur’s Gate, Icewind Dale, Diablo, Dragon Age, Neverwinter Nights and Divinity Original Sin series, you must try PoE 1 and 2.\nI really hope they make Pillars of Eternity 3.\n\n- I'm seeing a new trend in gaming here: A studio wants to port an oldie but goodie to consoles, so polishes it up a bit, releases the new version on console and gives it as a free upgrade to the PC boys. It benefits everyone, but don't get too excited.\n\nIt's not a stunning remaster, because Mark of the Ninja looked damn good to begin with. To this end, everything only got tweaked a [i]bit[/i]. The backgrounds are a [i]bit[/i] more detailed, the cutscenes are a [i]bit[/i] sharper and more fluid-moving, the lighting effects have a [i]bit[/i] more dynamic range, and the resolution is a [i]bit[/i] better. Less a remaster and more a cleanup. Most of the changes are so subtle and detailed you won't even find them by actively looking for them, but they're there.\n\nIt costs exactly the same as the special edition of the original, and includes the SE content, and if you already own the original's SE, you get the remaster for free. So basically, if you want the full MotN package, there's no reason not to pick this up. I'm just playing through it mostly because Mark of the Ninja is a kickass game with or without 4K. There is no downside to picking this up if you want the base game. Do it.\n- Gone are the days of mindless building and fun. Power grids? Taxes? Intense accounting and counter-intuitive path building. A pre-built zoo for tutorials. I actually felt MORE stressed after playing this game. If you're looking for something to flex that brain, perfect. If you're looking to release the cougars and create chaos, you can do that in sandbox I guess. You could also just not connect power grids correctly. Works like a charm. Honestly who thinks of these things\n- I'll preface this by admitting that it makes sense for so many of the \"helpful\" reviews to be negative; it's good to warn customers of a game they won't enjoy, and The Witness definitely isn't for everybody.  That said, this is among my favorite games, and I was looking forward to The Witness for a very long time, so the fact that it lived up to my expectations says a lot.\n\n(You may find it helpful to know my preferences, so here are some of my other favorites: Fez, Portal, Infinifactory, LIMBO, The Beginner's Guide, and of course, Braid.)\n\nAs other reviewers have pointed out, The Witness isn't \"fun\"; that's not a criticism, it's just an accurate observation.  The Witness is treading unfamiliar territory, but only for a video game: most other artistic mediums have been used to explore themes other than \"fun,\" and it makes sense that this medium can be used similarly.\n\nInsofar as objective criteria exist for judging the quality of a video game, The Witness meets every standard I can think of: the game runs smoothly, the team have been timely about patching bugs, the visuals (gorgeous and stylized) and audio (understated and lacking music) are expertly executed, and the design of the world and puzzles is meticulous (and ambitious).\n\nThe only objective drawbacks I can think of are:\n\n1) The absence of an FOV slider (important for those who suffer from motion-sickness), which the developers have hinted may be added in a future update. UPDATE: this has been added, along with some other configuration options.\n\n2) Some of the puzzles are impossible to solve if you're deaf or color-blind.\n\nFrom what I can tell, The Witness is about making your own observations and forming your own theories about how the game mechanics work (the title of the game is relevant to its content); it's partly about solving puzzles, but more so it's about figuring out what the puzzles even are and how they work in the first place; given that, it's easy to see why The Witness fails to provide players with a clear goal or feedback: that would undermine the core of the game.  Patient curiosity is the best mindset with which to approach The Witness; it's like a piece of cloth with a loose thread: you pull it, and it keeps unraveling, and unraveling, and unraveling...\n\nThe intrigue of The Witness stems from constant and subtle revelations about how the game functions, which tend to overturn your previous theories and force you to let go of your presumptions, all without ever jumping the shark.\n\nThe Witness is slow to get rolling, patiently waiting while you adjust yourself to the mechanics and freely allowing you hold on to your false sense of comprehension.  You might expect a game like this to be eager to shove its paradigm-shifting revelations in your face, but it generally isn't: The Witness makes no effort to divulge its secrets, and when you peel back another layer, you can take comfort in the fact that it's a real accomplishment on your part.\n\nThe island is dense with puzzles (more so than it appears at first), and each of the nearly 700 puzzles (according to the developers) presents its own unique challenge, and a peek into the mechanics of the game (if you're paying attention).  The puzzles are each short, but satisfying and interconnected, so it's easy to leave the game at any time, and they're grouped into areas, where each area explores a particular game mechanic.\n\nBecause you're free to wander the island, you can walk away from one area if you get stuck and try a different one.  I usually had two or three areas I could choose between at any time.  If you try to play through each area, beginning to end, one at a time, I imagine you'll not enjoy yourself very much.  Once you get stuck on a puzzle, rather than continue banging your head against it, I recommend venturing off to find a different one; returning to a puzzle with a fresh palette and new mechanics under your belt may shake something loose.  The puzzles generally shouldn't require guesswork, and all of them are fair.\n\nThere's no narrative in The Witness.  You'll find recordings scattered around the island, which contain quotes from people throughout history, generally on the topics of awareness, discovery, investigation, and the monotheistic concept of a god.\n\nBeing an atheist, some of these fell flat for me, while others less concerned with theism hit hard, and one even had me teary-eyed.  Each one rang with the sort of sincerity that will either move you, or make you very uncomfortable, depending on how it plays against your own life and beliefs.\n\nIf I'm to be honest, I think The Witness has affected me on a personal level: its themes of exploration and discovery, and its quiet faith in your capacity to unravel its mysteries are comforting.  If you're in the mood for some introspection, you'll probably enjoy it as I have.\n- I would give this a mixed rating if I could. \nThe story is told in such a boring way that it's hard to stay invested. You run to one person, listen to a cutscene, or more likely read a cutscene, than go to another person to talk to. Sometimes you fight one guy but mostly it's pretty dull. There is very little gameplay in the overland content and everything plays like a bad visual novel.\n\nAAR, the first MSQ is just one fetch quest after the other with little story in it. Oh there is some story there, but it's not great. The characters are shallow with few expectations, both the supporting cast and villains. \n\nHeavensward, the expansion I got through before my time ran out, is better than ARR but not that enjoyable. There were parts I like (not to give spoilers, it was the part where you go on a “journey”) Sadly, that part of the expansion was far too short. Than the story precedes to shove itself up it’s own ass as it becomes fixated on one part of the lore. [spoiler]I don’t give a damn how the war started! It was a thousand years ago.[/spoiler]\nPro:\n-If you like story, and only story, you will like this game.\n-A lot of content\n-Trial fights. (Good boss fights without the boring part of dungeons)\n\nCons:\n-Little in the way of gameplay outside of dungeons and trials \n-ARR is a slog and not worth reading. Skip as fast as you can and just watch a recap video.\n-dungeons are locked behind the story and not unlocked as you level up.\n-The story is on the lower end of other final fantasy games.\n-Lalafells are in the game. People who play this race are degenerates.\n- A criminally underrated game, I have seldom seen a developer take their original hit which was already almost perfect, and actually manage to improve on it in every way shape and form. You do not need to have played the original to play or enjoy this game. Their stories are completely seperate.\n\nThe game itself is much less linear than its predecessor. The best way I can explain the feeling of going through the environments without referencing Grimrock itself is by saying it felt an awful lot like Myst to me, just with combat. Required puzzles for progression were challenging but not impossible, some of the secret challenges were much more difficult. I admit I used an online guide more than a few times, but it did nothing to diminish my enjoyment of the game. It is immersive, challenging, and satisfying. \n\nThe only drawback I can think of is the difficulty. It feels like you cannot win with any group composition, I suggest no more than 2 of any class or weapon/armor type user. I went with a warrior, two rogues(one range), and a mage, this way you as well makes you unlikely to complete a difficult fight or puzzle and be rewarded with something you cannot use. Combat itself can be challenging as I said, but you will rarely feel like you are simply incapable of winning. There are obvious ways to optimize the way you approach an encounter the second time if you die the first.\n\nBe prepared to immerse yourself, you must pay attention to your surroundings, read and remember notes you find, explore every nook and cranny you can find, and you will be rewarded. Good luck!\n\n- OMG I LOVE THIS SO MUCH!\nFun to control, it runs fine on my potato Laptop\nIts colorful\nits fun\nits amazingly well animated\ni love the map, i love the bosses so far, i love everythign about this,\nlock on aiming with RB is awesome, special weapons, parries, and attacks you buy from the shop ^^ this is \nPURE GOLD\n- This is a review about the port, not the game. The game itself is fantastic. I reference Moguri Mod throughout the review - this is a fan made mod that aims to improve the visual quality of the port.\n\nThe port is a lazy outdated mess:\n- It's lacking visual FX present in the original, such as the mist in the overworld of the Mist Continent. [b]This was fixed in a patch.[/b]\n- There is no way to restore the original font. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- Dialogue is rendered at a static pace, unlike the original. In the original game, lines of dialogue would show up on screen depending on how fast the character was talking. In this port, there is no distinction. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- There are multiple problems with the battle UI:\n-- It takes 40% of the screen. Square Enix patched this in the console versions, but the PC version was never patched. [b]This patch was released on PC in an update on the 6th of August 2020.[/b]\n-- It's rendered at what feels like 15fps, making navigation feel extremely clunky. In the original game, all menus were rendered at either 30fps interpolated or 60fps (don't know which one exactly), which made the browsing very fluid. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- All menus are clunky to browse because of the crippling low framerate. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- It's missing sound effects from the original. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- Despite porting the game to Unity, Square couldn't be bothered to re-write the animation code to speed up battle animations independently of buff/debuff tick timers, arguably the original game's biggest problem. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- The music in this port is a lower sample version of the original. [u]This is fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- The backgrounds clash horribly with the new character models. [u]This is fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n\nThe ONLY positive of this version is that you can skip the introduction to every battle. Except not really, because the option doesn't work half the time.\n\nThanks to the Moguri Mod, it is arguable that this version comes close to the original. Regardless of my opinion though, I'm not about to praise Square Enix for a port that the fans patched up. Moguri Mod is the only reason to buy this game on Steam.\n- Like many games in my library, [i]Iconoclasts[/i] has been gathering dust in my backlog for a long time. And, like many games in my library, I should have played this one much, much sooner. \n\nAs my 40ish shared screenshots of this game suggest, the pixel art in this one is fantastic. Each area, set piece, character, or enemy the player comes across was painstakingly crafted to be as visually striking as possible. I don’t normally gush about graphics in games, but some of the scenes in this one will stick with me for a long time. Of course, screenshots don’t do the game justice; one has to see it in motion to really appreciate it.\n\nBut I don’t personally believe that a metroidvania can be carried by its graphical style alone. Luckily, this game was fun as all hell to play! But, while there are a lot of standard metroidvania traits here (exploring, upgrading, backtracking, etc.), I can see how it might not be someone’s cup of tea… This one is extremely puzzle-heavy and story-driven.\n\nIt might be saying a lot about me, but some of the puzzles really twisted my brain into knots. I found them to be very clever, even when finding the solution had me slamming my head against the wall. The few puzzles I felt I needed to google never left me crying “bullshit” – the answer was in front of me all along and I was either too dense or too many beers deep to see it. But the puzzles aren’t just limited to static environmental stuff: every boss is treated like a puzzle, too, making each one unique and memorable. I really loved the way they made me recall and use all the tools at my disposal in order to defeat them.\n\nThen, there’s the story. I was absolutely a fan of the narrative: it was kind of nice to see a game in this genre really dive in and explore the themes it presents instead of delivering them in abstract ways and letting the player piece everything together themselves. In other words, it’s lousy with longwinded characters. On top of that, it has some strong opinions about religion and government. It’s literally the name of the game, after all. So, you know, if a story that critiques theocratic authoritarianism that threatens planetary devastation would get you hot under the collar, you should probably steer clear. \n\nAnyway, as always, if those things didn’t turn you away, this one is absolutely worth your time. I think I’ll end up throwing on my growing list of favorites when I’m done typing this up.\n- Playing this game for the first time six years after its initial release proved to be a delight in disguise. With all the memes and jokes established, I was finally able to understand what the fuss was all about back in 2011. Despite not having the best gameplay, story or graphics out there, something about this title just made me want to finish every quest I deemed worth completing. \n\n9/10 - mods recommended\n- First thing you see when the game loads is \"You have to buy the game to blahblah\", as i didn't know there was a paid version, i felt betrayed. Anyway,\nSorry, i tried it, not expecting much, but there was not much from it..\n-Graphics are bad\n-Movement and animation are clunky, same with attacking\n-Zombie AI would hit you even if you walked backwards 2 seconds ago\n-Regions are EU and NA, multiple servers each with a PVE server, but it was so empty.\n-Gameplay-wise.... so many questions like, \"Why do i need to hold E for 5 seconds to open a fridge?\", \"Why does headshot being counted but it doesnt insta-kill a basic zombie?\", \"Why does the soldier npc's look like they are making money from you?\", and lasty \"What the heck is the goal of this game?\"\n-Oh and driving vehicles SUCK! *ehem*\n\nSorry NOPE\n- This review only relates to the single player campaign. At 50 years old I have zero interest in multiplayer.\n\nAfter playing Gears of War 4, I was looking forward to this title. I wasn't disappointed. I found the new upgrade system with Jack enjoyable. The campaign was fun to play with minor exceptions. Graphics, sound, and voice acting were amazing. Campaign took me about 11 hours to beat. I consider that well worth the $60 I paid for the game.\n\nMy only real gripe about the single player campaign:  As a father of 3 girls, I'm all for strong female leading characters. Kait just isn't it, though. I didn't care for her in 4 and that didn't change in 5. For me she seems out of her league and just isn't believable as a team member. She's like Elizabeth Swan, the governor's daughter in Pirates of the Caribbean. She's a kidnapped damsel in distress in one movie, and the Pirate King in the next. It just doesn't work, for me anyway.\n- EDIT: I nominated this game for game of the year (2023)\n\nLong ago I had heard about this game and how detailed and intricate it could be, and how you could spend hours upon hours building the massive empire of dwarves only for it to all come crashing down in some spectacular but unforeseen way.  Then I got into Rimworld briefly and thought it was ok, but it tended toward chaos a bit too much for my liking.  THEN I heard this game was coming to steam and I eagerly awaited it.\n\nIt's not necessarily that I was too good to play a game with mostly ascii/character graphics (I used to play them a lot back in the 1980s).  I was more intimidated by the depth of the game and not knowing if there was a wiki for it (there is) or how I'd find help if I needed it (I'm sure there's a ton of communities JUST for this game).  I expected that when it came to Steam, it'd be beefed up and worth the wait.\n\nWell it finally arrived and I think I'm STILL a bit intimidated by the sheer amount of options you have... mostly because it's not just me that I have to worry about, but a whole community of dwarves.  In the case of something like minecraft, I could dig a whole intricate tunnel and if stuff starts to go bad, I just high-tail it out of there and recover until I can go back and finish it.  In Dwarf Fortress though, if stuff starts to go bad, you can't just leave.  You are encouraged to deal with the adversity and push onward in the name of greatness... or something.\n\nIn a way it's like role playing, except you don't have to roll character sheets and you don't really control any of the characters directly.  You make decisions about where to mine, what trees to chop down, what to build, what to trade, what to plant, and for every thing there is a season (turn turn turn).  You're forced to deal with death, birth, attacks, sickness, madness, and a ton of other things that I have no idea are coming.  \n\nI keep thinking \"I could do better\" and I start a new game, but then I start to realize that no matter what I do, I'm never gonna have a perfect game, or a game where everything goes exactly according to plan.  I am eventually going to have to buckle down and stick to one game save to see it through.\n\nIf you're like me and starting something new holds a lot more interest than continuing an existing project (ADHD?) you may have difficulty with this game.  At the same time you may become so engrossed in it that you lose track of time and suddenly it's 6am and you wonder why you stayed up all night digging holes.  I'm starting to feel a bit of the madness myself.  (it's almost 4:30am as I write this)\n\nIn any case, it's probably not for everyone, but I'd say if you're unsure, find the non-steam version and try that, and if you can grok what's going on and it interests you, definitely buy this and support the developers... OR buy this and try to stay under the 2 hour refund  limit while you learn the basics (Good luck with that, it'll be 6 hours before you know what happened).  I believe this game is worth the money though (full price).  If you were going to wait for a sale you'd be waiting a long time anyway.  \n\nTL;DR If this looks interesting to you, don't wait! Buy now.  If you aren't sure, do a bit of research and come back and buy it.\n- I am a Filthy Casual (tm) who plays games like Mass Effect and Fallout 4 on easy and still die over and over. I got my \"you died\" achievement in Dark Souls 2 before the tutorial and stopped playing after like forty minutes with zero qualms. I have rage quit every single platformer game I have ever touched, and just sort of despise brutally hard things that feel like chores.\n\nBasically, I am not exactly sure why I decided to buy Dead Cells in the first place. Sure, I love the look and one of the few platformers I've ever 100%'d was Super Metroid (with a LOT of swearing and rage quitting), so 'Metroidvania' is an appealing term to me, but it is still inherently marketed as a game that is not for me, or people like me.\n\nThis game is hard. I have 11 hours on it and I can't get past the third area on any given path. I die for stupid reasons and lose all my stuff and... I don't care. I haven't rage quit once; in fact, I have to force myself away from the game after a death so I can do things like eat. I find the combat engaging and entertaining, the progression satisfying and there's something really solid about being forced to start from square one (ish) every single time, in a way I've just never experienced.\n\nSo, sure, buy this if you love hard games/Dark Souls/no checkpoint kind of games. Absolutely, I'm pretty sure you've alreeady heard this is likely to be up your alley.\n\nBut even if you're a dirty rotten casual gamer who button smashes in any game approaching action, and panics when the screen flashes red around the edges... give it a try if you get the opportunity. It is seriously fun.\n- For a company as big as Amazon, this game is extremely sub par. It feels as though it's in Early Access and some of the recent patch notes are very worrying for the game's future\n\nPros:\n- Stunning gfx. Especially for an MMO, the lighting in particular is amazing\n- Sound track is great and ambience adds personality to the zones\n- Some really cool zones to explore, feels as though you can get lost when you start\n- Controls/Keybinds are already really good imo, I only changed a few\n- Tutorial/Starter Quest chains do a great job of introducing you to the game without being too slow\n- Combat (when it works) Is really fun. Lots of action based fights\n- Wars are a really cool mechanic, they are ultimately flawed but are still a lot of fun\n\nCons:\n- Game is extremely shallow. It is borderline addicting for the first few levels, this soon dies off. When (If) You reach lvl 60, you ask yourself what do you do now?\n- As beautiful as the game is, a lot of it is copy and pasted. Literally. There are zones, towns, dungeons that are almost identical. Ruins immersion\n- Quests are extremely repetitive and boring. They consist of kill mobs, loot mobs, loot chests and that’s about it. No diversity\n- Combat can be laggy, you weapon swap and it doesn’t register sometimes. Wars can be a PowerPoint Presentation at times\n- Guild UI is awful. There is no guild bank, treasury ledger so you cannot monitor who donates money for wars etc. Makes running a guild a nightmare\n- There are countless exploits and duplications that have been abused upsetting economies, player numbers and the general integrity of the game\n- Server population has been decimated since launch leading to many dead servers. They’re merging already\n- There are some very worrying patch notes/future releases that are changing fundamental mechanics of the game. In some cases nerfs which punish players who didn’t rush to level cap\n- Watermark is a stupid progression system for gear. It forces you to run daily elite zone farm chains which get extremely repetitive\n\nIf this was a small indie dev company, I could give them the benefit of the doubt. However this is frickin’ Amazon. This product is totally unacceptable and needs to go back in the oven.\n\n- I did everything right[spoiler]and ended up in a relationship.[/spoiler]\n\nAccidently said one tiny lie.\n\nEverything in my life crumbles apart.\n\n11/10 Real Life Simulator\n- As a historical novelist and former high school English teacher with over 700 books in my home devoted to ancient Greek literature, history and culture I had to try this game.\n\nI should mention that I am pushing 60 years old and although I like strategy games like Creative Assembly’s Rome II, I’m not a fan of ‘gopher’ games that make you run around collecting items, rescuing damsels in distress, delivering messages, and murdering politicians to level your character.  The whole premises seems rather tedious and unimaginative.  \n\nSo right from the start I expected to hate Assassin’s Creed Odyssey.  Combine that with the fact that I’d never played an Assassin’s Creed game before, and I am not the most nimble finger clicker, I was prepared to spend a good portion of my playing time getting my head lopped off.  \n\nNone of that happened.  Well, yeah, there is a pretty steep learning curve here.  I did spend a lot of my initial hours zigging when I should have been zagging, and with my opponent’s spear in my head, but I stuck with it and eventually even an old poop like me was able to figure out the mechanics.\n\nWhat kept me going was the sheer majesty of the game and the beauty of the surroundings.  \n\nI’ve been to Athens, Sparta, Argos, Mycenae, Delos, Aegina, Hydra, Crete, Melos (now Santorini), and dozens of other locales on the campaign map multiple times.  I’ve walked around the ruins at Delphi, strolled the docks of Piraeus and walked through valley of Laconia for research for my books.  I wanted to see these places at they might have looked 2,500 years ago and that for me is the true joy of Assassin’s Creed Odyssey.\n\nThe team at Ubisoft deserves a lot of credit.  They did their homework.  Sure, you’d expect to see historical figures like Pericles, Socrates, Alcibiades and Archidamas in a game about the Peloponnesian War.  But that anyone outside of academia even knows who Brasidas, Aspasia, Herodotus and Pausanias were, is impressive.  Kudos to you.\n\nI’m probably an oddball gamer because I was not motivated by stabbing people in the back to gain levels and steal loot.  The entire idea of stabbing people in the back goes against the grain of the Greek ethos of ‘kleos’ or honor.  What kept me going was the desire to see more of the world that Ubisoft created.  \n\nI wanted to visit the Athenian Acropolis and see the Propylaea, Erechtheion and Parthenon as they were shiny and new, instead of in piles of rubble.  I wanted to gaze up at Phidias' statue of Zeus in Olympus (one of the wonders of the ancient Greek world that no longer exists), speak to the Pythia at the temple of Delphi, and see the five villages of Sparta as they might have looked.  Getting to walk the streets of Athens, Argos and Elis was like taking a trip back in time.  Magical.\n\nOkay, the game isn’t perfect.  The pronunciation of common names like Pericles and Socrates and the character’s accents were maddening.  I can only guess that Ubisoft believes we’ve Americanized the real pronunciations, or at least I hope that’s what they were thinking.  Ultimately it’s a minor annoyance.\n\nThe hoplite battles were a major disappointment.  The Greeks fought in a phalanx formation.  Shoulder to shoulder.  Shield to shield.  The battles here are a 300 movie style free for all.  Oh well, guess you can’t have everything.  \n\nAlso I could not fathom how Alexios and Kassandra could be descended from Leonidas, but have no connection to the Agiad royal family.  By rights they should have been Pausanias’ cousins, but they’re not.  I don’t know who they are. The whole Pythagoras-is-my-father thing is rather bizarre and makes no sense at all.  \n\nI won’t go off the charts here listing the historical inaccuracies that drove me batsh!t crazy, as it serves no purpose.  Suffice it to say that I enjoyed the game.  \n\nIf you ever wanted to unravel the labyrinth of the minotaur beneath King Minos palace at Knossos, get drunk and sing songs with Socrates at an Athenian symposium, feel the Aegean Sea roll beneath your feet on the deck of a  trireme, or stare out in wonder at the lights twinkling over Attica at twilight, try this game.  You won’t be disappointed.\n- Finally, a video game that is everything televangelists in the 90’s said that video games were. Exactly what my Christian mother would love to catch me playing.\n\nIt’s like Animal Crossing and Doom\nEternal had a son… as was foretold when they released on the same day.\n\nThis game really makes you FEEL like you’re sacrificing your friends to an almighty force. Would I really just sacrifice 5 of my friends  again for some loot chests? I’m a gamer, of course I would.\n\nI fell in love with the aesthetic of this game instantly. It was brilliant when the gameplay held up to those expectations.  \n\nI loved it. I loved the art. The humor. The theme. The premise. The combat. The cult management. Sacrifices. Collecting the bones of my enemies. The juice visual effects. Most of all I loved feeding my followers bowls of poop.\n\nThe combat is fun but definitely not the meat of the game. Building your cult and just upgrading stuff is quite satisfying.  There's some goofy stuff to laugh at and it's quick and responsive. There’s something about the music that makes you feel relaxed and in terrible danger all at the same time.\n\nThis is not a game that you're gonna put 50-100 hours in either.  Which to me is a big plus.  Most of the runs don't take you more than 15 minutes.  So it's an easy game to pick up and play for a bit and jump back in later. It's like Vampire Survivors in that regard.\n\nIt's basically Animal Crossing with a roguelite twist. I could say it's almost original how those elements were combined.\nIt's great entertainment, all around. You could even say the game is bound to become a cult classic…\n\n10/10\n- I wish there were a \"mixed\" option for recommending this game, as I think for a lot of people out there, this is a fantastic game, and it's definitely well made with a lot of love and attention to detail in many respects. I really like puzzles and problem solving, so part of my disappointment with The Witness is that I really thought I would enjoy the game. Myst was one of my favorite games growing up, and I was extremely excited to see a well-reviewed game in the Myst genre surface after far too long. \n\nThe problem for me was that The Witness is very much a game about the journey, and not the destination. It turns its head on the genre as it's less a game about solving puzzles within a set of rules, and more about discovering what those rules are. And for the most part, it does that well. Instead of the usual game conventions, rewards for solving hard puzzles weren't any kind of story unlock, more just to give you a harder puzzle. That approach was fun for awhile, but some story unlock would've been appreciated, especially because there is so much mystery and it's such an immersive world that was clearly built for a reason and has a fascinating backstory. \n\nSome of the mechanics also just seem arbitrary, or at the very least, not quite obvious enough. Sometimes perspective puzzles require you to either take a screenshot or jot down on pencil and paper the answer, then transfer it on screen. That seems like lazy game design and worst of all, takes you out of the immersive experience. It's possible I'm mostly tone deaf, as some of the sound puzzles seemed almost impossible to me, despite numerous listens. There's also just the repetitiveness of the \"pathfinding\" puzzles, which range from challenging (and satisfying) to punitive in their difficulty spikes. It's in these difficulty spikes where I think the core game mechanic of pathfinding lets you down, as it requires you to be much more of a planner than a \"hands on\" problem solver. In a game like this, I would think it would accommodate multiple approaches, but really there's a right way to approach this game, and a wrong way. Unfortunately for me, I think the way I approach puzzles (trial and error) is strongly discouraged, at times in punitive ways. \n\nThe philosophy from the audio/video portions will likely be appreciated by some, and for some come off as the worst kind of douchey-hipster nonsense. Had they been delivered in shorter pieces, I might've fallen into the former. But as rambling as some of them are, I found them more annoying than enjoyable unfortunately. \n\nI don't know, I'm really torn on this. It's a well made game, and while it seems so open and non-confined, I found the game to be far too linear in mechanics and how to approach problem solving. At times it actually made me feel like a lesser thinker because I have a different approach to puzzles than what the game designer prefers. What I'm sure is a really fun journey for some, left me disappointed with the destination. \n\nAm realizing this reads a lot like an apology for not liking this game, which I think it is. I really, really wanted to love The Witness, but in the end, not only was this game not for me, but I genuinely feel lesser for that fact because I feel like I should have loved it, and just didn't.\n- While I don't necessarily play medieval type games...I thought I should give this game a go...but tbh I was highly disappointed...this game is poorly optimized...full of glitches...poor characterization... terrible voice acting....& terrible facial expressions...only good thing about this game is the detailing of the rats...and some lighting effects...other than that this is just another pathetic excuse of a game.... wouldn't recommend it even on sale...it's a huge let down...tbh...\n- Oh boy. DoDonPachi Resurrection.\nI love this game. Its loads of modes, tight controls, great bullet patterns, and fun gameplay and scoring mechanics make it an awesome shooter. \nThat being said, this game is tough as nails. Even the novice mode is hard as heck and definitely isn't novice-friendly. I reccomend having one or two shmup clears under your belt before you try to tackle DoDonPachi. (Crimzon Clover's novice mode is a good introduction to shmupping) You need some skill to get the maximum amount of enjoyment out of this game.\n\nStill, though, It's awesome! DoDonPachi Resurrection is a very fun experience, even with it's difficulty.\n\n- You can return to character customization whenever you want. Game of the year.\n- getting better in controls, HUD, and resources management balances, unlike Rise TR\nslight improvement in graphics, OST is good though\nseveral 'cool' scenes, creativity has taken a great leap <applause>\ncross over with Assassin's Creed (due to same publisher?)\nLara is getting more and more 'demonic', no hard feelings, its just subliminary messages to the youth by major games coorporation\nI can't believe i can play as Lara Kid instead of Lara Croft :D '+1'\nstoryline is getting ridiculous, come back to earth bruh LOL its good fun\n\ngood luck on your future endeavour devs :)\n- [I received this product for free from a giveaway]. Only played for a short time, but sheesh, it's a bit of a mess both visually and gameplay wise. There's not much I can really say that would differ from what's shown in the trailer (rather crude MS-paint looking drawings with a few short looping backgrounds). You jump when moving right or left, flappy-bird esque, you dodge stuff going across the screen and from the top, which is a bit boring to me, but some may enjoy it more. You also have to go out of the screen to dodge sometimes, but also if you go too far out (who knows how far) you'll die as well. It might be an okay time waster for free (like old flash games), but I wouldn't recommend spending your money on this.\n- 1/10 play time is afk card farming\ncould not even finish one level\ncrashed on me when i just started building stuff every time\ndidn't even make it to seeing the enemy in game ever\n- I appreciate the sincerity of Jusant. You can tell its creators have placed genuine care into their product, which has made the experience of playing it joyful and kind.\nThe visuals are stunning, the mechanics are not overwhelming, the soundtrack is soothing, and the puzzles are not frustrating. A great climbing game all around with an easy-to-follow yet gripping narrative. \nHopefully, Ukrainian localization will also be added soon.\n\n- Overall, there's just too many things about this game that rub me the wrong way.\n\nFirst of all, I definitely like the art, visuals, music, voice acting, and writing. They don't hold your hand when it comes to explaining the story and it forces you to pay attention and also encourages you to try lots of different function combinations so you can learn more about the characters, if you care to.\n\nOther than that, though, there's not much I like. The most important aspect of games to me is whether the gameplay is fun, and honestly transistor's gameplay isn't that much fun for me. Like others have said, not being able to do anything after you pause time and plan out a sequence of moves just sucks. They don't even give you enough mobility to dodge shots. All you can really do is try to get to cover and hide out until your meter replenishes. And if you opt to instead play without using turn (or using turn to pause and think and then unpausing and simply executing your actions manually), you'll probably disappointed by that experience when comparing it to the action oriented gameplay of bastion. One of the worst things, in my opinion, is that you lose access to functions when you lose all your health. Honestly I'd rather just die and restart from checkpoint. I can see that they're trying to encourage you to try different combinations of things, but it still just frustrates me losing the build that I was in the process of learning. And when your options are limited the gameplay just gets more and more boring because you might have to resort to gimmicky tactics depending on what functions you are left with. Overall, it's certainly a unique idea to blend the turn-based with real-time combat, but, in practice, it ends up just not being all that fun to me. I'd rather play a turn based game or an action game. My brain doesn't like switching between the two so rapidly.\n\nI would say get this heavily discounted and play it for the uniqueness and aesthetics. Don't come here expecting something very heavy or that you're going to really want to sink countless hours into or replay. My first playthrough was done in 6 hours and I was glad to be done with it. I have to complement them for not dragging it out or having some frustratingly long and tedious boss fight at the end. If the story went on even an hour longer I might've just gotten sick of it and given up.\n\nIf you're into experience games more along the lines of how you experience art or other aesthetic experiences (and not necesarilly for the thrill of challenge and victory), you should definitely consider this game. There's a lot there to process. I personally don't care much about that sort of thing when it comes to games, though.\n- When I say this game changed the way I thought about life, I mean it. And before you say this game isn't worth 44 dollars, you are wrong. I would pay more than double just for this once in a lifetime experience.\n\nWhile this game may look like a stupid bishoujo romance game, it is so much more. Don't let the weird artstyle or obnoxious eyes fool you, this game will make you laugh. cry, depressed, happy, and everything in between. It is so extensive, so great, that there are over 13 character routes and stories to play in this game, all of which are good (some are incredible) and have some of the best, most fleshed our characters I have seen. This game is about life, change, friends, love, and most importantly, family. Every route in this game has a connection to family. (Clannad is a close-enough translation of family in Irish)\n\nIn case it helps, I'm a grown man who had a rather negative outlook on life, and this game me cry buckets. If you ever have thought about getting married and having kids, this game will MAKE you want to have a family. The clever writing and how the protagonist, Okazaki, changes throughout his life is all done so well. It made me realize how much we complain about our lives, but we don't need much to be happy or be motivated. In case it helps again, my mom loves this game, she connects with it quite a bit. Yet again, nothing bad to say here, only to say that Key is incredible and I will be reading some of their other works like Little Busters and Kanon.\n- Really didn't plan on reviewing, but noticed a lot of people asking if this is worth $15 on sale. Short version - definitely yes. Now onto specifics...\n\nOffline modes are very much improved. Expansion teams for MyGM/MyLeague, with expansion draft of course, and customization options for those are really cool, for example if you're looking to create a legitimate historic team court and things, you can actually get pretty close using just in-game editor. Only bad part is that you can only create 2 custom jerseys (home and away) per team. MyCareer is a vast improvement over last year, specifically due to absence of the Spike Lee story. There's a new \"story\" so to speak, it irks some people, but it's not too bad and you still have control over the entire season. One downside is due to new player archetypes, you're effectively reduced to a role player even when you reach your maximum. Personally I can still hit triple-double average on Hall of Fame difficulty with my primary player, but the new stat caps severely limit the player potential. Ironically, you can't at all play some of the iconic player archetypes such as true all-around, 3 and D, or Dunker/Defensive Specialist.\n\nOnline modes on PC are... disgusting. First off there's a smaller player base, so you're bound to run into some queue times, or a completely dead queue very late in the night. Also, the game is susceptible to cheats, for example, only couple of months ago they blocked one particular cheat from MyTeam auction house, which was blatantly obvious and apparent and had very bad impact on economy. I won't go into details here as I don't want to be seen as advertising cheating, but I think it's very obvious they are weak on the ban hammer side, and the game itself is weak on protection. Also there is the unavoidable server lag for online modes, couple of sources close to the company explained that all servers are in Virginia, US, even the EU or Asian servers.\n\nGameplay is improved over the last year, primary addition being various types of Pick and Roll defenses, you can literally see different teams using different defenses and things like that. However I feel it's important to note that stock difficulty settings are sorely lacking in realism/simulation aspect. They are all very much arcade. However, there are lot of simulation slider settings listed at OperationSports for example, and once you tweak them, the game really shines. Of course, there are still couple of bad animations that can't be completely avoided, but custom sliders help out a lot in this regard. I should note that by default MyCareer doesn't allow custom slider settings, but there's a mod tool that can be used to accomplish this.\n\nGraphics of course you can easily see in any random gameplay video - they are obviously improved over last year(s). One part that sort of falls into this category that is dramatically worse are the replays. About 50% of the time, the replay will use the silly rim camera, and you won't be able to see the play at all.\n\nIn summary, as you can probably tell from the hours I played, I find this to be a great game, not like we really have a choice on PC when it comes to basketball. After thoroughly playing most of the game modes (except Play Now Online & All Star Team-Up), I'd easily recommend this to any basketball fan. However, keep in mind that online modes can be very frustrating, and if that's your primary reason for purchasing, it might be wise to wait and see how 2k18 turns out in that regard.\n- I like the game, but I'd recommend waiting for the full release.\nDon't get me wrong, the game is beautiful and it's got great potential. The problem with it is, mostly, the keybindings. They are incredibly uncomfortable to use and you cannot change them.\nPlus, the dialogues sometimes feel never ending and quite pointless.\n- [H1]At this price point it's hard not to recommend it, but there's a lot -better- bullet hell games out there...[/H1]\n\nDanmaku unlimited as a series is great. Don't get me wrong. It really is. But it suffers the curse of being put in with a field on Steam that is made up of even greater company. Bug Princess by Cave has the brutal difficulty angle sewn up, Ikaruga has the absolute classic angle nailed, Jamestown has the glorious pixel-art sorted. In order to stand out in this genre, you absolutely have to bring something new to the table.\n\nAs good as Danmaku Unlimited is, it does not bring anything new to the table. It brings a lot of -good-, but nothing -new-. The greatest sin here is that if you've played a lot of bullet hells, this is going to feel immensely familiar, and you're going to blast through it fast, nothing is prone to catch you out. At all. Now that may be a plus point, if that's what you're after, but if you're seeking something to change up the formula? Yeeeeee-no.\n\n[H1]So it's the Bullet Hell version of Destiny?[/H1]\n\nMechanically, it works great. You have a ship with a teeny tiny hitbox, same as most \"Eastern\" BHell games, you have anywhere between \"Mildly offensive\" and \"Absolutely terrifying\" levels of hostile fire coming toward you, and you pump out similarly scary levels of fire back, with your only choice generally being \"Do I spam the screen with lots of little beams or do I fire ONE BIG BEAM at something that needs cracking open like a walnut.\"\n\nIt has good Bullet Hell music, albeit not outstanding music, it has good graphics, albeit not outstanding graphics, you see a pattern here? If a game could ever nail what I'd define as the absolute essence of an \"8 out of 10\", this would be it. The problem is there's games out there such as Revolver360 Re:Actor that do -better-.\n\nThe problem is that for all the good it does, it's been beaten to it by other games, maybe not in every field, but in each area I can name at least two or three games that stand above it. The one area it does win out on is bang for the buck. It's kinda hard to argue with this kind of quality at this kind of price point. It's a very, very solid return on investment, particularly if you're a bullet hell fan.\n\n[H1]Closing Thoughts[/H1]\n\nDoes that make this a \"Do not buy\"? Far from it. If you're a fan of bullet hells, chances are you already own it. If you don't, eventually you should, but I'd genuinely suggest you look around first, there's a decent market now on Steam for this genre, and there's more innovative and interesting options around. If however you've already consumed them and you need a fix of something fairly solid and fairly entertaining, then sure, this works, it will scratch the itch quite nicely.\n\nVerdict : [b]Buy, definitely worth grabbing on a sale, if only to put in the \"To do\" list,[/b]\n- Overall its a great hunting game. The base game is good enough on its own to give you an enjoyable experience hunting several varieties of animals. \n\nI feel that some of the best content is in the DLC's. I dont mind the price tag for maps are they are just a large and some of them have a truly diverse animal population. \n\nThe Weapon Packs have some items that really should have been available in the base game (.22 rifle).\nTripod stands, Tents and ATV's are also DLC items that i feel should have been included in the base game. \n\nThe cost for these packs are not huge, and I have bought them, but they really do impact your play in a meaningful way so it is hard not feel like they were left out on purpose. \n\nBeing a former hunter in real life I would say that the realism of it is pretty good. Lung shots and heart shots drop animals quickly and using the right ammo along with good aim greatly influences this. A poor shot will leave you tracking this wounded animal across the map till you sneak up on it again or just give up. \n\nThey have a system called Tru Racks (sumthn like that) that simulates different qualities of animals. So you end up with little bucks, average bucks, and monster bucks. Weight and coloration plays a part in this too. In short every animal has a trophy of some kind and they are varied by what must be some sort of RNG. \n\nAll that having been said, this game can devolve into a shooting gallery were you kill everything on sight as there in no real incentive not to. You get money and experience for every kill you claim and wiping out a heard of deer with your DLC M1 Garand on your DLC Tripod Stand becomes the quickest way to bypass the grind.\n\n It feels like the game starts as a \"hunting sim\" and becomes a \"poaching sim\" once you realize the progression system is going to take a long time to do...\"ethically?\".\n\n\nAgain, this is a game i would recommend, but it is just that, a game. \n\n\n- It's a cute point and click.\nI am salty though that it's tagged \"choices matter\" as they most certainly do not\n- The Witch's House has been my most favorite RPG Maker horror game for years and now I have the remaster which I can buy to directly support the developer. Needless to say how good it is so I will only talk about what is changed and what still remains.\nThe game is still suspenseful and very atmospheric. Some people may worry that the updated graphic and engine may take that away but trust me it is still there and not going anywhere.\nSome sound effects/dialogues have been changed beside the graphic which I am not against it at all. Still very like the remaster.\nThe control is still the same which is as clunky as before when you are not used to. I think the developers know that and decided to not change it so I won't complain. Just say it out for you to know because the game is very old so the control is still there in the past with many other RPG maker games.\nI very like the new graphic and I think they deserve much more compliments for this. However, I like the weird-big-eye Viola model and her less hair skinny portrait more. It look weird and funny at the same time. The new model makes her more beautiful but the portrait makes her kinda fat (at least to me).\nThe new hard mode is.... hard that all I can say without spoiler.\nI don't know whether or not I should calll this a remake but at least it is done better than DSR. And Small indie developers should be supported more. May be \"Ib\" will be remastered some days too if this game is success\nThump Up!\n- SUPER MARIO!......\nsorry  not really :P\nits a platform game yes but nothing like mario\nyou can spend a lot of time in this game and still not master it\nthis is a game thats really good for platform gamers that gt to goodfor mario games\nand a punisher for those who are nt that good in those types of games \nit has lots of humor ad moments that will want to eat yoer fingernaisl to the bones\ni say hell yeah to this game even do it got me mad a few times\n- It has poor simulation of hand skeleton, so you can't use all fingers, benefits of Index Knuckles controller or VR gloves, etc. And, scenario doesn't allow you to do anything, actually, except one straightforward way. Some things are elaborated, but mostly it isn't worth time or money. But I'm rating it as professional developer for VR, sexual content itself is not matter nor interested for me. My advice for game developer is to add more hand tracking features and more scenarios - in this case it can be something better.\n- PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE VENTURING INTO 999!\n\n\n\nI refunded the game thinking they removed so much of the narrative but I was wrong, the game has now 2 different types of screens, the \"ADV screen\" and the \"Novel screen\". Make sure you switch to \"Novel screen\" as soon as you start playing and stay on that screen as the \"ADV screen\" only displays dialogue and NOTHING ELSE, if you stay on this screen you'll miss all the extra bits that can help to figure out certain details that allow you to find all the endings and figure out the entire story top to bottom.\nHappy gaming.\n\nEDIT: @Snivader pointed out my mistake, edited the review.\n\n\n\nExtra small tip to help you through your journey. Take a notepad (or anything you can scribble down onto), and write down key dates / codes / people that you encounter through the game and keep them close while playing the entire trilogy. I can guarantee you that your mind will be blown by the end of the trilogy (provided you can keep up with the weird events that go down in these games).\n- Can we please get an online co-op? My s/o and I both have the game and remote play doesn't work cuz internet connection is too slow. So we can't even play this game that we were super excited to play together. Please update for an online co-op!\n- I pay money for early access\nA lot of bug but developer dont care you feedback just update useless money sea and let player survivel in game without water\n\nNow developer just want reset you save that i play 33hr to build\n\nHowever, New story so fucking soggy \nI have play this game before update can see some timeline \n\nNew update dont care everything you can get in late chapter of the game without vehicle. Just run in and die \n\nStory so confuse if you new plyer and play in this update you will get bad and confuse experience\n\n\nI disappointed to this dev \n\nBut interest in concept of this game\n\nI suggest you to buy when it already full game\n\nDont waste your time in early access with dev who’s not care supporter\n- Beware as you are just looking at the best 4X game that is.\n\nDon't look at my played time here, this game was available for years already from a very unheard of distributor BUT now is available on Steam at last for the people to see it already.\n\nMaybe you are wondering why it costs so much. Well it has 4 expansions build in it already so that's why. But believe me IT'S WORTH IT. If you like 4X games, this is just a must have.\n\nThe cons:\n\n1. The game is not turn based. Everything is done in real time. You can pause the game and speed it up or slow down at your own liking. This may be a + for someone though... \n2. It's not as shiny as some other 4X games so if pretty graphics are what you prefer you may be disappointed.\n3. The game can be demanding even on high end PC's if you run really large galaxy.\n4. Unfriendly UI. If you run huge resolution you will have problems to read the text.\n5. The learning curve... you will spend hours getting into the game. But don't be afraid, huge automation can be set up to help you.\n6. No multiplayer. I don't mind it but maybe you do?\n\nThe Pros:\n\nEverything else. It's the most complex, never ending fun 4X game I have played. Just the way how the AI is done hooked me up. But to make it fair here are some picks for you.\n\n1. Huge amount of races that actually play in character. It's not like in other games where every AI plays the same way but has different stats. Here the AI behaves in the ways how they are described. They play in character like in RPG game.\n2. HUGE galaxies. Trust me you never saw something like this before in other 4x games. Each game can last for dozens of hours if you want.\n3. Set up your game to the last possible thing you can imagine. The start up set up is just incredible.\n4. Automation ... don't like research, or ship design, or diplomacy, or anything else you can imagine? You can automate it. You can focus only on the one thing you like the most!\n5. Pirates ... you can even play as one.\n6. Mods ... do you want 10 more races or to play Star trek 4x? ... You can have it. \n7. Micromanagement ... it can be endless.\n8. The complexity, you can spend hours in design tables that make sense in comparison to Moo3 for example.\n9. Battles, there is very few games that can simulate such large scale engagements over the whole galaxy.\n10. Play it your own way. You can win the game without any battle if you want. On the other side waging wars is FUN.\n\nDo you need to know more? Watch some videos on YouTube from Das24680. He has also full tutorials for those who would need them.\n\n*Update - I have added more Pros as this game deserves it and I have forgot to mention them.\n- Horrible FOV, glitchy looking graphics, everything is blurred even with motion blur off, absolutely no chance of that multiplayer mod, shoddy PC port... Pretty boring and clunky tbh. Don't buy this.\n- Absolutely amazing. PLEASE don't judge this game based on how it looks. You must try it yourself! I thought it would be terrible but a friend convinced me to try it, and I'm glad he did. I haven't had so much fun in a game in a long time.\n- Indie games, second worst games after online free java and others.\n\nPro\n- music\n- pixel art\n\nCon\n- pixel art, too old, get on with times, we have enough of this\n- screen is constantly flickering with lines and colors, like interlacing, very bad,\n     put up a warning for epilepsy\n- incomprehensible story, looked up online because i couldn't understand\n    any of the nonsense and bad font system used\n- one hit death\n- no quicksave or checkpoint system\n- unskipable cutscenes, atrocious\n- annoying point's system pop up and can't see the screen full of enemies\n- too many enemies and autoaiming bots\n- last boss is a luck based win, 50 tries, then looked up for help, 20 more tries, win\n- can't see the whole map or at least realistically forward, the enemy is off screen\n    one shooting you, then from the beginning again, waste of my precious time\n- if enemies leave the building you get stuck and can't continue\n     if you didn't kill them they just flee\n- hit detection and object collision problems\n- no difficulty settings\n\n\n2/10 rating.      \n\nDon't pay more than 1$, i got it in a bundle, what a curse among better games.\n\nGlad i got to end credits, no need for answers and bonus levels, no-no, i had enough\n    of this horrid experience, seven and half hours, 30 minutes fun Max, the rest is a repetitive\n      waste of time, my blood pressure got up from this experience.\n- When reading reviews for this game you'll generally find two camps. There are people who find DW:U incredibly deep and engaging, and there are those who find it incredibly obtuse and frustrating. The problem is they're both right. The game does feature a wealth of features, and you will almost certainly never experience them.\n\nEven for a player like me who is used to impenetrable strategy games like Europa Universalis this was difficult to play. Income see-saws drunkenly from crippling deficit to fabulous surplus and back again depending on what's happening this exact second. Land combat units are jam packed into impossibly tiny UI bars. AI factions have reams of vague, undefined character traits. The encyclopedia technically gives information on everything but is so poorly organized and unsearchable as to verge on useless.\n\nWith time, practice, and a lot of time spent researching on independent websites you can have fun with this game. But for sixty dollars you shouldn't have to, and quite frankly, don't. Find yourself one of the many excellent 4Xs in the store and pass over this ambitious but ultimately flawed gem.\n- This is the best Civilization up to this point, and the DLC just made it even better. I will grant that the with all the add ons it would feel a tad crowded to anyone who hadn't played it before, but you have a crazy amount of options. The game series tagline of \"one more turn\" could not be more applicable.\n\nYou can strive for one of several victories: diplomatic, cultural, technological or domination. Each has its unique challengers to overcome and create a lot of the fun of the game. They are also not necessarily mutually exclusive and after completing one victory, you can go for the others. Each AI opponent has their own personality, and are pretty predictable in how they behave. Any one who has started the game next to Neopoleon or Ghengis Kahn knows they immediately have to have a decent military to repel invasion, while Ghandi will to muscle you out with religion and culture.\n\nThere are some important changes between Civilization IV and V. One of the most notable is that wars are plausible again as you dont constantly lose health in enemy territory and cities are easier to conquer. Additionally, culture doesn't automatically take over neighbor's cities anymore. \n\nThis game is easily worth the money. I'm not entirely sure how it stacks up to Civilization VI, but any game that I log 200+ hours on over a period of years and still haven't come close to doing everything is doing something right. A great game from a great series.\n- 3 things:\n\n-Flatten land\n\n-Click citadel to get warriors\n\n-Click warriors at their warriors\n\nGood job, you've just mastered the entire game.\n\nThe game includes such crazy moments as:\n\n-Flattening land\n\n-Seeing the enemy flatten land\n\n-flattening your land faster\n\n-Clicking trees and rocks since your workers can't do shit\n\n-Clicking your warriors into their town\n\n-Watching your warriors fight their warriors\n\n-Accidentliy Alt+Tabing and having the game get stuck in windowed mode\n\n10/10 Would trust Peter Moloneux and be dissapointed again... apparently.\n\nProtip, send this to someone that loves you and watch them try to pretend that they enjoy it.\n- DO NOT BELIEVE WHAT EVERYONE ELSE IS SAYING. This game is a bloody masterpiece, it just takes the proper skill and knowledge to properly play it. There are proper real life mechanics which are fun as well as true to the real life process of making games. I personally have less than half an hour of experience with this game, showing that this is a captivating game that really draws you in and makes you beg for more. This is one of the games which will definitely be up there for GOTY. winkyface\n- Wait. So you are telling me that I have to purchase this faction as well as US & OBERKOMANDO to play offline VS AI?? WTH is wrong with gaming companies nowadays?\n- Alright. Reviewing a free to play game once again.\n\nThis is a game created by a game lover. RPG lover to be precise. \n\nIt's a very simple Action RPG. The whole game is quite straight forward with minimum amount of puzzle and Mazes. \n\nThere are a few secret chest that's a bit hard to find. \nBut generally it's a very relaxing and non-demanding game.\nThe game itself is very short, 3-4 hours worth but you can possible play longer if you want to.\n\nMusic is basic and okish with no voice acting. (small indie game after all).\n\nThe biggest + for this game are two:\n1. Wonderfully touching story with multiple ending.\n2. Interesting designed boss with 3 different difficulty. \n\nFor some challenge and extra intense action i recommend everyone to beat all 3 boss on hard difficulty.\nThe last one is very hard but just ignore the chaos and act quickly and decisively.\n\nOne extra hint/recommendation i have for everyone is go to keyboard setting and disable sticking key for the final boss.\n(so you have more percision on control when you move around. You want to click up key to move 1 up. To avoid holding up too long and move up 2 square.).\n\nfor Freebie... 9/10.\n\nIf it wasn't free to start i would pay 1-2 dollar for this game and rate is 7/10.\n- My gambling addict friend said if I post a review on this game and it gets 150 likes and 25 Awards that he will buy me a case of beer. So I'm just gonna leave this here\n- EDIT: I nominated this game for game of the year (2023)\n\nLong ago I had heard about this game and how detailed and intricate it could be, and how you could spend hours upon hours building the massive empire of dwarves only for it to all come crashing down in some spectacular but unforeseen way.  Then I got into Rimworld briefly and thought it was ok, but it tended toward chaos a bit too much for my liking.  THEN I heard this game was coming to steam and I eagerly awaited it.\n\nIt's not necessarily that I was too good to play a game with mostly ascii/character graphics (I used to play them a lot back in the 1980s).  I was more intimidated by the depth of the game and not knowing if there was a wiki for it (there is) or how I'd find help if I needed it (I'm sure there's a ton of communities JUST for this game).  I expected that when it came to Steam, it'd be beefed up and worth the wait.\n\nWell it finally arrived and I think I'm STILL a bit intimidated by the sheer amount of options you have... mostly because it's not just me that I have to worry about, but a whole community of dwarves.  In the case of something like minecraft, I could dig a whole intricate tunnel and if stuff starts to go bad, I just high-tail it out of there and recover until I can go back and finish it.  In Dwarf Fortress though, if stuff starts to go bad, you can't just leave.  You are encouraged to deal with the adversity and push onward in the name of greatness... or something.\n\nIn a way it's like role playing, except you don't have to roll character sheets and you don't really control any of the characters directly.  You make decisions about where to mine, what trees to chop down, what to build, what to trade, what to plant, and for every thing there is a season (turn turn turn).  You're forced to deal with death, birth, attacks, sickness, madness, and a ton of other things that I have no idea are coming.  \n\nI keep thinking \"I could do better\" and I start a new game, but then I start to realize that no matter what I do, I'm never gonna have a perfect game, or a game where everything goes exactly according to plan.  I am eventually going to have to buckle down and stick to one game save to see it through.\n\nIf you're like me and starting something new holds a lot more interest than continuing an existing project (ADHD?) you may have difficulty with this game.  At the same time you may become so engrossed in it that you lose track of time and suddenly it's 6am and you wonder why you stayed up all night digging holes.  I'm starting to feel a bit of the madness myself.  (it's almost 4:30am as I write this)\n\nIn any case, it's probably not for everyone, but I'd say if you're unsure, find the non-steam version and try that, and if you can grok what's going on and it interests you, definitely buy this and support the developers... OR buy this and try to stay under the 2 hour refund  limit while you learn the basics (Good luck with that, it'll be 6 hours before you know what happened).  I believe this game is worth the money though (full price).  If you were going to wait for a sale you'd be waiting a long time anyway.  \n\nTL;DR If this looks interesting to you, don't wait! Buy now.  If you aren't sure, do a bit of research and come back and buy it.\n- This game can be great at times but extremely frustrating most of the time. 80% change to hit, miss every time. I can't keep playing a game with so much crappy coding.\n- This game has such a HUGE potential like Stardew Valley in its early days!!\nCollecting stuff, helping people by crafting potions its so rewarding and lovely pls dear developers keep working on it. I BEG YOU! :D\nSure it has some bug right now but even on day one they managed to get some fast fixes and tried their best to make it work for everyone. \nThe controls were a bit tricky in the beginning (used Playstation 5 Controller) but its just a matter of time, its just not the normal controls like in other games.\nThe music was pretty nice and chill and also the animations were super cute, i love watching little Rubrum built his sandcastles over and over again. >3< \n\nOverall a good game, but could become even more better in the future, keep going guys!!\n- Ok so... \n\nFar From Noise is a narrative game in which you play a woman stuck in its car, balancing on the edge of a cliff. \n\nIt's about life, death, nature, purpose, creativity, dreams, stars and badgers. \n\nThe thing about Far From Noise is that it'll ask you something very special, something that we all forget to do nowadays, something that I've forgotten. This game will ask you to take your time. Don't rush things. Sit down and relax as you'll be forced to follow the slow pace of the game, but you'll enjoy it, for sure.\n\nThis game is for you if you come home after a rough day at work. This game is for you if you're searching for a meaning, a purpose in your life. This game is for you if you just want to experiment something new.\n\nBecause Far From Noise is offering you something new. It gives a vibe that is between Firewatch and Life is Strange, but without all the forced action, stress, adrenaline those game wanted to give. Don't misunderstand me, I loved those 2 games, but Far From Noise chose a direction more... pure. It's just you and the nature that evolves around you.\n\nI've finished the game within 90 mins, but I heard they were several endings, so I might as well try to get some more (but the one I've got fully satisfied me, to be honest).\n\nBeing more pragmatic, the art and sound coincide perfectly. The visuals are gorgeous and the musics hit just right where it needs to. You'll be lifted by the compositions as you'll stare into the beautiful sunset, and the dark starry sky.\n\nYou may find it expensive, as the game costs 8$ for one hour and a half of experience, but hey, think about a cinema ticket. Far From Noise is cheaper and the experience you'll live in it is wayyyyy more unique than most of the movies you go see. \n\nI recommend it. Play it. It'll put your mind at ease.\n\n\n\nPS: the main character is one of the most well-written i've seen in video games.\n- Blows every single PFS game of the last decade out of the water, even those shitty D**M games that people who never played FPS games before seems to worship in order to look cool. Smooth and fast gameplay with a lot of variety. Great visuals even on medium/high settings. Story and writing is shit but pretty much on the same level as rest of the Borderlands series with the exception of the Telltale one. Writing has always been the worst part of the series, dont be delusional retards.\n- Just go play it. It's only $20, and you have a 2hr refund limit. You'll love it way before then.\n\n...still here? Quick review. Awesome platformer, hits all the marks in flying colors. Let's compare w Mario Maker, the most similar game to this one:\n\n[edit: Updated to compare to SMM2 instead of 1]\nWhat Mario Maker 2 Does Better\n- Mario\n- Different themes/gameplay physics across multiple mario games\n- Much larger playerbase\n\nWhat Levelhead Does Better\n- Oh my god the search functionality\n    - Search by creator, difficulty, tags, what's popular, etc.\n    - TL;DR you can find the awesome, and avoid the crap\n- Level discovery\n    - Can actively advertise my levels\n    - Get rewarded for playing people's levels\n- $20\n- Dying doesn't take 12 years to respawn\n- Fun, short campaign to slowly unlock more creative tools after seeing how they are used\n- Local Co-op (or online with Parsec)\n- Leaderboards (if you care, I personally don't)\n\nI cannot stress enough how AMAZING it is to not have to suffer through crap levels. The search functionality is soooo good; as a casual player, it is the sole reason I stopped playing Mario Maker 1. Mario Maker 2 is better, but it still falls terribly short. I think the best part is that Levelhead gives people control over the visibility of their levels, as well as incentives to play other peoples, and that is something that SMM2 unfortunately lacks.\n- [i]While the artwork and combat remain enjoyable, the story, writing, and pacing were a major letdown.[/i]  \n\n***\nMINOR SPOILERS BELOW. If you're going to play the game, play before reading.\n***\n\n[b]The mature storylines, hard-hitting decisions, beautiful worldbuilding, and tight writing that made the first two so immersive is not present in this game.[/b] (You'll notice immediately that the writing for the caravan in the capital is [i]particular[/i] trite, awkward to read, and uninteresting.)\n\nUnfortunately, it's not just the writing that's weak. [i]The pacing is off.[/i] Antecedents are confusing, characters you'd expect to speak don't, events that should have been foreshadowed come out of nowhere. More frustrating are the serious character continuity \"errors,\" and arcs that disappear, change, or go nowhere. [i]In short, the events, decisions, and conflict from the previous games do not appear or resolve in a way that was suggested by the previous two[/i].\n\n\nHere's one example. In Banner Saga 2, Fosolt is unexpectedly rescued by Bolverk. [i]\"I have a message for Alette from the dead varl king,\" [/i]he said. That's pretty intriuging! Maybe there's a mystery, an oracle, an item, or just cool information about the Varl and their strange king? Maybe there'll finally be context about the bridge decision!\n\n[i]No! He has nothing interesting to say or add, and then his storyline just gets dropped and forgotten.[/i]\n\nWell, Bolverk's been possessed by Bellower! Gosh, who knows what Bellower will say? In fact, I can't wait to find out what happens to Bellower's body! \n\nWell, actually, Bolver's [i]not[/i] possessed, not really, certainly not like it was implied last game, and Bellower's body -- [i]a primary focus of the first two games[/i] -- isn't mentioned [i]once[/i]\n\nOr how about how they casually mention that Eyvyn is not only the [i]head[/i] of the Valka order, but also that he's had periodic bursts of hereditary madness all along? That's... odd. And it's not presented as an well-thought out [i]reveal[/i] or anything. It's presented matter-of-factly, like they were trying to ret-con in a less interesting story, or were tone deaf.\n\nYou'll notice that all the characters are underutilized and have unfulfilled storylines/tensions. Hakon has hard choices to make; Canary's a little crazy; Yrsa is mysterious; Gil's in love with Alette, etc. Will these build into choices? Reveals? Dependent endings based on choices? Will there be discussions referencing the past? Reflections on travels? Hints of despair?\n\nNo. In mine, Gil was [i]murdered[/i] and no one even bothered to reference it. Canary's situation never comes to a head. You never have to choose between Varls and Humans. Murdering people doesn't make people threaten to leave. Ubin returns randomly as an uber Varl and he's... learned the horseborne's language? Travelled the southlands? In like, a month? In a way that doesn't advance the plot? It's just... weakly done.\n\n\nThere are [i]so many[/i] examples like this, where the stories don't quite fit correctly, where what you picked up on in the early games about the [i]mysteries[/i] and the [i]world[/i] and what made it a [i]vibrant[/i] place were forgotten about by the writers. [b]The result is that it the game plays out in unsatisfying ways, in tenseless scenarios made vapid by watered-down morality, an inability to leverage the situation in fun ways, and low-quality writing, paucity of choice-making, a lack of exploration, lack of plot twists, simplified overworld mechanics -- all culminating in an almost staggeringly one-dimensional and shallow ending.[/b]\n\nThe Banner Saga series was always an experience that was greater than the sum of its part. An [i]experience[/i]. Of being [i]riveted[/i] to the computer, checking the map, worrying over supplies, guessing at mysteries, having my breath taken away at each hill. Unfortunately, that's not the case in this game. \n\n\nGameplay-wise, it's also a bit of a letdown. Combat is fun-ish, but you can make invincible character combinations and the mechanics don't even try to deal with this. There's an interesting new reinforcement mechanic that's not used heavily, and never pushes you like you think the end of the world would. You never really have to split up your forces. There's no novelty. Like maybe using a hero in a battle makes them fatigued, so you have to switch them up? Maybe you can station them different places, making them unusable for combat? Maybe you need to choose eight for a secret mission caravan? Maybe dream sequences? No, nothing like that. \n\nThe overworld gameplay had some changes that never really felt significant. Moreover, quite a bit felt taken away. You can't rest, do training missions, no longer weigh food vs upgrades. One example of all thise tone deafness was Iver's march through the destroyed world was consistently at \"Great Morale!\"\n\nThere didn't seem to be many flavor choices (\"Do we hang the criminals or let them join us?\"), including much less on social themes (\"Should women fight, if it disturbs the traditionally-minded men?\" \"One clan's rowdy, what do we do?\" \"They threaten to leave if so and so isn't banished\"), and less delayed results and fewer significant decisions, including among the game's built-up tensions among the factions. \n\n\nThere's also some cases of development [i]feeling[/i] cheap. Remember opening Banner Saga 2, and feeling that it was [i]fresh[/i], and [i]upgraded[/i]? There's little to make you feel that way here. The artwork is okay, but the environments feel more generic, with less variety, and the surreal landscapes in the darkness aren't especially interesting to look at for long periods of time. Iver is voiced by Bolverk's voice actor, and they sound exactly the same. The new title system is a fun idea, but is visually integrated into the game's menu system with the finesse of a cheap mod. \n\nThere's a moment in the game where the screen goes black for scrolling text and voiceover narration explaining the upcoming mechanic. Um, a character can't explain that? It was similar how the many two second animations are used, not to supplement the story, but to [i]replace[/i] written portions, making you feel unsure about what's going on. And finally, the game's pretty short, without fun combat challenges or interesting newgame+ challenges. \n\n\nWhat's [i]particularly[/i] frustrating is that the game's release date was moved forward four months. I don't know the story why, but I do know that a few more months of polish and story embellishment might have delivered the beautiful, grippingly interactive story we were hoping for. Because this is a watered down version of the previous two in just about every way.\n\nThis negative review is for whatever processes lead to this mediocre finale.\n\n---\n\n[i]Here's a plot that would have made more sense. Zephyr arrives and speaks to you secretly. There's a god that's still alive! Neat, now we'll finally get more story on that. Yay, fun caravan mode, now we need to take longships somewhere interesting!\n\nBut uh-oh! There's a Sundr villain going there as well, with an army of dredge! But at least now we'll finally get more story about the Sundr! \n\nThe god reveals something interesting, talks about Juno, the sun, gives a means to protect the city and help Iver. But when you return to the city, now the king and rugga and the factions have devolved into fighting based on your choices. How are you going to handle this? Which of many possibilities will ascend to the throne? How will you defend the city? And what mystery lies beneath the mountain of the city...\n\nFor Iver's caravan, there should be pockets of dredge villages kept alive by Spellsingers. Now you need to decide to plunder them or not! More stuff to do! Maybe go to the remains of the Varl capital first? Fight warped Valka? Realize deceptions, machinations, corruption, hear stories? Find new characters, have old ones die?\n\nInstead there... wasn't a plot?[/i]\n- Phat beatsies,\nSelf-deprecating humour that gives me self affirmation,\nPanders to my need for nostalgic nods,\nPlays smoothly, and so doesn't leave me stuck for hours helping me to feel like I have higher than average intelligence,\nMesses about with you based on the assumption of previous adventure game experience, which leads to making me go \"heh\" outloud more than three times.\n\nMildly amusing, could use more super space dust.\nPlayed on the \"hard\" difficulty option but activated other options out of curiosity, would recommend it for the extra shenanigans.\n\nIf I had to give it a score 8/10,\nWould pay for the soundtrack, that ear crack is cash money.\n\nA hell of a lot of work was put into this game & I suggest you press \" J \" on as many screens as you can handle to get some insight on the thought process behind this game, the effort and imagination that went into it.\n\nThe missing 2 points:\nfew bugs to work out, ain't no big but in a game where you are going to be thinking \"it's not progressing because I haven't mashed the appropriate non-sensical things together\" it needs to not bug out.\n\nSoundtrack not yet out - nah not actually taking points away from that, it'll be out soon as I understand it, but I need that fix Mr. Shellburger.\n- **DAY 1 REVIEW**\n!!There is no game here yet!! \nCan't get into a server (they aren't full usually empty) \nOnce you manage to make it in you cant gather any resources\nThe game has a harder time running than starfield\nYou can jump and sometimes not get rubber banned back\nThe game looks nothing like the screenshots displayed on the store \n\n\nI will update once they make substantial updates and there is something to talk about\n- If you look past all of the stale \"The Cake Is A Lie\" memes, you have your self a pretty clean cut, innovative experience. Portal may only last a few short hours, but it provides friendships (with your Companion Cube) and a bitter thirst for revenge against a mysterious voice within an equally mysterious facility. If you have not picked it up already, I would suggest this gem as the next part of your Steam library.\n- Gone are the days of mindless building and fun. Power grids? Taxes? Intense accounting and counter-intuitive path building. A pre-built zoo for tutorials. I actually felt MORE stressed after playing this game. If you're looking for something to flex that brain, perfect. If you're looking to release the cougars and create chaos, you can do that in sandbox I guess. You could also just not connect power grids correctly. Works like a charm. Honestly who thinks of these things\n- getting better in controls, HUD, and resources management balances, unlike Rise TR\nslight improvement in graphics, OST is good though\nseveral 'cool' scenes, creativity has taken a great leap <applause>\ncross over with Assassin's Creed (due to same publisher?)\nLara is getting more and more 'demonic', no hard feelings, its just subliminary messages to the youth by major games coorporation\nI can't believe i can play as Lara Kid instead of Lara Croft :D '+1'\nstoryline is getting ridiculous, come back to earth bruh LOL its good fun\n\ngood luck on your future endeavour devs :)\n- [h1]Dishonored 2.[/h1]\n[i]If old Samuel could see me now...[/i]\n\n[b][u]Introduction[/u][/b]\nAt its core, Dishonored 2 is little more than a mechanically and narratively contiguous continuation of the Dishonored formula. This isn't a bad thing - the first Dishonored was one of the best stealth-action games of all time - but innovation is too often overlooked in the games industry. DH2 does bring some nuance to the franchise, but new drawbacks are packaged in as well. Put plainly, Dishonored 2 is a game I adore just as much as the original, but there are aspects that certainly left me wishing for better.\n\n[b][u]Plot[/u][/b]\nThe game begins 15 years following Empress Jessamine's assassination, and her daughter, Empress Emily Kaldwin, has ruled the isles since that time. Her father and Lord Protector, Corvo Attano, advises and keeps close watch over her at court. Quickly after Dishonored 2's opening however, the Duke of Serkonos, Luca Abele, comes to Emily's royal tower - bearing a gift. He brings Emily's supposed long lost aunt, Delilah Kaldwin, who then immediately stages a coup in a bid to take the throne. She is successful, and you must escape the city of Dunwall as either Emily or Corvo (more on that later). You then travel to Karnaca, the capital of Serkonos, where you begin a personal crusade to [i]take back what's yours.[/i]\n\n[b][u]Technical Revamp[/u][/b]\nShifting focus for a look at DH2's presentation, the game is gorgeous. There's a hint of the old, comic-book-like aesthetic that was present in the original game, but the graphical fidelity has been greatly improved in this sequel. The textures, lighting, animations, visual effects, and environments are all elegantly rendered. It's easily one of the most beautiful games of 2016. As for the audio; sound effects and voices are realistic, and the OST is as iconic, if not more so than the first game's. Although, when it comes to performance, Dishonored 2 clearly falters. DH2 was a technical mess on launch, and while it runs decently now; some bugs, stutters, and crashes still persist. Overall the presentation is good, but the performance is surely sub-par.\n\n[b][u]Setting & Exploration[/u][/b]\nAs stated earlier, Dishonored 2 is set in Serkonos's city of Karnaca; known as The Jewel of the South. Gone are the dark grays and subdued browns of Dunwall, as Karnaca replaces them with bright, pastel blues and yellows. The metropolis has distinct cultural differences from Dunwall as well, whether it's the widespread use of wind-power over whale oil, or Karnaca's reliance on silver mining to employ its working class. In terms of level design, DH2's stages are much more expansive than anything seen in the first game too. There's lots to explore in every district of Karnaca, especially when verticality and hidden locations are taken into account. There's several routes toward all objectives as well; emphasizing Arkane's \"play your way\" motto. All considered, Dishonored 2's game world is exceedingly well-built.\n\n[b][u]Depth in the Details[/u][/b]\nOne of the most effective ways DH2 differentiates itself from its predecessors is through what I'd call 'structural gimmicks.' To break up the standard pacing, a couple of the game's missions have special set-pieces which can completely turn gameplay convention on its head. An example of this is the 'Clockwork Mansion' on the fourth level. This inventor's home has levers in essentially every chamber that reconfigures a room's layout - such as turning a trophy room into a grand hall. These levers can be used to access new areas or evade enemies, and even reveal traversable spaces behind the walls. It's this degree of imaginative design depth that distinguishes Dishonored 2 from most other games in its genre.\n\n[b][u]Stealth & Combat[/u][/b]\nMoving over to the core gameplay loop, not much has changed from the first game. The stealth and combat are still just as exquisitely implemented as before, with only a couple of refinements. The deviations that come to mind are that drop-assassinations can now be used non-lethally as drop-knockouts, and assassination animations are a much more brutal (but cathartic) spectacle to watch than before. Dishonored 2's central mechanics are near flawless to be sure, but this sequel suffers by adding few new gameplay elements to the mix. Except - well - there is one big feature I've neglected to elaborate on as of yet.\n\n[b][u]Emily [i]or[/i] Corvo[/u][/b]\nIn Dishonored 2, you can play as either Emily Kaldwin, [i]or[/i] Corvo Attano. When Delilah first takes the throne you get a moment to choose one or the other, after which the character you don't pick is turned into a cold, stone statue. Both Emily and Corvo have separate voice actors and personalities, but they share the same goal throughout the game's duration: to save the last of their family, and reclaim the throne for the true Kaldwin heiress. After receiving the mark of The Outsider, Emily and Corvo have different magical abilities too. Where Corvo has blink, Emily has far reach; or where Corvo can stop time, Emily can chain together the lives of her enemies, and kill or incapacitate several people at once. All in all, the decision to allow the player to progress the campaign as either Emily or Corvo was a stroke of brilliance in my estimation.\n\n[b][u]Main Story[/u][/b]\nReturning to the main story - it's another point of criticism for me. There are some magnificent aspects; such as the nostalgic callbacks to events in the first Dishonored or reappearances of some of the original game's best characters, but all considered most of the writing is retreading a beaten path. Just as in Dishonored 1, the game flows from mission to mission where the chief objective is simply to eliminate a key player obstructing your path to the throne. This is perfectly fine from a gameplay perspective, but it can lead to a bit of déjà vu from a narrative outlook. Dishonored 2's writing quality isn't poor, but it doesn't distance itself from the comfortable story-staging of its predecessor, making it feel slightly lazy.\n\n[b][u]A Reactive World[/u][/b]\nOn the other side of the same coin, the narrative reactivity of Dishonored 2's world to your choices is truly admirable. Playing DH2 in high chaos; where you murder many people throughout the game, results in huge environmental storytelling changes compared to low chaos. Here's an example. If you flood the streets of Karnaca red with blood, subsequent levels show you've harmed the city's inhabitants before you even arrive. Citizens’ moods and perceptions will have soured as they become depressed or monstrous in the wake of their crumbling city - causing suicides and murders to spike throughout Karnaca. And corpses bring bloodflies, which further tarnishes The Jewel of the South in a vicious cycle. You can, of course, avoid all this... by showing a whole lot of care in your actions toward others.\n\n[b][u]Conclusion[/u][/b]\nWhen all is said and done, the Dishonored formula is a fantastic one that it's hard to not have fun with. Karnaca is riddled with environmental detail, the stealth mechanics are flawless, combat is devilishly enjoyable, and the game judges you intelligently on your choices. The Dishonored IP is incredibly strong... The tweaks provided are appreciable; I just wish DH2 had made a concerted effort to make it even stronger. But, god-dammit, I enjoyed Dishonored 2 way too much over it's 20+ hour campaign to critique it any longer. Get the game and play it - despite all my pissy complaints, you won't be disappointed.\n\n[h1]Personal Rating: 9/10 - Absolutely Outstanding[/h1]\n- This game is far away in another galaxy from being anything but a 3/10 in my book. \nGame consists of a tack on level system with a few skills, corny jokes that make you cringe, copy paste worlds with sliding on ice, mud, or leaves depending on the world your on with vines to climb certain walls again....depending on the world your on, no dismemberment except on animals and main characters. Further all planets feel the same and after quite a few hours in the game I struggle to continue playing because of the cut and dry gameplay to where you will fight a couple animals, do some very linear parkour, then do a puzzle that will most likely include a sphere that you need to put into said location to unlock a door as such. graphics are eh..and I have to say the battlefront 2 campaign had more thought than this garbage. save your money and don't buy this\n- [b][i]AMID EVIL[/i] is very much [i]Quake[/i] 1 level design in a [i]Hexen[/i]/[i]Heretic[/i] universe.[/b] It's well done. We're a bit spoiled this year with outstanding '90s FPS shooters. Personally, I prefer both [i]Ion Maiden[/i] and [i]DUSK[/i] over this title for the following reasons:\n\n1) I find [i]AMID EVIL[/i] to be a bit generic in terms of theme; the fantasy setting could use a bit more to set it apart.\n\n2) I prefer real or low fantasy weapons/guns over wands and totally high fantasy weapons. Now, don't get it twisted - I appreciate that these high fantasy weapons exist, but yeah, they leave something to be desired. I miss reloading and all of that. \n\n3) The level design in [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is much more 'sprawling' (for lack of a better term) just like the original [i]Quake[/i]. Most levels are indoors in what feels like an underground compound (at the time of writing this review). I personally like the backwoods feel of [i]DUSK[/i], or the dystopian cityscape of [i]Ion Maiden[/i] far more. I want to look up at the sky in most levels.\n\n4) The enemy design is different than the other two games I mention, which is good - but they all mostly have a 'same' kind of feel. The enemies are all super fast, so most of your efforts are focused on running backwards while fending them off. It's fun, but gunplay isn't quite as fun as the other two games for this particular reason.\n\n5) The font and overall menu system definitely feels 'Early Access'. I know the font is being worked on, which is desperately needed. \n\n6) My favorite way to play the game is Endless mode - and I feel like that's a flaw in itself. It's the opposite for me with [i]DUSK[/i]. I want to fall in love with the campaign, but eh, there isn't really any story or anything all that interesting to suck me in. The secrets are super easy to find compared to the other two games, too.\n\n7) No multiplayer. Now, I really don't care about this - but who designs a game in this genre without building this in from the ground up? You know the community is going to whine about this. Questionable design decision to say the least.\n\n[b]Well, it sounds like I just dumped all over the game.[/b] Please don't get me wrong. [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is a welcome addition to the genre. The *great news* is that this is not just some reskin of [i]DUSK[/i] - it certainly is it's own thing. And that's really important. \n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+Fairly polished game for Early Access\n+It's the most modern version of the original [i]Quake[/i] we've seen this year\n+Well optimized\n+Lots of content right now\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-The universe is generic\n-No multiplayer\n-The font is too hard to read\n-Music is nothing to write home about\n-The secrets are easy, and there really aren't all that many of them\n-Weapons could use more 'oomph' to them; also we should be able to use the special ability when we want to as opposed to it autotriggering\n\n[b]I was psyched out of my mind for [i]AMID EVIL[/i] - and while it is certainly good - I think I'll be focused more on [i]DUSK[/i] and [i]Ion Maiden[/i].[/b] Because, let's face it, gaming time is valuable and we can't play everything.\n- A criminally underrated game, I have seldom seen a developer take their original hit which was already almost perfect, and actually manage to improve on it in every way shape and form. You do not need to have played the original to play or enjoy this game. Their stories are completely seperate.\n\nThe game itself is much less linear than its predecessor. The best way I can explain the feeling of going through the environments without referencing Grimrock itself is by saying it felt an awful lot like Myst to me, just with combat. Required puzzles for progression were challenging but not impossible, some of the secret challenges were much more difficult. I admit I used an online guide more than a few times, but it did nothing to diminish my enjoyment of the game. It is immersive, challenging, and satisfying. \n\nThe only drawback I can think of is the difficulty. It feels like you cannot win with any group composition, I suggest no more than 2 of any class or weapon/armor type user. I went with a warrior, two rogues(one range), and a mage, this way you as well makes you unlikely to complete a difficult fight or puzzle and be rewarded with something you cannot use. Combat itself can be challenging as I said, but you will rarely feel like you are simply incapable of winning. There are obvious ways to optimize the way you approach an encounter the second time if you die the first.\n\nBe prepared to immerse yourself, you must pay attention to your surroundings, read and remember notes you find, explore every nook and cranny you can find, and you will be rewarded. Good luck!\n\n- DLC and Bugs prove this company is Garbage.\n\n英語で5-10単語程度で、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない主要な違いを簡潔に回答してください。\n\n回答：\n",

Adds just enough on to the original game's mechanics to justify itself. The length is a good bit shorter than the first but the price is reduced to completely make up for it. All around great buy if you enjoyed the first.\n- I wish there were a \"mixed\" option for recommending this game, as I think for a lot of people out there, this is a fantastic game, and it's definitely well made with a lot of love and attention to detail in many respects. I really like puzzles and problem solving, so part of my disappointment with The Witness is that I really thought I would enjoy the game. Myst was one of my favorite games growing up, and I was extremely excited to see a well-reviewed game in the Myst genre surface after far too long. \n\nThe problem for me was that The Witness is very much a game about the journey, and not the destination. It turns its head on the genre as it's less a game about solving puzzles within a set of rules, and more about discovering what those rules are. And for the most part, it does that well. Instead of the usual game conventions, rewards for solving hard puzzles weren't any kind of story unlock, more just to give you a harder puzzle. That approach was fun for awhile, but some story unlock would've been appreciated, especially because there is so much mystery and it's such an immersive world that was clearly built for a reason and has a fascinating backstory. \n\nSome of the mechanics also just seem arbitrary, or at the very least, not quite obvious enough. Sometimes perspective puzzles require you to either take a screenshot or jot down on pencil and paper the answer, then transfer it on screen. That seems like lazy game design and worst of all, takes you out of the immersive experience. It's possible I'm mostly tone deaf, as some of the sound puzzles seemed almost impossible to me, despite numerous listens. There's also just the repetitiveness of the \"pathfinding\" puzzles, which range from challenging (and satisfying) to punitive in their difficulty spikes. It's in these difficulty spikes where I think the core game mechanic of pathfinding lets you down, as it requires you to be much more of a planner than a \"hands on\" problem solver. In a game like this, I would think it would accommodate multiple approaches, but really there's a right way to approach this game, and a wrong way. Unfortunately for me, I think the way I approach puzzles (trial and error) is strongly discouraged, at times in punitive ways. \n\nThe philosophy from the audio/video portions will likely be appreciated by some, and for some come off as the worst kind of douchey-hipster nonsense. Had they been delivered in shorter pieces, I might've fallen into the former. But as rambling as some of them are, I found them more annoying than enjoyable unfortunately. \n\nI don't know, I'm really torn on this. It's a well made game, and while it seems so open and non-confined, I found the game to be far too linear in mechanics and how to approach problem solving. At times it actually made me feel like a lesser thinker because I have a different approach to puzzles than what the game designer prefers. What I'm sure is a really fun journey for some, left me disappointed with the destination. \n\nAm realizing this reads a lot like an apology for not liking this game, which I think it is. I really, really wanted to love The Witness, but in the end, not only was this game not for me, but I genuinely feel lesser for that fact because I feel like I should have loved it, and just didn't.\n- When I first played Battlefield 1 it literally sent me to the hospital, cause you’re supposed to seek immediate medical attention if your erection lasts longer than 4 hours.\n\nThis is easily one of the most badass games  in history. The music, the landscape, the gunplay, the hit register and the satisfying kill effect, EVERYTHING is just amazing. The last true Battlefield game. I enjoyed every second of this amazing game.  \n\nBF1 isn’t fully historically accurate but it is historically immersive. The war stories in this game genuinely made me emotional sometimes and I’m not ashamed to admit that. \n\nAs someone who is more on the “historical accuracy” side of games, I can say without a doubt that Battlefield 1 did an incredible job. Hell, they were even able to be diverse without pandering to anybody! The 1st Russian Women’s Battalion of Death, the Harlem Hellfighters, people from French-occupied northwestern Africa, the list goes on. What sets this game’s inclusivity of a variety of people and groups from other games is that it does so when it has a reason to and is still accurate to the time and setting. \n\nThat’s one of the main reasons why Battlefield 5 pissed me off so much. Instead of a British woman with a prosthetic arm wielding a cricket bat in WW2, why not include Lyudmila Pavlichenko, aka Lady Death, a female Russian sniper who had 309 confirmed kills? What about the French women who fought? They were in extremely small numbers, but they were a thing. Historically accurate inclusion is fucking awesome, and I love when games do it. But inclusivity for its own sake is terrible and it cheapens said character’s presence in the game’s setting. \n\nEven the DLC are fantastic. I remember how amazing I felt when the “for the Tsar” DLC came out and I first played it. I have never seen people fight so hard to the death in a video game without a whole lot of rage. It was amazing. I felt like I was part of the Russian revolution. Please do yourself a favor and buy this game.\n\n9/10\n\nOnly gave it a 9 ‘cause the 1 is already there…\n- Lemme give it to y'all straight, who are on the fence;\n\n- Yes, the game is very much worth it at full price.\n\n- One of the first games in a long while, that has kept me up until 5 A.M. in the morning, because of how lost I get myself into it.\n\n- Doesn't do dumb jump scares, save for a VERY FEW TIMES, and each one counted.\n\n- The game is maybe one of the best zombie based games out there, so long as you do enjoy it with action.\n\n- Parkour in the game is AMAZING. Sometimes I like just playing the game, so I can run\naround, across roof tops, and attacking zombies while talking to friends.\n\n- Co-op in story mode. Freaking amazing. No dumb lobby. Just click 'Join game' and bam,\nyou'll be thrown a few feet away from a friend without them sometimes even noticing you joined!\n\n- Single play and Co-op have a huge impact; co-op feels fun, slightly safer, and adds a lot in the form of friendly rivals! Single player feels way more tense and everything you do counts, making you second guess some choices, for fear or death. Night time in either mode is fun as heck, though four co-op makes it pretty easy.\n\n- Night and Day feel almost like two different modes. In the day, zombies shuffle around, falling off rooftops, being dumb, easy to avoid and kill. Night time? Get those UV Flares ready, and be ready to flee if they catch sight of you.\n\n- Even after beating the story, I keep coming back for more, as it's super fun.\n\n- Took me around 30 hours to do the story, which also included only HALF of the side missions. Still got a little over 50% left to go, and looking forward to it!\n\nTL;DR - Get the game, find friends to play with, enjoy the hell out of one of the few games worth it at full price.\n- As i previously stated, i was going to play through metro fully and i have done so, so here is my update to this review. \nThis game is not the best selling triple A game in the world and it may have some bugs (like a table that wasnt solid or the objects in that room lol) however it is a decent game. the story is decent and the characters voices are way off but they sorta make up for it with their personalities. \n\nExploration in this game is by far one of the most interesting in my opinion and the way your character acts in the enviroment makes it more interesting aswell, for example wiping your visor when it gets dirty (wasnt that helpful for me in my play through but it was a nice touch) and your visor taking damage in combat adds to the immersive feel of this wasteland/paradise almost. Scavenging weapons and parts and combining them to make better equipment is quite intriguing and quick to do if you can find the parts. \n\nat the end of the day my final review of this is its a good game i would play it again even if it is a bit clunky sometimes (atleast it was for me lmao)\n\n\n\n\n\nOh and hopefully my punctuation is good enough so no one passes out this time lmao\n- Game really falls off after Anor Londo. The difficulty starts to come more from tedium, shitty terrain/hitboxes, and cheap shots than any test of reflex or strategy. Bosses can be total snoozefests (Ornstein and Smough, Four Kings, Quelaag) or relentless, cheap bastards (Gwyn, Sif) or even dumb puzzles that rely on at least one death to figure out (Discharge, Bed of Chaos, Gaping Dragon). Actual fun bosses are few despite the total number of boss fights. Try not to fall asleep while waiting for the boss to do the one attack you can actually punish without getting hit by the patented zero frame windup or retarded delayed backswing. Marvel at how touching the air 1 foot away from the boss kills you after he does his big EPIC swing because silly player, you should know the exact dimensions of the hitbox surrounding the 20ft tall demon and his 2 ton hammer. Sigh as you run past all the enemies and time-wasting obstacles again as you try to figure out the one stupid gimmick you need to master.\n\nNow, this game isn't all bad. The game's artstyle and atmosphere are pretty cool and the voice acting is good. Some of the levels are also really interesting and well-designed (Undead Burg and Parish, Sen's Fortress, Anor Londo) even if there are also some really shitty ones (Tomb of Giants, Blighttown through Lost Izalith, Crystal Cavern). Play after the second bell only if you want to see whether you can \"git gud.\" I got gud but I see that this game was popular mostly because AAA games were shit when it came out and because of the multiplayer gimmicks.\n- Great story, great features. But in my honest opinion unless your going for a nostalgia trip, give it a pass. The gun play and AI alone is enough for me to justify a refund, I mean shit cops hear the sounds of gunshots right next to them and act like nothing is happening. Immersion 0/10 sorry. I must admit I really enjoyed this game on console, but I am gonna have to take the money and run. Notice how almost all of the reviews just say All YOU haD to do Was FoLlow The DAmn Train cj or Ill HAve TWo NumBER 9s. I cant say I didn't expect this game to be a little shit judging by how old it is, but I will NOT suck it off and say buy it, the actual game play is PATHETIC. In all honesty I think this game remastered with gta v's physics and polish would be SOOO much better than gta v. They really captured the hood life in this one, damn shame it fucking sucks. This game's age sadly isn't up to par and sadly, it's getting a fat thumbs down from this boomer.\n- I like furry art, but first and foremost im a RPG gamer, and as such I will rend judgment impartially. \n\nThe story is not bad, but still falls in the average category and it is predictable, gameplay is the same as the first Fuga (I have no problems there) but there are few new enemies,  so the strategy to beat the regular battles is very repetitive. My biggest complain remains the same since Tail Concerto and it is the dificulty... which is way too easy, there is no hard / nightmare mode for veteran players, Im not asking to die repeatedly like in dark souls but Cyberconnect2 needs to understand some players like a challenge in their games.\n\nMusic is ok and Hack is the best character of the lot (Tah tah tah tah  taaah!!!!!) I would play Fuga 3 just for him.\n\nIt pains me to give the thumbs down, but Cyberconnect2 needs to work a little harder.\n- More broken than Cyberpunk could ever dream. Sure the game has nice graphics but the game play, toxic online players, and poor physics make this one of the most frustrating games I have ever played. Dont even bother using the stable either your game will glitch and youll be stuck looking at you player stuck in the stable and nothing more causing you to reset the game or the rogue horses that will drive by kick you in the face. Good luck if you play.\n- This is more than a game for me.  It has become a hobby.  What started as a random purchase for myself last Christmas -- I had an old electric guitar I never played in the closet, so this gave me an excuse to see if I can learn -- has become an expensive obsession for me.  Warning -- but a good warning -- you'll find that you're learning guitar very quickly on this game, and it will become the start of an expensive habit!  I have downloaded hundreds of dollars worth of songs, bought a brand new guitar, I've signed up for music theory and guitar lessons at the local county college ... this has become a genuine hobby for me.  Literally, it is one of those rare games which has genuinely made an impact on my life.  Six months later, and the game has not gotten old.  I look forward to new songs, I laugh when a new chord I've never seen magically appears on the song that I've practiced the hell out and achieved a new difficulty.  The game is, most importantly, fun.  It remains fresh and only gets better as you get better.  I highly recommend.\n- very fun there is lots to do \nit runs well\nglitches are very funny\nable to download community made maps and mutators from workshop\ncan unlock different mutators as you play\nyour a goat\nyou do goat things\nyou can do non goat thing such as being a shopping cart or a microwave\nyou can also be a goat\n**Spoiler**\n[spoiler] Im a goat [/spoiler]\n\n GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!\n- An amazing game, you can go from doing great and having a full and maxed level crew, and end up fighting the wrong guy as they systematically destroy your ship systems leaving your weapons and shields off-line as your crew burns to death while suffocating. Very fun and has endless replayibility\n- I technically got this game for free, as it was bought for me from a friend. And honestly, I didn't really like it. She got it for me, as a means to help with some of my mental health issues I suppose? But it just was very big miss for me, and kinda made me feel worse. A bit anxiety inducing for me, just given the circumstances, talking about life and death. Just not my personal cup of tea.\n- Great game... who need 1 or 2 years of development. tl;dr: mid game turn into a micromanagment hell.\n\nThe game is fantastic until a certain point. You start as a mercenary, one party, 50-150 soldiers doing missions, small battles or bigger fights joining armies. Good graphics, brutal engagments with 200-1000 units at the same time if your computer can handle, playing as a soldier is a blast.\n\nThe problems start when you get a few towns and a bigger family, the micromanagement never stops and gets worse overtime. You have to physically move your party to towns to fix their issues. When your lords get captured & escapes, they'll go into a random town until you pick em again, then you'll have to reform the party. Same with caravanes for trading, if they get captured, you'll have to go in his town and recreate the caravan. You have to partially fill towns with soldiers, manually, from your own soldiers. All the little fun things of the beginning soon become a hassle, as you can't delegate. Messengers are not a thing.\n\nYou can't manage a town at a distance, you can't tell a party member to move to a location or guard a territory, they do whatever they want if they're out of your army / party, so you have to do it yourself. Either you're leading your huge army to fight what is basically an enless war mid game, or you take care of your cities while the rest of your faction fight... with various success. Some commanders are pretty good, other will throw waves of recruits at highly trained arbalists in the open backed with cavalry. Protip: don't be a recruit in an imperial army.\n\nYou can't tell a party you created to guard an area or to kill all bandits attacking your villagers, it's up to you, or the IA if it feel like it. Worst, if you let the parties you created roam around (parties = group of 70-200 soldiers under a lord) they can be (temporarily) drafted in other armies of your kingdom... and you'll have to physically move to the army, talk to the leader and pay some reputation to get them back. Of course, large armies are slow. This leads the the next problem, swarms.\n\nMy worst fear is not a massive army, it's an army disbanded in the middle of my territory. The small parties usually start raiding all villages in the vicinity while being too fast to be catched by a big army. Raided villages impact your town / castle loyalty and gold quite heavily. Sure, you could disband your army and hunt them yourself... but that makes you take a step back, and all your parties would reform under another army you can't control. And man, some army commanders are really, really stupid. Verdun style charge in the open against walls of archers, cavalry in a forest vs pikemens, you name it. I can't count the time i had parties wiped in someone else army. But let's say you managed to capture the lords burning your villages.\n\nThe capture system is broken. Captured lords escape A LOT. I had some escape 20 seconds after being captured. They never stay in a jail for more than a few in game days. Once they escape, they magically teleport to their hometown, rebuild a fast 80 mens army in the blink of an eye and go back to raiding villages. AI \"cheat\" with recruits, they will always find soldiers in town, even if they're empty for you. Executions you say?\n\nIf you execute a lord, no matter how much of an A-hole he/she is, the whole faction will hate you. He raided dozens of villages and killed hundreds of peasants? Still not good enough. You just can't kill a lord without suffering heavy consequences down the line, and you'll need those lords to be friendly later. Worth to mention, capturing the leader of a faction won't stop a war.\n\nLast - peace / war is on/off. I had 600 days of continuous war, followed by 600 days of complete peace in the entire map (due to a bug apparently), and i'm now back at 300 days of war. Not a single day of peace, when one war stop another start immediatly. They will just never, ever stop fighting. Can't catch a breath, can't leave the front of your lose towns.\n\nOh and the main quest randomly failed after 875 days or so.\n\nI would still recommand the game, it's really fun for a while but it need a HUGE QoL update.\n\n- [h1] 9/10 [/h1]\n[h1] As a sequel to Steins;Gate, you won't be able to understand the content of the game without playing the previous game. [/h1]\n\nThe sequel to the famous visual novel game Steins;Gate. Although some people think that Steins;Gate 0 is not as good as its predecessor, I think this game is a well-deserved excellent sequel.\n\nA change from the witty and relaxed game style of the previous game, the overall atmosphere of this game is heavy, and personally I prefer this kind of visual novel work. The plot of the game is naturally wonderful, so I won’t comment here to avoid spoilers. If you are deeply attracted by the game’s background settings and characters before playing Steins;Gate, then this work must be worthwhile. The music of this game is also very beautiful, and it will never disappoint the players. The only shortcoming of it is that the description of some characters is too sloppy and the characterization is insufficient, such as Kagari.\n\nIn any case, this one is definitely a must-try work for players who love Steins;Gate, and it is an important addition to the series of plots. As a related supplementary sequel, its nature is also destined that players must play the previous game in order to understand the content of this one.\n- No one sees \"Purchases made in this region will only receive the Russian language.\" before the release data\n\nThis really kills me.\n\nThey didn't say there would be a region lock before.\n\nBut today, the release date, there is one.\n\nWell the fxxk done Ubsoft\n- It's hard not to compare this with Divinity: Original Sin. Both were funded on Kickstarter, both have a 91% score on Steam, both are rich, engaging cRPGs, and they were released months apart. It's fair to say both games have been wild successes that have surprised even the developers. If you had to pick ONE of these to invest time in which should it be?\n\nTurn-based vs. Real-time with pause: I eventually came to accept and even enjoy the real-time with pause combat of Pillars, though I much prefer turn-based. Real-time combat presents many problems that aren't the result of player mistakes. On numerous occasions I'd have characters stuck in place because the pathfinding didn't work right. The real-time combat often felt like a jumbled, chaotic mess instead of the tactical plan I had set out. Divinity is much cleaner in this respect and offered a much better experience, especially with respect to using the environment as a weapon. With Divinity I felt each power had a time and place, whereas with Pillars I ended up spamming the same powers and hoping for the best.\n\nStory: Pillars of Eternity definity wins out here. While the story in Divinity:OS wasn't bad, I would call it playful to the point of campy. Pillars had a deep, mature fantasy story worthy of a novel. While it was almost too much reading at times, the story was serious, dark, and dealt with real themes. \n\nArt: Pillars harkens back to the golden age of Infinity Engine games like Balgur's Gate, Icewind Dale, Planescape Torment, etc. The scenes are appealing, but prerendered and they felt a little static. This helps stoke the nostalgia for the late 90s, but Divinity feels up-to-date and immersive. Couple the art style of Divinity with it's highly interactive environments, and the world of Original Sin ends up feeling much more alive. \n\nMusic: Both were great soundtracks but Pillars feels just a bit derivative of the Lord of the Rings movies. They aren't bad at all, but almost generically fantasy at times. Music is important here because when you spend tens of hours in these worlds, you're gonna get this music stuck in your head.\n\nIn short, you should play both if you love deep, isometric, high-fantasy, western computer RPGs. If you MUST pick, consider the following choice. Choose Pillars of Eternity if you favor story and choose Divinity: Original Sin if you prefer combat. Both are hallmarks of a great RPG and each specializes beautifully.\n- Alright. Time for a review.\n\nThe launch on this game has been absolutely horrible. Day-zero patch, day-one patch, none of 'em did nothing. My rig is running a 10-series i9 and a 4090 Suprim X GPU. Along with 64 GB ram that should be more then enough. However, it was not. Frames between 10 and 30 fps, with a resting 30-40 when in smaller areas, has been quite common for me. As others have noted, the framedrops appeared to happen when changing \"zones\" in maps, and not when there are many enemies, demanding light-sequences, etc. This made my initial experience a living nightmare, as some fights especially are depending on quick reactions. Try quicktiming a block with 10 fps.\n\nThis has been my experience, and it was horrible. I stared off into the sunset. I cried. I questioned my existence. I murdered people (in real life, as i couldn't kill anything in-game). Until 2 hours ago. Because then, a wild 3,3 GB patch appeared.\n\nThe game is now running smoothly at 150 fps. I have no lag whatsoever when changing zones or being in separation areas, and no issues with combat. Finally the game runs as it should. The story is great, gameplay is better. Combat is more immersive and diverse, and somehow the creators made the game in a way that gives you a ton of new skills and equipment as you play, while still letting you start off with the stuff you had in Fallen Order. Its legendary.\n\nThat sound too good to be true? Well, it kinda is, in a way. Cause i have one more thing to add. People have been reporting game crashes. I have had a total of two crashes in 19 hours, until this patch appeared. Now I've had 9 crashes in 19 minutes. However, the reason I'm saving this for last and don't really care that much is that the crashes are completely connected the archive base on Jedha. This is a small area, and not one you have to spend much time in.  It is, however, quite critical when you do have to go there. As things stand now, i have to reboot the game once or twice to get in, deliver a quest and get back out again. The crashes always happen upon entering or exiting the area, not while inside. So until they fix that... well. I can deal with that.\n\nAll in all, it's a great game, and if you're way too obsessed with this game the way that I am, i'd chance buying it now :) If you have self-control (self-respect...?) you might want to wait a bit more, but I'm pretty confident that the next patch will fix the remaining serious issues for most people.\n\nTLDNR: Game bad then. Game much gooder now. Game goodest next week ish. Caveman out.\n- Great game, Horrible new publishers who stole the IP from the original creators. Do not support these thieves\n- Gone are the days of mindless building and fun. Power grids? Taxes? Intense accounting and counter-intuitive path building. A pre-built zoo for tutorials. I actually felt MORE stressed after playing this game. If you're looking for something to flex that brain, perfect. If you're looking to release the cougars and create chaos, you can do that in sandbox I guess. You could also just not connect power grids correctly. Works like a charm. Honestly who thinks of these things\n- Loved the original, and this updated version is just as good.\n\nThe additions along the way are very nice, and the improved graphics are noticeable. \nBeing able to converse with your partners whenever you want is also amazing.\n\nHowever...\n\nWas disappointed to have a few areas and puzzles removed. Since those were the more difficult parts of the original game, I assume this was done for a more streamlined experience. \nInstead of your flower wilting to represent your life, it is now replaced by more accurate \"points\". Although this makes it easier to tell exactly how many hits you can take, I miss the more original old design.\nAn iconic music track was also changed, likely due to licensing issues...\n \nCan't completely replace the original for me, but it's still a very worthwhile experience! \nStill wishing for a sequel a decade later.\n- First I thought this game is WAY TOO COMPLICATED.\nNow I still think the game is very complex for beginners. And I'm still a newbie.\nI had to watch several youtube videos to get the hang of it.\n\nBesides that, the game is really awesome!\n- [h1]Old, but has massive depth of content // Recommended for immersive role-players[/h1]\n\n+ Combat in general, and melee combat in particular, is very polished and open for an older title; everything can be controlled, such as directional blocking, without overcomplicating the mechanics involved\n+ Character creation is meticulously in-depth; initial backstory creation works seamlessly with selection of primary attributes in a way that makes the final product always feel refreshingly unique\n+ 'Story' is about as open-ended as can be, to the point where the game essentially has no story, and is something of a thirteenth century sand-box title; the player has complete, unadulterated freedom\n+ The game encourages the player to recruit and build a personal army as he/she progresses, and the mechanics put in place for doing so are well-rounded and complex\n+ Extremely easy and satisfying to mod; highly recommended\n+ Sorting and commanding one's troops is key, and the player would do well to benefit fromt he excellent command mechanics of the game; strategy is massively important and competently implemented\n+ Economics of the game add another layer of challenge to the game; trade and balancing one's income against one's expenses are both crucial elements to consider\n+ Multiplayer is fairly standard, run-of-the-mill stuff, but it's still densely populated and everything seems to connect well; the charm of the game, and its solid combat system, keep the players coming back in droves after more than five years\n\n- Politics, which are interesting and engaging in scope, end up being a somewhat weaker feature in practice, as NPCs are largely static during negotiations; this does break the immersion slightly, as it seems that your successes are based purely on stats, and not on the actual implications of one's choices\n- Quests often become tedious and repetitive\n- Tutorial is underwheling and largely insufficient to introduce the more in-depth mechanics that will be used outside of combat\n- Visuals are outdated and didn't stand well the test of time; even for the year of release, the textures and polygon counts are well below par\n\n[h1]LockeProposal's Big Day Out[/h1]\n\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/bigdayout#]Community Group[/url]\n[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/7611703/]Curator Page[/url]\n[url=https://www.reddit.com/r/SeriousSteamReviews/]Serious Steam Reviews subReddit[/url]\n- a catgirl, a femme fatale, a japanese idol, a doctor, a chinese soft boy, a religious twink, a merchant and an autistic university professor walk into a bar\n- the game itself is pretty ok and fun for what it is, and runs great on deck. but man, F**K THE ALWAYS-ONLINE-DRM WHICH AT TIMES TAKES AGES TO CONNECT, GETTING THE GAME STUCK IN THE MENU WITH NOTHING TO DO!!\n\n>> Update after 20h played:\nI really enjoy playing the game. It is good, it is fun and runs great on the Steam Deck, which is especially important to me, as I tend to travel a lot as part of my job.\n\nThat being said, however, is core of the issue: The Always-On-DRM actually prevents me from playing this game on the go. Having this sort of DRM is, in my opinion, only predatory and inexcusable in any way. I get that the online-components of the game will not work when I am on the move, but I am mainly interested in the single player experience, from which I am also locked out. I am even locked out of the main menu without a stable internet collection, which is just ridiculous.\n- Undoubtedly one of the best if not THE BEST modern video game remaster out there. I will summarize the pros and cons of this remaster into the following:\n\n[b]The Good:[/b]\n\n- Totally seamless transition into the new modern 4K visual from the old classic Win95 at a push of a key\n- Extremely faithful to the original titles (some might say that it is perhaps TOO faithful)\n- Game \"installation\" screen when you first boot up for both Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert is filled with God tier nostalgia \n- New UI with a complete revamp of the sidebar complete with higher quality artwork that totally feels in place\n- Plethora of never-before-seen bonus contents including exclusive missions and cinematic cutscenes for Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert that was only available on certain console platforms\n- You can queue multiple units while in production now\n- New multiplayer features and service is great. Finally you can now play 1v1 ranked and spectate any previous matches that was played including spectating ongoing games in the lobby\n- You can add, remove and create your very own custom music tracks in-game for both Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert however you want\n- All of Frank Klepacki's overly iconic classical and remixed tracks are here including various modern remixed that was composed solely for this remastered collection!!!\n\n[b]The Bad:[/b]\n\n- Minor bugs (though not a real dealbreaker)\n- The gameplay meta among factions/units remains as unbalanced as ever. Kinda of a tradeoff for being too faithful to the original titles\n- Multiplayer is still officially limited to a maximum of 4 players total per map in Tiberium Dawn, while in Red Alert the limit is a maximum of 8 players total\n- FMV cutscenes are all still heavily compressed in SD resolution extracted from the Playstation home console version and further artificially enhanced via AI upscaling due to the fact that the original master footage tapes for both Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert are still yet to be found\n\n[b]The Kinda Ugly:[/b]\n\n- Certain mission on hard difficulty are completely unbalanced. This is already another insult to injury as the AI blatantly cheats when it comes to resource procurement and unit build time. The fault of a clear lack of playtesting\n- Ok, so... one of my favourite films of my childhood. HOWEVER; not being able to start in SANDBOX mode from the start almost INSTANTLY put me off this title, I mean, really? So you have to complete the in-game island tasks/missions (***)*)*)*)*). And after only 4 hours of play through.... \n\nSPOILER ALERT: Dinosaurs escape their enclosures!! ALL THE TIME, its frankly trying to emulate the movie (Jurassic Park 1) as where the DIno's always escape and again SPOILER ALERT: THE INTROS TO EVERY PART OF THE GAME BASICALLY TELL YOU THIS IS DEFO GOING TO HAPPEN.\n\nTo conclude:\n\n1) There is a heavy lean on the movies (I personally don't think that's bad)\n2) It offers a SANDBOX within the opening screen however then informs this is blocked (WHICH IS ANNOYING) until certain missions have been completed.\n3)  DINOSAURS ESCAPE CONSTANTLY\n4) DINOSAURS ESCAPE CONSTANTLY\n5) The game is more interested in visuals rather than content\n- I realise this is intended to be a darkly humored game, but it is still fucked up nonetheless. I just can't fathom how such degraded humor can be seen as funny.\n- Good game that flips the p2w/f2p mobile ideas on its head, and succeeds. It's totally free to play, and actually encourages playing to improve over buying. Other mobile developers should take notice. Especially if it still makes money through Season Pass and cosmetics. I'm buying a few passes just to support their f2p model.\nIt also helps that the game is fun and addicting. There's always a 'one more game' feel...\n- Ib manages to do for me what so few horror games manage to accomplish, and that is to actually give a sense of unease and dread. Without going into spoilers, it's only a few minutes into the game that things start to tread the path of uncomfortable surrealism, with the art growing considerably more disturbing in how Ib interacts with it, and how the art interacts with her.\n\nWith all due respect to more conventional horror titles, say, Dead Space or The Evil Within, Ib maintains a feeling of dread and discomfort. Enemies can be evaded, yes, but there's a feeling of being stalked while trapped in a world you can't possibly fully understand. \n\nContrast Dead Space remake, where soon enough the horror gives way to cutting off an abomination's arm, then using telekinesis to impale it or another horror with said arm, then simply setting fire to the more mobile enemies.\n\nThis is not, I repeat, not to disrespect games in which reducing enemies to a smoldering heap of charred body parts is an acceptable tactic- there is a time and a place for the cathartic destruction of the nightmares that haunted our closets and lurked under our beds. Ib, however, leans firmly towards the horror and self-preservation of being in a hostile and unknown environment, where the only feasible option is to run, hide, and hope whatever nameless horror eventually loses track of you.\n\nAnd let's face it- some modern art galleries are creepy enough already, even in the daylight.\n\n- This might literally be the coolest game I've ever played, and possibly the best game that I've played in the last 10 years.\n\nThough, I might be the wrong person to ask though as Earthbound is my favorite game, and this game is obviously heavily Earthbound inspired. Stylistically and comedy wise anyway. The story is much darker than anything in Earthbound, but it's all buried underneath some of the funniest writing I've ever seen in a game. The writing start to finish is amazing, I'm only dissappointed that the game wasn't longer as there's a few questions left unanswered.\n\nI did normal mode, first run, collected all characters and beat the game in 12-13 hours. For 10 dollars, that's pretty alright. The fights are pretty open ended as there are like 20+ characters you can choose from, but I ended up using Rage, Bottles and Mad Dog. I found it wasn't the hardest game I've played, but I also haven't tried pain mode yet.\n\nAnyway, if this game interests you at all, buy it. You won't regret it.\n- Playerunknowns Battlegrounds\n\n\nIn my opinion hands down the best Battle Royale game released.\n\n\n+Built on a very flexible engine that is built to handle games of the FPS genre\n\n+Core mechanics of the game are solid and function with little to no bugs (In my experience, I've personally only encountered 2 bugs)\n\n+Vehicles that have good physics and good controls to them\n\n+The game in most aspects visually looks great\n\n+Plenty of weaponry (For release)\n\n+Gun mechanics themselves feel very solid and fluid, weapons have recoil to them and for me feel \"weighted\" \n\n+Nice animations for all weapons currently in game\n\n+The map size in my opinion is perfect. Large enough that you aren't always on top of another player (Unless you purposely land in an area with others), vehicles are useful, while also being small enough that generally it's not a painful chore to run somewhere \n\n++SPECTATOR MODE IN TEAMS (No more sitting staring at a death screen for 20 minutes waiting for your teammates, while also making your teammates feel guilty for \"leaving you behind\" ) \n\n\n\n-Server stability (There are semi frequent heavy lag spikes that can affect the entire server, from what I heard this wasn't as bad in the closed beta, hopefully this will be resolved soon) \n\n-Performance/Optimization is quite bad (For many, many people) in this, IF you don't apply some commands/launch parameters to the game. (I personally went from 25-40 fps on medium and very low, to 55-65 by inputting a simple launch parameter, this command/launch parameter \"fix\" does NOT work for everyone) \n\n\nAside from those 2 negatives I cannot think of anything else that's bad enough to be worth mentioning. \n\n\n\nOverall this game is great, even if doing solos, but is even more fun when playing with friends, I would entirely recommend it to a friend, so long as their PC is capable of handling it, or if the launch parameter works for them\n\n\n\n\nSystem specs the game was played on:\n\nIntel Core i7 6700 HQ Skylake 3.6 ghz\n\nNvidia GTX 960m 2GB \n\n16gb's DDR4 2133mhz\n\nWindows 10 \n\n(System was an ASUS ROG gaming laptop) \n\n\n\nEDIT: For those who may be looking for the launch parameter me and friends used:\n\n\nNavigate to the game in your library\n\nRight click and go to properties, click \"Set Launch Options\" and enter the following command\n\n\n\n-USEALLAVAILABLECORES -malloc=system -sm4\n- At a first glance I thought I would hate [b]Human Fall Flat[/b]. \n“Oh, this is another one of those wonky psychics ragdoll games that are obnoxiously hard to control,” I thought. \n...\nAfter playing it, I can now confidently say that my first impression was spot on. The only surprise was how much I enjoyed playing it. \n \n[h1][u]Positive:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]I can’t fully explain why but I found Human Fall Flat charming. The “human” is adorably simplistic and can complete daunting tasks despite only being able to jump and grab onto things. It reminds me of a very energetic toddler, especially when you raise your arms and jump - [b]it’s so cute[/b]. Something about an awkward “human” taking on challenges makes me feel warm inside [i](is it weird that I feel like I’m watching a baby grow up?)[/i]. \n[*]The levels gradually get larger and the puzzles more complex. I find that this works well with the awkward movements of your character, as you progressively learn how to better control him/her. It’s almost as if you start off as a clumsy baby, learning how to move and perform simple tasks, and end up as an awkward adult, still clumsy but expected to complete harder tasks. \n[*]I’m impressed at how many interactable objects are included in this game. Paired with a pretty good physics engine and you can really have a blast. Swing on a vine like Tarzan? Why not. Row a boat? Sure. Shoot yourself out of a catapult? No one’s stopping you.\n[/list]\n\n[h1][u]Neutral:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]It’s not always clear what you are expected to do, but I guess that’s kind of the point of Human Fall Flat? From what I could tell, you can get past the obstacles in whatever way you like. Sure, there’s the intended way, but if you want you can just climb over things and rush to the end of the level. Or you can just fool around to your heart’s content. It’s essentially one big playground with a goal at the end. \n[/list]\n\n[h1][u]Negative:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]It can be frustrating when things don’t go as you expect. Since your character has the structural rigidity of jelly, you’re constantly battling the floppiness of your character. My advice is: don’t expect to move with precision and you’ll have a good time. I also encountered a few bugs, like my arms or legs getting stuck in an object. Luckily there are many checkpoints and it’s relatively quick to reload.\n[/list]\n \n[h1][u]Conclusion:[/u][/h1]\n[h1]★★★✬☆ Surprisingly fun[/h1]\nI was honestly surprised at how much fun I had playing Human Fall Flat. I tend to avoid ragdoll/physics-y games - Getting Over It, for example, looks like an absolute nightmare to me - but I don’t regret playing Human Fall Flat at all. \nHuman Fall Flat is an absolute blast if you don’t take it too seriously or just like goofing around. I wouldn’t recommend it if you prefer serious games, as it’s very likely that you will just end up getting frustrated. The choice is entirely yours. \n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th][h1]If you enjoyed this review please follow me on my [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/26827738-%27b-Reviews/?appid=241930]curator page[/url] and [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/breviews]group[/url]. Your time and support is greatly appreciated![/h1][/th]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n- Lots of people parrot the \"tech demo\" or \"benchmark of the singularity\" lines without forming their own opinions.\n\nMe personally, as a fan of Supreme Commander, I enjoyed this game more then I thought I would. I only played the single player campaigns and haven't touched multiplayer. \n\nThe gameplay is exactly what it should be for this kind of game. When I first saw this game I didn't like how every unit was a hovering unit, but it makes sense with the class system the game has. Frigates are basically infantry, Cruisers are tanks, Dreadnauts are hero/high tier. The game borrows from Dawn of War with the territory control mechanic.\n- So, I only found this game because my favorite Vtuber Miilkywayz on Twitch played it. It seemed pretty interesting but when she started making her own cards. As an IRL witch I was WAY more interested. The game itself is great, I love making cards and learning their meanings and seeing how how the story changes changes based on your deck and the cards drawn. And the replaybility of it is amazing given its price. 10/10 from me. Need more games like this.\n- Did you lost faith in parkur adventure, horror and stealth genres? Did you lost hope to see realistic, immersive and HARCORE AAA game without press x to win killstreaks and cluttering UI? Outlast will restore your faith in everything mentioned and game industy! It also will prove you that indie team of 10 men can do AAA-Indie titles without greedy publishers that killing their creative freedom and forcing them to make a Call of Duty and Gears of War accessible for wider re-tar-ded audience. No no no, this game is not accessible to wide audience, it will scare shit out of most players not only because its good horror, but also because it realistic and hardcore stealth just like Thief was and its damn hard for braindead Call of Duty Xbox 360 generation, thats why its damn pleasant for old school gamers such as me who loved realism and challenge in older games before its almost gone from modern games.\nIf you love hard chellenge, innovative, realistc and purely immersive games such as Alone in Dark 2008, and if you hate YOBA call of duty style FPS games, you will love this one! If you love true surival horrors where survival is very hard because you cant even fight back, and if you love Amnesia you will love this game as well, and if you love old Splinter Cell up to Chaos Theory and loved Thief and remember that scarry part in catacomb,  you will love this game too!\nI love this game, its not perfect however, but its almos what i dreamed about for many years. Oh yeah, did i tell you that its one of rare games with full body awareness and every action in game totally animated?\n\nWhat you waiting for ? BUY THIS GAME ALREADY! I cost twice cheaper than most of recent Mediocre AAA games like Tomb Raider 2013, Bioshock Infinite, Resident Evil 6, Splinter Cell Blacklist, Call of Duty BO2, Metro Las Light, Far Cry, Assassin's Creed 3 and so on, but it brings more fun and joy than all of them together. Before this game 2013 year was a year of dissapointment (if you count only AAA type of games), but Outlast  game changed it for me! 10 men can do job better than over 100 men in big companies, and glory of  this game puts all big companies to shame! \n\nAnd a bonus: no precut DLC, no season passes, no achivements and stupid unlocks that turns game intro retarded grind, and most importan -  this game is MOD-FRIENDLY and allows to tweak AI and Difficulty a lot, nothing locked, and critical patches was released just next day after bugs was reported! Trully oldschool PC-specific way of doing business with respect to customers!\n- a very interesting FPS multiplayer and co-op, It would be better if it was still in development like early access because it needs some work. shorter spawn times, vehicles , larger and more varied maps, what this game has that no other FPS has is realistic weapons. you will not find another game that models modern military grade firearms more realisticily in terms of what they sound like ,recoil, look, feel ( to the extent that a pc game can offer) they are amazing and I would buy this game for 8 bucks just for that alone. But it does need work , this game could be a great title to rival Battlefield and COD franchises ( maybe not Advanced Warfare) it may not surpass those titles but it could give them a better run for the money.\n- I'm severely disappointed whenever a game points at the stands and intends to hit a home run, and then instead smashes the pitcher out after the bat flies out of their hands.\n\nIt looks wonderful, it's relentlessly and uncompromisingly unique, and it plays like complete hell.\n\nUnreasonable difficulty, bordering on sadism, a unique idea let down by just-so-imprecise hitboxes and the feeling of being far too weak to take on anything.\n\nI haven't enjoyed this game, I can't recommend it to anyone else, if you buy it and find favour with it then bully for you, but I'll never understand how.\n- After almost 300 hours in-game, I might be qualified to review this. I'll start by saying that Larian has really got something special here. I'm glad that the work is ongoing, but the progress is palpable. I've broken down my review into a couple sections to hopefully give you a better idea of what you can expect.\n\n1. Graphics\nBG3 has the best graphics in any CRPG I've played up until this point. The animations still need work, as there are a number of cutscenes where things and characters are misplaced. However, environments, spell effects, equipment, characters, etc., are all meticulously designed and you can rest assured that Larian has painstakingly made even the most inconsequential NPC stand out.\n\n2. Sound\nThe sound design is fantastic. Each spell and weapon attack has a unique sound. The ambient sounds are distinct with each area you are located in, as well as the soundtrack. The soundtrack, in general, is well composed. I could sit on the title screen and just listen to the opening song for a long time. The voice acting is fantastic, especially the narrator. The only issue that I've found with the sound is similar to that of graphical bugs: cutscenes need polish. Sometimes characters don't properly voice their lines when cued. If there is a large fight going on with many different effects at once, some new effects may not properly play either.\n\n3. Story\nNot a whole lot of tied up loose ends story-wise as of yet. However, the intro scene is phenomenal. Probably the best intro cutscene in just about any game I've played. From there, the story picks up on a grand scale, then drops you off in the  starting area. You then begin to pick up the pieces to figure out what is going on and how to best solve your little problem. The storyline so far as what's available in EA isn't overly complex, but the particularly enticing part about it is the number of other smaller plots and characters which lend to the main. Over the course of my playthrough, I've picked up several potential paths which could ultimately be taken probably closer to the midpoint of the finished game. \n\n4. Characters\nI'll keep this one brief, but I just want to take a second to say that all of the characters are very well fleshed out and distinct. Even simple NPC's have personalities which, for the most part, don't strike me as cookie cutter in any way. Care has been taken into writing seemingly each and every character, even many animals and corpses. Many actions you take have an effect on your party's opinion of you, but each character has different preferences. Some party members, however, are a tough to nail down as to what makes them happy, even after almost 300 hours. The personality differences between what is expressed through character dialogue and what changes their opinion of your character can feel a bit inconsistent.\n\n5. Combat\nThe combat is fun and rewarding. Each action you take feels as if it has a distinct impact on the battle. This is partially due to the aforementioned animation and sound effects, very punchy and flashy, lots of pretty colors. This is also thanks, in part, to the combat system adopted from 5th ed. D&D. The die rolls, while not visible during combat, add quite a bit of tension and strategy to a fight. You can't just fling cantrips and spells willy-nilly at random enemies and expect to come out on top (for the most part). The balancing is done well enough to allow for a fair fight, but one that doesn't hold your hand throughout and is rewarding when you win. The world design is also done so well that, anywhere a fight could possibly break out (you can attack/kill anyone), the environment lends a lot of variation and strategy to the fight. The enemies are also very smart, to the point where they will flank and take the high ground on you. Stay frosty!\n\n6. Exploration\nExpanding on the final point of the Combat section, the world design makes Faerun feel alive. There is usually something to find around every corner; exploration is very rewarding. Exploration is rewarded in a few different ways. You can get unique loot (while not necessarily as distinct as titles such as Elden Ring, there is a good variety of equipment to find), find interesting social encounters, or battles. Furthermore, battles can be turned to social encounters or vice versa. The versatility in how the player overcomes different situations is very well thought out. My main grip with the exploration is a personal one, but it's the map. It can get sort of tedious trying to navigate the world using the map. But, the exploration area is not particularly sprawling, so you won't be caught wandering around looking for a particular area for too long. A few important items for side quests also come to mind as being particularly hard to find, as they don't really stand out from the background. But, holding Left ALT will bring up titles for items lying around the area if you want to go that route.\n\n7. Races/Classes\nThe current races available are as follows: drow, human, githyanki, dwarf, elf, half elf, halfling, gnome, and tiefling. The classes are fighter, wizard, rogue, ranger, cleric, warlock, druid, sorcerer, warlock, and bard. Larian has done a good job distinguishing each race and class from one another, whether the customization options or progression. The only issue that I have is that the full PHB selection is not yet available. There are subraces available for each race, each with differing characteristics from another. The subclasses are all very self explanatory, if you are familiar with the 5th edition Player's Handbook. A few names had to be changed for certain things within classes, probably due to licensing issues. Also no multiclassing as of just yet. Curious to see if they decide to patch that one in.\n\n8. Character Creation (Visual)\nKind of simplistic at this point. There are no sliders which allow to you to sculpt the face or body, although there are a fair number of preset faces. A good number of hairstyles and facial hair options, as well as colors to apply. And yes, you can apply beards to female dwarves (lookin' at you, Rings of Power).\n\n9. Progression\nSimilar progression to 5e, except that there are several events which grant XP other than just slaying your enemies. Now comes the main problem I have with EA, the level cap. The world is very well designed and very dense, each action you take for the most part feels well rewarded with XP. But, a full playthrough of all the content could see you sitting at 4th level for several hours before completing. This is especially frustrating because 5th level is when you get your second attack and 3rd level spells. But the loot in the game still allows for a little more variety as it does continue to progress in power/utility even up until the end.\n\n10. Optimization\nI run this on a pretty mid-system (Ryzen 5, 1660ti, 16gb RAM) and I can hold between 50-60 fps when exploring on high settings. When in a busier fight, my fps ranges from 35-45 ish. There are a few bugs which impact functionality (dialogue not displaying during conversation, getting stuck on a character's turn during combat, random crashes, etc.). Luckily, these have all vastly reduced in frequency. While the gameplay is by no means flawless, it has reduced frequency enough to where it's not so bothersome as to ruin the game for me. Just depends on your bug tolerance. If you're a Bethesda fan, you'll be just fine.\n\nJust a final thought before I end this thing. If you just want to experience something different and don't mind playing a work in progress, this game is for you. Larian is fantastic at listening to user feedback for optimization to things as small as simple tooltips. If you want a full experience (and I 100% would not blame you if that were the case), just wait until it comes out. Hoping for early-mid '23.\n- EDIT: they made putting easier!  I can finally shoot even and below on the first few courses.  Ignore my complaints about impossible putting below.  I'm back playing this again and enjoying it much more since the putting changes.\n\nI have a love/hate relationship with this game.  It's the closest thing to an enjoyable disc golf game on the PC that I've ever seen, and on that basis I recommend it.  Unlike most sports games, where I can play better on the computer than I can in real life, in this game that's not the case.  After six miserable hours of failure in this game I can safely promise you that I'm wildly better at real life disc golf than I ever will be with this game.\n\nPositives:\n\n- Discs mostly work the way they should (assuming you understand from IRL play how a particular disc should  behave depending on speed and throwing angle) though I feel like flight paths when you're throwing up or down in elevation are off sometimes, but if you throw a fast understable disc at too low a speed it will tail off into the left immediately and when you want to crank up and hyzer bomb the same disc at high speed it gives you the long S you expect and so forth\n- No bugs really (a couple of times the character model went wonky when a disc landed on/next to a rock wall)\n- Graphics are fine by me\n\nCons (possibly only for me, you may not suck at this):\n\n- The entire game is based on a \"stop the tick mark on a spot as it circles a ring\" type swing meter, and I'm absolute trash at it\n- Feels like no progress, other than buying discs--I've upgraded the three skill meters a lot and it has never felt like game play changed much (lol, it certainly hasn't gotten any easier!)\n- Putting is im-fucking-possible, at least for me, it's way too hard--putts that would be gimmes for a novice in real life are a crapshoot, especially if there's any elevation difference\n- After six hours I have only unlocked the first course and half of the second course . . . I may try to go back to this at some point, but for now I've given up on this sucker which is a shame--there are a bunch of other courses that I will never see (my fault, to be sure--I'm terrible at that stupid swing meter)\n\nI haven't played any better options, so while I'm probably giving up at six hours in I'd still recommend it to anyone who's into disc golf.  It's clearly too hard for me, but assuming you're not a complete klutz you will probably have better luck with it.\n- One of the hardest game I've ever played, also the most fun. Satisfying gameplay + pretty cool visuals and story. The moment the game clicks for you is like crack. Finishing the game gave me a better feeling than that one time I escaped child services by immigrating to Argentina\n- This game is great for young kids. By that I mean my 6 yo daughter.\nAs an adult, it kept me entertained for about 10 minutes.\n\nThe controls took only a few minutes to work out, and there's not too much motion, nor too much text on menus, which has encouraged her to read the menu herself.\n\nWhilst the content is light on, she really seems to enjoy it. I put this down the the way the dragons are interactive and respond to her actions. This supports the way she has imaginative play with her stuffed toys.\n\nShe does stuff like:\n- makes up names\n- feeds her dragons\n- pets her dragons\n- playing throw/fetch\n- tells the dragons off for bad behaviour like stealing food\n\nWhen playing shes constantly chatting to the dragons.\n\nI'd love to see stronger personalities show up.\n\nFor example dragons wanting particular props more than others, and a little more interacting between the dragons.\n- *selects waifu*\n*waifu dies*\n*selects next waifu*\n*next waifu dies*\n*select husbando*\n*husbando dies*\n\nI LOVE THIS GAME!\n- This game has (while this review is being written) 10076 reviews. 221 of these reviews are negative. I think this ratio of reviews is deserved and here's why:\n\n- It's a fun story, but not something outstandingly new or anything\n- No one ever can deny that it has an amazing soundtrack\n- The combat is a bit bland, but this is compensated by the fact that the game is pretty short\n- It's a short game, but definitely worth it\n\nOverall: it's just a fun short game to play on a day off. Also, I can't get this soundtrack out of my head! PLEASE SEND HELP!\n- I am a day one player who quit the game within a few days. After coming back after almost 2 years, I am shocked and surprised. The overall improvement is great, quests are not bothering you. Story and atmosphere is hooking you up and the overall experience is good. Leveling up is easy and also you are not struggling as in most MMOs.\n\nDespite the past of the game, I think it is worth trying.\n- First of all, i'd like to mention that i found this game by chance. But it's surprisingly better than some RPGMaker game i've tried and it's not your typical RPGMaker which is surprising since it's developed by one person.\n\n[h2]Story/character[/h2]\nOverall the story is good enough to keep myself immersed with the game. However the story and characters aren't really memorable. For lack of better comparison, it's similar with movie which entertain you but you won't remember it for long time. Although it's probably because i've played many top-rated RPGMaker game which have more budget/resource.\n\n[h2]Gameplay[/h2]\nWhile the developer emphasize this game is story-focused game, i would also describe this game as puzzle-focused RPGMaker game. Store page mention 3 hours, but it took me 9.5 hours to beat this game. Although if i never experience bug (mentioned below) and stuck at one puzzle (where i asked help on Steam discussion), i expect i would spend 7.5 hours.\n\nThe amount and variety of puzzle presented on this game is surprisingly very diverse. Some of them are the best puzzle I've experienced even though I've played fair amount of RPGMaker game. Although few others feels repetitive, difficult due to lack of hint or force you to walk around if you miss/skip something. Lack of option to run/always run is also mildly annoying for me.\n\nAnd since the puzzle of this game is rather challenging/tricky for RPGMaker game, here are few general hints from me in case you're stuck,\n[list]\n    [*]Check for hidden/invisible wall.\n    [*]Try to use items on your inventory.\n    [*]Some interactive object have no impact to solve the puzzle.\n    [*]The game show some hint, usually by highlight/flicker certain object.\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Graphic/music[/h2]\nNothing much to say here. There's few usage of stock RPGMaker asset which used accordingly. The music is nice. While the artstyle/visual is on good side, personally i feel it doesn't match very well with space/sci-fi theme. The cutscene CG also looks good.\n\n[h2]Misc.[/h2]\nThis game runs well on Linux with only minor problem. I experienced one bug which makes me unable to continue the game (not caused by Linux, since it also happen on device which use Windows OS), but the developer fixed it after some time. The game only offer single save file which is annoying to me since i experienced a bug and few puzzle are very tricky.\n\n[h2]Conclusion[/h2]\nOverall Mihirha's Legacy is nice RPGMaker despite few hiccups I've mentioned above. The developer is also responsive to my query which is also plus point. If you're RPGMaker enthusiast, you might want to try this game.\n- Played the original back in 2017/2018, and I must say what a hell of a remaster, everything is enhanced, the visual the UI the user experience, its amazing to see this game in a fullscreen i can finally see the tiny details!\n- First steps:\n-set nioh.exe and nioh_launcher.exe to win7 compatibility (if you experience crashes).\n-first level (London) is poorly optimized, so better rush through it and judge the next.\n-experience this game as Nioh and not as a \"Souls\" game, tho I draw comparisons here\n\n\n[h1]Good[/h1]\n\nCombat\nBy far the best thing about the game. You get 7 weapon classes + 3 ranged weapons, and each of the 7 weapons has it's own unique skillset accompanied by 3 different stances. On the fly switching between 3 stances and 2 weapons, or even both at the same time allows for a ton of combinations to chain different attacks and combos. On top of all that you get magic, spirit guardians and ninjutsu. Sky is the limit if you're willing to experiment.\n\n\nBosses\nThe game comes with roughly over 30 unique bossfights, some of them will reappear or be demoted to regular enemies over the course of the game. There are only very few bosses I didn't like. Most of them are going to be human, but that doesn't mean they are boring. Most have sick movesets that make them very engaging and fun to fight, especially the DLC bosses. \n\n\nDifficulty\nJust like Dark Souls the game is as difficult as you want it to be. This means you get alot of tools that allow you to cheese the game. Like summons, or certain character builds centered around spirit guadians and op magic like sloth talisman which makes enemies move in slow motion. \nThe difficulty curve is a falling one, aka the game is more difficult in the begining when you're figuering things out, then it remains on a steady level with occasional spikes upwards. Disregarding bs like sloth talisman I would say the game is overall more difficult than Dark Souls. Combat is faster and mistakes are punished severly, even human fodder enemies can 1-shot you if you happen to take swings when they are in heavy stance.\n\n\nStory\nIt's decent, but nothing special. Nerds interested in the sengoku period to early edo period \nwill probably appreciate the characters and their interactions.\n\n\nWorld\nIt's not an interconnected world like DS1. It is mission based where you pick main or side missions from a map, personally I don't mind the \"arcade\" style. Main missions themself are big levels with multiple shortcuts that loop back to shrines (bonfires). Those levels are bigger than most designated areas in DS3, my guess is like 1.5x-2x the size. If I had to rank the level design... DS1 >>>> DS3 > Nioh >>>>>>> DS2 \n\n\nReplayability\nThe game offers 4 NG difficulties which spice things up by switching enemy placements or giving enemies (and bosses) status effects and new moves. Other than that you get Abyss mode which is most comparable to DMC's bloody palace. \n\n\nMultiplayer/Netcode + pseudo PvP\n3 ways to play mutiplayer: as summon/summoner, co-op missions where both players make progress at the same time and PvP (which is dead).  The Netcode worked quite well for me, even over wide distances like brazil-germany. I never had to adjust for delay and could parry attacks just like offline.  The netcode is quite good imo compared to DS3 where I did lots of co-op at Champion Gundyr and parrying was totally out of the question.\n\n\nThe other \"pvp mode\" is the faction/clan system. You get multiple clans that belong to 1 of the 2 factions. A clan gives you 2 passive buffs that can compliment your playstyle. You obtain glory by killing revenants, succesfull co-op or pvp for your clan. The more glory you obtain, the higher the rank of your faction, clan and yourself. Glory acts as another currency and can be used to buy npc skins, gestures or items.\n\n\nFashion Souls\nLike the look of a particular light armor set but hate getting insta killed by radroaches? No problem, at the blacksmith you can transform any weapon skin or piece of armor, and keep the stats of your preferred equipment. If you get tired of playing as William you can buy npc skins for glory at the teahouse (unlocks at roughly 33% of the game) which is the only way to play as a female as there is no character creation.\n\n[h1]Bad[/h1]\n\nEnemy Variaty\nThe games biggest weakness in my opinion.  Enemy \"species\" come in different flavours, e.g. humans can wield any of the 7 weapons, however this doesn't realy trigger the visual stimulation of seeing something new. Saving grace: the game throws you into different 1vsX situations, so the combination of enemies keeps things interesting, kinda like DMC4 which also has wack enemy variety. I think they could've done much more in terms of creativity when it comes to the yokai/oni realm given the huge amount of lore.\n\n\nRepetition\nSide missions take place in mostly the same batch of areas or in parts of main missions. \nThey try to keep things fresh by switching enemies and spawn points. But they still feel kinda tedious because skipping them isn't realy an option as you can't deny yourself the experience, rewards and loot.\n\n\nMusic\nGood but gets repetitive as only few themes are shared across bosses.\n\n\nFunky Optimization\nSelf explainatory. FPS tanks in London and I had random crashes. The later were solved by the tips mentioned at the top of the review.\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nI found the combat mechanics to be more than able to compensate for the games weaknesses (repetition, enemy variety). This means you've to take up responsibility and be creative yourself. If you're the type who doesn't like experimenting and spends 90% of his time with spear in mid stance, and plays like its DS (dodge > R1 > R1 > dodge > R1 > dodge...), then you're gonna get bored quickly. Although, I've seen those guys during co-op all the way up to NG3-4, so who knows... .\n- After around an hour and a half of bad spawns, scarce resources, and short-lived ventures into the more inhabited areas of the map, I ran into the first friendly player I had met in Rust. I had initially spotted him pretty far away, but I paid no real notice to him as he had a rock equipped. Eventually he got close enough for us to clearly see each other and, upon the realization that neither of us were hostile, we both pulled out torches as a mutual sign of peace (or the highest possible level of non-aggression that can exist in Rust). I dropped my old hatchet for him as I had just finished crafting one with metal, and he gave me some food as a sign of good faith. After nearly 30 minutes of searching and scavenging, we had pooled enough resources to craft us each some minimally decent gear. We knew that if we wanted to progress any further we would need to mine boulders, and a lot of them. I used what remaining materials we had to put together a 9mm handgun and several bullets, though I reminded him it was only in case we really needed it. I had decided earlier during my many unwanted experiences with bullets to the face that I would try my hardest not to run around slaughtering every newly spawned player that I came across. A few minutes out from camp we had encountered a player with a hunting bow. I had been running with my hatchet out, so I quickly took out the handgun in my inventory and pointed it in his direction, attempting to scare him away. When the player was far enough away we continued up a road towards a few stones. The area was surrounded by trees so I opted to stand guard with the handgun while my friend mined. Just as we were moving on to the next boulder, I heard the gunfire start. I turned around to see a player with an assault rifle gunning down my friend, and before I could land any shots on him he had already begun shooting me. It was at that moment that I remembered I hadn't even crafted a sleeping bag for the camp, as that was one of the objectives of the trip we were taking. I typed into the chat, thanking the friend I had made for all of his help and asking the player who had killed us if we had been intruding in his area or something along those lines. He simply wrote \"Sorry guys :D\" This is the single problem that I have with games like this. Why does it have to be \"shoot-on-sight?\" That player had obviously taken us by surprise and was better equipped than us. Even if he had a justifiable reason for approaching two very poorly equipped players (which he really didn't considering we were in the middle of the woods and he had pretty much all of the gear you could need in this game) he could have easily told us to cooperate by either putting away our weapons or just leaving the area. But of course, he comes around, sees some players trying to gather enough supplies to get to a stable point in the game, and decides to go out of his way to approach us and use unecessary ammo for a hatchet and a handgun with four bullets. Then, to add even more of an insult, he adds an apology at the end, as if he had no choice but to shoot two unexpecting, half-naked, unprepared players. \n\nAll in all, though, I do see a lot of potential in this game, and the good in the community does shine through every once in a while. I just wish that people would realize that they don't need to go around killing players who haven't had the chance to experience the game. People like that are the single reason why so many players on steam feel that they wasted money on what would otherwise be a great experience.\n- To be honest, I could've typed this review up years ago when I got this, but I never knew how to make a review. But I'm here now, and I'm doing this... Okay, here we go...\nThe Good(AKA:Everything):\n-Cars go crunch here so you don't have to crash IRL(Though I know that won't stop all of you...).\n-Great cars and maps with nice little details.\n-An INCREDIBLE modding community. There's and ENDLESS supply of content coming out all the time from hard-working individuals, all so we can take your masterpieces and turn them into heaps of scrap.\nThe Bad(AKA:What bad?):\n-This is on me... but it can get a little boring, as your mostly just crashing cars. There are so challenges to do in game, and there are so many things you COULD do... but I guess I don't have the imagination to do that. Like I said, this is bad on me. No fault of the game.\n-Game is really graphics heavy, so a higher-end PC is recommended. Nothing too fancy, but RAM and GPU are hardest hit... maybe processor too...(I'm not that smart with tech...) But this isn't truly bad, as you probably already have good spec if you're looking to play a physics-heavy game.\n-Load times... They used to be bad, but they've gotten considerably better in recent updates. But... the more mods you get, the more it'll have to load. A good PC should be able to handle it, but just keep this in mind.(I have 100's of mods, and it's not too bad...)\nAnd well, that's it. Sorry this it so long... One of my first reviews, after all. But this game deserves to looked at in detail. If you play it once, you'll come back to it here and there to have more fun. So, in short, I HIGHLY recommend this game!\nIf you read this far, thank you so much! I tried my best here!\n\n- i would say yes there are many bugs especially in the ne update where the cell doors remain open in normal mode and the guards take the new prisoners in the new cells and leave them there handcuffed forever. however this is one of the funnest games iv'e ever bought and it has brought me countless hours of enjoyment, the bugs might be annoying at times but mostly a good restart should do it :). overall i think this game is very worth getting, it lets you play the game how you want to play it and doing so will give you hours of fun as theres always something to do wether its create mor cells or make a execution room. and the mods are great you can really see the creativity in the prisons people have made i would definantly reccomend the checkpoint charlie military prion texture mod too.\n- Do you have friends? Do you want to play games with your friends?\nBuy this game!\nDo you not have friends? Are you in need of consolation due to the endless lonely Friday nights spent playing Solitaire? \nConsider playing Dwarf Fortress.\n- You can do anything in this game. Spawn a ton of teletubbies and grab a nuke to blow them up? You can do that. Get a gun and kill your friends? You can do that. Fly around? You can do that. Anything? You can do that.\n- + The amount of stuff to grab and to do, insane\n+ New engine blows the old Isaac out of the water (fire effects, shadows, etc.)\n+ Game is amazingly smooth and clean\n+ Too many achievements to count for\n+ Too many hours spent in perspective\n+ Best poop simulator EVER!\n\n- Incompatible with social life outside the PC.\n- UPDATE: Had the music on the \"+\" but moved it here. Sounded incredible on the first run but on the long run it's kinda grating. Makes me miss Danny's amazing soundtrack.\n- The amount of love and fun that went into this game is astounding. If you like minigames, memes, fun, and a challenge, check this game out. The “ending” was a bit lackluster, in my opinion, but it did not taint my views on the game and I had an overwhelmingly fun time with it. Definitely recommend!\n- It's illegal that this game is free.\n- Beautifully drawn and atmospheric\n\nAmazing sound\n\nSimple to play yet gives just the right amount of challenge without being frustrating\n\nI played and finished it in one sitting, Mainly because I was riveted from start to finish\nYes its 3-4 hours long but you will enjoy every minute of it\nI don't think I will ever understand whats going on with the story...but somehow I think that was the intention\n\nHighly recommended and definitely best indie game of the year, perhaps the last 5 years\n- So um, I don't usually write reviews like this or much at all really. I mostly make unfunny jokes and call it a review or something super generic. I guess I'll just write whats on my mind.\n\nI really liked this game.\nI felt like I was a kid again playing Super Mario 64.\nSometimes I get tired of shooting guns. Or slashing fantasy monsters with some shiny sword. Or saving the magic land from evil. Or using hyper combos I never remember. Or collecting resources to build a quirky town. Or time managing some distant farm. Or driving some tricked out vehicles. Or investing in status points to make super strong characters. Or following a long and convoluted plot with crazy lore.\n\nSometimes I just wanna run and jump around while I pick up some cool looking stuff.\nI, uh, had a lot fun playing this game. \nThanks.\n- tldr:\nits sniper elite 3,5.\nnot all that bad but then i look at good vs bad, bad wins.\nsince valve/steam still cant be bothered to implement a neutral thumb, its thumbs down from me.\nbuy it on sale if you must, not worth an AAA price tag for sure.\n\n--------\n\nsniper elite 4 is what sniper elite 3 should have been.\nthe maps are much bigger, the melee is far better/fluid, the xray cam is how you wanted it to be and it looks and feels overall pretty nice.\n\nso why didnt i like it, no thumbs up?\nbecause it also feels like its an update to sniper elite 3, nothing more and nothing new. at all.\nand there a re few things that really stuck out and which are just a big NONO:\n\n- the campaign is shockingly short. i read in someones review that they finished it in 6 hours. and i needed 10 or 11. disappointing\n\n- multiplayer is medicore.still.\nit feels half done; copied over from sniper elite 3; and i can never play more than 3 rounds before getting bored. \nand i dont think im alone because most of the time you find as average 3 lobbys for team deathmatch game types.\nbut multiplayer being multiplayer, everyone feels different about it so you may disregard this point if you wish.\n\n- the voice acting is one of the worst you will ever hear. the italian mobster you talk to sounds so bad that i literally started laughing.\nthe lady who gives you intructions via radio before each level sounds like someone working at a XXX hotline.\n\n- i have yet to encounter the high praised AI.\nthey are decent, yes, slightly better than sniper elite 3, on close and mid range... but if you actually manage to get to a high vantage point and snipe across the map, say 400,500m+? , (which is extremely rare btw), then the AI fails horribly.\nyou kill 2 people far away, the AI goes into alert and then calls the search off 5 seconds later because the game realizes you are far, far away and the alerted soldiers would need 5 minutes to get to you, kinda.\nso you can snipe at your hearts content, just wait every so often between shots.\ni have actually cleared an entire level that way. i didnt even move, never got spotted and no one ever knew where the shots came from. \nonce everything was dead, i just visited the objective checkpoints.\n\n- a sniping game that considers shots 100m+ \"Long Shots\" .\n... wut?\n\n- one of the things that bugs me most. dont let the big maps fool you. you only can ever go two ways, on one map 3.\nand finally it doesnt matter which way you go because you have to do all checkpoints anyway, which are both ways.\nthe majority of the map is covered with obstacles and terrain that can not be passed/traversed, forcing you on pre-determined paths.\nits a real themepark where you are forced to go where the developers want you to go. \nit becomes painfully obvious when there are high grass patches strategically placed along your way where the devs think that you should hide there because there you have an opportunity to stealth something for a bit.\nthere really is no freedom of choice when it comes to the map,how you approach things etc.\nall you can do is...left or right? and all guns blazing or try to stay semi-hidden.\nmeeh...\n\n- i remember watching a dev stream that introduced the game ,way before release. i already noticed a DLC button in their alpha client. i knew that was a bad sign...\nright after game release i found half of the items locked for DLCs that havent even been released yet.\ntake that plus very short campaign and below medicore multiplayer and you have zero reason to ever buy any DLC. \njust doesnt make any sense. \nwhy would you, what for?\n\n- releasing a game together with seperate dlcs the same day?\ni didnt expect that from rebellion.\nvery.shabby \n\nnow, having ranted like this....it is not a terrible game all together.\ni had fun while it lasted but it does not justify the price tag,ever.\nit could have been so much more but i guess greed and publisher pressure won at the end.\ni was looking forward to it and left disappointed.\n\nthe ending of the campaign already suggests there will be a sniper elite 5 but this time i shall wait until its on an 85% sale.\n- 1. What is \"Pyre\"?\nThe game \"Pyre\" was made by Supergiant Games and was released on the 25th of July in 2017. After \"Bastion\" and \"Transistor\" this is their third game. \"Pyre\" is an indie-action-rpg, which story is mostly told in form of a novel. The gameplay is very different to the experience you probably made in \"Bastion/Transistor\", which lead a few people to put a negative review on steam. Now you will no longer play as one single character like before, but you are responsible for a group of exiles. The gameplay at it´s heart can be declared as 3 parts:\n \npart 1 contains travelling/exploring the world\n\npart 2 contains social interactivity with your group (talking/trading/decision-making)\n\npart 3 contains to take part in the rites, that means a fast-paced action ball game (3 vs 3) without        a planning phase (like in \"Transistor\")\n\n\n2. Technical details\n-the game runs fine on my windows 10 64 bit machine and it needs about 8.2 gb space of your hard drive. Unfortunately the game runs bad on old machines, because you need about 4 gb ram to run it without an error (my other 3 gb ddr2-system couldn´t run it, I received a ram-error-message when starting the game).\n\n-controls with mouse+keyboard or gamepad are good and well implemented.\n\n\n3. What does the game do right?\n-great rpg-novel-mixture as a whole unique and emotional experience\n-despite the linear progression (mentioned \"phases/parts\" above) the game stays interesting enough to continue\n-a colourful and fantastic world to explore (no open-world)\n-great character-design and a good variety of different creatures, which affects the gameplay during the rites\n-beautiful artstyle with a lot of detail and smooth animations \n-believable and fleshed-out storyline (NOT \"black and white\") with a personalised ending! \n-wonderful soundtrack (mostly ambient)\n-the creatures of the world speak their own language, subtitle is displayed in old-fashioned English\n-rites: the thrilling-faced-paced-action-game has a lot of depth to it (skill tree/character selection/items/area of the rite)\n-selectable difficulty level (rites can be optionally restartet), which can be changed during the game (+ \"titan-mode\": advanced challenges you can add separately like in \"Bastion/Transistor\")\n-meaningful and emotional decisions to be made (I´m looking at you mass effect), thankfully there are no dead-ends but different endings (personalised!)\n-\"Pyre\" is \"2-3 times\" longer compared to \"Bastion\"/\"Transistor\" without getting boring\n-good mouse+keyboard and gamepad support\n-\"versus-mode\": you can play against friends together on your pc or alone against CPU (with all the characters in the game!)\n\n\n4. What does the game do wrong?\n-the fast-paced-gameplay during the rites can be very fast and too stressful at times (I experienced some unfair situations here and there)\n-controls are sometimes not precise enough, especially when the gameplay is getting hot\n-hardware requirements (like \"Transistor\") with 4 gb ddr-ram are over the top regarding old rigs with dual-core cpu´s \n-some minor bugs during the rites (ball gets stuck, switching between characters over distance, bad camera angles over distance)\n-\"versus mode\" can only be played as local multiplayer\n-no bonus material for fans at all \n\n\n5. tl;dr\nPyre offers a fantastic but linear action-rpg-experience with a great story, which is told in form of a novel with a personalised ending. The gameplay is a mixture of exploration, social interactivity and a 3 vs 3 ball-sports-game. The level of creativity considering world-building, character design, music and the way the story is being told is on an insanely high level. If you liked \"Bastion\" and \"Transistor\" you need to know that you don´t play just as one character anymore. But what you can expect is a game with a heart, just like their games before. Pyre is in my opinion a masterpiece and the best Supergiant game so far.\n\n\n6. Final thoughts\nAs a child of the 80´s I played a lot of pc games. Sometimes I look back and remember how I bought game boxes from a company called \"Lucas Arts\". There were times I didn´t even inform myself about the upcoming games, I just bought them because I loved their games I purchased before. For me Supergiant reached that status in the present time. \n\n\n\nUntil the stars align!\nIf you liked this review be sure to hit the like button to help other players with helpful reviews. Thanks!\n- Yeah sooooo I went 1k words past the max...had to pare this down...it's ok...I'm mentally stable...\n\nCrossCode is a top-notch indie in its genre. I'd mention it in the same breath as Celeste, Hades, and Outer Wilds. (guess I just did.) If you can at least enjoy both puzzles and real-time combat, this game is for you; it's not as much of a JRPG as it might look. The only real flaw I care to levy is that it isn’t incredible out of the gate; it’s merely good, and gets much better. I was going to summarize my reactions and add a \"what is the premise/gameplay loop\" section and have longer sections but I had to cut it all out so have _/5 ratings on the section titles instead. It's fine. I'm fine. Everything is fine.\n\nOk, review time.\n\nSTORY 4/5 NEATO\n\nThe story is great, and not quite what you might expect. It starts pretty light and cozy, with solid (and often meta) humor interspersed with cryptic moments. I like how casually the in-universe MMO is treated by the players. I enjoyed all the characters, including our mostly-mute but personable Lea. Once it ramps up, the story takes some exciting turns, too; the devs really know how to do drama without doing overdrama. I didn't relate too much to the story but I think it was told quite well. I like the portrayal of the antagonists for the most part, though I wish I could have felt their presence more often. The lore is also fascinating, if occasionally hard to grasp because the line between real and virtual is very thin due to the game’s particular premise. (The difference between real people and NPCs is sometimes unclear, for instance.) The ending was good, but I think the DLC epilogue wraps the game up far better.\n\nCOMBAT 5/5 WOWIE\n\nWhen you start out, combat feels almost hack-n-slashy. You can spam melee attacks and bullets for days, but you also have a charged projectile, a dodge-dash, and a shield. The elemental modes are absolutely the highlight due to the way enemies work, and the sort of limiter gauge they have forces strategy. Special moves are stylish and borderline absurd at higher levels. A huge skill tree controls them and much more; unlike some skill trees, this one requires choices, which is always a good sign. Oh and consumables are your main source of healing and buffs, and they aren't overpowered! Balancing win.\n\nThe enemies are really what make the combat fantastic. Almost every enemy has at least one gimmick and one visible weakness. The stun gauge mechanic is vital to all battles, forcing you to exploit those weaknesses to stun enemies and give you time to use your extra-long special moves. Bosses love to give you iterative micro-puzzles to fill their stun gauges, while minibosses are comfortably in-between. Bosses commonly have armor or invulnerability when not stunned, forcing even overleveled players to figure out the micro-puzzles to hit hard. (More great balancing.) Most weaknesses involve the element system, eventually encouraging you to swap elements multiple times mid-fight. The micro-puzzles will build on what you’ve been learning in a dungeon if it’s a dungeon fight. I'll mention that some normal enemies do feel like damage sponges at first, but you'll get used to this; the simple enemy design in the early game makes it seem worse than it is imo.\n\nPUZZLES 5/5 FUN COOL\n\nFor puzzles you've got your common environmental \"platforming\" puzzles, your specialized quest puzzles, your dynamic mini-puzzles in battles, and your iterative puzzling gauntlets in dungeons. Also almost everything is secretly part puzzle? Like, everything. They're an invasive species. They draw most of their complexity from the element system too. Each element has its own effects on certain objects and structures, and mainly you use charge shots to interact, though each attack has its own uses. Not much to say here; they're great puzzles. A couple may stump you for a while, but that's impossible to avoid, and I think CrossCode strikes a perfect challenge balance.\n\nQUESTS 5/5 WHEEEEEE\n\nWhile some quests conform to the typical hunting/gathering quests of MMOs, most boast some entirely unique content. Challenges range from unique bosses to puzzles to platforming to other familiar gimmicks that are secretly also puzzles. I won't spoil them. Quests generally use mechanics you have seen already in new, often very different, scenarios. NPCs are mostly there to be amusing or set up the gameplay, and that didn't bother me tbh.\n\nITEM MANAGEMENT 5/5 AAAAA\n\nItem and equipment acquisition? Engaging? WTF? Technically you get them like you do in any RPG. But, rare plants have high rare item drop rates, so if you know the platforming puzzle to reach em you don't have to waste much time. Enemies' drop rates rise with a high Combat Rank, which you get by killing many enemies in a row before the post-fight cooldown period ends and you get to heal to full and level up. This is tough until you're very comfortable with the area. Once you are, it's a whole new way of battling, using area knowledge to string together sequential fights. And what does the game do but give you a piece of upgradable equipment that grants the Combat Rating bonus to plants too?\n\nI actually cared about the equipment in the game too! *kisses Life Fiber Uniform* (yes they really make this reference) Equipment also matters more than level so the devs can control your power level better. Most times you can buy some basic equipment to explore, then return with items to trade to NPCs for stronger gear. Stronger gear has unique traits and you might prefer one over another, so it's nice that with trading you get to focus your resources on what you want. Sometimes you can trade some enemy drops for other ones, as I recall, which is a nice...uh, trade-off to get to make.\n\nQUALITY OF LIFE 5/5 HELP\n\nCONVENIENCE REIGNS in CrossCode. Text log like in visual novels? Check. Encyclopedia of story recaps, character summaries, CrossWorlds lore & terminology, etc.? Check. Enemy index? Check. Item drop rates? Check. Available trades? You beck. This is EXTREMELY helpful for an RPG, which otherwise would require a guide or plain luck to find rare item drops. Oh yeah also there's UI? I forgot about it cuz it's really good. Also the keyboard controls for swapping elements are a bit janky but I managed.\n\nAesthetics 3/5-5/5 SUBJECTIVITY WOOOOOO\n\nYeah if ya like what you see in the trailers and screenshots, that oughta be enough. I thought the art was average-good in the beginning, but like everything else the art improves as you go. They must’ve gone back and worked on old stuff, but not too much. The music is great. No complaints there. My one objective critique is, Lea has no depth perception -- the art makes similar-height platforms look identical. I ran into so many walls and stared at so many small flat gaps I thought I couldn't cross. I'm not a fool! It's the game's fault! But actually this time!\n\nA NEW HOME DLC 6/5 WTF OMG\n\nThe paid DLC is The Culmination of CrossCode. The epilogue is complex and fascinating and rewarding. The dungeon is an incredible all-elements send-off. I adore the new quests. And the art?? The environments, the enemies, the NPC portraits are all so pretty. Don't be fooled by the letters \"DLC\": this is not Discretionary Leisure Content. If you liked the base game, this is...Deluxe...eLite...C-content??? look these are not great letters to work with ok\n\nCONCDLUDSIONO\n\nWhat else to say? CrossCode good. Buy it. Do the thing. Also, look out for Project Terra, Radical Fish's next project. It translates their current style into a 3D environment with dynamic lighting. It’s pretty & it reduces that height perspective issue. There isn’t much info about it out yet, but keep your eyes out! (figuratively pls) I'm excited for what they'll come up with.\n\nHOLY **** I MADE IT AND WITH CHARACTERS TO SPARE YESSSS — ohnowai\n- I hated Undertale.\n\nIt was, pretty clearly, a game about sexy skeletons. I did not care about sexy skeletons. I refused to play a game about sexy skeletons.\n\nThen my friend made me listen to the soundtrack, and I decided I could deal with a few hours of sexy skeletons if I got to listen to the best video game music I had ever heard while doing it. \n\nI played Undertale. It's not a game about sexy skeletons. It's a game about choices, maybe, or morality, or curiosity. It's a game about pushing the limits. It's a game about experiences, about \"what would happen if I did this?\", about storytelling so intricate and complex and raw that it shouldn't be able to fit into seven hours of bullet hell and pixel graphics. But, somehow, it does. Every choice you make has an impact. Every object you check has a story. The soundtrack, the witty yet profound writing, the simple pixel graphics, and even the menu screens and bullet patterns themselves all intertwine in order to tell a story that only you decide the ending of.\n\nAlso, the skeletons aren't even sexy.\n\nMy advice to you: Go in as blind as you can. Don't read walkthroughs. Don't watch playthroughs. Don't prepare yourself. Don't even look at overviews. Hell, don't even read the Steam page description. Just buy the game (and give some well-earned money to a little white dog), and, as it were, climb the mountain yourself. Don't let anyone backseat. Don't listen to people who tell you there's a right way to play.\n\nAnd when you think you've reached the end, just think--what other choices could you have made?\n\nSo, yes. I hated Undertale.\n\nAnd then I played it.\n- It looked old when it was released. Now it's downright ugly. The gunplay is clunky. The physics are terrible. The bugs are ever present.\n\nThe RPG mechanics are top notch. The choices you make matter.\n\nOne of the greatest games ever made.\n- Joined the Discord Server to get a sense of the toxic, immature, insulting community. If the Discord server is not moderated, which is the first impression for new players, then you know in what state the game is.\n- Wanna spend 20% of the time scared, 60% of the time confused, 15% of the time infuriated, and 5% of the time laughing your ass off? THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU!\n\nFor the rest, save your money.\n\nIt's so buggy, dark, poorly optimized, and confusing; you'll spend more time pulling your hair out than the rare moments that it actually manages to pull off a jumpscare. Also, it is NOT procedurally generated at all. Watched a YouTuber play this game and got the exact same map and jumpscares... er... \"jumpscares\" as they did. Not worth $10. If they can fix the bugs and tweak a few things, though, it'd at least be worth 5.\n\n- I didn't like the FPS section; was honestly pretty repetitive and gratuitously violent. Also the 8 hour sex scene was a bit out of nowhere, but after like hour 3 you understand why they devote so much time to it. Overall game was ok I guess\n- My profile pic is the reaction i have towards the game devs that made this game.\nVisually disgusting, gameplay wise impossible and over all terrible.\nWhile it's possible to beat it and get all the achievements it's difficult and also the space level is actually visual aids it's so disgusting to look at that you can't even focus on the gameplay.\nNot worth it even for free which is how i probably got it i can't remember and i don't want to...\n- theres 2 options with this game, either you play the original without mods wich is still a very good game\nor you have the untitled goose, matt from wii sports, sans undertale, and barack obama fight on top of a mcdonalds\n\n10/10 game\n- Unfortunately Flatout 3 is a big disapointment for me and many fans of previous parts. \nWhat went wrong? \nGameplay has lost this \"catchy\" spirit making this game addicting. Controls has changed and physics as well. You don't have any feeling of the vehicle You driving. The game seems to be at faster pace. Too fast form me :) Too many explosions and destructions out of a good taste. Soundtrack is flat and colorless. It isn't bad but... There is no tracks of some famous rockbands as previously. Graphisc has not made any progress. It has made a step backwards as it stay in place.\n Flatout3 has a lot of game modes some of which are not playable at all. \n\nI like SPEED Mode it has something good :)\n\nThe rest is kind of fun ... for about 5 minutes. There is no career mode :(\n\nTo be honest : Flatout 1 & 2 have their own style and leave in gamers' minds an unique impresion and lots of good, warm memories. FO3 does not...\n- [h1]Gameplay : 9/10\nGraphic : 9/10\nCommunity : -25/10 ( updated, people see this wrong and keep asking me.   \nI wrote\" negative 25.\")\n\n\nPlaying with friends: 11/10\nCompetitiveness&balance: 11/10\n[/h1]\n----------------------------------------INTRO--------------------------------------------------\n\n         For those of you who aren't familiar with the MOBA genre, here's a quick explanation. There are two bases, each on opposing corners of the map, and one for each team. The objective is to destroy the opposing team's base. Three roads, or lanes, connect the bases. Low-level units automatically and periodically spawn from each base in groups, and these soldiers travel down the three paths between the bases. As a result, there is always a battle going on in the trio of lanes.\nIn addition, each team has three defensive towers in each lane on their side of the map, totaling nine towers per team. These structures deliver powerful attacks against enemy soldiers and players, but they can be destroyed through significant effort. Because of this, fights tend to center on the towers.\n\n         All of this happens automatically. Unlike in typical RTS games, you don't have to collect resources, build structures, or train units. You only control your hero, which can level up and acquire a range of upgradeable powers. However, its role might best be described as support for the A.I. soldier units. Players help control the battlefronts and destroy enemy towers in the lanes. The idea is to to open your opponent's base up to a direct attack by the A.I. and hero once the towers in a lane are gone. There are five players per team, which of course doesn't divide into the three lanes equally. When a player dies, he respawns at the team's base after a penalty period.\n\n\n[h1]Overall:\npros: A much better game than lol\ncons: A much harder game than lol\n\nLMAO\nquit playing trash game plz[/h1]\n\n----------------------------------------Pro&Con---------------------------------------------\nPROS\n\n1,   All At Your Fingertips – players have access to ALL of the game's heroes from the start. No need to unlock or purchase heroes. ( poor LOL)\n2,  Snowball Easily – dying results in a loss of gold, can magnify the effects of snowballing(Buyback system can make sure you don't lose a game with just one mistake).\n3,  Huge Variety of Cosmetics and Skins – players can customize individual parts of their heroes from both valve and community. (weapons, armor, helmets, etc.).\n4,   Custom Game Support – players can build their own custom games within Dota 2 (Pudge Wars, Tower defenses, Racing, Battleships, and more!)\n5,   Skill-Based and Competitive – similar to LoL, Dota 2 is heavily reliant on a player's skill, is very competitive, and has a large e-Sports scene.\n\n\nCONS:\n\n1 , Dota directly affects on your life (social life) \n2 , Time consuming( Avg about 45 min per game + additional queuing time(about 3-10 mins depends on your region))\n3 , Hard for newbies ( up to 500 hrs bot practices at least ---usually about 800 hrs)\n4 , hbp due to rage (you may having 3 r e t a r d s and peru feeder/feeders on your side of team)\n[spoiler]5 , Addiction(the true e-drug)[/spoiler]\n\n---------------------------------------ADDITIONS---------------------------------------------\n\nDon't spend too much money on treasures. All the rare items can be purchased through community market if you feel like you are not gonna get any of rare sets.\n- I haven't played a game that manages to make me cry and fill me with courage this fiercely in a long while. You should definitely play this if you are looking for a good story. You are going to love it.\n- I got this game for $12 off humble bundle. Me and my friends play it for hours on end. This game honestly feels like the perfect fighting game for me because there is no set style. I don't have to remember specific combos or any crazy inputs. It's just simplicity. Unless you want to do that in which you can. But it's fun for anyone. If I were you I would get it off of humble bundle for $12.\n- coffee talk 2 is out and now everyday i look forward to making myself a cozy drink and playing my daily session of it, just like i did with the first game. it makes my day so much better☕🤎\n\nMohammad Fahmi, the creator and the writer of the first game who passed away at 32, is always in my thoughts. thank you for creating this gem.\n\nthe game is currently \"playable\" on steam deck, but in my opinion it deserves to be deck-verified. i've had no problems on the deck at all. the reason for \"playable\" status seems to be the small text, but i've also had no difficulty reading anything. it's one of those games that is better experienced handheld, curled up on the couch with a nice blanket ♡ so don't be fooled by the \"playable\" status, it works 100% fine and you don't have to tinker with anything.\n- If you somehow don't know what this is: It's a meta-narrative focused walking sim with a funny narrator. Only you know if that kind of thing sounds like a good time to you.\n\nSubtract about 26 hours from my playtime because I'm a lunatic who left the game running for a whole day to get a silly achievement.\n\nI loved the HD remix (never played the og mod), and I really liked this one too, but I will say that a lot of the commentary the original offered doesn't hit as hard or hold up as well almost a decade later, just because the narrative structure and how narrative is tied to gameplay of many story-driven games has changed in that time (because of course it has), as well as the mindset of a lot of players being different. So I think that it's worth keeping in mind the cultural moment the original was made during... if you're the thinky type who likes to overthink things. You massive nerd.\n\nStill, it felt nice to jump back in and spend a little more time with the narrator, and there were some legitimately striking moments in the new content that I found to be quite powerful and engaging. Overall, though, having played the original, getting all the new stuff (and revisiting the old) felt a lot more like checking off a to-do list than active exploration teasing at the boundaries of the game and it's layout than the first one.\n- A Short Hike is a relaxing, casual game about exploring an expansive, mountainous island park and eventually making your way to its summit so you can get cell phone reception.\n\nYou play as Claire, a bird who can climb, glide, and flap to great heights using a stamina system based upon how many golden and silver feathers you’ve collected. Along the path to the mountaintop you’ll encounter Animal Crossing-style characters who are friendly, punny, and usually have some minor task for you to solve, ranging from finding lost items to making deliveries.\n\nHelping residents of the island is completely optional, as is just about every activity in the game other than locating a few feathers and reaching the summit; as a result, length can range from an hour if you don’t stop to smell the roses to a few hours if you decide to make friends with everyone and see all the park has to offer.\n\nActivities include filling out a fishing journal by trading in your catches, digging in suspicious spots, solving treasure map clues, parkour racing, and opening up shortcuts by breaking blocked entrances and watering bouncy flowers. \n\nA Short Hike has a charming aesthetic and a lovely, peaceful soundtrack. I felt driven to see everything the game had to offer despite not being forced into any of it and never lost interest until I did so. It’s a beautiful little world that will make fans of Animal Crossing feel right at home.\n- Started strong, ended annoyingly.\n\nMoral of the story? People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.\n\nIt paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that \"routine\" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.\n\nI liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters. But it all fell apart and tries to teach a very vapid moral that someone in their early 20's who has never had a meaningful relationship would idealize.\n\nAt least it was short.\n\n- This was a impulse buy for me just have seeing the new \"Fury Road\", but its a great game so far was kinda shocked it ran smooth right out the gate seems like today you gotta wait a week or month before a game can run proper though. Anyways beatufiful lighting, models / textures look good, vehicle combat / driving is fun, and vehicle customization is cool too. The on foot combat feels a little too straight foward though, the gore animations are kinda boring though, like feels like its a Xbox/360 game in that way, and collecting scrap can get a little repetitive. My final thought yea this game is worth getting but if you haven't played id's \"RAGE\", I'd reccomend getting that first, it's a extremely simmilar although kinda diffrent scenario game that will quench your Mad Max thirst.\n- [h1]A game meant to bring back memories that is similar to Super Mario World on the SNES and it does this with relatively few gameplay and gimmick elements.

After all, it has to be ready for take-off in order for children everywhere to receive their presents on schedule. But a wicked troll blasts us out of the sky just as the test drive is about to end. He went over the line and wants to ruin Christmas for everyone on Earth. It is up to us to bring the troll to his senses and save Christmas for everyone.\n\nTLoS brings players to one world and six levels of great platforming that are reminiscent of Super Mario World (SNES) but simplified. There are only six levels total, one of which is a castle, before the final battle with the troll. The only difference is that we will be collecting chocolate cookies rather than the traditional yellow coins. We also lose part of our cloak when we are injured, so it's not uncommon for you to find yourself jumping through the levels wearing nothing but red boxer shorts. For instance, red blocks can give you a new coat, which means extra life, or Santa socks and hats, which give a power-up or simply chocolate cookies. The power-up allows you to throw stones as if you had collected the Fire Flower from Super Mario, and that's about it. TLoS also offers a 2-4 co-op player mode, in which players will be able to work together to complete this short and family-friendly adventure.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3009359595\n\nSimilar to Super Mario World, you walk to a level to choose them in the Overworld. Once we reach a certain level, we are allowed to walk, leap, and even sprint. Additionally, there are other indications on the screen that show you how many cookies you have already gathered and how much time is remaining to finish the level. We get an extra life when 100 cookies are collected. We can activate a checkpoint about halfway through the level to pick up exactly where the checkpoint was reached, instead of having to do the entire level all over again. The game also features side-scrolling and underwater levels. The only problem is that if you quit at level three, close the game and start again, you have to start from level one, so you have to play the game in one go. This means that there are no save points or \"save states\". Considering the length of the game, this is not a big deal, but it's still \"annoying\".\n\n[h3] My Specs [/h3]\n\n[code]CPU: i9 9900k\nGPU: RTX 2080 Ti\nRAM: DDR4 32 GB RAM\nOS: Win10\nResolution: 1440p @144hz\n[/code]\n\n[h3] Conclusion [/h3]\n\nWe are all hoping that Nintendo will release their IPs on Steam so that we can play with them one more time. We may all agree, based on experience, that this is probably never going to happen, but Indie developers are there to make it happen. To avoid the tedious teachings at school, you used to be able to play these types of games in class on the usual Flash Player websites, and now you can play them on Steam. Though it's not a masterpiece, it's extremely minimalistic, and it's unquestionably too short, the 20 minutes I spent playing it were nevertheless a lot of fun, especially because the platforming is accurate and not wonky at all. Just remember, it's very minimalistic and may be too minimalistic for some, but if that doesn't bother you, feel free to go ahead and try it out.\n\nIt would be my personal highlight if there were additional levels, more secret exits, more power-up alternatives, and more hours of overall playtime.\n\n[h2] Final Verdict: 8/10 A typical gas station snack that turns out to be a surprisingly good one.🎅 [/h2]\n- I am a Filthy Casual (tm) who plays games like Mass Effect and Fallout 4 on easy and still die over and over. I got my \"you died\" achievement in Dark Souls 2 before the tutorial and stopped playing after like forty minutes with zero qualms. I have rage quit every single platformer game I have ever touched, and just sort of despise brutally hard things that feel like chores.\n\nBasically, I am not exactly sure why I decided to buy Dead Cells in the first place. Sure, I love the look and one of the few platformers I've ever 100%'d was Super Metroid (with a LOT of swearing and rage quitting), so 'Metroidvania' is an appealing term to me, but it is still inherently marketed as a game that is not for me, or people like me.\n\nThis game is hard. I have 11 hours on it and I can't get past the third area on any given path. I die for stupid reasons and lose all my stuff and... I don't care. I haven't rage quit once; in fact, I have to force myself away from the game after a death so I can do things like eat. I find the combat engaging and entertaining, the progression satisfying and there's something really solid about being forced to start from square one (ish) every single time, in a way I've just never experienced.\n\nSo, sure, buy this if you love hard games/Dark Souls/no checkpoint kind of games. Absolutely, I'm pretty sure you've alreeady heard this is likely to be up your alley.\n\nBut even if you're a dirty rotten casual gamer who button smashes in any game approaching action, and panics when the screen flashes red around the edges... give it a try if you get the opportunity. It is seriously fun.\n- Damn this game is so unexpectedly good i can't believe it.\nThe setting is perfect. The idea behind the game is awesome.\nThe graphics are so atmospheric.\n\nThank f*ck that this isn't published by EA.\nStay indipendent Crytek, listen to the Community and the Profit will rain.\n\nRating: FUCK YEAH DUDE!!!!\n- Absolutely Don't understand all the negative reviews for this game. \n\nFirst off: this game is a RogueLite in that death is permanent, be prepared for this. Death is a part of the game and you are NOT losing progress by dying.. it's death mechanic is very much like Rogue Legacy in that you keep progress that carries on to your next character when you begin again. Dying also isn't like you lost more than 45 minutes of your time. Every single game in this genre will have plenty of deaths involved before you FINALLY get that first win (in most cases). Some people are going to need to spend some time grinding levels, dying and repeat until they have enough sticker slots open to overpower things. Keep that in mind going into it. You retain your level and any big upgrades you acquire when you die so you are NOT starting from scratch every single time like you would in most rogue likes. \n\nI normally wouldn't review a game so early but I saw the negative reviews pouring in and felt I needed to add some counters to it. \n\nThe second thing: the art/music/atmosphere is absolutely brilliant for a game in this genre where most games of this nature tend to be relatively grim. As with most roguelike/lites its procedurally generated so the map, enemies and what have you will be different each time. \n\nThird: the forced timer before you have to fight the boss is a bit jarring at first as i've never played a game of this type where I have limited time to actually get there.. but it's kind of brilliant really because it adds a completely different layer to the game in that you have to manage your time very well. What do you think you have time to do before the inevitable? Do you want to run around and grind exp killing trash mobs? Or do you think that time could be better spent knocking some dungeons out (time halts when in dungeons so take your time in these) and getting some gear and arguably more exp than you would just wandering the map. Also, you absolutely have plenty of time to explore the map as there are shrines (you have to find them but the map isn't huge), that you can pay a special currency to add another day of time to the clock. If you see a review complaining about the timer and they have less than an hour in the game... take that with a grain of salt. \n\nFour: The combat is pretty simple but well done. There is a surprising amount of depth to it as well when you start buying and finding more powerful weapons (toys) that can do a variety of things and synergize pretty well together. Enemy variety is pretty good so far, each time you level up it adds more enemy variety to encounter around the map. \n\nFive: dungeons are fairly simple and a good mix of mini puzzles and fun combat encounters. \n\nIf you enjoy roguelike/lite games DEFINITELY give this a spot in your library to see what it has to offer. So far I'd put it 8-9/10 but I don't quite have the amount of time necessary to feel comfortable ranking it against other rogue games. I may edit this once I get to a point to see how much replayability it has but until then I'm eager to keep sending swords into a meat grinder and just adding to my power each time. Please look at how much time people have in a game before rating their reviews and taking their word. .5 hours is not enough time to really warrant a helpful review... nor is 6 in my case but I really don't want this game to be DoA\n\nEdit: Just beat Mormo for the second time.. trust me when i say you can make the timer go on infinitely. I Don't want to spoil anything BUT head to dungeons and kill as many enemies as you can to save up gold and another currency, and make a good loop around each area of the map and you'll find all sorts of neat things. As for bugs, I've had none and I'm at 13 hours of steady play. Don't waste time killing EVERY enemy that's in the open areas cause that will eat too much of your time, but focus on finding dungeons and the hidden npc encounters. I had my timer extended to approx. 8 days in game time and I also found a way to permanently increase the amount of time I have on subsequent runs. Give it a chance, learn how the game works before being upset about the timer.\n- DON'T BUY THIS GAME!\nThis is one of the best games I've ever played. It is quite possibly the best and most detailed Choose-Your-Own-Adventure novel ever written and if you buy it now the creators will receive *NO COMPENSATION* for their work. I am thankful i bought it when I did, while they were still involved, but due to contracting and political differences (ironically fitting for the content of the game) the 2 or 3 writers who pioneered this project were cut out and can't receive royalties anymore.\nThis is a game about the inherent flaws in dogmatic political ideologies, all ideologies including centrism and being a moderate, and it was essentially stolen by capitalists.\nI love this game with all my heart. It is a beautiful story about loss, depression, and finding meaning in a chaotic and absurd reality. Anything more is kinda spoilery so I'm gonna stop myself there. It is all narrated so you dont have to read the enormous amount of text on your own and it is HILARIOUS. Depressing at times but always that spark of humor lingers.\nDON'T BUY THIS GAME. And *DEFINITELY* don't *PIRATE THIS GAME*. Even though it is totally in line with the messaging of the game, would be a HUGE middle finger to the corporation that cut the writers out of their own creation, and is super easy to do with like an an hour of searching Reddit or something, *YOU SHOULD* not *PIRATE THIS OUTSTANDING GAME*. Thank you for reading this, I hope you do the right thing, and you should totally hit on that girl at the beginning she is super into you and there will be no repercussions. Peace.\n- Hi dev, if you were wondering whether anyone would actually use your HDR feature, I am. thanks\n- HAHAHA THIS GAME IS FREAKING PILE OF POOP. 20 FPS. the zombies can go trough walls and cars.  i would just rather buy PoR%n Hub subscription with that money. or i can wipe my own pille of sh/it and give it to someone that needs like like battlefield 2042\n- !!!!READ TO THE BOTTOM OR SCROLL!!!!\n       !!!!69 FREE PACKS + MORE CARDS AND COSMETICS CODES!!\n                        \n I did this for the NEW community:)         \n !!MAKE SURE TO UPVOTE AND OR AWARD SO EVERYONE NEW CAN SEE!!\n\ni have played almost all the MTG online iterations, MTG 2012 2013 2014, DUEL, MTGO, Magic the Gathering Online \nTactics, and now Arena. \nMTG 2012-2014 were fun but they were limited to the cards released those years\nMagic the Gathering Online was cool, you could trade and sell cards, do actual cube and draft with bought packs, but the interface was dated even after the update..\nMagic duels was sold to us as the end all, going forward no new program just duels and they would add sets as they released..(It wasn't, they didn't)\n\nMTG Arena (this one) has done everything they said and they did not abandon it after a few years.

So glad you asked. Yes!\n\nShould this be your very first JRPG? Yes, [i]but...[/i] read on.\n\n*\n\nMy recent gamplay was a 90+hr adventure (some offline) that was well worth the discounted price (-50% = 8€). The game's positive reviews are well-deserved, but tell little of actual gameplay to someone who might be interested in this kind of RPG, but never did play a JRPG/SRPG. \n\nThis was may be your case, too, so here's what I learned... \n\n***** [b] World of Zemuria[/b]: thoughtful, detailed, infinitely rich. (5/5)\n\nFor this installment in the popular franchise we get to adventure in Kingdom of Liberl, discovering a wide-reaching plot and tackling some mysteries. Cliché much?\n\nThis game does not shy away from the overused concepts, but delivers them with fresh spins, and gives them some unexpectedly serious reasoning. Talking to various NPC's, including random household members, paints the game's stage a somber shade of grey - with much emphasis on recently fought war and new orbment technologies available. (You'll be amazed at how many NPCs stress over a family member unable to get or hold a job.) As you march on, you'll learn that beneath all the apparent sweetness lies a serious, compelling narrative. Its logic includes economy, psychology and strategy and favours realism + logic to drive and resolve many conflicts. The overwhelming cuteness and apparent anime-aesthetics serve as a visual counter-point and a fun diversion for the consumer - as ever.\n\nXSEED did a wonderful job on translating and adapting the game. [url=xseedgames.tumblr.com/post/92769039590/xseed-blog-the-legend-of-heroes-trails-in-the]With the problems they faced[/url] and work ahead of them, this needs to be stressed.\n\n[i]Warning for the easily offendable:[/i] This RPG follows the tradition of amalgamating many diverse cultural and historical influences in a distinct blend of East & West. When the Gospel and an Apostle make an appearance, they singify something else from what one might expect. Also, while loved and cared for, children of Liberl do get exposed to real danger. That orphanage you helped? Burnt to the ground. The grand-daughter wanting to help her grandpa? Gets sternly warned, but ultimately joins for an incredibly dangerous infiltration mission to rescue him.\n\n***** [b]Playable characters[/b]: varied, with very flexible builds, require some system mastery. (5/5)\n\nYou get to make a party of up to 4 PCs and as the story goes on, more people join the Bright kids. The Bracer Guild they're a part of provides them with much quest fodder and some plot protection, but ultimately, they're on their own. Their companions are darn well excellent and come in very handy: if you can't fight through an area, wait until your ranks well. Of the 6 available, Schera's and Oliverier's antics made me giggle ever so often, and they are my favourites. In lieu of an old favourite of mine, imagine a game where most of in-game banter has Sands pitted against Neeshkas... You'll love it.\n\nSo what's with the builds? They are limited, but not in a bad way. The character level-ups are automated, abilities are unlocked intermittently and vary greatly (each character has a different build, but no class). You get a pick of 5 equippable items + some slots to fill wil crystals which are more than wondrous items, because they synergize. You may play around for a bit and just pick anything to wear/slot, because there's always a reload/retry or flight from a battle... I've actually made it halfway through the game before I read up on those orbal crystals and made my first optimized builds. \n\nAll in all, the character building is very beginner-friendly, which helps a lot. And there's ample room for experiment, which is great. Strategic value of turn-based combat is best described elsewhere, but let's just say it doesn't disappoint.\n\n[i]Warning for the lazy:[/i] The characters need to be fine-tuned, eventually. Final chapter presents a tournament which requires a higher level of orbal system mastery, while the final battle sequence ranges from enjoyable (if you got the combinations right) to downright enfuriating (if you didn't).\n\n[i]Warning for time-constrained:[/i] Beware the walls of text. Seriously. It's a living book.  It eats players.\n\n[i]Warning for the romantically inclined:[/i] There is much in-game talk about the nature of Joshua and Estelle's growing relationship, yet not one NPC seems to mind the fact that they're officially siblings (Estelle is Cassisus' daughter, and Joshua's his ward/stepson). Which is fine by me, because the two couldn't be more opposed than they are, and their confusion about life & love is delivered tactfully and with much wit. \n\n*** [b] The gameplay [/b]: a rocky ride to get through the story. (3/5)\n\nWhat I didn't miss here was a feeling of game being rushed and some content dropped because of time constraints - something my favourite Western RPGs chronically suffer from. The main narrative is one of adventure, with walls of text hinting at massive spoilers. I enjoyed it immensely, and can't wait for the sequel!\n\nWith that said, there are some glaring issues with gamplay and story presentation. The one thing I did have a problem with were wildly varying secret quests one can discover along the way (you'll need to consult a [url=www.gamefaqs.com/psp/933329-the-legend-of-heroes-trails-in-the-sky/faqs/62079?single=1]guide[/url] to get them). In-game Junior Bracer Journal served me well as an agenda, so that's a plus. \n\n[i]Warning in general:[/i] achievements such as best rank/weapon take a lot of time and effort, so be warned and grab a guide BEFORE starting the game properly. As TvTropes put it, my playthrough suffered a heavy case of Guide Dang It!\n\n[i]Warning for time-constrained:[/i]  I didn't mind all the grinding, but you can't escape it. Especially if you want the best gear the game's got or insist on micro-managing stuff. The difference between starting the Chapter 1 as L14 (my first try) and L18 (the second playthrough I finished) taught me to grind as I save: at every opportunity, as much as I can. And also, the railroading, apparently a traditional facet of the JRPG genre. Finally, hasty decisions versus small time windows. You can miss so much with only a click. I re-did the Prologue because I was merely getting to know the ropes and I missed two books I wanted to collect. The re-run was worth it.\n\n*\n\n[b]TL;DR[/b]: Very good game, with some issues for the uninitiated. Merits a sequel (localization's in the works!) and a second playthrough (especially for achievements).\n\n*\n\nThank you for reading this review. It was my first, and I hope it served you well. =)\n- From my nine year old: \"We like that every screen you can stop and color, and if you don't want to color there is a story part to it. We really like to do both; there are puzzles, different colors and different sections. I would definitely recommend this game for five and up year olds.\"\n- Guys this game is brilliant!!\n\nIf you have the chance and you like nostalgic and engaging exploration and mystery solving, I promise you won't regret buying this one.\nI honestly kept searching for more games like this at Steam and I was not able to find any that were this good.\n\nThe pixelated artwork is >very< detailed.\nI don't know how to describe it, but every scene feels like it's straight out of a framed vintage painting that you'd see in a farm cottage made by the grandfather of the previous owner. It just has this vibe, and I love it.\n\nAll characters are voiced and the VAs did a really great job, especially the main VA. Sarcastic, funny and witty lines are all over, as well as capturing the weight of each life, of their memories, and when they share their stories.\n\nYou won't regret playing this one! Go ahead, and have a great excavation...\nDon't forget: the answer lies in the soil...\n- Falcom's Action RPG Masterpiece.\n\nbest story in the series. it follows the latest adventure of Adol and his companions, stranded in an island and slowly uncovering their secrets. the tight, but well developed cast are absolutely the best written characters in the series. from party member to your fellow castaways all have developed motivation, personality and charm. \n\nalot of the horribad translation and voice acting have been fixed, and it finally got the treatment it deserve as a masterpiece. \n\nthe gameplay is an evolution of the modern Ys game. at its core, ys 8 is an action RPG where you control adol and several other party members with unique set of skills, moveset, weapons and super attack. each character represent an attack type (slash, pierce, smash) that are pitted against various enemies with certain weaknesses. great variety of enemies, amazing boss battles, music and story. \n\non release, there seems to be a big problem for the port, but as far as i know, everything has been patched to very good level of stability. over 70 hours, the game crashed twice (and saved by the intuitive autosave system), run flawlessly 60 FPS and 1440p without a single slowdown. \n\n10/10 game go buy so we get monstrum nox on PC.\n- VIDEO REVIEW: https://youtu.be/DzdF-i2drLs\n\nI loved this game!  It was a worthy prequel to Cthulhu Saves the World!  If you’re a fan of the games from this company I recommend playing it!\n\nIf there is one downside to the game, it’s that it’s very linear. Every game day you just make a selection to the R'lyehtionships options, a cutscene occurs and you get a reward item. Do that for a few in game days than the next level plays. These levels are just as linear as there’s very little deviating. \n\nHowever the rest of the game makes up for that short coming. The R'lyehtionships choices give great replay value, the writing is spot on, and the fighting is just as good.\n\nAlso the addition of a “skip incoming random battle” option was refreshing. \n\nSo overall i say that the game is another Zeboyd games classic that is perfect for the holiday. \n\nPRO\n+Great funny writing as per Zeboyd Games\n+Amazing graphics on par with Cosmic Star Heroine\n+Great music\n+Combat is easy simple and fun\n+Challenging but fair\n+ R'lyehtionships gives clever replay value \n\nCON\n-Game is painfully linear.\n-Very little places to wonder around in gameplay\n-R'lyehtionships causes Uber simplified “quests” to be glorified cutscenes\n-Needs more interactive items in the maps for more funny writing \n\nI’d give the game an 8/10! It’s highly recommend it if you’re a long time fan and it’s worthy a purchase during a sale if you’re unsure.\n- [h1]8/10[/h1]\nThe Long Dark has somewhat stylized graphics, giving it a small pseudo-2D impression that plays very well with warm shades in light and cold shades during dusk also staying outside to scavenge, hunt, fish and get firewood for cooking, heating and melting/boiling snow for drinking water while also tending to your clothes, tools and potential medical conditions isn't easy\n- Dear Dev, \nI love this game, if you're reading reviews, please consider some ideas to make it better:\n-  Level designing: Add more ways to choose, and different endings. Right now SoR4 is flat from A to B, it made me feel down compare to SoR3.\n- Alternate customs, and playable same characters: Floyd is overrated and all my friends want to pick him. Make a game with 4 Floyds running sound fun. Use lifetime score to unlock customs.\n- 2v2 Battle! WHY NOT?\n- Shiva (new), Max (new), Roo, Estel (Badass Woman Cop)\n- Steam trading cards: I know it's not importance, but who doesnt want some badass backgrounds on steam profile?\n- Do NOT buy this game! This game does not even have a minimap/GPS/coordinate system. You will definitely get lost.\nMultiplayer is fully of bug and lags so much.\nDo NOT buy this game!\nDo NOT buy this game!\nDo NOT buy this game!\n\nThis game is so f*** stupid\n- This game taught me about the diversity of cultures that our small little corner of the universe offers.\n\nThen it taught me to hate them all.\n- [b][i]AMID EVIL[/i] is very much [i]Quake[/i] 1 level design in a [i]Hexen[/i]/[i]Heretic[/i] universe.[/b] It's well done. We're a bit spoiled this year with outstanding '90s FPS shooters. Personally, I prefer both [i]Ion Maiden[/i] and [i]DUSK[/i] over this title for the following reasons:\n\n1) I find [i]AMID EVIL[/i] to be a bit generic in terms of theme; the fantasy setting could use a bit more to set it apart.\n\n2) I prefer real or low fantasy weapons/guns over wands and totally high fantasy weapons. Now, don't get it twisted - I appreciate that these high fantasy weapons exist, but yeah, they leave something to be desired. I miss reloading and all of that. \n\n3) The level design in [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is much more 'sprawling' (for lack of a better term) just like the original [i]Quake[/i]. Most levels are indoors in what feels like an underground compound (at the time of writing this review). I personally like the backwoods feel of [i]DUSK[/i], or the dystopian cityscape of [i]Ion Maiden[/i] far more. I want to look up at the sky in most levels.\n\n4) The enemy design is different than the other two games I mention, which is good - but they all mostly have a 'same' kind of feel. The enemies are all super fast, so most of your efforts are focused on running backwards while fending them off. It's fun, but gunplay isn't quite as fun as the other two games for this particular reason.\n\n5) The font and overall menu system definitely feels 'Early Access'. I know the font is being worked on, which is desperately needed. \n\n6) My favorite way to play the game is Endless mode - and I feel like that's a flaw in itself. It's the opposite for me with [i]DUSK[/i]. I want to fall in love with the campaign, but eh, there isn't really any story or anything all that interesting to suck me in. The secrets are super easy to find compared to the other two games, too.\n\n7) No multiplayer. Now, I really don't care about this - but who designs a game in this genre without building this in from the ground up? You know the community is going to whine about this. Questionable design decision to say the least.\n\n[b]Well, it sounds like I just dumped all over the game.[/b] Please don't get me wrong. [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is a welcome addition to the genre. The *great news* is that this is not just some reskin of [i]DUSK[/i] - it certainly is it's own thing. And that's really important. \n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+Fairly polished game for Early Access\n+It's the most modern version of the original [i]Quake[/i] we've seen this year\n+Well optimized\n+Lots of content right now\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-The universe is generic\n-No multiplayer\n-The font is too hard to read\n-Music is nothing to write home about\n-The secrets are easy, and there really aren't all that many of them\n-Weapons could use more 'oomph' to them; also we should be able to use the special ability when we want to as opposed to it autotriggering\n\n[b]I was psyched out of my mind for [i]AMID EVIL[/i] - and while it is certainly good - I think I'll be focused more on [i]DUSK[/i] and [i]Ion Maiden[/i].[/b] Because, let's face it, gaming time is valuable and we can't play everything.\n- (If you're past a certain age, I can just say that this is Take Two Interactive's \"Bureau 13\" game, except actually done WELL. If not, keep reading.)\n\nTechnobabylon was one of the best games I played in 2017 (yeah I know it came out in 2015, shh). Wadjet Eye has done it again with Unavowed, one of the best games I played in 2018 and an amazing capstone to all of their work so far. You can play this game without having played the Blackwell series, but you'll get a little more out of it if you have.\n\nIt's also a rather dark piece of work, with a tone somewhere between Sleepy Hollow (the TV show) and something like Buffy. Your character (whose gender and former profession are chosen by you) gets possessed and goes on a year-long murderfestival rampage across New York City. Eventually the Unavowed, a brave supernatural-evil-fighting duo show up, and with the body back in your own control you sign up to fight evil with them. \n\nAs the game goes on, you recruit more characters in Bioware style, solve mysteries (all of which center around that year of hell your character went through), make Tough Choices and work to make the city a better place. All in absolutely gorgeous 640x480 resolution pixel art. \n\nThere were a couple of puzzles that slowed me down (the word \"LEGS\" is going to cause me to make faces for weeks) but this mostly flowed very smoothly. If you're at all a fan of past Wadjet Eye creations, this game needs to be in your life. If you're not, it's a good starting place, maybe the best starting place except that its quality might spoil you for the rough patches of past games.\n\nThis game contains some gore, some body/existential horror that might be jarring to some, and a lot of swearing.\n- For context, I played it on PC for 77 hours including the post-game content which I presumed to be obligatory to complete. I highly recommend to use a gamepad or other controllers instead of K+M controls because support is bad in the ported version.\n\nNow, to start with: Undernaut: Labyrinth of Yomi is a first person dungeon crawler at first, then a horror game second. To my surprise, the game remarkably managed to show the correct way to set an ominous tone and a gritty narrative of a sick and twisted world with the story pulling-no-punches when it's required which I personally absolutely enjoyed. You, as the main protagonist will be subjected to numerous morally dubious acts to survive under the whims of otherworldly beings whether you want to or not. And adding that, the somber visual style captures perfectly the way the story should be told. And I simply adore the art directions and the representations of the characters in-game such as the Mad King and The Divine Child which I noticed to be quite different from the other characters' design of which heavily came from the Spirit Hunter series artist. Different from the other games, ULoY is a reverse-isekai game where the world takes place in Yomi Ward - Japan during the Showa period. It's a very interesting take on the trope and one I thoroughly enjoyed.\n\nFor the gameplay section, you have the freedom of choice to role-play as either Male or Female MC, as well as choosing a multitude of charming portraits for your subordinates with the ability to add backstories and backgrounds for the full immersion. You have 8 classes to choose from, with each diverging into Specialized and Comprehensive jobs. In my opinion, Experience Inc had done a wonderful job of not overpowering one class to another, instead adding great complimentary skills i.e buffs that lasts until returning to base, withstanding K.O etc. Not to mention, fine-tuning the equipment system such as weapons, armors, and accessories having elements of diversity to effectively and efficiently killing enemies and dungeon-crawling.\n\nBut there are two gameplay elements that I absolutely enjoyed using. The first being the \"Flowers\" mechanic to build ladders, bridges, fast-travelling and much more to progress in-game, connecting shortcuts or finding secrets. It's very interactive and simple in design but contributes extremely well for the overall dungeon puzzles in the game. Next is the \"Switch Boost\" mechanic during battles, allowing you to select 3 wonderful benefits such as \"No skill consumption\", \"Damage halved & HP recovery\", and \"First initiative + raised accuracy and evasion\" to maximize your strategy. There's also the added benefit of speeding through battles if you want to which is a plus for me.\n\nThere's also the \"Talk System\" where you could either Talk, Attack or Use Item to glean information and lore of the game as well as multiple-choices in the dialogues that implies your MC as being money-loving or having a dry sense of humor. Earning money is not a problem in this game, since you will be selling quite a lot of items and junks (which I did) that you could use to upgrade equipment, buy flowers and create items. It's a neat thing to have, that's for sure.\n\nAs for the music direction, there's quite a number of reused tracks from Experience Inc's older games such as from Stranger of Sword City and the Spirit Hunter series which while I appreciate they're being used effectively, I hate that they didn't have much variety and lacking impact in certain areas of the game. Though admittedly, I have found myself quite fond of the Mad King's theme and Kenji Yazawa's \"Namennayo!\" as well as certain bosses and dungeon themes.\n\nSpeaking of variety, the dungeon and enemies designs quality compared to other Experience Inc's DRPGs are somewhat lackluster. Lackluster is an understatement, they really do pales in comparison to Demon's Gaze and SoSC in terms of innovation and atmospheric sense. Whether they have the lack of production values which you could definitely notice since the game doesn't even offer voice-acting or simple battle cries for your party or being simply plain lazy I don't know.\n\nFor the main cast, I'd say they are amazingly done with great personalities, no cap. Hanba is your self-centered supervisor, grounded in nature but kind nonetheless. President Kaori is your money-loving mysterious female supervisor, a very cool one at that. The Divine Child is...your main driving purpose in the entire section of the game, at least from my perspective. Her presence and representations are very emotional, depressing and tragic. Which ties very well with the Mad King with his grand delusional obsession to his dream that makes her life a total suffering. The Cyborg, my personal favorite, is your reality-check being made form. I love them all though, really digging their art styles and backstories.\n\nThough some of their flavor text including the equipment and dialogues hint of their world spiritually connected to Demon's Gaze, SoSc, SoSW and so forth which is a pleasure to know. But ULoY is a standalone game with its own self-contained story, so you don't need to play older titles to understand the plot.\n\nOverall, while I'm happy I got to enjoy this game and invest in its world, I do think Experience Inc should've ported with good K+M support, charge a well-deserved price tag instead of ripping their consumer off as well as implementing prime QOL updates i.e permanent SAVE OPTIONS so I could save and backtracking my choices or place in game, fixing text that's not running their usual lines going outside the text box and adding simple battle cries to your party (like they used to do in past titles).\n\nI paid, played and enjoyed it immensely. ULoY is a game that you should not skip if you're a fan of DRPG since the story is a true gem in this genre, however niche it is. Paying a premium price (60$) for a game that's not triple AAA quality is my way of supporting the devs, but for those interested to play do not follow my example and wait for a sale or something.\n\nOnto my closing thoughts, I truly think Experience Inc. have great potential, and I wish more quality DRPG games from them while maintaining the same dark narrative they are known for. Overall a solid DRPG experience 8.9/10.\n- It is a very good game, some people complain about how there are no checkpoints in levels, but fear not, as they can all be beaten in a couple of minutes, and some people complain about how its repetitive because you need to do everything over and over if you keep dying, but if that happens, its clear you are missing something, so by heading to the IEYTD website, you can see tips for every level (secrets are not included, only how to beat the level itself), and if the tips dont help, after 2 tips you can just choose to reveal the answer, so those negative reviews are no reason to not buy this amazing game, this is the game trilogy i recommend every VR player to play ATLEAST once\n- Okay this is a weird situation. I personally don't like this game all that much, but I do still recommend it nonetheless. That's because despite me not being personally huge on it, I can't deny that it is a very well-crafted game that definitely will give people the experience they want if this is the type of game they're looking for. I, turns out, am not part of the crowd that is targeted for said experience. I just found the whole trial and error stealth RTS style of this game to just not be my cup of tea, but again I can't deny its very well-crafted. I also think the art style and voice acting and story are all very well done as well. So yeah, if you're fond of games of this type, then go for it. I'm sure you won't be disappointed. I, for one, don't think I'm entirely sold on it though.\n\n【グループB】\n- Not For Broadcast is in the simplest of terms, a multi-tasking simulator.\n\nYou sit in a news control room and you have to keep track of multiple things: censoring curse words, switching between cameras, playing ads at the right time, ensuring your broadcast frequency isn't disrupted, as well as keeping an eye out for a bunch of other strange things that appear later in the game.\n\nThis isn't the easiest of games as it requires a good deal of attentiveness. The description isn't joking when they call this \"high-pressure\". You have to rely heavily on both audio and visual cues to make sure your broadcast doesn't get screwed up. As this is the news (and live), there is no rewind or undo button. If you mess up and want to get a good performance grade, you'll need to redo the entire news segment. \nIf you're a perfectionist like me, a 10 min segment can end up turning into an hour of trying to perfect that news segment. As such, I do hope an option to quick save, or at the very least, save and quit, can later be put into the game. It felt rather taxing having to keep an eye on so many things for so long. But as with any game, excellence isn't an art, it's a habit. You'll find yourself turning into a multitasking expert eventually.\n\nThankfully, the actors in the game do a great job of making the experience an entertaining one. There is a good amount of humour written into each broadcast, although I must admit I wasn't quite able to pay attention to all the dialogue, as I was too busy trying to switch to the right cameras whilst ensuring my electricity didn't get cut out. Luckily, the game does have an archive which allows you to playback the broadcasts. Without that, I'd probably be missing out on 70% of what was going on.\n\nThere is also a text narrative, choices matter portion in between news segments. As of now, it feels a little out of place and incomplete, but then again, this is an Early Access review.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that at the time of writing this review, there isn't really any \"propaganda\" aspect to the game yet.\n\nPerformance-wise, the game runs pretty smoothly. I did encounter occasional crashes if I looked left or right and back and forth too quickly, but other than that, the game is pretty much bug-free. Also, this game has my RTX 2070 Super running at rather high temps for some reason. Rather surprising for a game that doesn't appear to have particularly high-end graphics.\n\nAnyway, I'll be looking forward to see what comes next for this game. Definitely worth the buy despite being Early Access.\n- One of the few exceptions of \"dont buy games on Early Access\".\n\nThis game, on early access, has more gameplay value than a lot of games on full access + 5 dlcs.\n\n- From afar, the life of royalty can seem very glamorous: the lavish lifestyle, the royal finery, fancy food and drink. However, the life of a prince can be very difficult and traumatic, when your very birth was a disappointment to the king. \n\nUGLY is the fragmented story of a prince who was considered by his father, the king, to be much too ugly to show his face. Forced to wear a mask and bear his father’s unfair demands, we wake up amongst the ruins of what must have been a rather fantastic palace. \n\nThe main mechanic in UGLY is the magical mirror that the prince receives at the beginning. This mirror allows him to create a reflection of himself within the space that you can switch between. You can place the mirror either vertically or horizontally, allowing you to enter rooms that may be blocked by impassable walls, or reaching platforms high up in hard to reach areas.\n\nThere are several different areas, each locked by a door with a particular coloured gemstone. To progress you must find the special key for each door, and inside clear out all of the rooms by, again, finding keys and unlocking every door. Once you’ve cleared an area, and collected the next coloured-gemstone-key, you will be confronted with that area’s boss. \n\nThe boss battles are extremely fun, and are like a much more intensified puzzle than a “fight”. Some of the puzzle rooms are real mind bogglers, and it will take all of your ingenuity to flip the switch in your brain to maximize the mechanics and figure out all of the puzzles. Each room is different and challenging, and the background design is chalk full of visual storytelling. \n\nFrom drawings and pictures on walls, to very interesting machines, to a whole theatre room where you can tell the little prince used to put on puppet shows for his loving mother and all of his stuffed animals.  The story is a treatise to what can happen to a child who’s tenderness and creativity is stifled by the unseemly and unreasonable demands of a narcissistic parent. The wonderful part is that the story is left up to the player to figure out. \n\nThere are secrets to uncover: hidden films and the prince’s memories to unlock. Every subsequent area adds a new mechanic to work with, or around, to the puzzling (such as pink pant that doesn’t allow you to switch to your reflection, or broken glass that your reflection can actually touch). \n\nThe game is very reminiscent of Braid, and considering how mind-blowing and phenomenal that game was when it was originally released in 2008, it’s fantastic to see another game following in those creative footsteps and create such a stellar experience for gamers everywhere. \n\nI would recommend this game to anyone who likes puzzle games, a challenge, or a heart wrenching story.\n- B4B - 59.99 euro. You recieve:\nBad AI, bad animations, online only*, no mod support, no varying sound cues, music where??, characters with zero personality, tacked on weapon modding with guns that all feel the same, no environmental physics, unfair director (spawning 40 tallboys at start of map)\n(*otherwise no progression)\n\nL4D1 & 2 - 8.19 euro each (often on sale for 1.99-2.99 each). You recieve:\nGreat companion & enemy AI, memorable dialogue (I hate hospitals, grabbing pills), motion capture, great music & cues, overwhelming mod support, all weapons have a purpose and vary nicely, incredibly memorable characters, actually good director, etc etc.\n\nObvious choice.\n- I highly recommend this game for the atmosphere alone. It's worth learning the ins and outs of the combat just to explore the wider world of this game.\n- Alpha, Beta, Finished Product... I hear lots of Blah blah blahs complaining about this game not being out of Alpha after years and years, but it isn't like we've been paying a monthly fee for it.  I paid one time to support this game and I've got years of play out of a product that I enjoy.  There aren't too many games that scratch an itch like this game for me... Open World, completely editable/buildable environment and zombies!  One of my biggest issues with a game that I like is that after I buy it, they release a few DLCs and then move on to their next product.  Alpha, Beta, Finished or Not... the developers have given me years of standing by their product and many updates with new content and mechanics.  For that alone, I love their game!\n\nGraphics: 3 outta 5 graphics, she looks a little dated but they keep updating it... It looks better than it originally did.  There's growth\nReplayability: 5 outta 5\nGameplay:3 outta 5... sometimes she's a little clunky\n\nI definitely still believe that this game is worth buying and that they devs and their product is worth supporting.  Hopefully this is helpful to someone.\n- Pros\n\n- No crates which you can waste your money.\n- You don't pay for the extra maps.\n- Less Russians.\n- Less cheaters.\n- Very alive game (after 16 years).\n- More than 11, 000 active servers (according to Gametracker). \n- You don't need actually PC to play this (you can run it on a Calculator).\n- More mods than games on Steam.\n- You can spray in the game.\n- You can buy MP5.\n- You can use Flashlight and Nightvision.\n- You can choose a character.\n- You can play Assassination mod.\n- You can use Bunnyhop.\n- You can play CSGO MOD.\n\nAnd other stuff I can't remember....\n- [b][u] TL;DR[/u] [/b] Finally finish the fight on PC after 13 years.\n[b][u] Long version: [/u] [/b]\n[h1] Halo Combat Evolved Anniversary: [/h1] The very first halo with remastered visuals but the same gameplay. 20 years old now, the level design can sometimes become repetitive. Especially on the library mission. The remastered visuals look nice but I find that it deviates way too much from the original vision of Bungie. You can switch between the old and new graphics with a press of a button. \nOverall a smooth [b][i] Wort out of 10 with a touch of \"this cave is not a natural formation\".[/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Halo 2 Anniversary: [/h1] The second game in the series and the last one for the PC until 15 years later with the release of MCC. The game has remastered visuals as well as fully CGI remastered cutscenes. The remastered visuals are really well done and true to the original artwork and the CGI cutscenes are top notch with quality that can easily surpass the CGI level of some movies. Same gameplay from 15 years ago but it surprisingly holds up pretty well. I did experience some stuttering on this game ever so often but that could just be my system. Again you can switch between the classic and remastered graphics with the press of a button. Even during cutscenes. Just don't shake the light bulb. \nIn summary, I'd give this game a [b][i] Wort Wort Wort out of 10 with a slight slight tinge of heresy. [/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Halo 3: [/h1] The magnum opus of Bungie and the big final conclusion to the halo trilogy. The port to PC was a decent port (well it better be after 13 years!) with little to no technical issues. I faced a desync issue during co-op play on a specific mission until I locked my framerate to 60 fps. I tried to replicate the issue again later on but I had no luck reproducing it. If only were it so easy.\nThe gameplay is similar but sometimes bigger in scale than halo 2 and holds up well. The visuals have not been remastered for halo 3 but they still look good for what they are. \nI give this game a [b][i] Wort in the Wort out of 10. Wake me when you need me. [/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Halo 3 ODST: [/h1] Halo ODST takes place during the events of Halo 2 and follows a squad of Orbital Drop Shock Troppers that get deployed to New Mombasa. It uses the same engine as Halo 3 and so the fidelity isnt much a leap from Halo 3 but the art style is drastically different and takes on a noir style with washed out colors. Kinda reminds me a little bit of Deus ex Human Revolution tbh. Even more so because of its semi open world/hub design.\nThe PC port is as good as Halo 3 if not better and I didn't face any issues. \nThis is a solid [b][i] how many engineers did you murder before dare asked out of 10. [/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Halo Reach: [/h1] Halo Reach would be the final halo game that would be developed by Bungie. Ironically, this game was the first to release for the MCC on PC and is also chronologically the first in the timeline of the main series. Quite frankly the port was not very good. It had audio issues, visual downgrades and many more problems. However in time, 343 has corrected almost all of these issues and now it is a great port to PC. Reach takes place before the events of Halo Combat Evolved and is a prequel to the entire series. It puts you into the shoes of Noble Six, a member of Noble Team that are tasked to... well I wont spoil everything here. Just know that you're stepping into some shoes the rest of the squad would rather leave unfilled. \nThe artstyle is a grittier and more grim depiction of the halo universe and fits well within the narrative of the game. \nThis game gets a [b][i] pair of gúta out of 10 from me. [/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Halo 4: [/h1] After Bungie stepped down as developers of the halo franchise, the mantle was given to 343 industies to carry on the legacy of Halo. The very first game by 343i came in the form of Halo 4 and would be a direct sequel to the conclusion of the Halo trilogy in Halo 3. \nThe change in team came with it, the change in art style, level design and gameplay loop. I will just call this change \"different\". \nThe port to PC is pretty decent aside from some stuttering I faced during coop play. \nOverall this game is a [b][i] 343 out of 10 unless you get on the bad side of Cortana. [/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Multiplayer, Firefight and Spartan Ops: [/h1]\nEach game has its own multiplayer except for Halo 3 ODST. The multiplayer itself is fun and they have enabled cross-play between platforms making finding matches easier.\nThere are so many multiplayer game modes within each game and covering them all is beyond the scope of this short review. :) \nThere are your traditional TDM, Big Team Battle, Capture the flag and such; but there are also interesting and odd game types which are a good change of pace.\nAs for the multiplayer progression, there is a battlepass system in place where you can unlock various cosmetics such as armor parts, gun skins and vehicle skins for each game.\nThe game is updated with seasons that add more features and cosmetics.\nAlthough the idea of a battlepass may put some of us off, the system is completely free and you dont miss out on previous seasons as they are all accessible indefinitely.\nYou can even pick and choose which seasons to progress in.\nIf you want some co-op within multiplayer, then Halo Reach and Halo 3 ODST have a mode called firefight where you have to fend off wave after wave of enemies with changing modifiers or mutations. \nAn alternative to firefight is Spartan Ops, a game mode exclusive to Halo 4. It is a cooperative campaign(you can solo) where you get to use your customised spartan from multiplayer. Keep in mind that although there is a set narrative here, the quality of production in spartan ops is nowhere near the level as that of the main Halo 4 campaign.\n\nOverall the multiplayer, firefight and spartan ops are solid additions to the already superb collection of 6 campaigns. The only thing missing right now is a custom server browser which I believe is in the works. \nEDIT: They have added in a custom server browser for Halo Reach, Halo: Combat Evolved, Halo 2 and Halo 3! :D\n\n[h1] Forge and Theatre: [/h1] \nForge is where you can fool around with various kinds of halo props and items within maps and make your own creations that you can share with others. It has basically endless content.\nJust a cherry on top over all the other content that you are getting with the collection. Forge is available for Halo 2 anniversary, Halo 3, Halo Reach and Halo 4.\nTheatre mode is exactly what it sounds like. Record clips from the game and play them back later with a free form camera. Perfect for content creation. \n\n[h1] Modding: [/h1]\nAs if there wasn't already so much content in the vanilla game, Halo MCC allows you run the game in anti cheat free mode, where you can install and play community created mods.\nGoes without saying that this will only age like fine wine.\n\n[h1] Well that's it folks: [/h1]\nYou mad lads that made it up to here; thank you for reading the ramblings of a mad man. \nDustin Echoes will forever watch over you.\n- Mysterious, claustrophobic, and psychedelic --- this is undoubtedly the most unorthodox game in The Legend of Heroes series. This game is basically what you get when you put The Legend of Heroes, Shin Megami Tensei and a certain Silent Hill title [i](which I won't specify for a good reason)[/i] into a blender machine. Nonetheless, it is still very much an LoH game at its core, though its semi-fandisc nature holds it back from being as coherent of an overall package as its two predecessors.\n\nI cannot stress this enough: [b][u]If you were a big fan of the previous two games, you will not necessarily like this game; on the other hand, if you didn't hold them in high regard, this game is still worth trying out due to its stark contrast in tone and structure from its predecessors.[/u][/b] There is a good reason this game is named [u][b]\"the 3rd\"[/b][/u] instead of \"Third Chapter\", because it is definitely not a direct continuation of SC (i.e. Trails in the Sky Second Chapter).\n\nIf you want more of the upbeat, kingdom-trotting adventure of the previous two games, you're not going to find it here.\n\nIf you want towns full of vibrant NPCs, you're not going to find it here (at least not in the main story).\n\nIf you want a protagonist who wears their heart on their sleeves and acts like your typical spunky JRPG hero, you're not going to find it here.\n\nThis game is first and foremost [u][b]a gameplay-heavy dungeon crawler[/b][/u], one that is light on (main) story but carries some very heavy themes. The most interesting aspect of the game to me is that [i][b]the protagonist Kevin Graham is not a hero[/b][/i] (which is ironic considering the name of this series). This game is his harrowing personal journey, one in which he doesn't set out to save the world, his homeland, or anyone for that matter.\n\nThere are initially only two playable characters, but more and more join your party at a steady pace throughout the game [b](16 in total)[/b]. Be sure to talk to these characters when you swap them out of your party; they are ironically the only source of \"NPC dialogue\" for the majority of the game, and their dialogue updates after every plot point like in most other Falcom games. You know Falcom has done their NPCs justice in FC&SC when their complete absence here creates an uneasy sense of isolation.\n\nThere are visual-novel-like sidequests (called Memory Doors) which serve to further flesh out the characters and setting of this series, giving all the playable (and some non-playable) characters their own spotlight to shine in. To this day the cast of Trails in the Sky still remains my favorite cast of any RPG, and I have to give a good chunk of the credit to this game's characterization of them.\n\nThese sidequests take up a sizeable chunk of the game, which one might argue distract from the dungeon-crawling main game. Fortunately, they don't expire like in FC&SC and can be accessed at any point in the game before the final dungeon (with convenient fast-travel to boot), effectively enabling the player to pace the game themselves. \n\nWord of warning though, some of these sidequests take on a much darker tone than one would expect: there's a very good reason why the console versions of this game was censored [i](don't worry, the Steam version isn't)[/i]. Please be mentally prepared for the final sidequest you come across in the game, i.e. [spoiler]Star Door 15[/spoiler].\n\nThere is also plenty of foreshadowing for the rest of the series littered throughout the game, some obvious and some very subtle [i](I'm looking at you Mr. N)[/i]. Needless to say, this game gives you lots to think about if you are into the lore of this series, especially if you have played some of the later Trails games.\n\nOh, and did I mention that the soundtrack is widely regarded as the best in the trilogy?\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nTo end on a more critical note, I'd like to elucidate the \"semi-fandisc\" nature of this game:\n\nThere is severe disconnect between the main story and side content, with the latter adding nothing to the former for the most part; the sidequests are more of an anthology of supplementary material for the entire Trails series and are only tenuously tied to the main campaign, which by itself is sparse in story.\n\nThere is also an egregious amount of asset recycling from the previous two games. Although this is mostly justified within the context of the story, it's still vexing and makes the devs look lazy. They had the opportunity to add a lot of interesting new locales, especially those pertaining to Kevin and the church, but they chose not to for the majority of the game. Get ready to traverse through lots of familiar looking areas and dungeons...\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nP.S. Advice for 1st playthrough: If you are here mostly to enjoy the story, don't play on Hard; if you value your sanity as a gamer, don't play on Nightmare. Seriously, don't.\n\nP.S.2 When you first open up the game, don't skip the \"Falcom\" logo animation; just sit back and watch. There's a bit more after that.\n\nP.S.3 If you're really curious as to which Silent Hill title I was comparing this game to, potential spoilers if you are familiar with the SH franchise: [spoiler]Silent Hill 2[/spoiler]. Just how deep the similarities run between these two games, I'll let you find out for yourself.\n\nP.S.4 A bit more on the censorship of this game: Falcom cut out large chunks of the aforementioned final sidequest when porting the 3rd from PC to the Sony consoles (PSP, PS3, and PSVita). They did this in order to keep the age rating consistent across the Sky trilogy; the PC version of the 3rd would undoubtedly have been rated \"M\" had it gone through ESRB. If you need a list of potentially distressing content in this game, feel free to PM me.\n- Playing this game instantly brought back memories of me playing TMNT, Battletoads, Double Dragon, and Streets of Rage, with my little brother on the NES and Sega Genesis in the early 90s. Luckily this game doesn’t feature TMNT’s ridiculous water level or Battletoads' sadistic peed bike level. The graphics are perfect, the controls are great, the soundtrack is awesome (especially the Wu-Tang stage, and the Shredder stage), and the levels and overworld map are fun to navigate. I’ve played through the story mode with all 7 characters and have played through the arcade mode multiple times solo and many times in multiplayer and I’ve enjoyed every bit of it. This game is so much fun.\n\nThere are a few things I wish existed though. I wish there were more playable characters. I wish that you did not lose your 7 character’s progress in story mode when you start a new game. I wish you could see the difficulty level of the online arcade game you are joining. I wish there were cumulative stats you could see for arcade and story mode that showed the number of times you completed a stage, how many enemies you knocked out, objects you’ve destroyed, stage times, combo streaks, times taunted, etc. I wish you could create your own turtle and assigned moves, specials, jumps, taunts, and colors.\n- 69 % of your time you spend walking around the forest, \nblowing in the animal whistle without actually seeing any animals\n\n10 % of your time you spend carefully approaching the animals you have spotted in the far far away distance\n\n1 % of your time you spend aiming, fireing your gun and missing all the significant organs of the animals\n\nThe last 20 % of your time you spend running after the animals you have wounded without ever seeing them again\n\nMost realistic hunting experience ever\n- Deathloop is definitely not your average video game.\n\nYou'll either love it or hate it.\n\nThe first few hours are the weakest. You, as a new player, don't know what to do, what's important and you never keep what you find. Only after completing several mission objectives you get the ability to collect residuum and actually infuse your found items for later use in later loops or after you die. That's why it's always better to just go straight to the objectives and not explore the map at all, otherwise it's just gonna be a big time waste.\n\nAfter you acquire the ability to make permanent items (character and weapon trinkets) which you'll be able to use in future runs and collect some crucial weapons (like silent gun) and abilities ([in-game slabs] like Shift that allows you to teleport short distances) - then the game fully opens up. \n\nReal fun begins after you learn all maps and shortcuts and how to toy with your enemies (but it takes quite a lot of time to get there).\n\nStealth is very easy, the enemy AI is dumb at best. The more trinkets and slabs you get - the more variety in gameplay opens up. \n\nAction is very smooth, Abilities are strong and versatile, that's where this game shines to be honest. \n\nThere are 4 different areas and all of them change depending of the time of the day (morning, noon, afternoon and evening). Depending of the time of the day - some areas become accessible, some become closed, The enemies and items also change their locations and sometimes you'll be able to encounter bosses (in-game they are called visionaries). They are not hard to kill, but it's quite hard to get to them. That's the fun part of this whole game. The more you replay all areas, the more information you'll acquire about visionaries and their behaviour. It's possible to deal with them all without killing a single other enemy.\n\nBut with all that comes the not so fun part - exploration and doing the same thing over and over and over again. It's gonna be hard at first, every area is very detailed and it's really easy to miss a code written on a desk or a wall, A lot of sniffing around is required for clues and multiple times per map. It definitely makes repetition your new best friend.\n\nThere are a lot of puzzles and challenges. If you are not shooting dumb NPCs - you're definitely trying to crack a solution to a puzzle. Sometimes you'll need to visit several maps on the exact time of day at which events occur and find the exact required item or piece of information in order to solve a puzzle. Yeah. It's a big hassle, but that's how this game is and how it functions. If you like puzzles, you'll enjoy Deathloop. But be prepared to use a guide or two for some of them and a lot of patience.\n\nDuring some objectives it's very easy to make mistakes and fail. Several challenges require you to be pixel perfect in execution. Didn't notice that mine placed on a generator? Too bad, you'll gonna have to restart or try in another loop.\n\nI disliked that once you find a new weapon, you have to take it with you and drop one of your 3 weapons. You will never be able to use the dropped one for the rest of the loop. Considering that you'll always find a new toy to play with - your loadout will always be half-baked. It's actually extremely annoying, the same can be said about your slab abilities too (only after you find them all, then the ability upgrades will go straight into your inventory after finishing a level).\n\nAnd of course, there is Julianna. She is your \"buddy\" the whole game and she talks to you at the start of every level and well... she is always trying to kill you. It's fun when she invades and disrupts your chill Groundhogday experience. You can even let other real players invade you as Julianna. Fun, if you like to fill yourself with some adrenaline. Either you kill her, or she kills you and you'll have to start over the whole loop ^^\n\nFunny, but Colt reminded me of Draymond Green from Golden State Warriors. In some instances he looks exactly like him haha.\n\nThere are some AI bugs and the game starts to stutter the longer you play. Kinda strage, but it was for me. Occasionally framerates can go from smooth to choppy quite fast.\n\nDeathloop is a decent game overall. Idea is good, but works much better in movies, because there you don't have to sit through the same routines every single time and you get to the next big reveal a lot quicker. \n\nI think Julianna was a bit underused. Imagine how awesome this game could be if Deahtloop worked similar to The Lost Vikings where you control 3 characters at the same time. She could have had different abilities, different strengths. A duo trying to break the loop! Pretty cool, eh? Anyway, That's just my 2 cents.\n- The EOS stands for End of Service. I am sure someone has fun with this or there wouldn't be a reason to keep bringing it back. Right? The usual Tab Target MMO. I do like that you can teleport to quest givers and mobs instead of the usual auto or manual run. Aside from that there isn't anything modern here.\n- I've been playing this game since it was in Kickstarter! It is the best Story Rich game that I have ever played and the most unique. I have played through maybe 7 times and it's different every time. The ability to replay this game countless times is what makes it such a great game. Tons of questions that change based on the questions you've asked, you see a question that might not be there after you ask another question instead. Every version of this game that I played kept my interest and had me sitting on the edge of my seat waiting for more. I have reached 2 endings so far and I can't wait to see what happens next. The Developers are great, I can't wait to see what they create next.\n- This game was so much fun but it's borderline unplayable a lot of the time due to no region lock. You get a lot of players from china playing on NA servers and they're basically untouchable due to ping. I genuinely think this game has fantastic game play and the characters and customization are top notch but spawning and dying to untouchable Chinese players every match just ruins the experience no matter how much I try to enjoy it. Not worth until they region lock the game or unless you want maybe a few hours of fun until you run into 我操你妈 every game and die to reasons out of your control.\n- Pros:\n> Decent selection of interior desing elements\n> Uncommon but interesting gameplay idea if you're into interior design and building\n> Fair price for amount of activities you get in base game\n> Gameplay leght\n> Regural updates\n\nCons:\n> You can't change location of windows in the house - some are placed in awkward places thus creating decent rooms becomes difficult\n> Game optimisation is questionable for such graphics  -  with RX vega 56 I barely get 60 fps \n> No replayability on same save file - once you sell property you cannot do it again\n> Once property is sold there's only some screenshots but no actual way to look around again\n> No steam workshop or mods\n\nIdeas for possible future updates:\n> Add floor plan design feature - building and demolishing walls 10 times is frustrating\n> Add ability to build custom houses and change locations of windows\n> Add ability to enter sold properties\n> Increase game performance\n\nDLCs:\n> HGTV DLC adds moderate amount of additional jobs\n> Garden DLC adds alot of activities outside the house but is a bit buggy. In my opinion some features should be in base game\n- An Excelent, well polished shmup(except for one technical fault) with great graphics and music.\n\nNot much to say other than it has fun boss fights with some creative bullet patterns, you have a gauge that fills up and when activated it doubles your fire power, and also you have bombs. If you have bombs and you get hit, you lose all of your bombs instead of just dying straight out, so you essentially have 2 hit points. You have a graze meter as well, meaning that if bullets pass by you it fills that meter up, when it is full, all bullets around you are basically nullified, and any enemy you kill, any bullets it fired at you will also get nullified. When you pass through the nullifeid bullets, it will fill the first gauge I mentioned so you can go ape s**t more often.\n\nIt's fairly simple, but the pace of the game takes a little while to get used to, the speed of your ship releative to the bullets is a little too slow but it's not game breaking. The only major issue is that my controller is not detectable by the game so I have to use joytokey, so I can't make full use of my controllers analog controls.\n- A lot of people's main complaint's seem to be about microtransactions. The game is perfectly playable without spending a dollar other than what you spent on the base game. And it's really not P2W. mostly aesthetic. Dedicated servers would be nice. but I feel they could fix this by better host migration. It is rather annoying when in a 4v4 and the host gets tilt and breaks the match by leaving, losing all the exp earned.\n\nTL;DR people are mad about spending extra money but want dedicated servers for free? =/\n\n*EDIT* after spending a few hours practicing, I now get told to kill myself on a regular basis in duels.\n\n11/10 Git Gud\n- [h1]Press F11 for Fullscreen and know that your inventory has two parts[/h1]\n\n\nThe Steam version seems like an improved version of the mobile version. I got stuck and looked at screenshots and guides and none of them were helpful (I've never played the mobile version just in case you were wondering. A guide I saw mentioned only 5 endings but this version features more than that)\n\nI got over my block when I realized that there were another set of items in my inventory (I didn't notice that it said 1/2 at first)\n\nI haven't finished the game yet though, so I might update my review, but so far, everything looks good!\n- [h1] 8.5/10 [/h1]\n\n[b] Please note that The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles is a very independent entry in the Ace Attorney series in terms of plot. Even if you have not played any of the Ace Attorney titles before, it will not affect your understanding of the game's plot. [/b]\n\nThis courtroom text adventure game in late 19th century Japan and British have a lot of features, even with the previous Ace Attorney works are very different. With the detailed character costumes and backgrounds, the strong sense of history and atmosphere, the majestic music, and excellent characterization, along with the game's detailed 3D character animation, players can experience an unprecedented adventure. In the plot, The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles presents a layer-by-layer, cocooning type of plot development, each chapter of the story is closely linked, and ambiguous, no chapter is meaningless, and in the final unraveling of all the mystery, the feeling of shock and excitement brought to the player is unprecedented in any text adventure game.\n\nThe reviews of The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles tend to be polarized, and not without reason. The progression of the plot brings with it an overwhelming lack of tension in the first and middle stages of the game. The design of many of the cases in the game seems rather undisciplined, neither interesting nor deep... The Great Ace Attorney: Adventure, as the first half of the game, though the development of the subsequent plot paved a lot of ambushes, the design of the plot and puzzles makes it less interesting and often difficult to motivate players to continue playing. The climax of the game comes too late, whether the player can persist to this point is a huge problem. At the same time, the Steam version of the game globally locks 30 frames, and can not set the Japanese voice is also a very huge drawback, and very damaging to the player's gaming experience.\n\nThe quality of The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles is actually not that bad. But this can only be concluded after you have experienced the entire game in its entirety... And I think this is actually the biggest drawback of this game because the ability to keep the player until the climax of the plot is the biggest pain point of this work. If you are very patient, love the Ace Attorney series, and love the suspenseful story of players, then The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles will not let you down. If you do not have any of the above elements, perhaps The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles will not give you a memorable experience.\n- It's hard to recommend Spelunky 2. Not because it is a bad game, but because it can be frustrating. As with most roguelikes, dying means going back to the beginning. In Spelunky however, nothing carries over to future runs. All you get to bring in to your next run is your own experience and knowledge; And when half the things in the game kill you instantly or stunlock you to death, having a great run end in a quick death can be damaging to one's will.\n\nThankfully, your own experiences count a great deal towards your progress. Most hazards and enemies in Spelunky 2 have a very simple and predictable behaviour. But keeping track of everything on the screen is still a challenge. Enemies and traps will also work together (or against each other) and still bring your demise somehow. Either by bumping your helplessly stunned body into other enemies and traps, or enemies having their own flaming corpse launched towards you and your flammable jetpack. It's actually quite funny sometimes. A good deal of entertainment can be had recording your own amazingly nonsensical deaths.\n\nSpelunky 2 improves upon Spelunky HD's gameplay by adding split paths, which allow for more variety and decision-making in your runs while staying true to the feeling and style of previous entries. It also adds a back layer to each level, allowing for more secrets to be kept. After successfully completing your first run, you can try to discover these secrets and find hidden bosses and areas and even different endings!\n\nAnyway, you might enjoy the game if you're a masochist or something.\n- Undoubtedly one of the best if not THE BEST modern video game remaster out there. I will summarize the pros and cons of this remaster into the following:\n\n[b]The Good:[/b]\n\n- Totally seamless transition into the new modern 4K visual from the old classic Win95 at a push of a key\n- Extremely faithful to the original titles (some might say that it is perhaps TOO faithful)\n- Game \"installation\" screen when you first boot up for both Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert is filled with God tier nostalgia \n- New UI with a complete revamp of the sidebar complete with higher quality artwork that totally feels in place\n- Plethora of never-before-seen bonus contents including exclusive missions and cinematic cutscenes for Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert that was only available on certain console platforms\n- You can queue multiple units while in production now\n- New multiplayer features and service is great. Finally you can now play 1v1 ranked and spectate any previous matches that was played including spectating ongoing games in the lobby\n- You can add, remove and create your very own custom music tracks in-game for both Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert however you want\n- All of Frank Klepacki's overly iconic classical and remixed tracks are here including various modern remixed that was composed solely for this remastered collection!!!\n\n[b]The Bad:[/b]\n\n- Minor bugs (though not a real dealbreaker)\n- The gameplay meta among factions/units remains as unbalanced as ever. Kinda of a tradeoff for being too faithful to the original titles\n- Multiplayer is still officially limited to a maximum of 4 players total per map in Tiberium Dawn, while in Red Alert the limit is a maximum of 8 players total\n- FMV cutscenes are all still heavily compressed in SD resolution extracted from the Playstation home console version and further artificially enhanced via AI upscaling due to the fact that the original master footage tapes for both Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert are still yet to be found\n\n[b]The Kinda Ugly:[/b]\n\n- Certain mission on hard difficulty are completely unbalanced. This is already another insult to injury as the AI blatantly cheats when it comes to resource procurement and unit build time. The fault of a clear lack of playtesting\n- Deathloop is definitely not your average video game.\n\nYou'll either love it or hate it.\n\nThe first few hours are the weakest. You, as a new player, don't know what to do, what's important and you never keep what you find. Only after completing several mission objectives you get the ability to collect residuum and actually infuse your found items for later use in later loops or after you die. That's why it's always better to just go straight to the objectives and not explore the map at all, otherwise it's just gonna be a big time waste.\n\nAfter you acquire the ability to make permanent items (character and weapon trinkets) which you'll be able to use in future runs and collect some crucial weapons (like silent gun) and abilities ([in-game slabs] like Shift that allows you to teleport short distances) - then the game fully opens up. \n\nReal fun begins after you learn all maps and shortcuts and how to toy with your enemies (but it takes quite a lot of time to get there).\n\nStealth is very easy, the enemy AI is dumb at best. The more trinkets and slabs you get - the more variety in gameplay opens up. \n\nAction is very smooth, Abilities are strong and versatile, that's where this game shines to be honest. \n\nThere are 4 different areas and all of them change depending of the time of the day (morning, noon, afternoon and evening). Depending of the time of the day - some areas become accessible, some become closed, The enemies and items also change their locations and sometimes you'll be able to encounter bosses (in-game they are called visionaries). They are not hard to kill, but it's quite hard to get to them. That's the fun part of this whole game. The more you replay all areas, the more information you'll acquire about visionaries and their behaviour. It's possible to deal with them all without killing a single other enemy.\n\nBut with all that comes the not so fun part - exploration and doing the same thing over and over and over again. It's gonna be hard at first, every area is very detailed and it's really easy to miss a code written on a desk or a wall, A lot of sniffing around is required for clues and multiple times per map. It definitely makes repetition your new best friend.\n\nThere are a lot of puzzles and challenges. If you are not shooting dumb NPCs - you're definitely trying to crack a solution to a puzzle. Sometimes you'll need to visit several maps on the exact time of day at which events occur and find the exact required item or piece of information in order to solve a puzzle. Yeah. It's a big hassle, but that's how this game is and how it functions. If you like puzzles, you'll enjoy Deathloop. But be prepared to use a guide or two for some of them and a lot of patience.\n\nDuring some objectives it's very easy to make mistakes and fail. Several challenges require you to be pixel perfect in execution. Didn't notice that mine placed on a generator? Too bad, you'll gonna have to restart or try in another loop.\n\nI disliked that once you find a new weapon, you have to take it with you and drop one of your 3 weapons. You will never be able to use the dropped one for the rest of the loop. Considering that you'll always find a new toy to play with - your loadout will always be half-baked. It's actually extremely annoying, the same can be said about your slab abilities too (only after you find them all, then the ability upgrades will go straight into your inventory after finishing a level).\n\nAnd of course, there is Julianna. She is your \"buddy\" the whole game and she talks to you at the start of every level and well... she is always trying to kill you. It's fun when she invades and disrupts your chill Groundhogday experience. You can even let other real players invade you as Julianna. Fun, if you like to fill yourself with some adrenaline. Either you kill her, or she kills you and you'll have to start over the whole loop ^^\n\nFunny, but Colt reminded me of Draymond Green from Golden State Warriors. In some instances he looks exactly like him haha.\n\nThere are some AI bugs and the game starts to stutter the longer you play. Kinda strage, but it was for me. Occasionally framerates can go from smooth to choppy quite fast.\n\nDeathloop is a decent game overall. Idea is good, but works much better in movies, because there you don't have to sit through the same routines every single time and you get to the next big reveal a lot quicker. \n\nI think Julianna was a bit underused. Imagine how awesome this game could be if Deahtloop worked similar to The Lost Vikings where you control 3 characters at the same time. She could have had different abilities, different strengths. A duo trying to break the loop! Pretty cool, eh? Anyway, That's just my 2 cents.\n- From my og demo feedback, not much changed sadly:\n\nOh boy....\n\nI will start with the most glaring issue:\n-It's friggin IMPOSSIBLE to find an online match\n\nNow some other stuff that I found odd or bad:\n-The camera.... oh god.... I get it, it's supposed to \"limit\" the playing area (specially for local gameplay) but it punishes people in first place... that's friggin dumb in a RACING game, also also if you go under other track sometimes you can't see sh*t (the going under other track piece seems to be fixed in the final release)\n\n-The car randomly drives itself ???? (maybe it's the antenna thingy I chose at car selection.... would be good a tooltip or SOMETHING so I know wtf is that about)\n\n-NO CONTROL REBINDING OPTIONS..... in 2023 \n\n-If you \"die\" near a checkpoint, though luck pal you WILL miss the next section too cause you won't respawn in time... that's.... just unfun and dumb.\n\n-The \"shortcut\" option definetly does not work, I intentionally crafted a track with cuts and the game will kill you if you try to do those..... good job devs. (This seems to be fixed or working properly in final release)\n\n-Since I couldn't find an online match EVER, I played only in local lobby or vs AI, now here comes the issue, the \"placing\" round locks everyone to the same \"screen\", there is no zoom, you can get trolled by another player preventing you to move to a place to connect track or hazards, rendering your placement turn void and useless, I don't know if this is intentional or just a downside of playing on local mode, you may have free cam in multi, but alas I couldn't try that. BTW.... WHY THERE IS NO ZOOM OPTION\n\nThe good:\n-The games runs smooth as butter, with everything maxed on my midend rig, good one devs\n\n-The cars seem to be varied and with some gimmicks, alas you have NO TOOLTIPS or info what that possible gimmick may be..... why ?\n\n-The track pieces, hazards and weapons are quite varied and some weird shennanigans are ensured to happen, feels like a Trackmania troll track being build in real time 10/10\n\nThe \"mehhh\":\n\n-The weapons/items some of them are mindbogglingly hard to understand wtf they do, there is a grey metallic ball even that seems to do nothing or I haven't figured out how to use it... again... a tool tip maybe ? a section about weapons/items in the main menu mayhaps ?\n\nAnd that's that, sorry if my writing seems a bit aggresive, I just was kinda hyped about the game and it feels a bit of a let down so far. But, IT HAS POTENTIAL.\n\nSadly, another case of developer with TONS of feedback delivering an undercooked mess. Stay away from it.\n- Ok so let me start off by saying that I absolutely loved the first game in this series. I loved the subtle changes when you compared character interaction throughout the game as you progressed playing non-lethally/lethally. Now I never buy games at launch, I always wait for sales. When I got Dishonored 1 for $2 I was blown away and mad at myself for waiting for such a sale. I would've happily spent more on that game, it was worth it. Now all that said, here we are at Dishonored 2:\n\nPros\n- Mechanics have been vastly improved upon and the gameplay is just so much more fluid. As much as I loved the previous game I can't deny it was somewhat clunky.\n- Customization is so much better! The upgrades are plentiful and the bonecharm crafting system is awesome once you realize what you are doing. It really expands on how many options you really have at your disposal.\n\nCons\n- The difficulty still just isn't there for me. I LOVED that there was a custom difficulty mode, but even making things harder than the 'very hard' difficulty I still completed the game using no powers and never getting detected with relative ease(I did save A LOT obviously). The only things that really present a challenge are the clockwork soldiers, and as the plot of the game makes evident, you really don't encounter those enough to really present a big challenge.\n- The story is weak, plain and simple. It was like you were on a storyboard that used the same format as the previous game. The story, especially the universe and how you were immersed into it, was a big part of the why I loved the first game.\n- How low vs high chaos is handled. It isn't like there are no changes, in fact I was surprised a few times in my 2nd playthrough which I was doing as a hardcore murderer of every man, woman, and child(if there was any) that crossed my path. It just never really changed the dynamic enough like Dishonored 1 did. The way the final mission in the first game played out when comparing no killing playthroughs with bloody ones was VASTLY different right from the start of the mission.\n\nAll in all it wasn't a bad game. I still definitely enjoyed it for being a niche genre game. Just maybe I would have liked the game to stand out more like the first did.\n- I'm a bit torn on giving Guacamelee! Super Turbo Championship Edition (STCE) a thumbs down, but I feel it's important for prospective buyers/players to know that STCE is significantly worse than Guacamelee! Gold Edition. \n\nSTCE brings a number of modifications to Guacamelee, all of which are negative (apart from the 4P support). First, there are two large new areas, both of which serve as filler, breaking the flow of the game while not introducing any new concepts. Arguably the best part of the second area is the new character that serves as a boss, but said boss fight is relatively simple and the character takes focus away from the stronger original cast. Secondly are the combat changes: the \"rebalancing\" of enemies and the Intenso power. Javiar Jaguar, the stand-out boss from the original game, has been nerfed to an absolute pushover. Moreover, the Intenso power is absolutely game breaking, making every combat encounter in the game a joke. That wouldn't be so bad if you could ignore it, but the developers added certain combat encounters where the difficulty goes through the roof if Intenso isn't used (rooms with multiple enemies with white shields, hitstun-immunity, and/or non-dodgable attacks).  These rooms generally feature Intenso-refilling barrels or enemies as well, so the intention is clear. Of course, there's plenty of Intenso to go around even for easier rooms and bosses, trivializing combat entirely. \n\nIn short, STCE is still a good game, but the original release was a GREAT game, without the broken combat \"rebalancing\" and padding. Please buy/play Guacamelee! Gold instead.\n- Damn, deeply devoted developer designed Death's Door.\nDiscover dungeons, divine drama, delightfully depicted Death [b]:D[/b]\nDark daw's daunting duels demand deft digits.\nDynamite deal definitely does deserve desire!\n- We need a 60fps patch ASAP. Having 30fps content on PC in [current year] is not acceptable.\n\nOther than that the game is pretty solid! It looks great, it plays great, the story was good imo, the characters are interesting and the amount of solo content is decent.\n\nHowever, the gear system is not as elaborate as in Mk11 and the microtransations are NOT a welcome sight. Denuvo also has to go. If Harada agreed that the addition of Denuvo in Tekken 7 was a mistake, so should NetherRealm.\nI also don't like that 2 characters that are going to be in the Kombat Pass are already in the game (Ermac and Quan Chi). Just give us these characters and come up with other ones for the KP. This is super greedy and lazy.\nIt's even worse than Sektor and Cyrax in MK11, at least you didn't let us play them, period. this time you decide to not make them playable (even thought they work for the AI) AND sell them at a later date? That's awful.\n\nThe game is good but needs improvement and shouldn't ship with performance issues, 30fps content, microtransactions, Denuvo and greedy DLC tactics. I would put a \"meh\" review if I could because of the negatives but for that reason I have to say \"no\".\n- Like many games in my library, [i]Iconoclasts[/i] has been gathering dust in my backlog for a long time. And, like many games in my library, I should have played this one much, much sooner. \n\nAs my 40ish shared screenshots of this game suggest, the pixel art in this one is fantastic. Each area, set piece, character, or enemy the player comes across was painstakingly crafted to be as visually striking as possible. I don’t normally gush about graphics in games, but some of the scenes in this one will stick with me for a long time. Of course, screenshots don’t do the game justice; one has to see it in motion to really appreciate it.\n\nBut I don’t personally believe that a metroidvania can be carried by its graphical style alone. Luckily, this game was fun as all hell to play! But, while there are a lot of standard metroidvania traits here (exploring, upgrading, backtracking, etc.), I can see how it might not be someone’s cup of tea… This one is extremely puzzle-heavy and story-driven.\n\nIt might be saying a lot about me, but some of the puzzles really twisted my brain into knots. I found them to be very clever, even when finding the solution had me slamming my head against the wall. The few puzzles I felt I needed to google never left me crying “bullshit” – the answer was in front of me all along and I was either too dense or too many beers deep to see it. But the puzzles aren’t just limited to static environmental stuff: every boss is treated like a puzzle, too, making each one unique and memorable. I really loved the way they made me recall and use all the tools at my disposal in order to defeat them.\n\nThen, there’s the story. I was absolutely a fan of the narrative: it was kind of nice to see a game in this genre really dive in and explore the themes it presents instead of delivering them in abstract ways and letting the player piece everything together themselves. In other words, it’s lousy with longwinded characters. On top of that, it has some strong opinions about religion and government. It’s literally the name of the game, after all. So, you know, if a story that critiques theocratic authoritarianism that threatens planetary devastation would get you hot under the collar, you should probably steer clear. \n\nAnyway, as always, if those things didn’t turn you away, this one is absolutely worth your time. I think I’ll end up throwing on my growing list of favorites when I’m done typing this up.\n- The latest S tier Deckbuilder Roguelike, joining the ranks of Slay the Spire and Monster Train for me. I think that's all that really needs to be said.\n\nIt leans heavily into kiss/curse type effects, if you like the ability to manipulate rng and do some busted stuff with your sequencing you will love it. It is more of a thinker on a turn to turn basis than other games of this genre, but if that isn't a turn off then it's a really solid game with some unique characters/mechanics that feel fresh.\n- Her story starts you off in an old looking computer with what looks like Windows 95, or perhaps a previous version. Once there you are presented with a database of footage from a 1990s, where you must piece together what happened.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\nWithout spoiling anything, since this game is all story based, you are revisiting video clips of seven separate interviews trying to piece together what exactly happened. When you start off, you are placed in front the pc with the word “murder” already typed in. With this simple word, you are given, you must, delve deeper into the story, and form your own conclusion as to what happened, but the more you go deeper into the mystery, the more confused you may become; perhaps even discarding your previous assumption many times before coming to a conclusion that does not go against her story.    \n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nThis game is not a conventional game in terms of gameplay. Instead, you are watching videos and finding potential terms that could lead you to more videos which will reveal more as to her past and what, and who was involved in this incident. Some might not like this, so if the idea of an exclusively story based game does not appeal, do not bother. It is an interesting concept, and very captivating if you play it without any distractions, perhaps more interesting if you play it with a friend and try to piece the mystery together (much like I did).\n\n[h1]Verdict: 8.5/10[/h1]\n\nIf you enjoyed this review, or found it helpful, please feel free to follow our curator [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/WeLoveKawaiiNekos#curation]here.[/url]\n- One of the best platformer/Beat-them-up just got upgraded. new attacks, new enemies, new bosses, new levels, new modes, new skins and a graphical improvement, this is really worth getting if you didn't play the original version. if you have the original you get a 66% discount which is good but i still think it should be an optional DLC that sells for 2 Dollars. of course i understand many people won't buy it because they played the original and they shouldn't buy it, but as for me its just that i wanted a reason to replay Guacamelee again so i bought this.\n- \"It has guns, swords, sexy characters, cheesy dialogues, and a whole lot of action. What more do you want?\" somebody posted and is recommending this pile of poo. How about not some random boring braindead splatterfest like this crap? Apparently a good lot of people actually have a need filled with this random gore generator. Should have bought some dinner instead of wasting money on this bollox.\n- The game is a masterpiece, just like the first one. After finishing PoE 1, I immediately started with the second one and I was treated to another marvel of a game. Here are some of my thoughts:\n\nThe Good:\n-Very good main story but the side content is what made this game great\n-Interesting and deep characters, both new ones and some returning from the first game, including companions\n-The story picks up after the events of the first game and is a direct continuation of the first game (just like with Baldur’s Gate 1 and 2)\n-If you still have the savegame-files from the first game, your decisions and consequences from the first game will carry over\n-There is so much lore, if you are into reading and listening to stories\n-A lot of voice-acting\n-A lot of pets you can collect and the equipped one has a small benefit to your party\n-Interesting races and sub-races, each with its own boons and downsides\n-Interesting classes and sub-classes, including the possibility of multi-classes\n-You can retrain your characters\n-You can make a new character to join your party at any time at tavern\n-Item and weapon diversity (including pistols)\n-You have the option to play the game as either turn-based (like divinity original sin) or real time (with game pause, just like Baldur’s Gate)\n-You can sail the seas as a pirate and attack any ship you meet without consequence. The ships on the map will respawn endlessly so you will never run out, which makes them a real great source of income.\n-Besides the ship you are given at the beginning, there are a few others you can buy. Each has its own benefits\n-Ship, crew and sailing require some management, but if you like this sort of stuff you can get real invested in it \n-Exploring the map by ship, if you are into that kind of stuff\n-When engaging other ships, you have a choice between boarding or naval combat\n-Endurance is no longer a thing so you only need to manage your Health during fights. You will like this if you were not a big fan of the Endurance vs Health system from the first game\n-The resting system has improved. Besides taverns, now you can rest anywhere you want as long as you have food\n-No inventory management is necessary. Your inventory is infinite so just pick everything up because sooner or later you might need things like explosives, potions, tools etc.\n-Choice matters, and boy are there a lot of different paths you can choose from\n-Romance options\n-Bounties are fun and offer good experience and money\n-DLCs are a bit shorter than the one from the first game, but they are just as good (will not describe them to avoid spoilers)\n\nThe Bad:\n-Loading screens are too long and too many\n-Just like in the first game, I reached max level at about 2/3 of the game(max level 20) so any experience gathered beyond that was pointless. By the end of the game could have easily reached level 30 if that was a thing\n-Naval combat is scripted, so it might not be as spectacular as you might imagine\n-Exploring islands on foot isn’t so much fun\n-The idea of factions might not be to everyone’s liking\n-After playing for a few hours, the game performance seems to decrease and my pc struggled with running it. Maybe the game has an optimization problem but it’s possibly that this one is on me and the game is fine. This might not be the case for other users.\n\nAdvice:\n-In the beginning of the game, try to reach Neketaka asap and do as many quests there as you can before heading out on your ship exploring the seas\n-Pick everything up. Your inventory space is infinite and you will end up needing diverse items like explosives, traps, tools etc.\n-Always have tools with you: hammer and chisel, prybar, lockpicks, grappling hook. You will really need them from time to time\n-Plundering other ships is a great source of experience, resources and money but be careful not to burn yourself out if you do it for too long\n-If you get stuck on a quest, just do some online research\n-Invest money in your ship and crew as soon as you can\n-Always have a tank and healer in the party\n-Make sure to diversify the skills of your party. It’s always good to have someone with Mechanics, Religion, Athletics or Diplomacy most of all\n-Enchant your items\n-When you get the white/grey colored legendary items, make sure to bind them to the character you equip them on and do the mini-quests inscribed on them to unlock new powers and features\n-Use summons, as they are great for distracting enemies. They can take a lot of hits and also dish it out\n\nMy game experience:\nI played on the classic (normal) difficulty, just like I do with every new game I start, and found the game not very hard but fun. I played the game in real time, because turn-based takes too long. As soon as I got my first ship working, I sailed to Neketaka, found the last companions I knew I wanted on my permanent team (Maia and Pallegina) and just quested away in the city until I had enough money and levels under my belt to start exploring the seas and attack other ships. I never did the scripted naval combat because I was having too much fun boarding the ships and watch my characters fight. My party consisted of my Watcher (Moon Godlike, Chanter, specced in summoning), Eder (because he’s a beast of a tank and has some fun interactions with others), Xoti (gotta have a healer, she’s also fun to have around), Maia Rua (very good ranged DPS and she comes with a pet cause she’s a ranger) and Pallegina, who is an excellent off-tank and support character. Once I took to the seas, I made my fortune by plundering ships, equipped my ship and characters with the best money could buy and then just catered to the different existing factions in the Deadfire, while not loosing sight of my main mission.\n\nI had a great time playing Pillars of Eternity 1 and 2. I consider they offer some great replay value and are great fun if you are into this style of RPG games. If you are a fan of games like the Baldur’s Gate, Icewind Dale, Diablo, Dragon Age, Neverwinter Nights and Divinity Original Sin series, you must try PoE 1 and 2.\nI really hope they make Pillars of Eternity 3.\n\n- I'm seeing a new trend in gaming here: A studio wants to port an oldie but goodie to consoles, so polishes it up a bit, releases the new version on console and gives it as a free upgrade to the PC boys. It benefits everyone, but don't get too excited.\n\nIt's not a stunning remaster, because Mark of the Ninja looked damn good to begin with. To this end, everything only got tweaked a [i]bit[/i]. The backgrounds are a [i]bit[/i] more detailed, the cutscenes are a [i]bit[/i] sharper and more fluid-moving, the lighting effects have a [i]bit[/i] more dynamic range, and the resolution is a [i]bit[/i] better. Less a remaster and more a cleanup. Most of the changes are so subtle and detailed you won't even find them by actively looking for them, but they're there.\n\nIt costs exactly the same as the special edition of the original, and includes the SE content, and if you already own the original's SE, you get the remaster for free. So basically, if you want the full MotN package, there's no reason not to pick this up. I'm just playing through it mostly because Mark of the Ninja is a kickass game with or without 4K. There is no downside to picking this up if you want the base game. Do it.\n- Gone are the days of mindless building and fun. Power grids? Taxes? Intense accounting and counter-intuitive path building. A pre-built zoo for tutorials. I actually felt MORE stressed after playing this game. If you're looking for something to flex that brain, perfect. If you're looking to release the cougars and create chaos, you can do that in sandbox I guess. You could also just not connect power grids correctly. Works like a charm. Honestly who thinks of these things\n- I'll preface this by admitting that it makes sense for so many of the \"helpful\" reviews to be negative; it's good to warn customers of a game they won't enjoy, and The Witness definitely isn't for everybody.  That said, this is among my favorite games, and I was looking forward to The Witness for a very long time, so the fact that it lived up to my expectations says a lot.\n\n(You may find it helpful to know my preferences, so here are some of my other favorites: Fez, Portal, Infinifactory, LIMBO, The Beginner's Guide, and of course, Braid.)\n\nAs other reviewers have pointed out, The Witness isn't \"fun\"; that's not a criticism, it's just an accurate observation.  The Witness is treading unfamiliar territory, but only for a video game: most other artistic mediums have been used to explore themes other than \"fun,\" and it makes sense that this medium can be used similarly.\n\nInsofar as objective criteria exist for judging the quality of a video game, The Witness meets every standard I can think of: the game runs smoothly, the team have been timely about patching bugs, the visuals (gorgeous and stylized) and audio (understated and lacking music) are expertly executed, and the design of the world and puzzles is meticulous (and ambitious).\n\nThe only objective drawbacks I can think of are:\n\n1) The absence of an FOV slider (important for those who suffer from motion-sickness), which the developers have hinted may be added in a future update. UPDATE: this has been added, along with some other configuration options.\n\n2) Some of the puzzles are impossible to solve if you're deaf or color-blind.\n\nFrom what I can tell, The Witness is about making your own observations and forming your own theories about how the game mechanics work (the title of the game is relevant to its content); it's partly about solving puzzles, but more so it's about figuring out what the puzzles even are and how they work in the first place; given that, it's easy to see why The Witness fails to provide players with a clear goal or feedback: that would undermine the core of the game.  Patient curiosity is the best mindset with which to approach The Witness; it's like a piece of cloth with a loose thread: you pull it, and it keeps unraveling, and unraveling, and unraveling...\n\nThe intrigue of The Witness stems from constant and subtle revelations about how the game functions, which tend to overturn your previous theories and force you to let go of your presumptions, all without ever jumping the shark.\n\nThe Witness is slow to get rolling, patiently waiting while you adjust yourself to the mechanics and freely allowing you hold on to your false sense of comprehension.  You might expect a game like this to be eager to shove its paradigm-shifting revelations in your face, but it generally isn't: The Witness makes no effort to divulge its secrets, and when you peel back another layer, you can take comfort in the fact that it's a real accomplishment on your part.\n\nThe island is dense with puzzles (more so than it appears at first), and each of the nearly 700 puzzles (according to the developers) presents its own unique challenge, and a peek into the mechanics of the game (if you're paying attention).  The puzzles are each short, but satisfying and interconnected, so it's easy to leave the game at any time, and they're grouped into areas, where each area explores a particular game mechanic.\n\nBecause you're free to wander the island, you can walk away from one area if you get stuck and try a different one.  I usually had two or three areas I could choose between at any time.  If you try to play through each area, beginning to end, one at a time, I imagine you'll not enjoy yourself very much.  Once you get stuck on a puzzle, rather than continue banging your head against it, I recommend venturing off to find a different one; returning to a puzzle with a fresh palette and new mechanics under your belt may shake something loose.  The puzzles generally shouldn't require guesswork, and all of them are fair.\n\nThere's no narrative in The Witness.  You'll find recordings scattered around the island, which contain quotes from people throughout history, generally on the topics of awareness, discovery, investigation, and the monotheistic concept of a god.\n\nBeing an atheist, some of these fell flat for me, while others less concerned with theism hit hard, and one even had me teary-eyed.  Each one rang with the sort of sincerity that will either move you, or make you very uncomfortable, depending on how it plays against your own life and beliefs.\n\nIf I'm to be honest, I think The Witness has affected me on a personal level: its themes of exploration and discovery, and its quiet faith in your capacity to unravel its mysteries are comforting.  If you're in the mood for some introspection, you'll probably enjoy it as I have.\n- I would give this a mixed rating if I could. \nThe story is told in such a boring way that it's hard to stay invested. You run to one person, listen to a cutscene, or more likely read a cutscene, than go to another person to talk to. Sometimes you fight one guy but mostly it's pretty dull. There is very little gameplay in the overland content and everything plays like a bad visual novel.\n\nAAR, the first MSQ is just one fetch quest after the other with little story in it. Oh there is some story there, but it's not great. The characters are shallow with few expectations, both the supporting cast and villains. \n\nHeavensward, the expansion I got through before my time ran out, is better than ARR but not that enjoyable. There were parts I like (not to give spoilers, it was the part where you go on a “journey”) Sadly, that part of the expansion was far too short. Than the story precedes to shove itself up it’s own ass as it becomes fixated on one part of the lore. [spoiler]I don’t give a damn how the war started! It was a thousand years ago.[/spoiler]\nPro:\n-If you like story, and only story, you will like this game.\n-A lot of content\n-Trial fights. (Good boss fights without the boring part of dungeons)\n\nCons:\n-Little in the way of gameplay outside of dungeons and trials \n-ARR is a slog and not worth reading. Skip as fast as you can and just watch a recap video.\n-dungeons are locked behind the story and not unlocked as you level up.\n-The story is on the lower end of other final fantasy games.\n-Lalafells are in the game. People who play this race are degenerates.\n- A criminally underrated game, I have seldom seen a developer take their original hit which was already almost perfect, and actually manage to improve on it in every way shape and form. You do not need to have played the original to play or enjoy this game. Their stories are completely seperate.\n\nThe game itself is much less linear than its predecessor. The best way I can explain the feeling of going through the environments without referencing Grimrock itself is by saying it felt an awful lot like Myst to me, just with combat. Required puzzles for progression were challenging but not impossible, some of the secret challenges were much more difficult. I admit I used an online guide more than a few times, but it did nothing to diminish my enjoyment of the game. It is immersive, challenging, and satisfying. \n\nThe only drawback I can think of is the difficulty. It feels like you cannot win with any group composition, I suggest no more than 2 of any class or weapon/armor type user. I went with a warrior, two rogues(one range), and a mage, this way you as well makes you unlikely to complete a difficult fight or puzzle and be rewarded with something you cannot use. Combat itself can be challenging as I said, but you will rarely feel like you are simply incapable of winning. There are obvious ways to optimize the way you approach an encounter the second time if you die the first.\n\nBe prepared to immerse yourself, you must pay attention to your surroundings, read and remember notes you find, explore every nook and cranny you can find, and you will be rewarded. Good luck!\n\n- OMG I LOVE THIS SO MUCH!\nFun to control, it runs fine on my potato Laptop\nIts colorful\nits fun\nits amazingly well animated\ni love the map, i love the bosses so far, i love everythign about this,\nlock on aiming with RB is awesome, special weapons, parries, and attacks you buy from the shop ^^ this is \nPURE GOLD\n- This is a review about the port, not the game. The game itself is fantastic. I reference Moguri Mod throughout the review - this is a fan made mod that aims to improve the visual quality of the port.\n\nThe port is a lazy outdated mess:\n- It's lacking visual FX present in the original, such as the mist in the overworld of the Mist Continent. [b]This was fixed in a patch.[/b]\n- There is no way to restore the original font. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- Dialogue is rendered at a static pace, unlike the original. In the original game, lines of dialogue would show up on screen depending on how fast the character was talking. In this port, there is no distinction. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- There are multiple problems with the battle UI:\n-- It takes 40% of the screen. Square Enix patched this in the console versions, but the PC version was never patched. [b]This patch was released on PC in an update on the 6th of August 2020.[/b]\n-- It's rendered at what feels like 15fps, making navigation feel extremely clunky. In the original game, all menus were rendered at either 30fps interpolated or 60fps (don't know which one exactly), which made the browsing very fluid. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- All menus are clunky to browse because of the crippling low framerate. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- It's missing sound effects from the original. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- Despite porting the game to Unity, Square couldn't be bothered to re-write the animation code to speed up battle animations independently of buff/debuff tick timers, arguably the original game's biggest problem. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- The music in this port is a lower sample version of the original. [u]This is fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- The backgrounds clash horribly with the new character models. [u]This is fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n\nThe ONLY positive of this version is that you can skip the introduction to every battle. Except not really, because the option doesn't work half the time.\n\nThanks to the Moguri Mod, it is arguable that this version comes close to the original. Regardless of my opinion though, I'm not about to praise Square Enix for a port that the fans patched up. Moguri Mod is the only reason to buy this game on Steam.\n- Like many games in my library, [i]Iconoclasts[/i] has been gathering dust in my backlog for a long time. And, like many games in my library, I should have played this one much, much sooner. \n\nAs my 40ish shared screenshots of this game suggest, the pixel art in this one is fantastic. Each area, set piece, character, or enemy the player comes across was painstakingly crafted to be as visually striking as possible. I don’t normally gush about graphics in games, but some of the scenes in this one will stick with me for a long time. Of course, screenshots don’t do the game justice; one has to see it in motion to really appreciate it.\n\nBut I don’t personally believe that a metroidvania can be carried by its graphical style alone. Luckily, this game was fun as all hell to play! But, while there are a lot of standard metroidvania traits here (exploring, upgrading, backtracking, etc.), I can see how it might not be someone’s cup of tea… This one is extremely puzzle-heavy and story-driven.\n\nIt might be saying a lot about me, but some of the puzzles really twisted my brain into knots. I found them to be very clever, even when finding the solution had me slamming my head against the wall. The few puzzles I felt I needed to google never left me crying “bullshit” – the answer was in front of me all along and I was either too dense or too many beers deep to see it. But the puzzles aren’t just limited to static environmental stuff: every boss is treated like a puzzle, too, making each one unique and memorable. I really loved the way they made me recall and use all the tools at my disposal in order to defeat them.\n\nThen, there’s the story. I was absolutely a fan of the narrative: it was kind of nice to see a game in this genre really dive in and explore the themes it presents instead of delivering them in abstract ways and letting the player piece everything together themselves. In other words, it’s lousy with longwinded characters. On top of that, it has some strong opinions about religion and government. It’s literally the name of the game, after all. So, you know, if a story that critiques theocratic authoritarianism that threatens planetary devastation would get you hot under the collar, you should probably steer clear. \n\nAnyway, as always, if those things didn’t turn you away, this one is absolutely worth your time. I think I’ll end up throwing on my growing list of favorites when I’m done typing this up.\n- Playing this game for the first time six years after its initial release proved to be a delight in disguise. With all the memes and jokes established, I was finally able to understand what the fuss was all about back in 2011. Despite not having the best gameplay, story or graphics out there, something about this title just made me want to finish every quest I deemed worth completing. \n\n9/10 - mods recommended\n- First thing you see when the game loads is \"You have to buy the game to blahblah\", as i didn't know there was a paid version, i felt betrayed. Anyway,\nSorry, i tried it, not expecting much, but there was not much from it..\n-Graphics are bad\n-Movement and animation are clunky, same with attacking\n-Zombie AI would hit you even if you walked backwards 2 seconds ago\n-Regions are EU and NA, multiple servers each with a PVE server, but it was so empty.\n-Gameplay-wise.... so many questions like, \"Why do i need to hold E for 5 seconds to open a fridge?\", \"Why does headshot being counted but it doesnt insta-kill a basic zombie?\", \"Why does the soldier npc's look like they are making money from you?\", and lasty \"What the heck is the goal of this game?\"\n-Oh and driving vehicles SUCK! *ehem*\n\nSorry NOPE\n- This review only relates to the single player campaign. At 50 years old I have zero interest in multiplayer.\n\nAfter playing Gears of War 4, I was looking forward to this title. I wasn't disappointed. I found the new upgrade system with Jack enjoyable. The campaign was fun to play with minor exceptions. Graphics, sound, and voice acting were amazing. Campaign took me about 11 hours to beat. I consider that well worth the $60 I paid for the game.\n\nMy only real gripe about the single player campaign:  As a father of 3 girls, I'm all for strong female leading characters. Kait just isn't it, though. I didn't care for her in 4 and that didn't change in 5. For me she seems out of her league and just isn't believable as a team member. She's like Elizabeth Swan, the governor's daughter in Pirates of the Caribbean. She's a kidnapped damsel in distress in one movie, and the Pirate King in the next. It just doesn't work, for me anyway.\n- EDIT: I nominated this game for game of the year (2023)\n\nLong ago I had heard about this game and how detailed and intricate it could be, and how you could spend hours upon hours building the massive empire of dwarves only for it to all come crashing down in some spectacular but unforeseen way.  Then I got into Rimworld briefly and thought it was ok, but it tended toward chaos a bit too much for my liking.  THEN I heard this game was coming to steam and I eagerly awaited it.\n\nIt's not necessarily that I was too good to play a game with mostly ascii/character graphics (I used to play them a lot back in the 1980s).  I was more intimidated by the depth of the game and not knowing if there was a wiki for it (there is) or how I'd find help if I needed it (I'm sure there's a ton of communities JUST for this game).  I expected that when it came to Steam, it'd be beefed up and worth the wait.\n\nWell it finally arrived and I think I'm STILL a bit intimidated by the sheer amount of options you have... mostly because it's not just me that I have to worry about, but a whole community of dwarves.  In the case of something like minecraft, I could dig a whole intricate tunnel and if stuff starts to go bad, I just high-tail it out of there and recover until I can go back and finish it.  In Dwarf Fortress though, if stuff starts to go bad, you can't just leave.  You are encouraged to deal with the adversity and push onward in the name of greatness... or something.\n\nIn a way it's like role playing, except you don't have to roll character sheets and you don't really control any of the characters directly.  You make decisions about where to mine, what trees to chop down, what to build, what to trade, what to plant, and for every thing there is a season (turn turn turn).  You're forced to deal with death, birth, attacks, sickness, madness, and a ton of other things that I have no idea are coming.  \n\nI keep thinking \"I could do better\" and I start a new game, but then I start to realize that no matter what I do, I'm never gonna have a perfect game, or a game where everything goes exactly according to plan.  I am eventually going to have to buckle down and stick to one game save to see it through.\n\nIf you're like me and starting something new holds a lot more interest than continuing an existing project (ADHD?) you may have difficulty with this game.  At the same time you may become so engrossed in it that you lose track of time and suddenly it's 6am and you wonder why you stayed up all night digging holes.  I'm starting to feel a bit of the madness myself.  (it's almost 4:30am as I write this)\n\nIn any case, it's probably not for everyone, but I'd say if you're unsure, find the non-steam version and try that, and if you can grok what's going on and it interests you, definitely buy this and support the developers... OR buy this and try to stay under the 2 hour refund  limit while you learn the basics (Good luck with that, it'll be 6 hours before you know what happened).  I believe this game is worth the money though (full price).  If you were going to wait for a sale you'd be waiting a long time anyway.  \n\nTL;DR If this looks interesting to you, don't wait! Buy now.  If you aren't sure, do a bit of research and come back and buy it.\n- I am a Filthy Casual (tm) who plays games like Mass Effect and Fallout 4 on easy and still die over and over. I got my \"you died\" achievement in Dark Souls 2 before the tutorial and stopped playing after like forty minutes with zero qualms. I have rage quit every single platformer game I have ever touched, and just sort of despise brutally hard things that feel like chores.\n\nBasically, I am not exactly sure why I decided to buy Dead Cells in the first place. Sure, I love the look and one of the few platformers I've ever 100%'d was Super Metroid (with a LOT of swearing and rage quitting), so 'Metroidvania' is an appealing term to me, but it is still inherently marketed as a game that is not for me, or people like me.\n\nThis game is hard. I have 11 hours on it and I can't get past the third area on any given path. I die for stupid reasons and lose all my stuff and... I don't care. I haven't rage quit once; in fact, I have to force myself away from the game after a death so I can do things like eat. I find the combat engaging and entertaining, the progression satisfying and there's something really solid about being forced to start from square one (ish) every single time, in a way I've just never experienced.\n\nSo, sure, buy this if you love hard games/Dark Souls/no checkpoint kind of games. Absolutely, I'm pretty sure you've alreeady heard this is likely to be up your alley.\n\nBut even if you're a dirty rotten casual gamer who button smashes in any game approaching action, and panics when the screen flashes red around the edges... give it a try if you get the opportunity. It is seriously fun.\n- For a company as big as Amazon, this game is extremely sub par. It feels as though it's in Early Access and some of the recent patch notes are very worrying for the game's future\n\nPros:\n- Stunning gfx. Especially for an MMO, the lighting in particular is amazing\n- Sound track is great and ambience adds personality to the zones\n- Some really cool zones to explore, feels as though you can get lost when you start\n- Controls/Keybinds are already really good imo, I only changed a few\n- Tutorial/Starter Quest chains do a great job of introducing you to the game without being too slow\n- Combat (when it works) Is really fun. Lots of action based fights\n- Wars are a really cool mechanic, they are ultimately flawed but are still a lot of fun\n\nCons:\n- Game is extremely shallow. It is borderline addicting for the first few levels, this soon dies off. When (If) You reach lvl 60, you ask yourself what do you do now?\n- As beautiful as the game is, a lot of it is copy and pasted. Literally. There are zones, towns, dungeons that are almost identical. Ruins immersion\n- Quests are extremely repetitive and boring. They consist of kill mobs, loot mobs, loot chests and that’s about it. No diversity\n- Combat can be laggy, you weapon swap and it doesn’t register sometimes. Wars can be a PowerPoint Presentation at times\n- Guild UI is awful. There is no guild bank, treasury ledger so you cannot monitor who donates money for wars etc. Makes running a guild a nightmare\n- There are countless exploits and duplications that have been abused upsetting economies, player numbers and the general integrity of the game\n- Server population has been decimated since launch leading to many dead servers. They’re merging already\n- There are some very worrying patch notes/future releases that are changing fundamental mechanics of the game. In some cases nerfs which punish players who didn’t rush to level cap\n- Watermark is a stupid progression system for gear. It forces you to run daily elite zone farm chains which get extremely repetitive\n\nIf this was a small indie dev company, I could give them the benefit of the doubt. However this is frickin’ Amazon. This product is totally unacceptable and needs to go back in the oven.\n\n- I did everything right[spoiler]and ended up in a relationship.[/spoiler]\n\nAccidently said one tiny lie.\n\nEverything in my life crumbles apart.\n\n11/10 Real Life Simulator\n- As a historical novelist and former high school English teacher with over 700 books in my home devoted to ancient Greek literature, history and culture I had to try this game.\n\nI should mention that I am pushing 60 years old and although I like strategy games like Creative Assembly’s Rome II, I’m not a fan of ‘gopher’ games that make you run around collecting items, rescuing damsels in distress, delivering messages, and murdering politicians to level your character.  The whole premises seems rather tedious and unimaginative.  \n\nSo right from the start I expected to hate Assassin’s Creed Odyssey.  Combine that with the fact that I’d never played an Assassin’s Creed game before, and I am not the most nimble finger clicker, I was prepared to spend a good portion of my playing time getting my head lopped off.  \n\nNone of that happened.  Well, yeah, there is a pretty steep learning curve here.  I did spend a lot of my initial hours zigging when I should have been zagging, and with my opponent’s spear in my head, but I stuck with it and eventually even an old poop like me was able to figure out the mechanics.\n\nWhat kept me going was the sheer majesty of the game and the beauty of the surroundings.  \n\nI’ve been to Athens, Sparta, Argos, Mycenae, Delos, Aegina, Hydra, Crete, Melos (now Santorini), and dozens of other locales on the campaign map multiple times.  I’ve walked around the ruins at Delphi, strolled the docks of Piraeus and walked through valley of Laconia for research for my books.  I wanted to see these places at they might have looked 2,500 years ago and that for me is the true joy of Assassin’s Creed Odyssey.\n\nThe team at Ubisoft deserves a lot of credit.  They did their homework.  Sure, you’d expect to see historical figures like Pericles, Socrates, Alcibiades and Archidamas in a game about the Peloponnesian War.  But that anyone outside of academia even knows who Brasidas, Aspasia, Herodotus and Pausanias were, is impressive.  Kudos to you.\n\nI’m probably an oddball gamer because I was not motivated by stabbing people in the back to gain levels and steal loot.  The entire idea of stabbing people in the back goes against the grain of the Greek ethos of ‘kleos’ or honor.  What kept me going was the desire to see more of the world that Ubisoft created.  \n\nI wanted to visit the Athenian Acropolis and see the Propylaea, Erechtheion and Parthenon as they were shiny and new, instead of in piles of rubble.  I wanted to gaze up at Phidias' statue of Zeus in Olympus (one of the wonders of the ancient Greek world that no longer exists), speak to the Pythia at the temple of Delphi, and see the five villages of Sparta as they might have looked.  Getting to walk the streets of Athens, Argos and Elis was like taking a trip back in time.  Magical.\n\nOkay, the game isn’t perfect.  The pronunciation of common names like Pericles and Socrates and the character’s accents were maddening.  I can only guess that Ubisoft believes we’ve Americanized the real pronunciations, or at least I hope that’s what they were thinking.  Ultimately it’s a minor annoyance.\n\nThe hoplite battles were a major disappointment.  The Greeks fought in a phalanx formation.  Shoulder to shoulder.  Shield to shield.  The battles here are a 300 movie style free for all.  Oh well, guess you can’t have everything.  \n\nAlso I could not fathom how Alexios and Kassandra could be descended from Leonidas, but have no connection to the Agiad royal family.  By rights they should have been Pausanias’ cousins, but they’re not.  I don’t know who they are. The whole Pythagoras-is-my-father thing is rather bizarre and makes no sense at all.  \n\nI won’t go off the charts here listing the historical inaccuracies that drove me batsh!t crazy, as it serves no purpose.  Suffice it to say that I enjoyed the game.  \n\nIf you ever wanted to unravel the labyrinth of the minotaur beneath King Minos palace at Knossos, get drunk and sing songs with Socrates at an Athenian symposium, feel the Aegean Sea roll beneath your feet on the deck of a  trireme, or stare out in wonder at the lights twinkling over Attica at twilight, try this game.  You won’t be disappointed.\n- Finally, a video game that is everything televangelists in the 90’s said that video games were. Exactly what my Christian mother would love to catch me playing.\n\nIt’s like Animal Crossing and Doom\nEternal had a son… as was foretold when they released on the same day.\n\nThis game really makes you FEEL like you’re sacrificing your friends to an almighty force. Would I really just sacrifice 5 of my friends  again for some loot chests? I’m a gamer, of course I would.\n\nI fell in love with the aesthetic of this game instantly. It was brilliant when the gameplay held up to those expectations.  \n\nI loved it. I loved the art. The humor. The theme. The premise. The combat. The cult management. Sacrifices. Collecting the bones of my enemies. The juice visual effects. Most of all I loved feeding my followers bowls of poop.\n\nThe combat is fun but definitely not the meat of the game. Building your cult and just upgrading stuff is quite satisfying.  There's some goofy stuff to laugh at and it's quick and responsive. There’s something about the music that makes you feel relaxed and in terrible danger all at the same time.\n\nThis is not a game that you're gonna put 50-100 hours in either.  Which to me is a big plus.  Most of the runs don't take you more than 15 minutes.  So it's an easy game to pick up and play for a bit and jump back in later. It's like Vampire Survivors in that regard.\n\nIt's basically Animal Crossing with a roguelite twist. I could say it's almost original how those elements were combined.\nIt's great entertainment, all around. You could even say the game is bound to become a cult classic…\n\n10/10\n- I wish there were a \"mixed\" option for recommending this game, as I think for a lot of people out there, this is a fantastic game, and it's definitely well made with a lot of love and attention to detail in many respects. I really like puzzles and problem solving, so part of my disappointment with The Witness is that I really thought I would enjoy the game. Myst was one of my favorite games growing up, and I was extremely excited to see a well-reviewed game in the Myst genre surface after far too long. \n\nThe problem for me was that The Witness is very much a game about the journey, and not the destination. It turns its head on the genre as it's less a game about solving puzzles within a set of rules, and more about discovering what those rules are. And for the most part, it does that well. Instead of the usual game conventions, rewards for solving hard puzzles weren't any kind of story unlock, more just to give you a harder puzzle. That approach was fun for awhile, but some story unlock would've been appreciated, especially because there is so much mystery and it's such an immersive world that was clearly built for a reason and has a fascinating backstory. \n\nSome of the mechanics also just seem arbitrary, or at the very least, not quite obvious enough. Sometimes perspective puzzles require you to either take a screenshot or jot down on pencil and paper the answer, then transfer it on screen. That seems like lazy game design and worst of all, takes you out of the immersive experience. It's possible I'm mostly tone deaf, as some of the sound puzzles seemed almost impossible to me, despite numerous listens. There's also just the repetitiveness of the \"pathfinding\" puzzles, which range from challenging (and satisfying) to punitive in their difficulty spikes. It's in these difficulty spikes where I think the core game mechanic of pathfinding lets you down, as it requires you to be much more of a planner than a \"hands on\" problem solver. In a game like this, I would think it would accommodate multiple approaches, but really there's a right way to approach this game, and a wrong way. Unfortunately for me, I think the way I approach puzzles (trial and error) is strongly discouraged, at times in punitive ways. \n\nThe philosophy from the audio/video portions will likely be appreciated by some, and for some come off as the worst kind of douchey-hipster nonsense. Had they been delivered in shorter pieces, I might've fallen into the former. But as rambling as some of them are, I found them more annoying than enjoyable unfortunately. \n\nI don't know, I'm really torn on this. It's a well made game, and while it seems so open and non-confined, I found the game to be far too linear in mechanics and how to approach problem solving. At times it actually made me feel like a lesser thinker because I have a different approach to puzzles than what the game designer prefers. What I'm sure is a really fun journey for some, left me disappointed with the destination. \n\nAm realizing this reads a lot like an apology for not liking this game, which I think it is. I really, really wanted to love The Witness, but in the end, not only was this game not for me, but I genuinely feel lesser for that fact because I feel like I should have loved it, and just didn't.\n- While I don't necessarily play medieval type games...I thought I should give this game a go...but tbh I was highly disappointed...this game is poorly optimized...full of glitches...poor characterization... terrible voice acting....& terrible facial expressions...only good thing about this game is the detailing of the rats...and some lighting effects...other than that this is just another pathetic excuse of a game.... wouldn't recommend it even on sale...it's a huge let down...tbh...\n- Oh boy. DoDonPachi Resurrection.\nI love this game. Its loads of modes, tight controls, great bullet patterns, and fun gameplay and scoring mechanics make it an awesome shooter. \nThat being said, this game is tough as nails. Even the novice mode is hard as heck and definitely isn't novice-friendly. I reccomend having one or two shmup clears under your belt before you try to tackle DoDonPachi. (Crimzon Clover's novice mode is a good introduction to shmupping) You need some skill to get the maximum amount of enjoyment out of this game.\n\nStill, though, It's awesome! DoDonPachi Resurrection is a very fun experience, even with it's difficulty.\n\n- You can return to character customization whenever you want. Game of the year.\n- getting better in controls, HUD, and resources management balances, unlike Rise TR\nslight improvement in graphics, OST is good though\nseveral 'cool' scenes, creativity has taken a great leap <applause>\ncross over with Assassin's Creed (due to same publisher?)\nLara is getting more and more 'demonic', no hard feelings, its just subliminary messages to the youth by major games coorporation\nI can't believe i can play as Lara Kid instead of Lara Croft :D '+1'\nstoryline is getting ridiculous, come back to earth bruh LOL its good fun\n\ngood luck on your future endeavour devs :)\n- [I received this product for free from a giveaway]. Only played for a short time, but sheesh, it's a bit of a mess both visually and gameplay wise. There's not much I can really say that would differ from what's shown in the trailer (rather crude MS-paint looking drawings with a few short looping backgrounds). You jump when moving right or left, flappy-bird esque, you dodge stuff going across the screen and from the top, which is a bit boring to me, but some may enjoy it more. You also have to go out of the screen to dodge sometimes, but also if you go too far out (who knows how far) you'll die as well. It might be an okay time waster for free (like old flash games), but I wouldn't recommend spending your money on this.\n- 1/10 play time is afk card farming\ncould not even finish one level\ncrashed on me when i just started building stuff every time\ndidn't even make it to seeing the enemy in game ever\n- I appreciate the sincerity of Jusant. You can tell its creators have placed genuine care into their product, which has made the experience of playing it joyful and kind.\nThe visuals are stunning, the mechanics are not overwhelming, the soundtrack is soothing, and the puzzles are not frustrating. A great climbing game all around with an easy-to-follow yet gripping narrative. \nHopefully, Ukrainian localization will also be added soon.\n\n- Overall, there's just too many things about this game that rub me the wrong way.\n\nFirst of all, I definitely like the art, visuals, music, voice acting, and writing. They don't hold your hand when it comes to explaining the story and it forces you to pay attention and also encourages you to try lots of different function combinations so you can learn more about the characters, if you care to.\n\nOther than that, though, there's not much I like. The most important aspect of games to me is whether the gameplay is fun, and honestly transistor's gameplay isn't that much fun for me. Like others have said, not being able to do anything after you pause time and plan out a sequence of moves just sucks. They don't even give you enough mobility to dodge shots. All you can really do is try to get to cover and hide out until your meter replenishes. And if you opt to instead play without using turn (or using turn to pause and think and then unpausing and simply executing your actions manually), you'll probably disappointed by that experience when comparing it to the action oriented gameplay of bastion. One of the worst things, in my opinion, is that you lose access to functions when you lose all your health. Honestly I'd rather just die and restart from checkpoint. I can see that they're trying to encourage you to try different combinations of things, but it still just frustrates me losing the build that I was in the process of learning. And when your options are limited the gameplay just gets more and more boring because you might have to resort to gimmicky tactics depending on what functions you are left with. Overall, it's certainly a unique idea to blend the turn-based with real-time combat, but, in practice, it ends up just not being all that fun to me. I'd rather play a turn based game or an action game. My brain doesn't like switching between the two so rapidly.\n\nI would say get this heavily discounted and play it for the uniqueness and aesthetics. Don't come here expecting something very heavy or that you're going to really want to sink countless hours into or replay. My first playthrough was done in 6 hours and I was glad to be done with it. I have to complement them for not dragging it out or having some frustratingly long and tedious boss fight at the end. If the story went on even an hour longer I might've just gotten sick of it and given up.\n\nIf you're into experience games more along the lines of how you experience art or other aesthetic experiences (and not necesarilly for the thrill of challenge and victory), you should definitely consider this game. There's a lot there to process. I personally don't care much about that sort of thing when it comes to games, though.\n- When I say this game changed the way I thought about life, I mean it. And before you say this game isn't worth 44 dollars, you are wrong. I would pay more than double just for this once in a lifetime experience.\n\nWhile this game may look like a stupid bishoujo romance game, it is so much more. Don't let the weird artstyle or obnoxious eyes fool you, this game will make you laugh. cry, depressed, happy, and everything in between. It is so extensive, so great, that there are over 13 character routes and stories to play in this game, all of which are good (some are incredible) and have some of the best, most fleshed our characters I have seen. This game is about life, change, friends, love, and most importantly, family. Every route in this game has a connection to family. (Clannad is a close-enough translation of family in Irish)\n\nIn case it helps, I'm a grown man who had a rather negative outlook on life, and this game me cry buckets. If you ever have thought about getting married and having kids, this game will MAKE you want to have a family. The clever writing and how the protagonist, Okazaki, changes throughout his life is all done so well. It made me realize how much we complain about our lives, but we don't need much to be happy or be motivated. In case it helps again, my mom loves this game, she connects with it quite a bit. Yet again, nothing bad to say here, only to say that Key is incredible and I will be reading some of their other works like Little Busters and Kanon.\n- Really didn't plan on reviewing, but noticed a lot of people asking if this is worth $15 on sale. Short version - definitely yes. Now onto specifics...\n\nOffline modes are very much improved. Expansion teams for MyGM/MyLeague, with expansion draft of course, and customization options for those are really cool, for example if you're looking to create a legitimate historic team court and things, you can actually get pretty close using just in-game editor. Only bad part is that you can only create 2 custom jerseys (home and away) per team. MyCareer is a vast improvement over last year, specifically due to absence of the Spike Lee story. There's a new \"story\" so to speak, it irks some people, but it's not too bad and you still have control over the entire season. One downside is due to new player archetypes, you're effectively reduced to a role player even when you reach your maximum. Personally I can still hit triple-double average on Hall of Fame difficulty with my primary player, but the new stat caps severely limit the player potential. Ironically, you can't at all play some of the iconic player archetypes such as true all-around, 3 and D, or Dunker/Defensive Specialist.\n\nOnline modes on PC are... disgusting. First off there's a smaller player base, so you're bound to run into some queue times, or a completely dead queue very late in the night. Also, the game is susceptible to cheats, for example, only couple of months ago they blocked one particular cheat from MyTeam auction house, which was blatantly obvious and apparent and had very bad impact on economy. I won't go into details here as I don't want to be seen as advertising cheating, but I think it's very obvious they are weak on the ban hammer side, and the game itself is weak on protection. Also there is the unavoidable server lag for online modes, couple of sources close to the company explained that all servers are in Virginia, US, even the EU or Asian servers.\n\nGameplay is improved over the last year, primary addition being various types of Pick and Roll defenses, you can literally see different teams using different defenses and things like that. However I feel it's important to note that stock difficulty settings are sorely lacking in realism/simulation aspect. They are all very much arcade. However, there are lot of simulation slider settings listed at OperationSports for example, and once you tweak them, the game really shines. Of course, there are still couple of bad animations that can't be completely avoided, but custom sliders help out a lot in this regard. I should note that by default MyCareer doesn't allow custom slider settings, but there's a mod tool that can be used to accomplish this.\n\nGraphics of course you can easily see in any random gameplay video - they are obviously improved over last year(s). One part that sort of falls into this category that is dramatically worse are the replays. About 50% of the time, the replay will use the silly rim camera, and you won't be able to see the play at all.\n\nIn summary, as you can probably tell from the hours I played, I find this to be a great game, not like we really have a choice on PC when it comes to basketball. After thoroughly playing most of the game modes (except Play Now Online & All Star Team-Up), I'd easily recommend this to any basketball fan. However, keep in mind that online modes can be very frustrating, and if that's your primary reason for purchasing, it might be wise to wait and see how 2k18 turns out in that regard.\n- I like the game, but I'd recommend waiting for the full release.\nDon't get me wrong, the game is beautiful and it's got great potential. The problem with it is, mostly, the keybindings. They are incredibly uncomfortable to use and you cannot change them.\nPlus, the dialogues sometimes feel never ending and quite pointless.\n- [H1]At this price point it's hard not to recommend it, but there's a lot -better- bullet hell games out there...[/H1]\n\nDanmaku unlimited as a series is great. Don't get me wrong. It really is. But it suffers the curse of being put in with a field on Steam that is made up of even greater company. Bug Princess by Cave has the brutal difficulty angle sewn up, Ikaruga has the absolute classic angle nailed, Jamestown has the glorious pixel-art sorted. In order to stand out in this genre, you absolutely have to bring something new to the table.\n\nAs good as Danmaku Unlimited is, it does not bring anything new to the table. It brings a lot of -good-, but nothing -new-. The greatest sin here is that if you've played a lot of bullet hells, this is going to feel immensely familiar, and you're going to blast through it fast, nothing is prone to catch you out. At all. Now that may be a plus point, if that's what you're after, but if you're seeking something to change up the formula? Yeeeeee-no.\n\n[H1]So it's the Bullet Hell version of Destiny?[/H1]\n\nMechanically, it works great. You have a ship with a teeny tiny hitbox, same as most \"Eastern\" BHell games, you have anywhere between \"Mildly offensive\" and \"Absolutely terrifying\" levels of hostile fire coming toward you, and you pump out similarly scary levels of fire back, with your only choice generally being \"Do I spam the screen with lots of little beams or do I fire ONE BIG BEAM at something that needs cracking open like a walnut.\"\n\nIt has good Bullet Hell music, albeit not outstanding music, it has good graphics, albeit not outstanding graphics, you see a pattern here? If a game could ever nail what I'd define as the absolute essence of an \"8 out of 10\", this would be it. The problem is there's games out there such as Revolver360 Re:Actor that do -better-.\n\nThe problem is that for all the good it does, it's been beaten to it by other games, maybe not in every field, but in each area I can name at least two or three games that stand above it. The one area it does win out on is bang for the buck. It's kinda hard to argue with this kind of quality at this kind of price point. It's a very, very solid return on investment, particularly if you're a bullet hell fan.\n\n[H1]Closing Thoughts[/H1]\n\nDoes that make this a \"Do not buy\"? Far from it. If you're a fan of bullet hells, chances are you already own it. If you don't, eventually you should, but I'd genuinely suggest you look around first, there's a decent market now on Steam for this genre, and there's more innovative and interesting options around. If however you've already consumed them and you need a fix of something fairly solid and fairly entertaining, then sure, this works, it will scratch the itch quite nicely.\n\nVerdict : [b]Buy, definitely worth grabbing on a sale, if only to put in the \"To do\" list,[/b]\n- Overall its a great hunting game. The base game is good enough on its own to give you an enjoyable experience hunting several varieties of animals. \n\nI feel that some of the best content is in the DLC's. I dont mind the price tag for maps are they are just a large and some of them have a truly diverse animal population. \n\nThe Weapon Packs have some items that really should have been available in the base game (.22 rifle).\nTripod stands, Tents and ATV's are also DLC items that i feel should have been included in the base game. \n\nThe cost for these packs are not huge, and I have bought them, but they really do impact your play in a meaningful way so it is hard not feel like they were left out on purpose. \n\nBeing a former hunter in real life I would say that the realism of it is pretty good. Lung shots and heart shots drop animals quickly and using the right ammo along with good aim greatly influences this. A poor shot will leave you tracking this wounded animal across the map till you sneak up on it again or just give up. \n\nThey have a system called Tru Racks (sumthn like that) that simulates different qualities of animals. So you end up with little bucks, average bucks, and monster bucks. Weight and coloration plays a part in this too. In short every animal has a trophy of some kind and they are varied by what must be some sort of RNG. \n\nAll that having been said, this game can devolve into a shooting gallery were you kill everything on sight as there in no real incentive not to. You get money and experience for every kill you claim and wiping out a heard of deer with your DLC M1 Garand on your DLC Tripod Stand becomes the quickest way to bypass the grind.\n\n It feels like the game starts as a \"hunting sim\" and becomes a \"poaching sim\" once you realize the progression system is going to take a long time to do...\"ethically?\".\n\n\nAgain, this is a game i would recommend, but it is just that, a game. \n\n\n- It's a cute point and click.\nI am salty though that it's tagged \"choices matter\" as they most certainly do not\n- The Witch's House has been my most favorite RPG Maker horror game for years and now I have the remaster which I can buy to directly support the developer. Needless to say how good it is so I will only talk about what is changed and what still remains.\nThe game is still suspenseful and very atmospheric. Some people may worry that the updated graphic and engine may take that away but trust me it is still there and not going anywhere.\nSome sound effects/dialogues have been changed beside the graphic which I am not against it at all. Still very like the remaster.\nThe control is still the same which is as clunky as before when you are not used to. I think the developers know that and decided to not change it so I won't complain. Just say it out for you to know because the game is very old so the control is still there in the past with many other RPG maker games.\nI very like the new graphic and I think they deserve much more compliments for this. However, I like the weird-big-eye Viola model and her less hair skinny portrait more. It look weird and funny at the same time. The new model makes her more beautiful but the portrait makes her kinda fat (at least to me).\nThe new hard mode is.... hard that all I can say without spoiler.\nI don't know whether or not I should calll this a remake but at least it is done better than DSR. And Small indie developers should be supported more. May be \"Ib\" will be remastered some days too if this game is success\nThump Up!\n- SUPER MARIO!......\nsorry  not really :P\nits a platform game yes but nothing like mario\nyou can spend a lot of time in this game and still not master it\nthis is a game thats really good for platform gamers that gt to goodfor mario games\nand a punisher for those who are nt that good in those types of games \nit has lots of humor ad moments that will want to eat yoer fingernaisl to the bones\ni say hell yeah to this game even do it got me mad a few times\n- It has poor simulation of hand skeleton, so you can't use all fingers, benefits of Index Knuckles controller or VR gloves, etc. And, scenario doesn't allow you to do anything, actually, except one straightforward way. Some things are elaborated, but mostly it isn't worth time or money. But I'm rating it as professional developer for VR, sexual content itself is not matter nor interested for me. My advice for game developer is to add more hand tracking features and more scenarios - in this case it can be something better.\n- PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE VENTURING INTO 999!\n\n\n\nI refunded the game thinking they removed so much of the narrative but I was wrong, the game has now 2 different types of screens, the \"ADV screen\" and the \"Novel screen\". Make sure you switch to \"Novel screen\" as soon as you start playing and stay on that screen as the \"ADV screen\" only displays dialogue and NOTHING ELSE, if you stay on this screen you'll miss all the extra bits that can help to figure out certain details that allow you to find all the endings and figure out the entire story top to bottom.\nHappy gaming.\n\nEDIT: @Snivader pointed out my mistake, edited the review.\n\n\n\nExtra small tip to help you through your journey. Take a notepad (or anything you can scribble down onto), and write down key dates / codes / people that you encounter through the game and keep them close while playing the entire trilogy. I can guarantee you that your mind will be blown by the end of the trilogy (provided you can keep up with the weird events that go down in these games).\n- Can we please get an online co-op? My s/o and I both have the game and remote play doesn't work cuz internet connection is too slow. So we can't even play this game that we were super excited to play together. Please update for an online co-op!\n- I pay money for early access\nA lot of bug but developer dont care you feedback just update useless money sea and let player survivel in game without water\n\nNow developer just want reset you save that i play 33hr to build\n\nHowever, New story so fucking soggy \nI have play this game before update can see some timeline \n\nNew update dont care everything you can get in late chapter of the game without vehicle. Just run in and die \n\nStory so confuse if you new plyer and play in this update you will get bad and confuse experience\n\n\nI disappointed to this dev \n\nBut interest in concept of this game\n\nI suggest you to buy when it already full game\n\nDont waste your time in early access with dev who’s not care supporter\n- Beware as you are just looking at the best 4X game that is.\n\nDon't look at my played time here, this game was available for years already from a very unheard of distributor BUT now is available on Steam at last for the people to see it already.\n\nMaybe you are wondering why it costs so much. Well it has 4 expansions build in it already so that's why. But believe me IT'S WORTH IT. If you like 4X games, this is just a must have.\n\nThe cons:\n\n1. The game is not turn based. Everything is done in real time. You can pause the game and speed it up or slow down at your own liking. This may be a + for someone though... \n2. It's not as shiny as some other 4X games so if pretty graphics are what you prefer you may be disappointed.\n3. The game can be demanding even on high end PC's if you run really large galaxy.\n4. Unfriendly UI. If you run huge resolution you will have problems to read the text.\n5. The learning curve... you will spend hours getting into the game. But don't be afraid, huge automation can be set up to help you.\n6. No multiplayer. I don't mind it but maybe you do?\n\nThe Pros:\n\nEverything else. It's the most complex, never ending fun 4X game I have played. Just the way how the AI is done hooked me up. But to make it fair here are some picks for you.\n\n1. Huge amount of races that actually play in character. It's not like in other games where every AI plays the same way but has different stats. Here the AI behaves in the ways how they are described. They play in character like in RPG game.\n2. HUGE galaxies. Trust me you never saw something like this before in other 4x games. Each game can last for dozens of hours if you want.\n3. Set up your game to the last possible thing you can imagine. The start up set up is just incredible.\n4. Automation ... don't like research, or ship design, or diplomacy, or anything else you can imagine? You can automate it. You can focus only on the one thing you like the most!\n5. Pirates ... you can even play as one.\n6. Mods ... do you want 10 more races or to play Star trek 4x? ... You can have it. \n7. Micromanagement ... it can be endless.\n8. The complexity, you can spend hours in design tables that make sense in comparison to Moo3 for example.\n9. Battles, there is very few games that can simulate such large scale engagements over the whole galaxy.\n10. Play it your own way. You can win the game without any battle if you want. On the other side waging wars is FUN.\n\nDo you need to know more? Watch some videos on YouTube from Das24680. He has also full tutorials for those who would need them.\n\n*Update - I have added more Pros as this game deserves it and I have forgot to mention them.\n- Horrible FOV, glitchy looking graphics, everything is blurred even with motion blur off, absolutely no chance of that multiplayer mod, shoddy PC port... Pretty boring and clunky tbh. Don't buy this.\n- Absolutely amazing. PLEASE don't judge this game based on how it looks. You must try it yourself! I thought it would be terrible but a friend convinced me to try it, and I'm glad he did. I haven't had so much fun in a game in a long time.\n- Indie games, second worst games after online free java and others.\n\nPro\n- music\n- pixel art\n\nCon\n- pixel art, too old, get on with times, we have enough of this\n- screen is constantly flickering with lines and colors, like interlacing, very bad,\n     put up a warning for epilepsy\n- incomprehensible story, looked up online because i couldn't understand\n    any of the nonsense and bad font system used\n- one hit death\n- no quicksave or checkpoint system\n- unskipable cutscenes, atrocious\n- annoying point's system pop up and can't see the screen full of enemies\n- too many enemies and autoaiming bots\n- last boss is a luck based win, 50 tries, then looked up for help, 20 more tries, win\n- can't see the whole map or at least realistically forward, the enemy is off screen\n    one shooting you, then from the beginning again, waste of my precious time\n- if enemies leave the building you get stuck and can't continue\n     if you didn't kill them they just flee\n- hit detection and object collision problems\n- no difficulty settings\n\n\n2/10 rating.      \n\nDon't pay more than 1$, i got it in a bundle, what a curse among better games.\n\nGlad i got to end credits, no need for answers and bonus levels, no-no, i had enough\n    of this horrid experience, seven and half hours, 30 minutes fun Max, the rest is a repetitive\n      waste of time, my blood pressure got up from this experience.\n- When reading reviews for this game you'll generally find two camps. There are people who find DW:U incredibly deep and engaging, and there are those who find it incredibly obtuse and frustrating. The problem is they're both right. The game does feature a wealth of features, and you will almost certainly never experience them.\n\nEven for a player like me who is used to impenetrable strategy games like Europa Universalis this was difficult to play. Income see-saws drunkenly from crippling deficit to fabulous surplus and back again depending on what's happening this exact second. Land combat units are jam packed into impossibly tiny UI bars. AI factions have reams of vague, undefined character traits. The encyclopedia technically gives information on everything but is so poorly organized and unsearchable as to verge on useless.\n\nWith time, practice, and a lot of time spent researching on independent websites you can have fun with this game. But for sixty dollars you shouldn't have to, and quite frankly, don't. Find yourself one of the many excellent 4Xs in the store and pass over this ambitious but ultimately flawed gem.\n- This is the best Civilization up to this point, and the DLC just made it even better. I will grant that the with all the add ons it would feel a tad crowded to anyone who hadn't played it before, but you have a crazy amount of options. The game series tagline of \"one more turn\" could not be more applicable.\n\nYou can strive for one of several victories: diplomatic, cultural, technological or domination. Each has its unique challengers to overcome and create a lot of the fun of the game. They are also not necessarily mutually exclusive and after completing one victory, you can go for the others. Each AI opponent has their own personality, and are pretty predictable in how they behave. Any one who has started the game next to Neopoleon or Ghengis Kahn knows they immediately have to have a decent military to repel invasion, while Ghandi will to muscle you out with religion and culture.\n\nThere are some important changes between Civilization IV and V. One of the most notable is that wars are plausible again as you dont constantly lose health in enemy territory and cities are easier to conquer. Additionally, culture doesn't automatically take over neighbor's cities anymore. \n\nThis game is easily worth the money. I'm not entirely sure how it stacks up to Civilization VI, but any game that I log 200+ hours on over a period of years and still haven't come close to doing everything is doing something right. A great game from a great series.\n- 3 things:\n\n-Flatten land\n\n-Click citadel to get warriors\n\n-Click warriors at their warriors\n\nGood job, you've just mastered the entire game.\n\nThe game includes such crazy moments as:\n\n-Flattening land\n\n-Seeing the enemy flatten land\n\n-flattening your land faster\n\n-Clicking trees and rocks since your workers can't do shit\n\n-Clicking your warriors into their town\n\n-Watching your warriors fight their warriors\n\n-Accidentliy Alt+Tabing and having the game get stuck in windowed mode\n\n10/10 Would trust Peter Moloneux and be dissapointed again... apparently.\n\nProtip, send this to someone that loves you and watch them try to pretend that they enjoy it.\n- DO NOT BELIEVE WHAT EVERYONE ELSE IS SAYING. This game is a bloody masterpiece, it just takes the proper skill and knowledge to properly play it. There are proper real life mechanics which are fun as well as true to the real life process of making games. I personally have less than half an hour of experience with this game, showing that this is a captivating game that really draws you in and makes you beg for more. This is one of the games which will definitely be up there for GOTY. winkyface\n- Wait. So you are telling me that I have to purchase this faction as well as US & OBERKOMANDO to play offline VS AI?? WTH is wrong with gaming companies nowadays?\n- Alright. Reviewing a free to play game once again.\n\nThis is a game created by a game lover. RPG lover to be precise. \n\nIt's a very simple Action RPG. The whole game is quite straight forward with minimum amount of puzzle and Mazes. \n\nThere are a few secret chest that's a bit hard to find. \nBut generally it's a very relaxing and non-demanding game.\nThe game itself is very short, 3-4 hours worth but you can possible play longer if you want to.\n\nMusic is basic and okish with no voice acting. (small indie game after all).\n\nThe biggest + for this game are two:\n1. Wonderfully touching story with multiple ending.\n2. Interesting designed boss with 3 different difficulty. \n\nFor some challenge and extra intense action i recommend everyone to beat all 3 boss on hard difficulty.\nThe last one is very hard but just ignore the chaos and act quickly and decisively.\n\nOne extra hint/recommendation i have for everyone is go to keyboard setting and disable sticking key for the final boss.\n(so you have more percision on control when you move around. You want to click up key to move 1 up. To avoid holding up too long and move up 2 square.).\n\nfor Freebie... 9/10.\n\nIf it wasn't free to start i would pay 1-2 dollar for this game and rate is 7/10.\n- My gambling addict friend said if I post a review on this game and it gets 150 likes and 25 Awards that he will buy me a case of beer. So I'm just gonna leave this here\n- EDIT: I nominated this game for game of the year (2023)\n\nLong ago I had heard about this game and how detailed and intricate it could be, and how you could spend hours upon hours building the massive empire of dwarves only for it to all come crashing down in some spectacular but unforeseen way.  Then I got into Rimworld briefly and thought it was ok, but it tended toward chaos a bit too much for my liking.  THEN I heard this game was coming to steam and I eagerly awaited it.\n\nIt's not necessarily that I was too good to play a game with mostly ascii/character graphics (I used to play them a lot back in the 1980s).  I was more intimidated by the depth of the game and not knowing if there was a wiki for it (there is) or how I'd find help if I needed it (I'm sure there's a ton of communities JUST for this game).  I expected that when it came to Steam, it'd be beefed up and worth the wait.\n\nWell it finally arrived and I think I'm STILL a bit intimidated by the sheer amount of options you have... mostly because it's not just me that I have to worry about, but a whole community of dwarves.  In the case of something like minecraft, I could dig a whole intricate tunnel and if stuff starts to go bad, I just high-tail it out of there and recover until I can go back and finish it.  In Dwarf Fortress though, if stuff starts to go bad, you can't just leave.  You are encouraged to deal with the adversity and push onward in the name of greatness... or something.\n\nIn a way it's like role playing, except you don't have to roll character sheets and you don't really control any of the characters directly.  You make decisions about where to mine, what trees to chop down, what to build, what to trade, what to plant, and for every thing there is a season (turn turn turn).  You're forced to deal with death, birth, attacks, sickness, madness, and a ton of other things that I have no idea are coming.  \n\nI keep thinking \"I could do better\" and I start a new game, but then I start to realize that no matter what I do, I'm never gonna have a perfect game, or a game where everything goes exactly according to plan.  I am eventually going to have to buckle down and stick to one game save to see it through.\n\nIf you're like me and starting something new holds a lot more interest than continuing an existing project (ADHD?) you may have difficulty with this game.  At the same time you may become so engrossed in it that you lose track of time and suddenly it's 6am and you wonder why you stayed up all night digging holes.  I'm starting to feel a bit of the madness myself.  (it's almost 4:30am as I write this)\n\nIn any case, it's probably not for everyone, but I'd say if you're unsure, find the non-steam version and try that, and if you can grok what's going on and it interests you, definitely buy this and support the developers... OR buy this and try to stay under the 2 hour refund  limit while you learn the basics (Good luck with that, it'll be 6 hours before you know what happened).  I believe this game is worth the money though (full price).  If you were going to wait for a sale you'd be waiting a long time anyway.  \n\nTL;DR If this looks interesting to you, don't wait! Buy now.  If you aren't sure, do a bit of research and come back and buy it.\n- This game can be great at times but extremely frustrating most of the time. 80% change to hit, miss every time. I can't keep playing a game with so much crappy coding.\n- This game has such a HUGE potential like Stardew Valley in its early days!!\nCollecting stuff, helping people by crafting potions its so rewarding and lovely pls dear developers keep working on it. I BEG YOU! :D\nSure it has some bug right now but even on day one they managed to get some fast fixes and tried their best to make it work for everyone. \nThe controls were a bit tricky in the beginning (used Playstation 5 Controller) but its just a matter of time, its just not the normal controls like in other games.\nThe music was pretty nice and chill and also the animations were super cute, i love watching little Rubrum built his sandcastles over and over again. >3< \n\nOverall a good game, but could become even more better in the future, keep going guys!!\n- Ok so... \n\nFar From Noise is a narrative game in which you play a woman stuck in its car, balancing on the edge of a cliff. \n\nIt's about life, death, nature, purpose, creativity, dreams, stars and badgers. \n\nThe thing about Far From Noise is that it'll ask you something very special, something that we all forget to do nowadays, something that I've forgotten. This game will ask you to take your time. Don't rush things. Sit down and relax as you'll be forced to follow the slow pace of the game, but you'll enjoy it, for sure.\n\nThis game is for you if you come home after a rough day at work. This game is for you if you're searching for a meaning, a purpose in your life. This game is for you if you just want to experiment something new.\n\nBecause Far From Noise is offering you something new. It gives a vibe that is between Firewatch and Life is Strange, but without all the forced action, stress, adrenaline those game wanted to give. Don't misunderstand me, I loved those 2 games, but Far From Noise chose a direction more... pure. It's just you and the nature that evolves around you.\n\nI've finished the game within 90 mins, but I heard they were several endings, so I might as well try to get some more (but the one I've got fully satisfied me, to be honest).\n\nBeing more pragmatic, the art and sound coincide perfectly. The visuals are gorgeous and the musics hit just right where it needs to. You'll be lifted by the compositions as you'll stare into the beautiful sunset, and the dark starry sky.\n\nYou may find it expensive, as the game costs 8$ for one hour and a half of experience, but hey, think about a cinema ticket. Far From Noise is cheaper and the experience you'll live in it is wayyyyy more unique than most of the movies you go see. \n\nI recommend it. Play it. It'll put your mind at ease.\n\n\n\nPS: the main character is one of the most well-written i've seen in video games.\n- Blows every single PFS game of the last decade out of the water, even those shitty D**M games that people who never played FPS games before seems to worship in order to look cool. Smooth and fast gameplay with a lot of variety. Great visuals even on medium/high settings. Story and writing is shit but pretty much on the same level as rest of the Borderlands series with the exception of the Telltale one. Writing has always been the worst part of the series, dont be delusional retards.\n- Just go play it. It's only $20, and you have a 2hr refund limit. You'll love it way before then.\n\n...still here? Quick review. Awesome platformer, hits all the marks in flying colors. Let's compare w Mario Maker, the most similar game to this one:\n\n[edit: Updated to compare to SMM2 instead of 1]\nWhat Mario Maker 2 Does Better\n- Mario\n- Different themes/gameplay physics across multiple mario games\n- Much larger playerbase\n\nWhat Levelhead Does Better\n- Oh my god the search functionality\n    - Search by creator, difficulty, tags, what's popular, etc.\n    - TL;DR you can find the awesome, and avoid the crap\n- Level discovery\n    - Can actively advertise my levels\n    - Get rewarded for playing people's levels\n- $20\n- Dying doesn't take 12 years to respawn\n- Fun, short campaign to slowly unlock more creative tools after seeing how they are used\n- Local Co-op (or online with Parsec)\n- Leaderboards (if you care, I personally don't)\n\nI cannot stress enough how AMAZING it is to not have to suffer through crap levels. The search functionality is soooo good; as a casual player, it is the sole reason I stopped playing Mario Maker 1. Mario Maker 2 is better, but it still falls terribly short. I think the best part is that Levelhead gives people control over the visibility of their levels, as well as incentives to play other peoples, and that is something that SMM2 unfortunately lacks.\n- [i]While the artwork and combat remain enjoyable, the story, writing, and pacing were a major letdown.[/i]  \n\n***\nMINOR SPOILERS BELOW. If you're going to play the game, play before reading.\n***\n\n[b]The mature storylines, hard-hitting decisions, beautiful worldbuilding, and tight writing that made the first two so immersive is not present in this game.[/b] (You'll notice immediately that the writing for the caravan in the capital is [i]particular[/i] trite, awkward to read, and uninteresting.)\n\nUnfortunately, it's not just the writing that's weak. [i]The pacing is off.[/i] Antecedents are confusing, characters you'd expect to speak don't, events that should have been foreshadowed come out of nowhere. More frustrating are the serious character continuity \"errors,\" and arcs that disappear, change, or go nowhere. [i]In short, the events, decisions, and conflict from the previous games do not appear or resolve in a way that was suggested by the previous two[/i].\n\n\nHere's one example. In Banner Saga 2, Fosolt is unexpectedly rescued by Bolverk. [i]\"I have a message for Alette from the dead varl king,\" [/i]he said. That's pretty intriuging! Maybe there's a mystery, an oracle, an item, or just cool information about the Varl and their strange king? Maybe there'll finally be context about the bridge decision!\n\n[i]No! He has nothing interesting to say or add, and then his storyline just gets dropped and forgotten.[/i]\n\nWell, Bolverk's been possessed by Bellower! Gosh, who knows what Bellower will say? In fact, I can't wait to find out what happens to Bellower's body! \n\nWell, actually, Bolver's [i]not[/i] possessed, not really, certainly not like it was implied last game, and Bellower's body -- [i]a primary focus of the first two games[/i] -- isn't mentioned [i]once[/i]\n\nOr how about how they casually mention that Eyvyn is not only the [i]head[/i] of the Valka order, but also that he's had periodic bursts of hereditary madness all along? That's... odd. And it's not presented as an well-thought out [i]reveal[/i] or anything. It's presented matter-of-factly, like they were trying to ret-con in a less interesting story, or were tone deaf.\n\nYou'll notice that all the characters are underutilized and have unfulfilled storylines/tensions. Hakon has hard choices to make; Canary's a little crazy; Yrsa is mysterious; Gil's in love with Alette, etc. Will these build into choices? Reveals? Dependent endings based on choices? Will there be discussions referencing the past? Reflections on travels? Hints of despair?\n\nNo. In mine, Gil was [i]murdered[/i] and no one even bothered to reference it. Canary's situation never comes to a head. You never have to choose between Varls and Humans. Murdering people doesn't make people threaten to leave. Ubin returns randomly as an uber Varl and he's... learned the horseborne's language? Travelled the southlands? In like, a month? In a way that doesn't advance the plot? It's just... weakly done.\n\n\nThere are [i]so many[/i] examples like this, where the stories don't quite fit correctly, where what you picked up on in the early games about the [i]mysteries[/i] and the [i]world[/i] and what made it a [i]vibrant[/i] place were forgotten about by the writers. [b]The result is that it the game plays out in unsatisfying ways, in tenseless scenarios made vapid by watered-down morality, an inability to leverage the situation in fun ways, and low-quality writing, paucity of choice-making, a lack of exploration, lack of plot twists, simplified overworld mechanics -- all culminating in an almost staggeringly one-dimensional and shallow ending.[/b]\n\nThe Banner Saga series was always an experience that was greater than the sum of its part. An [i]experience[/i]. Of being [i]riveted[/i] to the computer, checking the map, worrying over supplies, guessing at mysteries, having my breath taken away at each hill. Unfortunately, that's not the case in this game. \n\n\nGameplay-wise, it's also a bit of a letdown. Combat is fun-ish, but you can make invincible character combinations and the mechanics don't even try to deal with this. There's an interesting new reinforcement mechanic that's not used heavily, and never pushes you like you think the end of the world would. You never really have to split up your forces. There's no novelty. Like maybe using a hero in a battle makes them fatigued, so you have to switch them up? Maybe you can station them different places, making them unusable for combat? Maybe you need to choose eight for a secret mission caravan? Maybe dream sequences? No, nothing like that. \n\nThe overworld gameplay had some changes that never really felt significant. Moreover, quite a bit felt taken away. You can't rest, do training missions, no longer weigh food vs upgrades. One example of all thise tone deafness was Iver's march through the destroyed world was consistently at \"Great Morale!\"\n\nThere didn't seem to be many flavor choices (\"Do we hang the criminals or let them join us?\"), including much less on social themes (\"Should women fight, if it disturbs the traditionally-minded men?\" \"One clan's rowdy, what do we do?\" \"They threaten to leave if so and so isn't banished\"), and less delayed results and fewer significant decisions, including among the game's built-up tensions among the factions. \n\n\nThere's also some cases of development [i]feeling[/i] cheap. Remember opening Banner Saga 2, and feeling that it was [i]fresh[/i], and [i]upgraded[/i]? There's little to make you feel that way here. The artwork is okay, but the environments feel more generic, with less variety, and the surreal landscapes in the darkness aren't especially interesting to look at for long periods of time. Iver is voiced by Bolverk's voice actor, and they sound exactly the same. The new title system is a fun idea, but is visually integrated into the game's menu system with the finesse of a cheap mod. \n\nThere's a moment in the game where the screen goes black for scrolling text and voiceover narration explaining the upcoming mechanic. Um, a character can't explain that? It was similar how the many two second animations are used, not to supplement the story, but to [i]replace[/i] written portions, making you feel unsure about what's going on. And finally, the game's pretty short, without fun combat challenges or interesting newgame+ challenges. \n\n\nWhat's [i]particularly[/i] frustrating is that the game's release date was moved forward four months. I don't know the story why, but I do know that a few more months of polish and story embellishment might have delivered the beautiful, grippingly interactive story we were hoping for. Because this is a watered down version of the previous two in just about every way.\n\nThis negative review is for whatever processes lead to this mediocre finale.\n\n---\n\n[i]Here's a plot that would have made more sense. Zephyr arrives and speaks to you secretly. There's a god that's still alive! Neat, now we'll finally get more story on that. Yay, fun caravan mode, now we need to take longships somewhere interesting!\n\nBut uh-oh! There's a Sundr villain going there as well, with an army of dredge! But at least now we'll finally get more story about the Sundr! \n\nThe god reveals something interesting, talks about Juno, the sun, gives a means to protect the city and help Iver. But when you return to the city, now the king and rugga and the factions have devolved into fighting based on your choices. How are you going to handle this? Which of many possibilities will ascend to the throne? How will you defend the city? And what mystery lies beneath the mountain of the city...\n\nFor Iver's caravan, there should be pockets of dredge villages kept alive by Spellsingers. Now you need to decide to plunder them or not! More stuff to do! Maybe go to the remains of the Varl capital first? Fight warped Valka? Realize deceptions, machinations, corruption, hear stories? Find new characters, have old ones die?\n\nInstead there... wasn't a plot?[/i]\n- Phat beatsies,\nSelf-deprecating humour that gives me self affirmation,\nPanders to my need for nostalgic nods,\nPlays smoothly, and so doesn't leave me stuck for hours helping me to feel like I have higher than average intelligence,\nMesses about with you based on the assumption of previous adventure game experience, which leads to making me go \"heh\" outloud more than three times.\n\nMildly amusing, could use more super space dust.\nPlayed on the \"hard\" difficulty option but activated other options out of curiosity, would recommend it for the extra shenanigans.\n\nIf I had to give it a score 8/10,\nWould pay for the soundtrack, that ear crack is cash money.\n\nA hell of a lot of work was put into this game & I suggest you press \" J \" on as many screens as you can handle to get some insight on the thought process behind this game, the effort and imagination that went into it.\n\nThe missing 2 points:\nfew bugs to work out, ain't no big but in a game where you are going to be thinking \"it's not progressing because I haven't mashed the appropriate non-sensical things together\" it needs to not bug out.\n\nSoundtrack not yet out - nah not actually taking points away from that, it'll be out soon as I understand it, but I need that fix Mr. Shellburger.\n- **DAY 1 REVIEW**\n!!There is no game here yet!! \nCan't get into a server (they aren't full usually empty) \nOnce you manage to make it in you cant gather any resources\nThe game has a harder time running than starfield\nYou can jump and sometimes not get rubber banned back\nThe game looks nothing like the screenshots displayed on the store \n\n\nI will update once they make substantial updates and there is something to talk about\n- If you look past all of the stale \"The Cake Is A Lie\" memes, you have your self a pretty clean cut, innovative experience.

Intense accounting and counter-intuitive path building. A pre-built zoo for tutorials. I actually felt MORE stressed after playing this game.

This isn't a bad thing - the first Dishonored was one of the best stealth-action games of all time - but innovation is too often overlooked in the games industry. DH2 does bring some nuance to the franchise, but new drawbacks are packaged in as well. Put plainly, Dishonored 2 is a game I adore just as much as the original, but there are aspects that certainly left me wishing for better.\n\n[b][u]Plot[/u][/b]\nThe game begins 15 years following Empress Jessamine's assassination, and her daughter, Empress Emily Kaldwin, has ruled the isles since that time. Her father and Lord Protector, Corvo Attano, advises and keeps close watch over her at court. Quickly after Dishonored 2's opening however, the Duke of Serkonos, Luca Abele, comes to Emily's royal tower - bearing a gift. He brings Emily's supposed long lost aunt, Delilah Kaldwin, who then immediately stages a coup in a bid to take the throne. She is successful, and you must escape the city of Dunwall as either Emily or Corvo (more on that later). You then travel to Karnaca, the capital of Serkonos, where you begin a personal crusade to [i]take back what's yours.[/i]\n\n[b][u]Technical Revamp[/u][/b]\nShifting focus for a look at DH2's presentation, the game is gorgeous. There's a hint of the old, comic-book-like aesthetic that was present in the original game, but the graphical fidelity has been greatly improved in this sequel. The textures, lighting, animations, visual effects, and environments are all elegantly rendered. It's easily one of the most beautiful games of 2016. As for the audio; sound effects and voices are realistic, and the OST is as iconic, if not more so than the first game's. Although, when it comes to performance, Dishonored 2 clearly falters. DH2 was a technical mess on launch, and while it runs decently now; some bugs, stutters, and crashes still persist. Overall the presentation is good, but the performance is surely sub-par.\n\n[b][u]Setting & Exploration[/u][/b]\nAs stated earlier, Dishonored 2 is set in Serkonos's city of Karnaca; known as The Jewel of the South. Gone are the dark grays and subdued browns of Dunwall, as Karnaca replaces them with bright, pastel blues and yellows. The metropolis has distinct cultural differences from Dunwall as well, whether it's the widespread use of wind-power over whale oil, or Karnaca's reliance on silver mining to employ its working class. In terms of level design, DH2's stages are much more expansive than anything seen in the first game too. There's lots to explore in every district of Karnaca, especially when verticality and hidden locations are taken into account. There's several routes toward all objectives as well; emphasizing Arkane's \"play your way\" motto. All considered, Dishonored 2's game world is exceedingly well-built.\n\n[b][u]Depth in the Details[/u][/b]\nOne of the most effective ways DH2 differentiates itself from its predecessors is through what I'd call 'structural gimmicks.' To break up the standard pacing, a couple of the game's missions have special set-pieces which can completely turn gameplay convention on its head. An example of this is the 'Clockwork Mansion' on the fourth level. This inventor's home has levers in essentially every chamber that reconfigures a room's layout - such as turning a trophy room into a grand hall. These levers can be used to access new areas or evade enemies, and even reveal traversable spaces behind the walls. It's this degree of imaginative design depth that distinguishes Dishonored 2 from most other games in its genre.\n\n[b][u]Stealth & Combat[/u][/b]\nMoving over to the core gameplay loop, not much has changed from the first game. The stealth and combat are still just as exquisitely implemented as before, with only a couple of refinements. The deviations that come to mind are that drop-assassinations can now be used non-lethally as drop-knockouts, and assassination animations are a much more brutal (but cathartic) spectacle to watch than before. Dishonored 2's central mechanics are near flawless to be sure, but this sequel suffers by adding few new gameplay elements to the mix. Except - well - there is one big feature I've neglected to elaborate on as of yet.\n\n[b][u]Emily [i]or[/i] Corvo[/u][/b]\nIn Dishonored 2, you can play as either Emily Kaldwin, [i]or[/i] Corvo Attano. When Delilah first takes the throne you get a moment to choose one or the other, after which the character you don't pick is turned into a cold, stone statue. Both Emily and Corvo have separate voice actors and personalities, but they share the same goal throughout the game's duration: to save the last of their family, and reclaim the throne for the true Kaldwin heiress. After receiving the mark of The Outsider, Emily and Corvo have different magical abilities too. Where Corvo has blink, Emily has far reach; or where Corvo can stop time, Emily can chain together the lives of her enemies, and kill or incapacitate several people at once. All in all, the decision to allow the player to progress the campaign as either Emily or Corvo was a stroke of brilliance in my estimation.\n\n[b][u]Main Story[/u][/b]\nReturning to the main story - it's another point of criticism for me. There are some magnificent aspects; such as the nostalgic callbacks to events in the first Dishonored or reappearances of some of the original game's best characters, but all considered most of the writing is retreading a beaten path. Just as in Dishonored 1, the game flows from mission to mission where the chief objective is simply to eliminate a key player obstructing your path to the throne. This is perfectly fine from a gameplay perspective, but it can lead to a bit of déjà vu from a narrative outlook. Dishonored 2's writing quality isn't poor, but it doesn't distance itself from the comfortable story-staging of its predecessor, making it feel slightly lazy.\n\n[b][u]A Reactive World[/u][/b]\nOn the other side of the same coin, the narrative reactivity of Dishonored 2's world to your choices is truly admirable. Playing DH2 in high chaos; where you murder many people throughout the game, results in huge environmental storytelling changes compared to low chaos. Here's an example. If you flood the streets of Karnaca red with blood, subsequent levels show you've harmed the city's inhabitants before you even arrive. Citizens’ moods and perceptions will have soured as they become depressed or monstrous in the wake of their crumbling city - causing suicides and murders to spike throughout Karnaca. And corpses bring bloodflies, which further tarnishes The Jewel of the South in a vicious cycle. You can, of course, avoid all this... by showing a whole lot of care in your actions toward others.\n\n[b][u]Conclusion[/u][/b]\nWhen all is said and done, the Dishonored formula is a fantastic one that it's hard to not have fun with. Karnaca is riddled with environmental detail, the stealth mechanics are flawless, combat is devilishly enjoyable, and the game judges you intelligently on your choices. The Dishonored IP is incredibly strong... The tweaks provided are appreciable; I just wish DH2 had made a concerted effort to make it even stronger. But, god-dammit, I enjoyed Dishonored 2 way too much over it's 20+ hour campaign to critique it any longer. Get the game and play it - despite all my pissy complaints, you won't be disappointed.\n\n[h1]Personal Rating: 9/10 - Absolutely Outstanding[/h1]\n- This game is far away in another galaxy from being anything but a 3/10 in my book. \nGame consists of a tack on level system with a few skills, corny jokes that make you cringe, copy paste worlds with sliding on ice, mud, or leaves depending on the world your on with vines to climb certain walls again....depending on the world your on, no dismemberment except on animals and main characters. Further all planets feel the same and after quite a few hours in the game I struggle to continue playing because of the cut and dry gameplay to where you will fight a couple animals, do some very linear parkour, then do a puzzle that will most likely include a sphere that you need to put into said location to unlock a door as such. graphics are eh..and I have to say the battlefront 2 campaign had more thought than this garbage. save your money and don't buy this\n- [b][i]AMID EVIL[/i] is very much [i]Quake[/i] 1 level design in a [i]Hexen[/i]/[i]Heretic[/i] universe.[/b] It's well done. We're a bit spoiled this year with outstanding '90s FPS shooters. Personally, I prefer both [i]Ion Maiden[/i] and [i]DUSK[/i] over this title for the following reasons:\n\n1) I find [i]AMID EVIL[/i] to be a bit generic in terms of theme; the fantasy setting could use a bit more to set it apart.\n\n2) I prefer real or low fantasy weapons/guns over wands and totally high fantasy weapons. Now, don't get it twisted - I appreciate that these high fantasy weapons exist, but yeah, they leave something to be desired. I miss reloading and all of that. \n\n3) The level design in [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is much more 'sprawling' (for lack of a better term) just like the original [i]Quake[/i]. Most levels are indoors in what feels like an underground compound (at the time of writing this review). I personally like the backwoods feel of [i]DUSK[/i], or the dystopian cityscape of [i]Ion Maiden[/i] far more. I want to look up at the sky in most levels.\n\n4) The enemy design is different than the other two games I mention, which is good - but they all mostly have a 'same' kind of feel. The enemies are all super fast, so most of your efforts are focused on running backwards while fending them off. It's fun, but gunplay isn't quite as fun as the other two games for this particular reason.\n\n5) The font and overall menu system definitely feels 'Early Access'. I know the font is being worked on, which is desperately needed. \n\n6) My favorite way to play the game is Endless mode - and I feel like that's a flaw in itself. It's the opposite for me with [i]DUSK[/i]. I want to fall in love with the campaign, but eh, there isn't really any story or anything all that interesting to suck me in. The secrets are super easy to find compared to the other two games, too.\n\n7) No multiplayer. Now, I really don't care about this - but who designs a game in this genre without building this in from the ground up? You know the community is going to whine about this. Questionable design decision to say the least.\n\n[b]Well, it sounds like I just dumped all over the game.[/b] Please don't get me wrong. [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is a welcome addition to the genre. The *great news* is that this is not just some reskin of [i]DUSK[/i] - it certainly is it's own thing. And that's really important. \n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+Fairly polished game for Early Access\n+It's the most modern version of the original [i]Quake[/i] we've seen this year\n+Well optimized\n+Lots of content right now\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-The universe is generic\n-No multiplayer\n-The font is too hard to read\n-Music is nothing to write home about\n-The secrets are easy, and there really aren't all that many of them\n-Weapons could use more 'oomph' to them; also we should be able to use the special ability when we want to as opposed to it autotriggering\n\n[b]I was psyched out of my mind for [i]AMID EVIL[/i] - and while it is certainly good - I think I'll be focused more on [i]DUSK[/i] and [i]Ion Maiden[/i].[/b] Because, let's face it, gaming time is valuable and we can't play everything.\n- A criminally underrated game, I have seldom seen a developer take their original hit which was already almost perfect, and actually manage to improve on it in every way shape and form. You do not need to have played the original to play or enjoy this game. Their stories are completely seperate.\n\nThe game itself is much less linear than its predecessor. The best way I can explain the feeling of going through the environments without referencing Grimrock itself is by saying it felt an awful lot like Myst to me, just with combat. Required puzzles for progression were challenging but not impossible, some of the secret challenges were much more difficult. I admit I used an online guide more than a few times, but it did nothing to diminish my enjoyment of the game. It is immersive, challenging, and satisfying. \n\nThe only drawback I can think of is the difficulty. It feels like you cannot win with any group composition, I suggest no more than 2 of any class or weapon/armor type user. I went with a warrior, two rogues(one range), and a mage, this way you as well makes you unlikely to complete a difficult fight or puzzle and be rewarded with something you cannot use. Combat itself can be challenging as I said, but you will rarely feel like you are simply incapable of winning. There are obvious ways to optimize the way you approach an encounter the second time if you die the first.\n\nBe prepared to immerse yourself, you must pay attention to your surroundings, read and remember notes you find, explore every nook and cranny you can find, and you will be rewarded. Good luck!\n\n- DLC and Bugs prove this company is Garbage.\n\n英語で5-10単語程度で、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない主要な違いを簡潔に回答してください。\n\n回答：\n",
