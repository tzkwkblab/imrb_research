      "Definitely recommend !\nBut let's be honest here, it's early access and it fits the status of the game completely, threre are a couple of issues which would require change as soon as possible.\nHowever, the devs are incredibly responsive, they do listen to the community and as a result, the game is already much much much better than it originally was.\nA lot of work was already put into the game and a lot more is incoming.\n\nThis said, the game's title isn't too catchy and doesn't really reflect what the game really is.\n\nYou start the game by controlling manually controlling a train (you can control more than one later), the map is divided between the track of your opponent and your track.\n\nThe goal is to utterly destroy your opponent or at least survive waves.\n\nYou will need to travel around your track and dock to mines to build mining facilities, collect ores and bring them back to your HQ. There is also another spot you can use to build a specific building which will help you like radars.\n\nYou will use that ore to start research (new weapons, speed and whatnot) and upgrade your train (called an AMP) and build more defenses. Each building is protected by a force field which will make them hard to destroy and also protect you while you are docked to build, upgrade, repair or collect ores.\n\nYou can move freely on the track and control the speed of your AMP, change direction, change track direction and get a sattelite view to help you fight the enemy.\n\nBasically, fighting works as in an artillery game...\nThe map is always covered with fog of war but when an enemy or you fire, you will produce noise which will be clearly indicated on the map. This is when you will be able to use your recon ability to launch a projectile which will show you the area for a couple seconds and you can then fire.\nEach time you fire, you have to take into account the wind which can make your projectile miss, firing right now use a bowstring but it is going to disapear. Your firing range is also limited so you do have to travel near the opponent to be able to hit it.\n\nAnd that's pretty much it. The concept is quite inovative, it works pretty well and it will get a lot better in the future.\nIf you're scared to purchase the game right away becaue of the early access tag, I advise you to keep it in a corner and wait for it to evolve until the development reach a more advanced point because the game is pretty unique and quite beautiful.\nRight now controlling and managing the trains can be a bit tedious and not really easy to master but I think we can trust the devs team to find a solution to the problems.",

      "everyone posting 16 gb ram specs and saying it runs well, lul\n\ni have 8 gigs of ram with a gtx 660 (yep) and a fx-8350 and it runs around 45-60 FPS (i cap it at 60) at High settings. yeah. REALLY well optimized, considering this computer is nearing the end of its life and the visuals are gorgeous.\n\nEDIT: 1080p :)\n\noh, and it's fun too, right.\n\nEdit 2- Actual review\n\nGame is pretty easy. I forget if there was a hard mode, but if there was I picked normal mode, and the game feels like it should be on easy. I've yet to break a sweat on a boss (currently chapter 5), and the only thing stopping me from taking on enemies 10+ higher than me is that the game auto-nerfs your damage if the enemy is too far above you. I've actually found the game very relaxing as a result, because there isn't the frustration of having to redo bosses after getting wiped, so it's not entirely a bad thing. But if you were looking for a challenge in your battles, this isn't your game.\n\nAs for story, it's also fairly basic, and rides off of having a sizeable to-do list as sidequests. Recruiting new citizens, doing major sidequest chains, unlocking new stuff, it's got a good amount to do in-game to keep you occupied, unless you're a \"main quest line only\" player. It helps that the warp system is easy to use (and you will use it often) and the game is gorgeous, so you don't really feel too bored doing the same shet over and over again. \n\nThere are several elements to the gameplay. \n\nOne, the overworld traversing. Overall, I'm ambivalent to it. It can feel slightly sluggish at parts, but collecting the shiny areas is surprisingly addicting (maybe because I'm a sem-completionist), as are finding chests. The unfortunate part is that most of these chests contain utterly useless items, so don't really feel that rewarding. \n\nTwo, dungeon crawling. Have to admit this is one of the weaker parts for me. The dungeons are basic, and don't really have much in the way of puzzling elements. Could change later, highly doubt it will. I do like how the battles are seamless, though.\n\nThree, army battles. Also not much of a fan of this, but only because it seems like a side addition without much depth to it. Fortunately it's not a major part of the game, so meh.\n\nFour, kingdom management. Holy cow I love this part of it. People might complain it feels like a mobile game with the wait times and whatever, but since you can warp straight back to your castle whenever you want, it's not that big of an issue. I do wish your gains accumulated while you're offline (or tabbed out, at least...), but idk something about managing the kingdom and making it grow/level up is stupidly addicting.\n\nOverall, if you're looking for a challenging or engaging JRPG, this might not be the game for you. If you're looking for a game with gorgeous visuals, fantastic voice acting (using JP), laid-back atmosphere, and want to be the president of the United States serving some random kid as his vassal, highly recommended.\n\nHighly recommend to play on controller. I'm using the Switch Pro Con.",
      "Hello Charlotte is not a game; it is a confessional.\nIf you're here you've probably already realized, but I wish to place massive emphasis that Hello Charlotte, and Hello Charlotte 3 especially, has very little gameplay, and what is present is very standard RPGMaker fare. If you are the kind to balk at visual novels, HC3 will not be your cup of tea. Watch a playthrough or something if you're interested, but don't expect any kind of engaging play.\nWith that said: Hello Charlotte 3 (and its DLC, Heaven's Gate) has been one of the most emotional, impactful pieces of art I've ever engaged with. It is horrifically honest, incorrigibly vulnerable, and, as previously stated-- more a confessional than a game. With everything I know how to say and with everything I have to say about it, I cannot find a way to truly articulate what Hello Charlotte made me feel (still makes me feel) and how it has affected me.\n\nHello Charlotte: Childhood's End is from the perspective not of the Charlotte of the previous two games, but a new, blank slate PC. While not necessary to play the previous two games, I strongly recommend it. It develops on the themes of the previous two games, and in doing so, completely recontextualizes them. C and Anri of HC2 return, as does Scarlett, though not in the forms we are accustomed to. We are finally given a full understanding on the nature of Charlotte and the False Realm, and what we are in relation to it.\netherane's art has markedly improved since the second game, with impressive sprite and background artwork, though their style is still recognizable. The music (some composed by etherane, others outsourced) is varied and distinctive. Most prominent about etherane's work, however, are the themes and writing, which have matured considerably since the release of HC2. Though often garish and on the nose, HC3 is a poignant commentary on the nature of art and fiction, the impact we have on one another, and our understanding of realness itself.\nYou will experience confusion. You will experience whiplash. The game intends to make you unsure and uncomfortable in its consumption, <i>deliberately</i> so. In the process it becomes a jarring, distinctive work of art unique to its creator and an important representation of the Millenial psyche. It's a psychological horror game and by God will it force you to experience psychological horror.",
      "[h1]First of all, NISA... the elephant in the room needs addressing.[/h1]\nIf you're going to use D3D11 and try to do stuff multi-threaded, use a 64-bit executable.\n\nMemory allocation and thread pooling work much better in a 64-bit environment. 32-bit doesn't really expand your market share any but causes several compatibility headaches (including memory fragmentation in your resource manager). Please, NISA, stop fooling around with legacy APIs (i.e. WinMM for gamepad input and OpenGL 1.x as you did in Disgaea) and outdated ABIs.  D3D11 / 64-Bit should be the target environment for software longevity.\n\nI get the impression you believe that OLDER means more compatible, but you've got the whole PC development paradigm upside down. Old stuff is simply old, period.\n\nI would encourage you to review the guidelines for authoring Windows Store software, Microsoft's policies for Windows Store are designed to reduce legacy software maintenance problems. You need not follow them, but they will give you a pretty good idea of the APIs and ABIs that are relevant / native / not running through compatibility layer redtape. Do this and I believe you will find PC development much less troublesome.\n\n\n\n\n[list][i]With that out  of the way, I would like to point out that NISA patches their games more than any developer I have ever seen.[/i][/list]\n\n\nI personally believe this game is best suited for the Nintendo Switch, but PC will have a stable version by the time the Switch version ships. I have already authored a number of fixes for texture aliasing that guarantee image quality-wise, the PC version is where you would expect it to be. We just need NISA to polish the rest of the stuff :)\n\nTake early reviews with a grain of salt because NISA's going to be busy patching this game for months if Disgaea is any indication. Price complaints are probably the only aspect of current reviews that will remain valid. I tend to agree, the asking price is not what it should be for a game that's not exactly finished.\n\n\n\n[h1]I am leaving a positive review because I have faith NISA will stick with it, but ...[/h1]\n\n[list][list]You shouldn't rush to buy this game by any means.

      "The premise is that you're a passenger on a ship, waking up on the morning after you've murdered your well-to-do husband. From that point, you're free to go anywhere on board to do whatever you can to avoid justice within the time limit. You could just try to play dumb and cover up enough evidence to put your guilt into doubt. If you're more devious you could try to frame one of your fellow passengers. You could even go the And Then There Were None route and murder everyone else on board just to be thorough, if you can pull it off.\n\nOverboard! was clearly designed for replayability. The ship is full of evidence and red herrings to tamper with, desperate schemes to attempt, and secrets to learn. The first playthrough reveals only a small slice of all this, leaving a collection of unsolved mysteries and unfollowed leads to pursue on the second. The second playthrough prepares you for the third, and so on, until finally you beat the game... but there's much more to it than that. Vague, but I don't want to spoil anything.\n\nThis game was released today without any kind of announcement beforehand from inkle. As usual, their writing and design are superb. If you're captivated by the premise, even by a little, you won't regret the purchase.",
      "Gone Home is... okay. There's nothing particularly terrible about it, but it's hardly this amazing, revelatory experience that it's been portrayed as in the media. It's just a very short, straightforward game of exploration, in which a fairly simple story of teenage love and rebellion is fed to you through bits and pieces of notes and spoken journal entries you find while exploring a large, abandoned house. But this game does absolutely nothing innovative, unlike the pre-release hype proclaimed. There have been hundreds of games with more compelling stories, and this game introduces no original mechanics. I took my time and explored the entire house, and I beat the game in three sessions totalling 81 minutes.\n\nAgain, it's not bad, it's just an utter ripoff for $20. I got it in a large Humble Bundle package, paying about a dollar for it, and it's decent value at that price, but there's no way I'd pay more than five bucks, and even that is stretching it. I'd be pissed if I'd paid full retail for it. You can find many many games that will be far more engrossing, more entertaining, and just plain longer at this price point.",

      "[h1]Strategy at its finest[/h1]\n\nInto the Breach is Subset Game’s latest title, following on from their massive hit, FTL. I put off trying Into the Breach for a long while, but I finally got it when it dropped down to $10 on HB a couple of months ago and I’m so glad I did. This game isn’t for everyone, it’s kind of rogue-like mech chess, but if it clicks for you then it’ll be one of the best strategy games you’ll ever play.\n\n[h1]Positives:[/h1]\n[list][*]First up, the game looks fantastic. The pixel art here is great, from the backgrounds to the mechs and even the pilot portraits. The animations here area also really good. There’s nothing too complicated here but it’s all well executed. On the topic of appearances, I also really like the way the maps are laid out, the 8x8 grids on a plain background work really well here and it reminds me of simple boardgames. I think it works well for the game.\n\n[*]As with any good strategy game, it’s easy to pick up, but hard to master. You have a squad of three mechs (there are a few different mech groups to unlock with gold coins (?) and you can also create custom groups from the mechs you’ve unlocked). Each group has a unique element, but they all follow the basic structure of one close-range mech, one long-range mech and one support mech. Each mech has a different ability/weapon and they’re all well varied. The mech teams are really well designed here so that no one mech is super powerful and they all work really well as a unit. \n\n[*]The combat is excellent. It’s really simple but it works so well. You’ll quickly learn the different roles your mechs have and figure out the best strategies to use them. There are two ways to kill most enemies. Getting rid of all of their HP or pushing them into water/lava (with the exception of boss enemies or flying enemies). However, a lot of the time you probably won’t even be trying to kill your enemies in a given turn. You can always see what the enemies will do on their next turn and so you always want to be playing to react to/prevent their next move. Typically, enemies target civilian buildings or buildings related to your objective, so it’s usually better to focus on moving them away from these buildings rather than focusing on killing them. If you’re really smart/lucky you can also push enemies so that they attack each other, as friendly fire is a major part of this game. It’s really satisfying when you line it up right so the enemies are killing each other rather than attacking you or the buildings you defend. You can even block them from spawning by moving something on top of them!\n\n[*]Unlocks in this game are handled better than in FTL in my opinion. There are six actions that you can complete with each mech squad to earn those gold coins I mentioned in order to unlock new mech squads. The first three are the three possible victories: two, three and four island (more on that in a second) and then the other three achievements are unique to each mech squad. They’re centred around the unique aspect of each squad, tasking you to get a bit creative with the way that you’re playing. I know some players didn’t like the way that unlocks worked but I think it’s a really good way to handle it and encourages you to try new strategies. \n\n[*]The game has five islands, with one of those being the final boss fight. Each island is basically a different biome with different enemies and environmental hazards. They aren’t necessarily easier or harder than each other to start with, but the difficulty does increase as you move from island to island. There is some crossover with the enemies you’ll see, but they at the very least have a different appearance and most of them behave differently. There are also enemies unique to each island. \n\n[*]On each island, you’ll need to complete several missions before facing off against the island’s mini-boss. The missions all have different objectives for you to complete, though the win condition is always just to survive all of the turns (typically 5 turns). The different objectives vary but there are usual two, with some easier missions only having one and harder missions having three. Completing these objectives gets you certain rewards. You can either get stars, which are used upon completing an island to purchase new pilots, abilities or weapons. There is grid power which restores or increases the grid power you start with (grid power is lost when buildings are destroyed, losing all grid power results in a loss). Lastly, some of the missions award power cores (usually you only see this as the third reward for a hard mission) which allow you to upgrade your mech’s weapons or abilities (super handy). The mission variety is fairly good.\n\n[*]There are a range of different pilots in the game. You always start with one ‘special’ pilot and two regular pilots but more can be found in cryo-pods or bought at the end-of-island store. All pilots earn xp at the end of missions and when they level up they get some kind of upgrade, like more mech health or an extra movement per turn. The ‘special’ pilots all have some kind of special ability, such as being able to attack twice if you don’t move or the ability for the piloted mech to fly. Some of these require a power core, but they’re definitely worth it.  [/list]\n\n[h1]Negatives: [/h1]\n[list][*]Honestly, I’m clutching at straws here for negatives. One thing I would mention is that I don’t think this game will have as much replay value as FTL does for most people (completionists have an awful lot to do here) which shouldn’t put you off from getting it, but is something to base your expectations on. I also felt like Chris Avellone was a bit wasted on this game, his writing is fantastic but there just isn’t much of it. [/list]\n\n[h1]Verdict: [/h1]\n\nInto the Breach is as close to a perfect strategy game as I’ve ever played and it’s an excellent follow-up to FTL. This game is easy to pick up, hard to master and it looks beautiful the whole time you’re playing this weird mech chess. I can’t recommend this enough and at $15 it’s an absolute steal. This was easily one of my favourite releases of 2018 and anyone who likes strategy absolutely needs this in their library. \n\nIf you found this review helpful, please check out my other reviews over at [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33633486/]Kemo's Corner.[/url]",

      "[H1]At this price point it's hard not to recommend it, but there's a lot -better- bullet hell games out there...[/H1]\n\nDanmaku unlimited as a series is great. Don't get me wrong. It really is. But it suffers the curse of being put in with a field on Steam that is made up of even greater company. Bug Princess by Cave has the brutal difficulty angle sewn up, Ikaruga has the absolute classic angle nailed, Jamestown has the glorious pixel-art sorted. In order to stand out in this genre, you absolutely have to bring something new to the table.\n\nAs good as Danmaku Unlimited is, it does not bring anything new to the table. It brings a lot of -good-, but nothing -new-. The greatest sin here is that if you've played a lot of bullet hells, this is going to feel immensely familiar, and you're going to blast through it fast, nothing is prone to catch you out. At all. Now that may be a plus point, if that's what you're after, but if you're seeking something to change up the formula? Yeeeeee-no.\n\n[H1]So it's the Bullet Hell version of Destiny?[/H1]\n\nMechanically, it works great. You have a ship with a teeny tiny hitbox, same as most \"Eastern\" BHell games, you have anywhere between \"Mildly offensive\" and \"Absolutely terrifying\" levels of hostile fire coming toward you, and you pump out similarly scary levels of fire back, with your only choice generally being \"Do I spam the screen with lots of little beams or do I fire ONE BIG BEAM at something that needs cracking open like a walnut.\"\n\nIt has good Bullet Hell music, albeit not outstanding music, it has good graphics, albeit not outstanding graphics, you see a pattern here? If a game could ever nail what I'd define as the absolute essence of an \"8 out of 10\", this would be it. The problem is there's games out there such as Revolver360 Re:Actor that do -better-.\n\nThe problem is that for all the good it does, it's been beaten to it by other games, maybe not in every field, but in each area I can name at least two or three games that stand above it. The one area it does win out on is bang for the buck. It's kinda hard to argue with this kind of quality at this kind of price point. It's a very, very solid return on investment, particularly if you're a bullet hell fan.\n\n[H1]Closing Thoughts[/H1]\n\nDoes that make this a \"Do not buy\"? Far from it. If you're a fan of bullet hells, chances are you already own it. If you don't, eventually you should, but I'd genuinely suggest you look around first, there's a decent market now on Steam for this genre, and there's more innovative and interesting options around. If however you've already consumed them and you need a fix of something fairly solid and fairly entertaining, then sure, this works, it will scratch the itch quite nicely.\n\nVerdict : [b]Buy, definitely worth grabbing on a sale, if only to put in the \"To do\" list,[/b]",
      "Write a review they said.. alright.. here it is... \n\nI am at year 5, day 29, Population 250, its winter right now in my little village.. my vikings are freezing, but they should not be. I have stores of coal available to them but they just do not go get it. \n\non a scale of 1 - 10, right now.. a solid solid 7. Why just a 7, well.. its new.. its not finished yet.. and still a tiny bit buggy. \n\nGameplay. It's good.. but i would really like to be able to grab the map with a left click hold and drag it around that way. The camera movement when trying to move the map is slow.. too slow for me. Also the fact that you have to clear whatever you have selected before you can selected the next thing you want to build. \n\nGraphics... VERY nice.. love it.. everything has great detail. People walking really nicely. Now for the not great part.. zoom in on a fishing boat.. boats moving.. oars. well.. they are not moving, I think I have even seen a fisherperson sleeping in the boat as well.. little more on the animations will probably be inserted at a later time.. but I thought it humorous, People also do tend to walk right into the side of a mountain and vanish.. then poof.. they walk back out at another area. \n\nHousing:  Great looks on both the poor and good housing. the option to just upgrade from poor to good would be nice.. \n\nStorage: Storage needs some work.. seriously.. So you have the Wood storage and you have stone storage.. they are basicly the same looking building.. I'd like to see them combined, with that being said.. please add COAL and IRON as well. Make it so that we can set whats to be stored in that building and make it have workers.. that way we can have dedicated vikings move the specific stuff.. \n\nWater: Please allow the area of coverage to overlap.. OR. make the coverage a square so we can fully cover the areas.\n\nFOOD: You gave us these great fields to use. But um.. can we grow something other than wheat and barley? like. potatoes? carrots? I mean, the vikings didn't only eat meat and bread?(but i am also aware the games still in progress)\n\nThe only real issue I have had with the game so far on my system is I was spending point on the tree and when I went back to the village it was gone and I had to reload. I do know once in a while a reload will fix the workers from gathering resources but it doesn't always work.\n\nSo over all I really enjoy this game. I'd definitely recommend  this game to anyone who enjoys city building survival type game. \n\nHope everyone enjoys this game...",

      "When I first played Battlefield 1 it literally sent me to the hospital, cause you’re supposed to seek immediate medical attention if your erection lasts longer than 4 hours.\n\nThis is easily one of the most badass games  in history. The music, the landscape, the gunplay, the hit register and the satisfying kill effect, EVERYTHING is just amazing. The last true Battlefield game. I enjoyed every second of this amazing game.  \n\nBF1 isn’t fully historically accurate but it is historically immersive. The war stories in this game genuinely made me emotional sometimes and I’m not ashamed to admit that. \n\nAs someone who is more on the “historical accuracy” side of games, I can say without a doubt that Battlefield 1 did an incredible job. Hell, they were even able to be diverse without pandering to anybody! The 1st Russian Women’s Battalion of Death, the Harlem Hellfighters, people from French-occupied northwestern Africa, the list goes on. What sets this game’s inclusivity of a variety of people and groups from other games is that it does so when it has a reason to and is still accurate to the time and setting. \n\nThat’s one of the main reasons why Battlefield 5 pissed me off so much. Instead of a British woman with a prosthetic arm wielding a cricket bat in WW2, why not include Lyudmila Pavlichenko, aka Lady Death, a female Russian sniper who had 309 confirmed kills? What about the French women who fought? They were in extremely small numbers, but they were a thing. Historically accurate inclusion is fucking awesome, and I love when games do it. But inclusivity for its own sake is terrible and it cheapens said character’s presence in the game’s setting. \n\nEven the DLC are fantastic. I remember how amazing I felt when the “for the Tsar” DLC came out and I first played it. I have never seen people fight so hard to the death in a video game without a whole lot of rage. It was amazing. I felt like I was part of the Russian revolution. Please do yourself a favor and buy this game.\n\n9/10\n\nOnly gave it a 9 ‘cause the 1 is already there…",
      "I purposefully went into this game looking for bugs, seeing that it was in early access, and I have yet to find any. The only reason I stopped playing was because there was a fence that wasn't fully secured to the ground that I was able to get underneath, allowing me to get out of bounds. This lead to me falling into an area where I couldn't get out, and it wouldn't let me respawn at my most recent checkpoint. This would mean I'd have to start from the beginning, which I very much didn't want to do. Anyway, the biggest tips I can give to the developers is to make sure the map is 100% how they want it, and to make the audio design better. That's it. I may come back and change my review in the future.\n\nFINAL RATING: 4 / 10",

      "EDIT:\n\nWhile I have played Squad quite a bit for a few years, the large update named \"V6.0 Infantry Combat Overhaul\" unfortunately did not sit well with me.\n\nThe goals for the update:\n\n- Increase length of fights.\n- Reduce the impact of lone wolfs (solo players).\n- Increase emphasis on teamwork mechanics, which mainly meant supression.\n- Increase gunplay diversity, to create choices between optics, since the old meta meant that the magnified optics were greatly outperforming iron sights and holo sights.\n\nWhile I do not disagree with some of the goals, the implementation of them left a lot to be desired.\n\nAfter the update most gunfights became a mess of supression, without either side being able to effetively kill each other beyond 200m.\nGunhandling was also drastically nerfed, creating the sense that your character has never held a rifle before, or even used an optic for that matter.\n\nI can unfortunately no longer recommend this game, since I myself no longer feel drawn to play it.\n\nIf enough changes are made, I may revisit the game and this review, but for now there are better options out there.\n\n\n** OLD REVIEW ** \n\nCan the game be amazing and fun - yes! Do I recommend this for everyone? - No.\n\nThe experience of the game largely depends on what servers / communities you play with. If you play the core game with no moderation (no rules or admins), the game will become a race to make the first unit and lock others out and a race to get armor, then proceed to rush the enemy and end up spawnkilling them near their main spawn.\n\nIf you play on moderated servers with established rules and active admins, then you may experience a great sense of teamplay - other times not so much.\n\nBefore you buy it though...\n\n- Microphone and willingness to use it is REQUIRED for a good experience (People will quickly kick or become hostile towards you, if you do not communicate)\n- This is not battlefield or call of duty, running of solo to pull off 360 noscopes will probably get you kicked/ killed.\n- You will die without knowing from where and you will get into situations in which you have no option to survive, especially if you're new to tactical shooters.\n- You will end up running... A lot..\n- Armor is not like battlefield or call of duty, you need a driver, gunner, commander and possibly a loader (has a machinegun). Where you hit the enemy matters as much as what you hit him with (Armor piercing on his front turret will likely bounce, but even a high explosive may hurt if you can hit him up the rear)\n\nStill here... ?\n\nIf I haven't scared you off, here are my personal tips:\n- Play. The. Tutorial.  Like really...\n- Try different graphic settings, shadows especially makes a big difference in enemy visibility (game looks better with them though)\n- Start as infantry and pick rifleman, but remember to join a squad.\n- Find a server that seems to have active admins and have a ruleset you agree with.\n- Try NOT to give up when you die, generally it isn't worth throwing away a ticket to respawn if you have friendlies within 100m. Sometimes it is the right choice, but before you know which is which, it's a good idea to hold on for a medic.\n- Not all squad leaders know what they're doing, do not be afraid to join another squad if it turns out your squad leader is a fool.\n- Defending is often as important (if not more), than attacking... But you may end up waiting 30 minutes without getting shot at or shooting anyone.\n\n\nAs you can probably tell... Squad is a community based game, with in-depth enough mechanics, while also being easily accessable.\nIf you want a good sense of what the game is, check out some lesser known streamer playing it (bigger streamers will often give you the wrong sense of what a game is like)\n\nHope this helped you make an informed decision.\n\nbut for now there are better options out there.",
      "BE ADVISED!!!\nif u are from asia, just don't buy it! there is no server for us.\nwe can't found any server even from EU & NA",
      "Stephen's Sausage Roll is a game that the developer doesn't want normal people to buy, it seems. The description is literally, \"A simple 3d puzzle game.\", there is one video that shows you nothing about the game, and it's priced at $32 CND.\n\nFortunately, I'm here to tell you to get off your ass and to buy this wonderful game. The graphics are alright, the music is OK, but the puzzles are sublime.\n\nIn each level, the goal is the same: cook all the sausages and exit the level by standing on the exit level sign in the right orientation. You cook sausages by pushing them over a grill. Like in sokoban games, you can't pull the sausage (yet...), only push it. Another huge wrinkle is that sides of the sausage can only touch the grill once. If you touch a cooked side of a sausage to the grill, it will be burned and you fail the level. This little wrinkle will make you pull your hair out in some levels as you try and figure out how the hell you are going to maneuver the sausages around so they get cooked properly. A neat thing about the game is that if you fail, you can still continue playing the level, which might help you figure out how to play it.\n\nYou'll have a section (part of an island) that has a number of puzzles for you to solve in any order, so if you get stuck, you can try another one (until you get to the last puzzle of the section). Once you complete a section, a new section will open up with more puzzles.\n\nYour little guy has tank controls, which you will find extremely useful, as turning to the left or right near a sausage will push it in different directions. A nice detail is that the all of the puzzles make up the island section. When you activate a puzzle, the rest of the island drops away into the sea, leaving you on a tiny puzzle island.\n\nEach section introduces new mechanics into the game. First you'll just be pushing the sausages, but then you'll be stacking them, skewering them (you would think this would make things easier, but no! You can't turn when you have a skewered sausage!), walking on them...\n\nI would say that these levels are on the level of Snakebird, though I found many of them easier than Snakebird's puzzles (maybe I'm better at sokoban games than I know?). These are the kind of puzzles that you walk away from frustrated, but come back to a few hours later with the solution. This is the game where there are so many ah-ha! moments that make you feel smart. You have no idea what to do at first, but eventually you get better and better. You might not see solutions at first, but you begin to see where you need to go to solve the puzzle, and then work backwards from there. It's wonderful!\n\nIf you're having trouble, there's a community guide that has all the solutions, which is super helpful (though not as much when I was playing because it wasn't complete!).\n\nIt might be expensive, but I took 36 hours to solve all the puzzles and it was worth every penny.",
      "[b]Playing status:[/b] 100% achievement\n[b]Grindy Achievement(s):[/b] No.\n[b]Optional Achievement(s):[/b] Yes (9 achievements).\n[b]Difficult Achievement(s):[/b] No.\n\n[h1]Intro[/h1]\nYou were sure that you weren't supposed to be here: a dark forest with a thick mist surrounding over it. Where is this place? Can you go back? Join Kihara Kashin in her adventure, looking for a way to return to where she belongs in [b]Tales of the Black Forest[/b].\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n- Heartwarming stories\n- 2 endings\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n- Dialogues might be hard to understand with the untranslated words and a lot of Japanese names that are given at once\n\n[b]Specs[/b]\nIntel Core i5-9300H 2.40GHz, 8GB RAM, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650\n\n[h1]Should you buy this game?[/h1]\n[b]Yes.[/b]\n[i]If you like to play games with a heartwarming story and don't mind reading a lot of texts, buy this game. You might want to familiarize yourself with Japanese terms though.[/i]\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1]In-Depth Review[/h1]\n\n[h3]Visuals[/h3]\nThe game is presented in 2D pixelated art. As an RPG Maker game, all of its assets and interfaces have been customized, leaving no trace of the default one. It does a good job with the interface though - everything looks beautifully made and straight to the point. The maps are also done well to promote the areas, whether it's the bustling city or the abandoned village. The areas, although usually depicted at night, are still easy to see with their blue-ish colors. Everything is done well to help you enjoy the scenery.\n\n[h3]Story[/h3]\nThe main selling point of the game is in its storytelling. The world of [b]Tales of the Black Forest[/b] is separated into 3 interconnecting chapters, each focusing on someone and the event that was happening around them. The story has a different vibe on each chapter, although one thing is certain: it does a good job in delivering a heartwarming story at the end. I know that creating good storytelling with just 2D sprites is not easy, but this game does it seamlessly.\n\nSince the storytelling focuses on a different person in each chapter, the story is obviously non-linear. You'll find some clues of what was happening to a certain event, which will help you in understanding another event in a bigger picture. It might be hard to keep track of all of them, especially with the recurring names, but the game is kind enough to give you some explanation about it. There might still be some mysteries lying around, but I found it to be concluded nicely at the end.\n\nThe translation might hinder you from enjoying the story to its fullest. It tends to not translate some words, whether it's some locations or simple terms. Some words like \"komusume-chan\" can be translated into English nicely without ruining the sentences, but the translator decides to just give a translation note surrounded in brackets when you encounter it for the first time. People who do not know Japanese terms might have trouble understanding these words sometimes, especially when you also have to remember a lot of Japanese names in the process.\n\n[h3]The Game[/h3]\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nAlthough the story is the main focus of the game, there were times when you have to walk around, whether to initiate another cutscene or solve some puzzles. Important objects are marked in the game, making it easier to locate where you are supposed to look. If you are the adventurer type, some additional dialogues will also available to give a conclusion to some characters after you progress the story. They are not related to the main story though, so you can safely ignore them if you choose to do so.\n\nSeveral puzzles are available to break the repetitiveness. Puzzles in the first half of the game usually take the form of finding some number combinations based on the provided hints, although the second half of the game starts to be more creative with its puzzle-like minigame. I wish that the game will do these puzzles right from the start since it helps to break the monotonous pace.\n\n[b]Length and Replayability[/b]\nThe game lasts for about ~5h. Despite it having two endings, the point of no return is obvious and the game is kind enough to tell what you have to do to reach both endings. That being said, there is no point to replay the game since you can save before the point of no return to unlock both endings at once.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nIt's been a while since I found a quality RPG Maker game on Steam. I didn't expect that it will do a good job with its storytelling. The music, art, and dialogue - everything helps to enhance the story, giving this heartwarming feeling after you read it. I was satisfied with the story, although I admit that I got bored sometimes because of the number of dialogues that I had to read. The game is completely not for those who don't like visual novels, and people who appreciate the story aspect in a game will enjoy it to the fullest.\n\n[quote]Visit SaveOrQuit.com for detailed game reviews, posted daily![/quote]",

      "Mori's 3-Part Review:\n1. Bare minimum information and recommendations to improve your playthrough\n2. Background information on me and my playthrough\n3. More extensive non-spoiler reactions\n \nPart 1: Recommendations for You\nIf you're like me and you try to get all the extra scene dialogue, then please, if you take nothing else from this, give yourself time to play this game yourself. There is actually so much content here, I really want you all to take your time to experience it as you go. The game is just too long to binge in a reasonably short amount of time, and if you do binge, you're going to lose a lot.\n \nMy recommendations:\n1. Give yourself time to play the game. Let it sink in, and take notes- it'll be rewarded. The game is literally too dense and too long to binge reasonably if you like 100%ing.\n \n2. Get invested in the characters and pay attention to them, not just the (admittedly stellar) mysteries.\n \n3. Explore the game, its mechanics, and its dialogue yourself. Don't be afraid to restart a Somnium several times; the more options you pick, the more meaningful information you get.\n \n4. If you're a puzzle lover then try to solve the game yourself. You're going to have a blast if you manage it, and the game has tons of built-in hint systems to make it even easier, fairer, and more fun.\n \n5. Try to go in knowing at little as you can. The marketing has already done a great job. Focus on finishing the game and bringing it all together.\n \n6. On PC, force anti-aliasing on using your graphics card to make the game prettier. Game ran and controlled smoothly with few bugs.\n \n7. You don't need AI1 to play AI2, but I think AI2 does spoil AI1, though you could still enjoy them in reverse order.\n \n7. If you're sensitive to horny then just read less background dialogue in Ryuki side. Gore is pretty toned down, and there isn't any single huge CW.\n \nYou can stop reading now if you don't want your playthrough tainted by my reactions/expectations effected.\n \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nPart 2: Who am I, and how do I play?\nI'm an Uchikoshi fanatic. I've played all his English-translated games, and visual novels are my favorite genre of game. I've played a lot of visuals novels, but Uchizawa's are my favorites. I usually try to 100% complete all the scenes and see all the bonus dialogue. I've also played a lot of other genres of game, and I do like fun gameplay, but the most important things to me tend to be:\n \nA. An interesting story is absolutely what gets me invested\nB. Bunches of novel ideas like unique plot points I haven't seen before, philosophical ideas, or puzzles\nC. Characters that I at least don't actively hate; I can like a game for the above two, but characters still matter\nD. Deep personal connection, usually formed by connections to real people or how a game shaped my life\n \nThose are the ways I rate my top games. For the last 8 years, my top 2 favorite games have been the same:\n \nMy top favorite game of all time is Remember11. I love the plot, the ideas, the twists, the characters, and it's what got me truly invested in Uchikoshi. It's very much a mystery game first with an unravelling mystery and themes I love to explore.\n \nMy second favorite game is Virtue's Last Reward. I love the interactive moral dilemmas. VLR's use of the Prisoner's Dilemma jumpstarted my interested in Philosophy which led me to major in Philosophy. I don't like the characters as much save for a few, but it's still very important to me.\n \nNow, let me tell you how I've played AINI: I've basically been playing non-stop since June 13th.\n \nTake this with a grain of salt because I've been documenting as I play (the average main story playtime seems to be 20-35 hours, with 100% likely taking 50+), but right now, I have 97 hours of playtime. I have not gotten all the dialogue, achievements, or fully explored the abundance of extra mechanics. Instead, I have a 616-page reaction document full of constant laughs, cries, screams, passing out, and most of all love.\n \nPart 3: My Review\nThe R11 #1 and VLR #2 holy duology held true for 8 years. Also, AI1 isn't one of my favorite standalone games; it has huge personal connection for me because of the community and the AI1 ARG, but it wasn't my favorite as a game.\n \nI gave all that background because I want you to take me seriously when I say this:\nAI2 is my new favorite game. The #1 spot has been Easily dethroned.\n \nThe themes, twists, characters, ideas, gameplay, visuals, voice acting, fair mystery, presentation, mechanics, and comedy all of it resonates together perfectly. I don't even tend to value gameplay or visuals, but at many times, this game is fun to play while looking genuinely beautiful and cinematic.\n \nThe story reads like a proper Uchikoshi + Nakazawa return to form. The mystery is fair, interesting, meaningful, and complex told satisfyingly. There are many deep ideas, concepts, and themes utilized in thought-provoking ways.\n \nGameplay-wise, there are tons of mechanics that are utilized to make each Somnium unique; they all feel designed by love, fair, and reflective of the character through gorgeous symbolism. They blow the first game completely out of the water. Each one is its own experience to explore and a visual delight. There are also tons of mechanics for you to discover that make AI2 a fun game to play.\n \nThe animations, voices, and directing are cinematic; this game is actually breathtaking a lot of the time. It's backed up by great and charming character writing- despite the fact Mizuki is my favorite AI1 character with 0 contest, I grew to like much of the AI2 cast the same amount.\n \nAI2 is a story about halves and splitting, but also love and coming together- please, see it through until it's whole. I hope and believe you will all fall in love with AI2 like me; AI2 is all I've ever wanted. AI2 is my dream game come true; it's a gorgeous love letter to all Uchikoshi fans who love Zero Escape's puzzles, Infinity's mysteries, and AI's characters and humor.",
      "I thought I liked this game....  but after completing about half, I am super bored.  I quit the game after every battle.\n\nDeck building is super basic and kinda pointless.   No reason to adjust deck after you complete a few maps.  The maps are super easy.\n\nYou can basically just run around with 1 unit and kill everything...   Since movement costs a card, you either move one unit many times, or many units 1 time.   Easier to just move 1 strong unit around.\n\nI think I am the wrong demographic.  The storyline is for kids.   So maybe the target audience is 10 year olds with no strategy gaming experience.",

      "An instant classic.\n---\n\nThe original [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/kunovega/recommended/264200]One Finger Death Punch[/url] was an unexpected treat for me. The refined simplicity of just two buttons that require masterful timing to create a legitimate fighting experience laid out to a selection of music that reminds you of the classic Kung-fu movies of the 1970's but packaged with a carefree stickman aesthetic.\n\nOne Finger Death Punch 2 is a respectable sequel in most ways. The core gameplay is fundamentally the same while the visual indicators and special attack animations have been upgraded and made more fanciful. Other things are changed simply to give you a new experience.\n\nEvery aspect of the game is polished from the interesting tutorial to the many additional modes (survival, gauntlet, etc.) that exist beyond the (very long) main campaign. Once you get into the groove there's potentially dozens if not hundreds of hours of fun to squeeze from this.\n\nThis is a game that just has to be played to truly appreciate it as the feel of your interaction along with the music is what really defines the experience. Simply watching it or looking at the screenshots doesn't do it justice.\n\nThere are a couple of (minor) controversial changes that may not appeal to some fans:\n1. The music in 2 includes a more modernized remix compared to the more traditional music from 1. Personally I love the soundtracks from both, but there are people who have a preference.\n2. The upgrades to special attacks in 2 can be a bit of visual clutter at times. I like both styles, but there are people who prefer 1 over 2.\n3. There are some sequences (like the lightsword rounds) which did not return in 2, replaced instead by other weapons. While I think it would have been cute to include all of that along with the new stuff, it's not a deal breaker. It does however mean that both games retain a bit of unique flair and a reason for you to play and experience them both. 2 is overall an upgrade, but it's also not a 100% replacement.\n\nI would strongly suggest that if you've never played either game, you should begin with the first one. I think it's a better entry point to the series and might have a slightly broader appeal. (it's also slightly cheaper).\n\nThen if you find yourself enjoying it, come back and pick up 2 and you'll find yourself with some remixed music, fancy new special attack animations and a whole new adventure to work through.\n\nJust to be very clear: Both of these games are fantastic and deserve more praise than I can properly express and I'll very likely be putting 100's of hours into this just like I did the first one.\n---\n\nBottom line: Simple to learn, hard to master, and super satisfying fighting along with a great soundtrack.\n---\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38232109/]While you are here, would you consider following my curator page?[/url]\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/kunovega/recommended/]Want to read all of my reviews and not just the curated ones?[/url]",
      "It's about time i wrote a proper review for one of my favourite games ever.\n\nRivals of Aether is a platform fighter that tries to follow Super Smash Bros. Melee and P+'s footsteps by making a competitive focused game, but also while trying to keep it more accessible than the former. The game also has a very active workshop that allows players to create their own characters and play ones made by other creators, alongside custom made stages and buddies.\n\nI will focus on the purist aspect of the game first.\n\nAs for many \"smash clones\", the game will feel very familiar to people who already played a smash game, with the controls being nearly identical but with some key differences:\n\n1. THERE'S NO SHIELD. Rivals of Aether is probably the first game in its genre to forgo the iconic \"bubble\" shield, choosing it to replace it with a parry instead. Parries are riskier, staying out for a few frames, and will reward you immensely by either stunning the opponent or reflecting their projectiles. Since parrying is so risky, the game's neutral and defense (but also its offense) will be focused on movement, especially thanks to wavedashing, wavelanding alongside some more niche or character specific movement techs. \n\n2. THE STAGES HAVE NO LEDGES. This means your way to safety when you get knocked off the stage will be actually landing onto the main platform, rather than aiming for the ledges. Rightfully so, the game offers much more options when offstage compared to smash games, with every character having access to wall jumping, an airdodge that doesn't send in freefall and the ability to walljump and cancel special falls, allowing you to use your up special two times. This means the offstage game is a lot deeper than in other game, as there will always be a way back onto the stage since almost every character is allowed a lot of freedom while in disadvantage.\n\n3. THERE'S NO GRABS. There's not much to add here; the absence of a shield makes grabs unnecessary, and thus they're not present in the game. Some characters have command grabs, though.\n\nThere's a total of 14 characters in Rivals of Aether (free from the beginning), with 4 more to come in future patches. Although the cast might seem very slim for people who are used to smash games, it's incredibly diverse. Enough to probably warrant you to try every character. Each character has a lot of depth and can shape the stage in some way. Some fighters take inspiration from smash characters, such as Clairen having a tipper mechanic like Marth, or Absa having Ness and Mewtwo's movement turned up to 200 and Zelda's lightning kicks; this means you'll probably find a character you're familiar with in case you're not confident to play with a brand new character yet. It's also worth mentioning that the game is very balanced, with tiers being very subjective. Regardless, RoA's current top player plays the character that is considered the worst in the game by most, so that should prove that the balance state is very good.\n\nNetplay is not perfect, but it's very good and playable. As i'm writing this review, there's currently a beta build that includes rollback netcode, which presents a couple of bugs and desyncs but does its job quite well. Default build uses delay netcode, which also works just fine in case you're dissatisfied with the rollback beta. Rollback is expected to become the default build once the dev team fixes all its kinks.\n\nEvery stage has both an \"aether\" (casual, with hazards) mode and a \"basic\" (competitive, no hazards) mode. Every single stage in \"basic\" mode is tournament legal (with the exception of tempest peak in some regions), adding a lot of stage variety. Aether stages are aimed for a casual audience, with some spicy traps and whacky platform arrangements for a more casual and laidback experience.\n\nOn that topic, there's no items in this game, so the chaotic free-for-all  factor goes down by a notch, to the discomfort of players who like the party game side of platform fighters.\n\nThe community may be small, but it's very active and constantly organizes weekly and monthly tournaments, with the active (financial and whatnot) support of the game devs themselves, so you will quickly find a community in which to play. Sadly, though, having a small community means you'll be bound to experience some \"dead lobbies\" from time to time.\n\nSolo play, i'll have to be honest, is incredibly lackluster. This game was mainly thought to be played with other players and as a result, single player content is very scarce. There's an arcade-styled story mode which only features a handful of characters (the original 4+2 more), that will have you fight some random fighters until you reach your character's \"rival\" at the end of the story. The cutscenes go from average to bad, depending on the character's story. Each story is very simple and resolves itself in the course of 5 encounters, with a super boss+ a final cutscene once you complete every character's story mode\n\nThere's also \"endless abyss\" mode. It's similar to smash's multi-man mode, where you'll fight a never ending horde of weak cpus, with some minigames slapped inbetween, like a platforming section or explosive enemies. You will have to fight a weaker version of the story mode's boss after a set number of waves each time. The most interesting part of this gamemode is probably the rune system. The rune system will allow to buy runes with the in-game currency that will make your character stronger, be it by making them faster/more powerful or improving their moves. These runes can also be used in abyss versus, which is basically pvp but with runes.\nSadly, endless abyss can become repetitive very quickly, with its never changing waves and gimmicks and grind you have to go through to be able to buy (and use) your runes.\n\nThere's one more mode called Tetherball. It's actually a PvP mode, but i'm putting it in the solo play paragraph because it's a very casual mode. Simply put, the goal of this mode is to hit a beach ball that is attached to a pole by a string and make it spin around it. You score one point when the ball-on-a-string completely wraps the pole. You will have to fight your opponent to keep the control of the ball, as they can hit it as well and make the ball \"theirs\". It's a very fun but often shunned aside mode so i felt like putting it in this review. Please, play Tetherball with me. \n\n\nAs for workshop...\n\nIf you're not big on the competitive scene of platform fighters, this is probably why you came to this store page and. as you may have gathered, casual play is not very fleshed out, with only aether mode and some solo modes as your only options. That's where workshop shines! You'll be able to download hundreds of play made characters, some with the intent of being serious, competitive fighters, while others (most) are aimed to a more casual audience. Characters can go from original characters to the reckless wii mote guy, so you'll have plenty of fun by browsing the worshop page and finding the perfect character, be it an original character or a direct transposition of greninja from Smash Ultimate. Needless to say, you'll also have a huge choice of stages and music packs, alongside some hidden gems like new gamemodes that often pass under the radar. I bet you didn't know you could play Uno in Rivals of Aether!\n\n\n\nTo wrap things up, i'd like to comment on the great pixel art graphics which does its job very well and will appeal to retro gamers specifically, and give my shoutouts on the incredible OST made by flashygoodness. Every track fits the stage perfectly and gives the right atmosphere to this fast paced fighting game.\n\nIn other words this game is a very good purchase for both casual players, thanks to the workshop, and competitive players because of its deep yet accessible design. I hope this review made whoever is reading it consider buying Rivals of Aether and join the community.",
      "Fun Tower-Defense style indie game. Definitely one where your skill improves every time you die. And you will die, repeatedly. :P Expect to try out many monster combinations per floor before you find something that can delay the hordes of adventurers long enough to set up the floor beneath! I would probably enjoy some more horizontal progression + permanent upgrades for long term re-playability, but it seems like a solo dev/small scoped project. Definitely worth the price for the current amount of content!",
      "If you like management type games and RPGs, this is the perfect mix. It's just enough management to allow you to thrive with mostly strategy without feeling bogged down, and just enough RPG elements to get you invested in not just your squad, but each individual character in it. \n\nHere's a tale from my experience with the game;\n\nThis is the kind of game to change your entire perspective on life itself. Failure is not the end, nor the beginning, but a constant in this world that you can either let destroy you or make you stronger. Allow me to tell you a story. The story of New Battlehill. \nNear the Shek city of Squin, not far east, was a small town. It went through many names. The first that stuck was Firstyeet, totally not a placeholder. It wasn't an notable settlement, merely consisting of a shack, an iron processor, and some walls to mildly inconvenience the roving gangs of Dust Bandits that liked to bully the residents. After being evicted from their own city once again, the residents, Denver, Soto, Ruka, and Meow, vowed to take back their home. After training and buying the best weapons and armor they could, they made their way back to Firstyeet. To their surprise, however, they would not have to fight. One of the bandits had picked a fight with a herd of goats. The bandits' defense failed against the caprine assault. From this, the town would get its second name - Densorumego. Den for Denver. So for Soto. Ru for Ruka. Me for Meow. And Go for the true heroes, the goats.\nPeace would not last long but soon the residents of Densorumego would become strengthened by their constant fighting. On the elevated, somewhat round land on which Densorumego sat, there were many large fights involving a lot of people. If only there was some sort of name to reflect this... \nAnd from that, the town was renamed for the last time, to Battlehill.\nThings were looking up. The town built its first farms and expanded to be almost four times its original size. But this peace would not last. Battlehill's new ambitions of self sufficiency would attract the attention of a new foe - The Shek Kingdom.\nThe Shek claimed ownership of the land Battlehill was on, and as such, demanded all food grown there be given to them. Confident from their many victories against the Dust Bandits, the Battlehillites refused the Shek demands. Their risk was calculated... but man were they bad at math.\nAll but one were nearly killed in the ensuing battle, and the one person that wasn't knocked into a coma was stuck on the wall because part of the wall was destroyed and he could no longer reach the stairs because of that. The people knew they couldn't fight the Shek, but they would not allow themselves to be subservient either. And so began their malicious compliance. The Shek would get all the food in Battlehill, as it would be none - The Battlehillites were moving.\nI could write entire books about their journey around the west. The Fogmen, the ruins, the Screeching Bandits, there's many a tale. But, eventually, the people would find a new home. In the harsh and Beak Thing infested land of Vain, homeland of the Western Hive, they would found their new home - New Battlehill.\nJump to now, the city is thriving, they have more bread than they know what to do with, they've grown strong from defending their home from the Beak Things, and their population has grown. They are currently planning a reconquest of Battlehill, which was occupied by Dust Bandits shortly after they left.\n\nThere is a part I left out, between Firstyeet and Densorumego - I had repeatedly failed to retake Firstyeet, and I was about to quit the game. I was frustrated that I'd gone and bought the best arms and armor and still failed. And when I tried to set up a training ground on a mountain near Squin, bandits again came and defeated me. I went as far as to try and get a refund, which was denied. That refund being denied was the best thing that could've happened. I decided to give the game another try, and to try accepting my failures and growing from them. And if I hadn't done that, I would never have founded New Battlehill. None of the legend worthy tales my squad has been through would have happened. And I'd never have had the fun of going through all of them.\n\nIn short, get this game. It is just great.",
      "DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU ALREADY OWN SHOVEL KNIGHT!!!!\n\nIt's a free update to the Original Shovel Knight if you purchased it.  Not a bad game by any means, has the same charm as the original S.K., but why pay for it here if you can get it free with the original (now called Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove).\n",
      "I have a serious love/hate relationship with Sea of Thieves. It is both one of the best games I have ever played and one of the most frustrating games I have ever played, all wrapped into one. The gameplay of Sea of Thieves is INCREDIBLE. The sailing is the best in any game I have ever played. The feeling of exploration and discovery as you blast through treasure hunts and puzzles and mysteries is unlike any feeling you can get from any other game. The cooking mechanic, the healing from food, the not-terrible fishing mechanic... all subsystems that prop up the rest of the gameplay are unique and interesting in their own right. The land-based combat is relatively uninspired, yet still satisfying when part of the greater picture that the game presents. Some of my favorite memories in gaming, full stop, come from completing long nights on the high seas or doing long-form content available in the game. The game is gorgeous, some of the best ocean/water graphics in any game. The rest of the game is equally beautiful while perfectly conveying the environment of the map you are in. I swear to Gaben that I can freaking smell the wet sand or sulfurous lava on some of these islands. The music and sound design are some of the best in the industry. Outright, the game is incredible. \n\nBUT... Sea of Thieves sweaties ruin the game for me. There is absolutely nothing worse than having a night full of fun absolutely destroyed by some player who's enjoyment of the game is derived from eliminating anyone else's fun. I understand that PvP is part of the \"pirate life\", but it is by far the worst part of the game by far. I would be willing to pay money, hell a freaking monthly subscription, for the opportunity to play SoT as a strictly PvE game with just my friends and the rest of the server populated by bots. I actively avoid playing the game now because of how many of my last play sessions started with me spawning at an outpost and subsequently being sunk less than 15 feet off the dock by some sweaty that hasn't seen sunlight since the Obama administration. I know that this is an incredibly unpopular opinion in the greater SoT-sphere, but part of the enjoyment of games is letting players enjoy them how they wish, and I really freaking wish that I could enjoy the aspects of SoT that are fun to me without being the plaything of those pirates who live only to ruin the fun of others.",
      "Plays and looks just like the Park Ranger and Cruise Director HOG series, if you enjoyed those then you will likely enjoy this series. Game is composed of hidden object scenes and simple puzzle transitions that have a loose story to bridge the movement between them. The hidden object scenes follow an older couple as they take their grandchildren to a variety of European counties on their vacation, they sprinkle in a few interesting facts between each location. There are collectibles in each scene along with a raccoon. I overall enjoyed it for a laid back experience and the weirdly fun photostock based scenes. It took me about 2.5 hours to play through the game along with the bonus scenes/puzzles.",
      "Remember when Doom 2016 released the multiplayer beta test first, and we rightfully worried the game would be a flop? Thankfully, the campaign instead blew us away.\n\nI enjoyed my first run through 2016, but only moderately so. In the original Dooms, if you never stop moving, enemies truly can never hit you. With 2016, however, enemies lead their shots if you move predictably. Also, if you leave line of sight, the demons will fire several more predict shots, in case you re-engage from the same vantage point.\n\nI failed to adapt initially. Instead, I blamed the game, claiming it felt unfair compared to the originals.\n\nThen, I stumbled upon Clockner's playthrough of Doom. He showed me a skill ceiling I never dreamed possible. Next came ByteMe's speedrun performance at QuakeCon 2019. I noticed when the demons charged their shots, he would at times hold still and bait for them to aim before dodging at the last second.\n\nThe excuses were off. Doom has transformed after 25 years. The enemies are now more intelligent (yet not overly so). I too needed to evolve.\n\nAs I took on my Ultra Nightmare run (over 3-4 months), I developed a deep knowledge of every level, and in the process, became fond of every inch, as if the entire UAC and Hell were my homes. UN felt like such an accomplishment. After that, I tried to take on an all runes/weapons/challenges mastered run (no grinding). I failed the first two times. With Eternal around a day or two away, I just completed this challenge on my third try. Personally, I leave satisfied with nothing left.\n\nI initially had gripes with 2016, only to learn the developers were one step ahead. When a team/game proves me wrong, I am loyal forever.\n\nDoom 2016 will now be uninstalled from my machine, never again to be reinstalled. May your thirst for blood never quench. And may we never need you again.\n\nTo me, Doom 2016 is also Eternal 🙏.",
      "Where's the atmosphere the first two games had?\nWhy can I only have 2 weapons at any time?\nWhy is this game a generic shooter?\nIf the game they had shown in so many videos previous to the release had come out, it'd have been a masterpiece, instead we got a severely watered down version of it.\nIt's a corridor shooter for the most part, with some parts where you're in a bigger room instead, really what I played the first two games for.",
      "This is the best Civilization up to this point, and the DLC just made it even better. I will grant that the with all the add ons it would feel a tad crowded to anyone who hadn't played it before, but you have a crazy amount of options. The game series tagline of \"one more turn\" could not be more applicable.\n\nYou can strive for one of several victories: diplomatic, cultural, technological or domination. Each has its unique challengers to overcome and create a lot of the fun of the game. They are also not necessarily mutually exclusive and after completing one victory, you can go for the others. Each AI opponent has their own personality, and are pretty predictable in how they behave. Any one who has started the game next to Neopoleon or Ghengis Kahn knows they immediately have to have a decent military to repel invasion, while Ghandi will to muscle you out with religion and culture.\n\nThere are some important changes between Civilization IV and V. One of the most notable is that wars are plausible again as you dont constantly lose health in enemy territory and cities are easier to conquer. Additionally, culture doesn't automatically take over neighbor's cities anymore. \n\nThis game is easily worth the money. I'm not entirely sure how it stacks up to Civilization VI, but any game that I log 200+ hours on over a period of years and still haven't come close to doing everything is doing something right. A great game from a great series.",
      "(If you're past a certain age, I can just say that this is Take Two Interactive's \"Bureau 13\" game, except actually done WELL. If not, keep reading.)\n\nTechnobabylon was one of the best games I played in 2017 (yeah I know it came out in 2015, shh). Wadjet Eye has done it again with Unavowed, one of the best games I played in 2018 and an amazing capstone to all of their work so far. You can play this game without having played the Blackwell series, but you'll get a little more out of it if you have.\n\nIt's also a rather dark piece of work, with a tone somewhere between Sleepy Hollow (the TV show) and something like Buffy. Your character (whose gender and former profession are chosen by you) gets possessed and goes on a year-long murderfestival rampage across New York City. Eventually the Unavowed, a brave supernatural-evil-fighting duo show up, and with the body back in your own control you sign up to fight evil with them. \n\nAs the game goes on, you recruit more characters in Bioware style, solve mysteries (all of which center around that year of hell your character went through), make Tough Choices and work to make the city a better place. All in absolutely gorgeous 640x480 resolution pixel art. \n\nThere were a couple of puzzles that slowed me down (the word \"LEGS\" is going to cause me to make faces for weeks) but this mostly flowed very smoothly. If you're at all a fan of past Wadjet Eye creations, this game needs to be in your life. If you're not, it's a good starting place, maybe the best starting place except that its quality might spoil you for the rough patches of past games.\n\nThis game contains some gore, some body/existential horror that might be jarring to some, and a lot of swearing.",
      "Cthulhu Saves Christmas is another solid, fast-paced comedy jrpg from the folks at Zephoyd games. If you're looking for something bite sized, with some funny dialogue (most of it lands) and great combat this is a worthy purchase. I'd estimate an average playtime of 5-8 hours which is a perfect investment for a weekend jrpg.\n\nTLDR: If you enjoyed Cthulhu Saves the World and Cosmic Star Heroine, you're probably going to enjoy this game.",
      "I don't understand why everyone is saying to stay out of the house? I went inside, they were super nice loving and caring people. The dude that owns the place is a butcher and has all kinds of quality meat. We had BBQ and showed me around the wheat farm.

They're both looking after a baby that's ABSOLUTELY ADORABLE!\n\nI don't get what all the fuss is about, I enjoyed my visit.",
      "I had to purchase Scarlet Hollow after witnessing the excitement of Episode 4 through my friends. I immediately binged the first three episodes the following day and found myself and in rather different spot compared to their playthrough. The choices you make in SH are actually impactful - which is (unfortunately) quite refreshing for the genre! I've since run through several different routes to explore more of the story (and collect those achievements!). While you have the ability to skip through previously seen text, lines within replayed conversations are shaped by your selected traits, choices, and previously selected dialogue; you won't be skipping that many lines before seeing new content. Similarly, characters may be painted in an entirely different light based on choices you've made. The cast and writing truly nails the small town feel of SH (gossip and all). \n\nMake sure you eat the takeaway container in the fridge. Thank me later.",
      "This game has such a HUGE potential like Stardew Valley in its early days!!\nCollecting stuff, helping people by crafting potions its so rewarding and lovely pls dear developers keep working on it. I BEG YOU! :D\nSure it has some bug right now but even on day one they managed to get some fast fixes and tried their best to make it work for everyone. \nThe controls were a bit tricky in the beginning (used Playstation 5 Controller) but its just a matter of time, its just not the normal controls like in other games.\nThe music was pretty nice and chill and also the animations were super cute, i love watching little Rubrum built his sandcastles over and over again. >3< \n\nOverall a good game, but could become even more better in the future, keep going guys!!",
      "the game itself is pretty ok and fun for what it is, and runs great on deck. but man, F**K THE ALWAYS-ONLINE-DRM WHICH AT TIMES TAKES AGES TO CONNECT, GETTING THE GAME STUCK IN THE MENU WITH NOTHING TO DO!!\n\n>> Update after 20h played:\nI really enjoy playing the game. It is good, it is fun and runs great on the Steam Deck, which is especially important to me, as I tend to travel a lot as part of my job.\n\nThat being said, however, is core of the issue: The Always-On-DRM actually prevents me from playing this game on the go. Having this sort of DRM is, in my opinion, only predatory and inexcusable in any way. I get that the online-components of the game will not work when I am on the move, but I am mainly interested in the single player experience, from which I am also locked out. I am even locked out of the main menu without a stable internet collection, which is just ridiculous.",
      "I reviewed the original Mark of the Ninja more than 4 years ago. I liked its stealth-based gameplay approach and praised the learning curve experienced throughout the story. I bought the [i]Special Edition[/i] which practically meant an add-on with some more levels, a custom and the option to replay the entire game in commentary mode. \n\nYou know some games get re-released due to the availability of a new console generation. This [i]Remastered[/i] edition is what was made available for PS4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch users not long ago. We, PC gamers (who already own the original Mark of the Ninja), can get this version free-of-charge in our library.\n\nThere's not much to say, really. I do not have a 4K display so this higher resolution I cannot enjoy. Compressed in-game art or not the original already looked very good. But the creators confirmed this will give us an enhanced experience even under 1080p resolution. \n\nWell, I did complete the game once again as this is how much I love MoN. I recommend that you do the same.\n\nPS: It may be possible that you are required to have the special edition of the original version to get the remastered version.",
      "-This game is like the combination of old PC sidescroller like Duke Nukem (pre-3d), NES Contra, and arcade Metal Slug with 80s /90s cyberpunk and action movie tropes.\n-The cheesy humor, plot, and music is top notch. Might look like a shallow nostalgia at a glance but once you played it, they even spiritually nailed the silliness of similar games/story in that era. The guns, the character acting and lines, the costume design, etc.\n-It's not as fast paced as I thought it would be. But actually that makes it relaxing to play. Easy to get into and the challenge is just right for me without being frustrating. \n-I like how the enemies and characters are pretty diverse. \n-I haven't finished the game but I feel like this game will have similar replay value like Streets of Rage 4. Not because of there are many things to do or getting better at the game but because it's somehow just simply tight, fun, and arcadey to replay.",
      "RPG Maker strikes again!\n\n\"Intergalactic traveler: The Omega Sector\" is one of hundreds of low effort retro-pixel RPG Maker asset/construction kit flips spamming the Steam catalog, made with the RPG Maker video game construction kit... in their own words, \"Our easy to use tools are simple enough for a child.\"  Like all RPG Maker \"games\", this is essentially a bunch of low quality/canned assets from RPG Maker coupled with a cringeworthy high school anime club fan fiction.\n\nAs with all RPG Maker games, the poor quality engine displays badly in fullscreen and doesn't have full HD support or any graphics tweaking options, making this unacceptable for any dedicated modern PC gamer.  The point can be made that the intention of RPG Maker is to make demos and small games to pass around friends, and shouldn't be used for \"professional\" game development.\n\nLike most RPG Maker shovelware and asset flips, the game features extremely low quality copy + pasted 2D retro pixel art, looks awful, and has even worse gameplay.  RPG Maker is an absolutely terrible construction kit, and never results in games of any reasonable quality or value to gamers.\n\nNotably the developer here couldn't work out how to use RPG Maker to make an RPG... and that's the only thing RPG Maker can do properly... except it's not even very good for making RPGs.  Instead, we have a simple 2D top down action/puzzle game where you blip around badly designed and godawfully bad looking mazes.  It's incredible the developer found a way to make RPG Maker even more crap than it is, this is truly a sensational achievement.  \n\nThe poor quality of this game is reflected by how many people spent time with it.  At the time of this review, SteamDB shows the game all-time peak player count was only ONE player.  That's right, only one person ever played this at a time.  When I played this for the purposes of reviewing it, I equalled the peak player count for the game.  OUCH.  The only player activity occurs once or twice a month, presumably someone loading it up to see what it is then quickly uninstalling it.  Considering there's over 120 million gamers on Steam and well over 50,000 games for gamers to choose from (over 9,000 completely free titles), the overwhelming lack of interest in this low quality game is to be expected.\n\n\"Intergalactic traveler: The Omega Sector\" is relatively cheap at $2, but it's not worth it. Given the defects and quality issues with the game, coupled with the unrealistic price, this is impossible to recommend.  Gamers who want a good retro JRPG experience would be better off playing the originals, like Final Fantasy, Star Ocean or Chrono Trigger.\n",
      "So, I hated this game at first...\n\n I've never been into a MMO before, and I went into it with a mindset of \"FUCK YEAH! MULTIPLAYER SKYRIM LETS GO\" - In short don't do that. This isn't going to be like playing Skyrim, Oblivion, Morrowind. \n\nIt is when it all comes down to the core an MMO, it's set in Tamriel, it sounds like Tamriel and the storylines feel like an Elder Scrolls game. However being an MMO, it has a lot of grindy MMO style quests. And don't get me wrong, it's bewildering at first, all these mechanics, all these places to go....and before the 'One Tamriel' update if you chose the wrong faction, you were screwed, in a place all on your own surrounded by all these people who are WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY higher level than you. But thankfully they changed all of that. The game scales now, so you can rock up to a dungeon with your level V300 mate, and still have some fun slicing up enemies.\n\nSo I saw a friend playing the other day, and spent a few hours installing this to join him (By the way its like 70 Gig...If you have slow internet prepare for a few days of download), I got back on it after not playing for 14 months, but this time I was playing with a friend who was already Veteran Level 250, So I was in luck, he introduced me to everything and I got used to all the deconstructing of equipment to get my blacksmithing up, showed me about dungeons and bascially got me to enjoy the grind. I think my previous time was a bit lackluster because I got dropped in the middle of the Aldmeri Dominion on my own, without any of my friends. So I left.\n\nNow I know what I'm doing, and keep in mind I usually hate MMO's never played WoW or anything like that, this is the first one. I'm enjoying myself, I'm triple digits into this game time-wise and I don't see it stopping now. We've made a guild for noobies. To help them out, and get them to enjoy the game also. Because the community is nice...but you still get the elitist fucks from any competitive game kicking you out of dungeons because you're only level 14. But you won't get that when you're in a guild, having people to play with and explain all the mechanics did help, a lot. I've even gone as far as to buy this AGAIN on steam just to collect my hours and so on.\n\nAdd-ons are awesome being able to mod basic features of the game to help with information and quality of life improvements is a must. I'll provide an essential mods pack if any of you wish to know.\n\nFor those of you who actually got this far into this, well done. I didn't think I'd keep you captivated long enough to get to the end.\n\nIf any of you are new to the game, on EU server and would like to join a guild to show you the way, add me or visit our [url=www.godsofsalt.com]website[/url] and join us on teamspeak, or just message us in game @diseasedcrow.\n\nBut all in all if you like Elder Scrolls and you think you want to try this, just do, I'm glad I gave it a second chance.",
      "[h1]An old classic that's fresher than lots of today's titles.[/h1]\n\n[i]Day of the Tentacle[/i] first launched in 1993. I remember, because I was a teenager then and couldn't play it as my PC didn't meet the minimum requirements! This was actually the sequel to an earlier game, [i]Maniac Mansion[/i], which was released in 1987. I played [i]Maniac Mansion[/i] a few years after it came out, but did not complete it as the game's movement and controls were just too dated and clunky for me (even back then) to be bothered with. \n\nPlaying [i]Maniac Mansion[/i] is not at all necessary in order to enjoy [i]Day of the Tentacle[/i], though those who have will definitely find greater connection to the game's characters, especially the Edison family.\n\n23 years later, [i]Day of the Tentacle Remastered[/i] is essentially the same as it was before, but with sleeker graphics and a more modernised interface. While the story hasn't changed, it surprisingly (or not) hasn't aged one bit either - tentacle mutates and seeks to conquer the world, and only you (and your friends) can stop him! Though straightforward, the game's charm is in its various amusing time travel locations and the weird and wonderful characters you meet along the way.

      "Normally, I am hard-set on if a game is good, or bad. This game? its in the middle. I mean, a lot of the game is actually really cool, it looks great, it doesn't explain why basically almost every single person is a walking hunk of muscle, but there are some serious flaws. Not just the weird ones like \"kitchen knives break after you stab someone 3 times\" or \"I just ran over an entire sidewalk of people, and the police are nowhere to be found\", but some seriously terrible glitches that make the game unplayable. Such as the whole space-car thing. \"lalala... driving along the road...\" all of the sudden KABAM your car goes flying, hits the ground, explodes, you die, and you get charged money. You use a car to try and get back to where you were going, and BANG same thing happens again. Also, the cops, even though they are extremely spread out and don't appear to have any form of 911 or anything, are nuts with guns. You, who are supposed to be some sort of superultracop, don't even carry a knife. A FREAKING KNIFE. So if you want a gun, you have to kill a police officer, BUT WAIT HE DIDN'T DRAW HIS GUN AND YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE A HOLSTER so you have to wait until another police officer shows up, hope that he tries to shoot you instead of tackling you, and then run up to him while he shoots at you, press f when you are right in front of him, and grab his gun. Meanwhile the entire police force is going to where you are. Thats just how to get a pistol. Whats that? You want a real gun? One that doesn't take 7 shots(literally) to kill a unarmored policeman? Well, you have to hole up in some building, which its hard to find one with an interior, and just keep shooting the police officers when they charge in. Eventually, after maybe 30 officers are dead, they send in their \"elite team\" of guys... with no helmets... no armor other than a vest... and either a shotgun or a submachine gun. The farthest I have gotten to is with these guys dressed in all grey with helmets and assault rifles, they are meant to be the wall, because it can take up to an entire clip of your submachine gun to take one down. Oh, and back to the cars, WHAT THE HECK IS WITH THE CAR ATTACKING. It made me almost fall out of my chair laughing when I realized that I could use my car to \"lunge\" left and right, and take out other cars. I guess the devs didn't know that cars can't drive straight sideways. Your character has no weapons as well, so it looks kinda stupid when you are blocking and punching a bunch of guys with tire irons, knives, and whatnot. Oh yeah, the weapons break after you swing a few times. The game also has weird weapons. You can pick up an umbrella, a purse, heck even a grocery bag, or a take-out box, to use as a weapon, but these things are one use, and deal less damage then a punch. Overall, this game is a little too unrealistic, to the point where it really removes you from the game. Not to mention the glitches, you would think that the \"new and improved\" sleeping dogs would be \"new and improved\" not the horrible, glitchy mess it is now. I really tried to play it, but I just got tired of being gunned down while I am trying to break into a car and start it up, which takes like a good 20 seconds, which is a lot of time when you have 10 cops unloading their bottomless clips at you. I got tired of randomly being flung into space. I got tired of a cop arresting me, and instead of allowing me to break free and whatnot, me and the cop take a \"small adventure\" gliding across the road through cars and buildings. I got tired of a game thats supposed to be fixed and nearly glitchless, when in reality most early access games play better. I am sorry.",
      "I love this game. In fact, I've loved it since I was in highschool about 8 years ago. My friend and I used to play this game together all the time on my flashdrive. We were always discussing & trying to understand the ins-&-outs of the game and how to get a specific ending depending on what you did. Playing this brought me back to those good times in that library.\n\nThe OSTs are nostalgic, the gameplay is about the same and the artwork is amazing as ever(actually the graphics are much better with this remake).\nThe only complaint I have is that it lags at random times(though usually in the menu). The original IB on RPGMaker never did that.\nOverall I'm glad I bought this so I could support the Dev and thank them for all those years of entertainment-\nI just wish there wasn't so much lag over an RPGMaker game.",
      "This game is for sure not perfect, but worth buying for a specific type of gamer.\n\n[b]What is good in this game?[/b]\n- It has a pretty solid gun gameplay. The movement is quick and polished as well.\n- One level is on average 20 seconds. It's fun to improve your gameplay to get better times in the small levels. \n- It's really a blast getting a perfect run, killing enemies in bullet time or exploiting the enemies weakspots.\n- There is content for around 10-15 hours. Maybe more if you consider going for 100%.\n\n[b]Anyway there are also some flaws: [/b]\n- In Neon White or Ghostrunner the movement and pace through the levels often feels like a perfect choreographic \"dance\"\n- The levels and the areas in Warstride are verry tight. I often lost pace through \"stupid\" placed rocks or small doors.\n- There is not much to explore. The levels are verry linear. While in Neon White it was so much fun to explore shortcuts or other hidden possibilities to improve ur time there are no such mechanics in Warstride at all. I'd love to have some exploration at least in the \"long levels\".\n- It could get repetitive for some players as it's a core element to complete the levels on 5 different difficulties. \n\n[b]Conclusion: [/b]\nIf you like fast paced games like Ghostrunner, Neon White or Doom and you have no problem in repeating short levels several times and u don't except an extraordinary game u will have fun for several hours on a low price.\n",
      "Delete the intro.\n\nHonest Edit:\n\n Actually pretty sweet game.  Lots of things I don't like in terms of menu navigation and difficulty curve, but conceptually one of the better games I've played in awhile.  I just wish the controls weren't so poor. Very tedious with doubletap movement to dodge/counter (keyboard)\n\nAlso not very optimized for steam link or the steam controller. In general the worst parts of this game are directly attributed to the fact that this is a port. One of the worst port jobs i've seen to be honest.  Definitely play with a good controller. \n\nThe game also does a poor job of introducing the \"extended\" story, I nearly missed what i would consider the best part of the game just because I stopped after the first round of credits. There is actually a ton more content afterwards. Very worth investing the time into watching everything play out.",
      "WHERE ARE MY OG DS FANS OF THIS GAME? REJOICE BRUDDAS!\n\nNo but seriously, I loved this game to DEATH when it first came out on the DS and to now see an HD version of this game on steam.

      "Cassette Beasts: it's high time we dispel the notion that it's merely a Pokémon clone. Developed by Bytten Studio, this game offers a fresh and exhilarating take on the monster taming genre that stands tall on its own merits. Here, we'll dive into what makes Cassette Beasts so unique and why it's a complete masterpiece.\n\nA Unique Twist on Monster Taming:\nAt first glance, some may draw parallels between Cassette Beasts and the Pokémon franchise. After all, both involve capturing and battling creatures, but Cassette Beasts distinguishes itself with its innovative \"cassette\" mechanic. Unlike Pokémon, where you simply capture creatures, in Cassette Beasts, you capture abilities and splice them together to create your own unique monster hybrids. This adds a layer of strategy and creativity that sets it apart from the traditional monster taming formula.\n\nA Riveting and Fast-Paced Story:\nOne of Cassette Beasts' most outstanding features is its gripping storyline. From the moment you step into this pixel-art world, you'll find yourself engrossed in a narrative that unfolds at a breakneck pace. The plot is full of unexpected twists, complex characters, and thought-provoking themes that keep you invested from start to finish. It's not just about capturing monsters; it's about uncovering the mysteries of the world and your character's place in it.\n\nChallenge for the Experienced Gamer:\nCassette Beasts doesn't hold your hand. It offers a refreshing challenge for those seeking a more demanding gaming experience. Battles are strategic and require careful planning. The variety of cassette combinations and the dynamic AI make each encounter a thrilling puzzle to solve. It's a game that rewards skill and strategy, keeping even seasoned gamers on their toes.\n\nVisually Stunning Graphics:\nThe game's pixel-art style is a work of art in itself. The attention to detail in every environment, creature design, and character is astounding. Cassette Beasts manages to evoke a sense of nostalgia while still pushing the boundaries of what pixel art can achieve. It's a visual treat that enhances the overall immersion in the game.\n\nA Masterpiece in the Monster Taming Genre:\nIn summary, Cassette Beasts is nothing short of a masterpiece in the monster taming genre. It successfully distances itself from the Pokémon comparisons with its innovative mechanics, and it offers a captivating story, challenging gameplay, and stunning visuals that set a new standard for the genre.\n\nWhile Pokémon may have laid the foundation for monster taming games, Cassette Beasts takes bold steps in its own direction. Bytten Studio's creation deserves recognition for its dedication to delivering an unforgettable gaming experience that stands tall on its own. Cassette Beasts is more than a clone; it's a genre-defining title that has undoubtedly earned its place among gaming greats.\n\n10/10",
      "Basically Wizard of Legend, but from a different viewpoint. Same composer, both pixel art, similarly fast paced boss fights with good telegraphs, combos are a little less deliberate, though. Very satisfying build making, with solid build variety. Has couch co-op which is very nice. It has some beautiful pixel art, truly. This game is a feast for the eyes and ears with cutscenes, voice acting, and more. Ok, I just love this game. It's so damn good.",
      "This is mostly a worse version of the much better \"Slay the Spire\". Slightly different gameplay (Inscryption has a 'field' and some very limited mechanics from Gwent-like games), but both are deck builders with card alteration and deck probability as a core mechanic. Really expected better from the reviews and a demo that promised more gameplay aspects than seem forthcoming. Not an awful game, and has potential, but it feels like they took a basic card game and never bothered to balance it or build better guidelines for the randomized encounters. \n\nPros\n-Atmosphere is decent\n-Gameplay core is fine and could have promise but is highly random. \n-The 'scale' system works well in concept - winner must be X damage points above the opponent, not a set amount of life. X is too small.\n\nCons\n-'Roguelike' aspects are minimal so far. Even as I get more familiar with gameplay my runs are as likely to end on the first or second map. Grinding the same level doesn't get you anywhere in terms of improvements, since the end game 'summary' is determined by random cards you obtained during your run... which can be very poor. Even then, these seldom show up on future runs in my experience.\n-Few ways to guarantee what cards/powerups you get if you want to focus on any specific type of build. Additionally certain paths are OP, while others are next to worthless. With STS there are far more viable builds, and while some are better than others, most times you could construct one to get you far.\n-Powerups sometimes do nothing (e.g., Instant kill on a card with zero attack is... worthless, but if you add 1 attack it suddenly works), and sometimes create amazing combos.\n-Highly variable battles, often hinging on 1 turn or card draw. Get your top card first? Battle is won. Keep drawing the wrong 'fuel' (card summoning) source? You've lost. Sometimes you'll get 1-2 cards that are a permanent squirrel card, other times you'll need to spend a 1-2 draw actions to even summon a card.\n-Overall atmosphere is interesting, but highly limited and very repetitive. Narrative only changes when you advance and isn't skipable so spending 1 minute each death doing the same death sequence 5 times in a row ruins it. \n-You can't just quit a run. Also the stupid UI that has you click + drag to use the menu system. \n-The room, which functions as your 'rogue-like' element is limited, and once explored is dull. Late 90's graphics, low light. Puzzles are mostly bound by gameplay and even completing a puzzle and adding a card to the pool of possible draws isn't that useful. \n\nThe game needs more features to allow for 'controlled randomness' (e.g., lock certain starting cards for each run, set a preferred powerups/creature type, start encounters with +1-2 cards in hand, expand # of result possibilities, better 'rarity' parity), better permanent powerups (expand past # of \"helper items\" that can be held), scale needs to be larger (once you get the right set-up the game is over the next turn, conversely some scenarios the computer can 'rush' you and a match is over by turn 3-4). Possibly expand # of slots for cards and allow player to have 2 rows, like AI does - would also allow certain powers to be more interesting.",
      "tldr:\nits sniper elite 3,5.\nnot all that bad but then i look at good vs bad, bad wins.\nsince valve/steam still cant be bothered to implement a neutral thumb, its thumbs down from me.\nbuy it on sale if you must, not worth an AAA price tag for sure.\n\n--------\n\nsniper elite 4 is what sniper elite 3 should have been.\nthe maps are much bigger, the melee is far better/fluid, the xray cam is how you wanted it to be and it looks and feels overall pretty nice.\n\nso why didnt i like it, no thumbs up?\nbecause it also feels like its an update to sniper elite 3, nothing more and nothing new. at all.\nand there a re few things that really stuck out and which are just a big NONO:\n\n- the campaign is shockingly short. i read in someones review that they finished it in 6 hours. and i needed 10 or 11. disappointing\n\n- multiplayer is medicore.still.\nit feels half done; copied over from sniper elite 3; and i can never play more than 3 rounds before getting bored. \nand i dont think im alone because most of the time you find as average 3 lobbys for team deathmatch game types.\nbut multiplayer being multiplayer, everyone feels different about it so you may disregard this point if you wish.\n\n- the voice acting is one of the worst you will ever hear. the italian mobster you talk to sounds so bad that i literally started laughing.\nthe lady who gives you intructions via radio before each level sounds like someone working at a XXX hotline.\n\n- i have yet to encounter the high praised AI.\nthey are decent, yes, slightly better than sniper elite 3, on close and mid range... but if you actually manage to get to a high vantage point and snipe across the map, say 400,500m+? , (which is extremely rare btw), then the AI fails horribly.\nyou kill 2 people far away, the AI goes into alert and then calls the search off 5 seconds later because the game realizes you are far, far away and the alerted soldiers would need 5 minutes to get to you, kinda.\nso you can snipe at your hearts content, just wait every so often between shots.\ni have actually cleared an entire level that way. i didnt even move, never got spotted and no one ever knew where the shots came from. \nonce everything was dead, i just visited the objective checkpoints.\n\n- a sniping game that considers shots 100m+ \"Long Shots\" .\n... wut?\n\n- one of the things that bugs me most. dont let the big maps fool you. you only can ever go two ways, on one map 3.\nand finally it doesnt matter which way you go because you have to do all checkpoints anyway, which are both ways.\nthe majority of the map is covered with obstacles and terrain that can not be passed/traversed, forcing you on pre-determined paths.\nits a real themepark where you are forced to go where the developers want you to go. \nit becomes painfully obvious when there are high grass patches strategically placed along your way where the devs think that you should hide there because there you have an opportunity to stealth something for a bit.\nthere really is no freedom of choice when it comes to the map,how you approach things etc.\nall you can do is...left or right? and all guns blazing or try to stay semi-hidden.\nmeeh...\n\n- i remember watching a dev stream that introduced the game ,way before release. i already noticed a DLC button in their alpha client. i knew that was a bad sign...\nright after game release i found half of the items locked for DLCs that havent even been released yet.\ntake that plus very short campaign and below medicore multiplayer and you have zero reason to ever buy any DLC. \njust doesnt make any sense. \nwhy would you, what for?\n\n- releasing a game together with seperate dlcs the same day?\ni didnt expect that from rebellion.\nvery.shabby \n\nnow, having ranted like this....it is not a terrible game all together.\ni had fun while it lasted but it does not justify the price tag,ever.\nit could have been so much more but i guess greed and publisher pressure won at the end.\ni was looking forward to it and left disappointed.\n\nthe ending of the campaign already suggests there will be a sniper elite 5 but this time i shall wait until its on an 85% sale.",
      "On the Steam Store page for [i]Candle[/i] I saw:\n\n1. The game's description: \"Candle is an adventure with challenging puzzles.\"\n2. The 5 most popular tags for the game: Indie, Adventure, Hand-Drawn, Puzzle & Fantasy\n3. The beautiful screenshots\n4. The 'very positive' reviews\n\nSo I bought it. I should have actually read some of the reviews, though. It turns out [i]Candle[/i] is just another platformer game. Granted, it's a \"puzzle-platformer\" but still a platformer where agility, dexterity and a lot of trial & error are key to finishing the game, although there is some light puzzling involved, as well. I don't like platformers. I also don't like pixel hunting for items, which is what you need to do in [i]Candle[/i] to find all the items you need to advance. You see, some items are almost absorbed in the background and frustratingly hard to spot. So there will be a lot of backtracking, unless you follow a guide, which then kills part of the fun anyway.\n\n[b]In summary, just a friendly warning: if you think [i]Candle[/i] is a beautiful point & click adventure game, like I did, don't be fooled. It's actually a beautiful, frustrating platformer game with some light puzzling.[/b]",

      "And that's it, after 278 hours of play, the adventure is over... \nThis type of game that you wish you could forget so you could rediscover it like the 1st time, where you discover everything, a bit like a child\nIt's a game made with passion for video games, to tell a story, to make the player laugh too, and to make him a little melancholic or horrified or even sickened sometimes\n\n[u]Divinity OS 2 will have marked my young adult life[/u], like Sonic and megadrive games, Pokémon, FFTactics, Zelda and gameboy / gamecube games, Warcraft3 (TT), or Mass Effect and other PC games did in my childhood and adolescence (I surely forget so much excellent games)\n\nIt's a 20/20 for me.

      "This is less of a review and more of me gushing about how much im enjoying myself, but you can still get a idea of what the game is from it. I am not usually a puzzle game player, or even a \"chill\" game player. im usually all about quick shooters, fighters, and platformers, but i decided to give this game a shot and i am very glad i did. with a mechanic as simple as pushing trees i thought that it would be simple enough for me to have a good time, the last time i played a puzzle game was BaBa is You and i put 14 hours into it and never got past word 3, it was just too much for me. but this game manages to still be challenging even with it laying all the pieces out in front of me, it introduces new features not by putting one in a level and saying good luck, it makes you do something you have done before but gives a new outcome, because you never got to do that thing in that exact way before, and when puzzles start requiring you to do those things you wonder how you ever got that far without doing one of those things before. all of the mechanics and solutions also are based in logic, all your doing is pushing things, so you dont have to suspend your current understanding of things to learn a new mechanic. The world of the game is also very relaxing and sucks me right in, its a museum of the \"past\" of humans that takes place in the far future from the perspective of monsters who dont really understand human culture, and it is hilarious! the music is very chill and moves with your actions, when you push something in a specific way the music also does a specific things, and its part of the reason this game is so relaxing. most other puzzle games i have played frustrate me when i get stuck on a puzzle for a long time, but seeing the monster relax helps me relax and keep a level head to get to the next museum exhibit. i dont know how to end this review but if you read it i hope you dont feel like i wasted your time!",
      "*LOOK INTO SAFETY/SECURITY RISKS BEFORE BUYING THIS GAME*\n\n     Playing this game online can be risky as hackers are able find your IP address, mess with your in-game / weapons / health / money, find out your personal information, install rats on your PC & even get into your computer. Although this isn't super common it's still a legitimate thing that people need to know about & should look into before spending their money on this game. It doesn't happen as much to random players but Streamers have to play this game in offline mode whenever they stream themselves playing otherwise the hackers will mess with whatever they're doing by trying to get them banned. \nPlease google \"Black ops 3 PC security risks 2022\". It really is a shame that Treyarch isn't coming back to fix this very serious problem in their game, but let's be real Activision  more than likely isn't letting them. \n\nTL;DR: Be cautious of potential security issues, but I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes Call of Duty Zombies / zombies in general or who wants to get into the Call of Duty Zombies franchise.\n\nNow for my review:\n     Best call of duty game ever for Zombies. Definitely can be a challenge to find multiplayer matches nowadays but zombie matches aren't hard to find as long as you're playing the \"popular\" maps. The \"less popular\" maps are more difficult to find a match on but it's still possible, especially if you search for a match at the right time of day. This goes for multiplayer as well, if you search for a match during specific times you will be more likely to find matches (I'm not entirely sure when these times are so I wont even leave my guess here). This is likely because of people in different time-zones getting up / getting off work or school and getting on the game.\n     This game is the best thing to ever happen to the Zombies series in terms of gameplay, storyline, progression & more. There are endless tasks, items & surprises in each map that keep you coming back for more and having a different experience each time! It truly is a wonderful & fun game that has offered me more re-play ability than any other game I've ever experienced, especially with custom zombies/mod tools. With community made maps there's literally endless maps/levels to play on, & because of mod tools we not only have the remakes that come with Zombies Chronicles but we also have the visually stunning remakes of Mob of the Dead, Call of the Dead & Town, with Buried as well as Die Rise on the way for 2023/2024! I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes Call of Duty Zombies / zombies in general or who wants to get into the Call of Duty Zombies franchise.",
      "I am a 43 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he helped me. Loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.\nThank you <3",

      "I would describe this game as a 'befriending sim' with a very shallow veneer of farming/resource gathering/'witchy' activities. The farming/mining/fishing is nowhere near as fun or sophisticated as other games e.g. Stardew Valley. And there are no customisation options - even very shallow ones - to make the game experience your own, e.g. the layout of your farm and buildings can't be changed or decorated, there's no home decoration, no character customisation or clothing options. So the game feels very linear and daily tasks are repetitive and grind-y. There's also a dearth of special/seasonal occasions which adds to the repetition.\n\nAnd even though this game majors on the social/befriending angle, which is largely ok, it still doesn't feel quite right. You can get to be 'good friends' with a character and they still repeat dialogue asking if you've met their family members (of course you have) and/or your character asks them really basic getting-to-know-you type questions that previous cutscenes have already answered. The voice acting is great though.\n\nI think this game would have been a lot better had it been done as an all-out graphic novel/choices matter game, and dropped the farming etc. As it is, it's a jack of all trades and master of none.",

      "First, there was Guitar Hero. Now you've got Guitar Nero. \n\nIt's wild that this came out of nowhere, because this is easily one of the best games I've ever played. This is what I've been waiting for rhythm games to be like since Space Channel 5 on Dreamcast.",
      "So um, I don't usually write reviews like this or much at all really. I mostly make unfunny jokes and call it a review or something super generic. I guess I'll just write whats on my mind.\n\nI really liked this game.\nI felt like I was a kid again playing Super Mario 64.\nSometimes I get tired of shooting guns. Or slashing fantasy monsters with some shiny sword. Or saving the magic land from evil. Or using hyper combos I never remember. Or collecting resources to build a quirky town. Or time managing some distant farm. Or driving some tricked out vehicles. Or investing in status points to make super strong characters. Or following a long and convoluted plot with crazy lore.\n\nSometimes I just wanna run and jump around while I pick up some cool looking stuff.\nI, uh, had a lot fun playing this game. \nThanks.",
      "Not what the developers promised.\nFeels like a graphics mod for Chivalry.\n\nI'm not a fan of Chivalry either. I had some fun with it, but couldn't bear the clunkiness and wished for intuitive controls and realistic fights. Mordhau promised exactly that. \nAlthough it's equally clunky und even more buggy.\n\nAlso it doesn't offer the option to play in private rooms with your friends (duel mode) or only on paid servers. Inviting a friend to a local match should be a standard feature.\n\nAll the new content and features don't really matter - it's a PvP fighting game. I need only a couple of weapons that work, not 100+ that don't.",
      "Launch controversy aside, what this game should have been called for the longest time is 'Early Access'. Around the time of the Beyond update is when I'd say would have been the true 'launch'. \n\nI didn't get this when it first came out, but even when I did it was a fragmented mess of a game. Now, finally, with the Beyond and Synthesis updates there's a solid game here that's almost (but not quite) like what Sean Murray promised way back at the beginning.\n\nPerformance on PC has dramatically improved with the switch over to the Vulkan API, and it finally supports Ultrawide and various other PC-specific options. The game itself provides a significant amount of variety, offering a combination of Elite-lite and 'Minecraft in Space' mechanics. There's plenty to see and do, and the exploration aspect is enjoyable - if a little bland. The planetary biomes and overall game could still do with further diversity, but there's plenty here to get to your teeth into.\n\nHello Games show no sign of slowing down their support for the game either, having just recently released a bizarre in-game music synthesizer of all things, and going by the evidence of their progress to date I can only see the game improving further as time moves on.\n\nEDIT - 24/09/2020 \"Origins\" Patch: well, you can ignore the previous comments about diversity being a bit on the low side. They already added things like living ships, derelicts, space creatures and robots since I made this review, and with the Origins patch the variety of experience on offer is on such a scale now that I don't think I'm going to be lacking for things to do for some time. Also, impressively, the game runs even better than it did when I originally posted this - and the rejigged UI looks fantastic on Ultrawide. \n\nBrilliant work by the team at Hello Games. I can't think of any game I've played (and I've been indulging since the late 80's) where I've ever gone from \"I can't stand this\" to \"this is one of my favourite games\". It's taken a while to get here, but No Man's Sky is definitely one of the greats.",
      "I even set a calendar reminder so that I could get this on release. I wish I hadn't bothered. Going great guns until I got to the passage. Game over as I can't progress. Tried allsorts to drop the jammer but unable to do so. I guess it is a case of waiting for all the bugs to get resolved.",
      "It is a total eyegasm with a captivating story/lore. If you're even a tiny bit interested in anything f*cked-up and mysterious (SCP-like), buy this.\n\nFrom the gameplay perspective, it is simply good. Nothing mind-blowing, but good nonetheless.\n\nI've completed the game with a couple of sidequests (there are more for me) in about 13 hours, and there are two story DLC + the Expeditions mode, so I anticipate at least another 10+ hours of gameplay. Which is great for the price.\n\nUpdate: I've put in ~10 more hours to complete the Foundation DLC. It is a good DLC, and brings a few more hours of joy living in this world. It also has some sick areas (like that dark cave with the TV). The overall design is a bit more dull, but I enjoyed the story.",
      "Okay this is a weird situation. I personally don't like this game all that much, but I do still recommend it nonetheless. That's because despite me not being personally huge on it, I can't deny that it is a very well-crafted game that definitely will give people the experience they want if this is the type of game they're looking for. I, turns out, am not part of the crowd that is targeted for said experience. I just found the whole trial and error stealth RTS style of this game to just not be my cup of tea, but again I can't deny its very well-crafted. I also think the art style and voice acting and story are all very well done as well. So yeah, if you're fond of games of this type, then go for it. I'm sure you won't be disappointed. I, for one, don't think I'm entirely sold on it though.",
      "1 week before release i played the demo, it was a 20 minutes demo that was very underwhelming, but i still thought i should give the game a chance to see if it gets better later on.\n\nIt doesn't.\n\nSo the first thing i read about this game in the embed of the steam link was \"a fresh take on the jrpg genre\", and its probably the biggest problem of the game. It is really the most basic, mediocre turn base combat you can find.\n\nTurn base combat, rock paper scissor elemental types plus physical, materia base skills with few spots (i had only 4 skills activated),  no gear, no party. Does that sound like a fresh take to you?\n\nSo if the gameplay is so barebones it means is at least hard right? Well no, it is basic and easy. The start is easy, in the mid part they blow up the HP of enemies so you understand you should buy new skills, and once you do it the game is easy again. Mob enemies are generally harder than bosses because you are 1vs3 most of the time, while in bosses you can just debuff it and make it slow, while you have 2 turns to spam healings and hitting. There also some questionable decisions on the minor mechanics of the combat system but i don't think they matter (see some paragraphs below)\n\nNow here is what is really the \"fresh take\": the setting being cyberpunk. Everything is written with tech terminology. The mana is called data, block and delay turn is called cache, melee combat is called hack? some of the terms don't even make sense of what they actually do. Also because we obviously live in a technological society we have people called \"V-sync\" or \"Nullpointer\", expresions like \"Digits!\" or \"Oh my grind!\", you know, normal behaviour if you ask me.\n\nThe story is pretty standard for a futuristic setting, it wasn't bad but also it wasn't good, pretty normal.\n\nThe artstyle is cool, the music is generally cool, which i think its why most people would don't mind the boring gameplay and will just play for the story, which is also present in the game itself because you have options to either skip every random encounter (yeah we have those here) or to insta win every battle when you want it.\n\nSo if you want to try this game because of the \"fresh take in the jrpg genre\" you will be disappointed, if you have played jrpgs before there is nothing new in this game, you have already played it before.",
      "The game is a masterpiece, just like the first one. After finishing PoE 1, I immediately started with the second one and I was treated to another marvel of a game. Here are some of my thoughts:\n\nThe Good:\n-Very good main story but the side content is what made this game great\n-Interesting and deep characters, both new ones and some returning from the first game, including companions\n-The story picks up after the events of the first game and is a direct continuation of the first game (just like with Baldur’s Gate 1 and 2)\n-If you still have the savegame-files from the first game, your decisions and consequences from the first game will carry over\n-There is so much lore, if you are into reading and listening to stories\n-A lot of voice-acting\n-A lot of pets you can collect and the equipped one has a small benefit to your party\n-Interesting races and sub-races, each with its own boons and downsides\n-Interesting classes and sub-classes, including the possibility of multi-classes\n-You can retrain your characters\n-You can make a new character to join your party at any time at tavern\n-Item and weapon diversity (including pistols)\n-You have the option to play the game as either turn-based (like divinity original sin) or real time (with game pause, just like Baldur’s Gate)\n-You can sail the seas as a pirate and attack any ship you meet without consequence. The ships on the map will respawn endlessly so you will never run out, which makes them a real great source of income.\n-Besides the ship you are given at the beginning, there are a few others you can buy. Each has its own benefits\n-Ship, crew and sailing require some management, but if you like this sort of stuff you can get real invested in it \n-Exploring the map by ship, if you are into that kind of stuff\n-When engaging other ships, you have a choice between boarding or naval combat\n-Endurance is no longer a thing so you only need to manage your Health during fights. You will like this if you were not a big fan of the Endurance vs Health system from the first game\n-The resting system has improved. Besides taverns, now you can rest anywhere you want as long as you have food\n-No inventory management is necessary. Your inventory is infinite so just pick everything up because sooner or later you might need things like explosives, potions, tools etc.\n-Choice matters, and boy are there a lot of different paths you can choose from\n-Romance options\n-Bounties are fun and offer good experience and money\n-DLCs are a bit shorter than the one from the first game, but they are just as good (will not describe them to avoid spoilers)\n\nThe Bad:\n-Loading screens are too long and too many\n-Just like in the first game, I reached max level at about 2/3 of the game(max level 20) so any experience gathered beyond that was pointless. By the end of the game could have easily reached level 30 if that was a thing\n-Naval combat is scripted, so it might not be as spectacular as you might imagine\n-Exploring islands on foot isn’t so much fun\n-The idea of factions might not be to everyone’s liking\n-After playing for a few hours, the game performance seems to decrease and my pc struggled with running it. Maybe the game has an optimization problem but it’s possibly that this one is on me and the game is fine. This might not be the case for other users.\n\nAdvice:\n-In the beginning of the game, try to reach Neketaka asap and do as many quests there as you can before heading out on your ship exploring the seas\n-Pick everything up. Your inventory space is infinite and you will end up needing diverse items like explosives, traps, tools etc.\n-Always have tools with you: hammer and chisel, prybar, lockpicks, grappling hook. You will really need them from time to time\n-Plundering other ships is a great source of experience, resources and money but be careful not to burn yourself out if you do it for too long\n-If you get stuck on a quest, just do some online research\n-Invest money in your ship and crew as soon as you can\n-Always have a tank and healer in the party\n-Make sure to diversify the skills of your party. It’s always good to have someone with Mechanics, Religion, Athletics or Diplomacy most of all\n-Enchant your items\n-When you get the white/grey colored legendary items, make sure to bind them to the character you equip them on and do the mini-quests inscribed on them to unlock new powers and features\n-Use summons, as they are great for distracting enemies. They can take a lot of hits and also dish it out\n\nMy game experience:\nI played on the classic (normal) difficulty, just like I do with every new game I start, and found the game not very hard but fun. I played the game in real time, because turn-based takes too long. As soon as I got my first ship working, I sailed to Neketaka, found the last companions I knew I wanted on my permanent team (Maia and Pallegina) and just quested away in the city until I had enough money and levels under my belt to start exploring the seas and attack other ships. I never did the scripted naval combat because I was having too much fun boarding the ships and watch my characters fight. My party consisted of my Watcher (Moon Godlike, Chanter, specced in summoning), Eder (because he’s a beast of a tank and has some fun interactions with others), Xoti (gotta have a healer, she’s also fun to have around), Maia Rua (very good ranged DPS and she comes with a pet cause she’s a ranger) and Pallegina, who is an excellent off-tank and support character. Once I took to the seas, I made my fortune by plundering ships, equipped my ship and characters with the best money could buy and then just catered to the different existing factions in the Deadfire, while not loosing sight of my main mission.\n\nI had a great time playing Pillars of Eternity 1 and 2. I consider they offer some great replay value and are great fun if you are into this style of RPG games. If you are a fan of games like the Baldur’s Gate, Icewind Dale, Diablo, Dragon Age, Neverwinter Nights and Divinity Original Sin series, you must try PoE 1 and 2.\nI really hope they make Pillars of Eternity 3.\n",
      "Before I continue writing my review on this game, I got to say that the PC port of Valkyria Chronicles is one of the best, if not, [u]the[/u] best port. The game was originally exclusive for the PlayStation 3 back in 2008. The game was well received, but garnered low sales that would put the sequels Valkyria Chronicles 2 and 3 on the PSP. I actually never heard of this game before until a few week prior to the PC release on November 2014. That said, I will have to give a standing ovation to Sega for putting an effort to make the PC port well optimized in 1080p (or more) at 60 FPS (or more). Sega has my attention and I will present this review.\n \nValkyria Chronicles focuses on Welkin Gunther, a son of a legendary general who fought in the First Europan War, leads a platoon of some adults and teenage volunteers to defend their country against the invading forces of the Imperial Alliance. The game presents a mix of tactical strategy and third-person action that is very unique in the strategy game genre. Does this game deserve your attention? \n\nThe story takes place in a “fictional” European continent where the Second Europan War was fought primarily between the Atlantic Federation (think of all of the European countries, in a geographical sense) versus the Imperial Alliance (Russia, in a geographic sense). Gallia is a “neutral” country where it contains a unique resource known as Ragnite. Thus, the Imperial Alliance invade Gallia to get Ragnite to fuel up their war resources. One of the greatest parts about the game is how well the developers use analogies from World War II into the game and its execution is well-received. The analogies ranged from weapon designs (like the Gallian Scout weapons that look like the Soviet SVT-40 to the Imperial weaponry comparison to the real-life MP40 and STG44, and plenty others). The analogy extends to vehicles and geopolitical conflicts. \n\nThe character developments in the game are highly impressive, particularly with the relationship between Welkin (protagonist) and Alicia Melchiott (deuteragonist). The themes in Valkyria Chronicles consist a good mix of “light” moments (like hope as an example) and “semi-grotesque” themes of war (such as discrimination/racism, personal ambition over soldiers’ lives, and others themes that will unravel later on). Some reviewers criticized the game as being not serious on the themes about war. Honestly, I don’t think that the game is supposed to be depressing and a good mix between “light” and “dark” is best suited for the game. The story starts really slow in the beginning and actually begin to progress as you reach a certain point in the story. The plot is pretty good in most area while few scenes are a bit “awkward” in terms of sudden shifts between a sad event to a “positive motivation”. \n\nThe gameplay in Valkyria Chronicles is turn-based, but it is very unique because once you click on a character to choose, you can actually control the character to move to any location in third-person you like as long you have enough Action Points (basically, the movement bar). Experience points and money are earned by Ranks (like A, B, C, and D) by completing an objective within a certain number of turns (Example: Getting a ‘A’ rank within 3 turns or less to get the maximum amount of exp and money). However, it is possible that you can actually kill all of the enemies on the map, complete the objective, and still get an ‘A’ rank in the majority of missions (except for a few of them). \n\nWith the exp and money, you train your soldiers based on classes Scout, Shocktrooper, Lancer (Anti-Tank/Explosives), Engineers, and Sniper rather than individuals. The money are used up to upgrade weapons, buy tank parts, and purchasing “reports” from a reporter in certain chapters in the story. The game would last you a good 30-50 hours if you play the game in a smart, tactical manner or have an “OCD” on getting an “A” rank on every single mission in the story or a mix of both (like I did). \n\nThe game does have some faults, particularly when it comes to classes. Reviewers argued that Scouts are too overpowered, but in my view, it is best to say that scouts are too reliable since they have the most movement bar and top-tier weapons like the ZM Kar 8 (the game's version of Soviet PTRS-41 that can obliterate any enemy, even medium and heavy tanks if you shoot it in the back). Engineers are useless in the game since you won’t repair your tank very often (depending on your play style) and Scouts are the better alternative. There are some bugs in the game that is related to the monitor refresh rate (if you play it on a 144 Hz monitor like I did) in certain missions in the story. PC controls are a bit awkward when you control the tank. There are a few moments in the story that has some poor “transitions” (an example would be that an upsetting moment happened in the story and all of a sudden, some of the major characters wanted a medal for their part on a major battle in the next cutscene as if that upsetting moment never happen or affected them). \n\nThe game is often compared to XCOM when it comes to gameplay. This may be true, but Valkyria Chronicles is very unique since you can actually control the character in third person instead of the computer doing it for you when you command the character to move from Point A to B, in bird’s eye view. The game engine is very aesthetic and presents the story very well. I’m glad the Sega released Valkyria Chronicles to the PC and I am very pleased to hear that a (possible) new Valkyria Chronicles game is being trademarked (and hopefully in development) thanks to the PC sales. The default price of $20 is a good deal, -50% off is a great deal, -75% is a perfect steal. Valkyria Chronicles is one of my top games for 2014 due to its unique strategy gameplay and superb PC port optimization. I am looking forward for the new game that is being trademarked (or possible PC ports or revamp for VC2 and 3). This game has my highest recommendation for any strategy gamer who want to find something original, unique, and beautiful.",

      "Originally a Skyrim mod known for its story and interesting main driving mechanic is made 100 times better here by having its own fleshed out art style and textures, deeper story and characters",
      "Quite possibly the worst game ever.  The menus and navigation appear to have been designed to deliberately confuse the player.  At no point is there any guidance as to what the player should be doing.  Free roam is fun, but the driving physics are nonexistent.  \n\nInstruction comes in the form of a tiny text readout for a complicated step, and is never repeated or accessible.\n\nMost frustrating of all?  Its impossible to just simply quit the game without messing with the entire interface in a while goose chase for a way to exit the application.  I finally settled on ctrl-alt-del, but the game even withstood an end task and simply kept playing.  Had to hard boot my computer.\n\nTotal garbage.",

      "It was a nice little trip, about 8 hours of gameplay (A bit more if you feel like grinding)\nStory went along nicely from start to end, in no place felt rushed.All sidequest can be done as you progress on the story.\nCombat is nice, and gotta apply every mechanic you had learnt about to fight the final boss.\nThe music, both in fights and background is really nice, has some nice Cyber-future feel\nRecommended? Yes. \nRating 9/10. Hoping for DLC or sequel soon enough",
      "Pretty fun and polished for a fast paced shooter.\nOn the technical side, the game ran well and I encountered very few bugs: in a few cases I got stuck in the level geometry, but then a failsafe teleported me back to a safe spot after a few seconds, and in another case I got softlocked by a broken level trigger but reloading the last checkpoint fixed it.\nAll the weapons are fairly useful and interesting, and they can be combined in creative ways instead of the extremely boring \"use A on B\" seen in Doom Eternal.\nEnemy variety is pretty good, even the lowest tiers are different enough to require a bit of attention.\nThe levels also aren't bad, but you have so much mobility that it's easy to sequence break by accident and in some cases skip past large chunks of them.\nSecrets aren't terrible, no wall humping required in this game, but given the sheer size of most levels they can be pretty tedious to find even when no attempt is made to hide them: in some cases, the opposite is true and you'll just walk into a \"secret\" by looking to your side as you follow the intended path.\nDifficulty is odd: I was playing on Street Cleaner (the middle of the 5 difficulty levels), and around the halfway point the game went from \"very easy\" to \"very hard\", with plenty of attacks dealing 300+ damage when the most you can stack is 200 health and 200 armor.\nAt least, the augments you collect in-game and the mutators you unlock by finding secrets offer plenty of ways to fine-tune the difficulty level: for example, you can enable infinite ammo and instagib to breeze through even the hardest difficulty, or disable all weapons but your chainsaw leg and triple enemy spawns to turn even the easiest difficulty into a bit of a challenge.\nFinally, there's a level editor and that's always nice.\n\nWorth playing, even at full price.",
      "A dude looked at you funny? Punch him. Some guy is chilling by the river? Kick him in. A girl has a cute outfit on? Divekick her from across the street. Bought pizza at a food truck? Uppercut the staff. Violence is never the answer; It is in fact the question, and the answer is YES.",
      "I bought the game and the mechanics are fun! The battle system is super impactful and just FEELS fun. It really gives you a sense of satisfaction. And it has interesting elements that really every game should have... but the UI sucks, the classes are genderlocked, and there are so many systems going on at once it's annoying. Like something as simple as a constant notification in the middle of the screen of some other person or random guild you know nothing about doing quests or getting skill points. It's a fun game, but has WAAAY too many minor (except genderlocked classes. Genderlock is never a minor thing) problems that just add up making it annoying to play",
      "Why did i get this game???\n\nWell.. Mainly because i've always liked seeing those big trucks driving by me, So i wondered what it would feel like driving a big tractor trailer, And so i got this!\n\nHonestly, I can't say if it's anything like a real truck, But this game does get very very complicating when it comes to parking with your 53' container, And it makes me wonder, Wow! Those guys must really have some good practice! Because if i can't do it here, I for sure wont be able to do it in real life! xD\n\nMultiplayer is super fun as well, Driving next to other truck drivers and then honking at them, or meeting new friends, SOME actually truck drivers, and then traveling with them, Stopping to weight your freight, getting gas and such, It's a very fun experience.\n\nHonest Rating: 10/10 As of right now, Because I feel like i haven't played enough to experience any problems or bugs, But the game is very fun!! ***ONLY IF YOU LOVE SIMULATOR GAMES, If you don't, Then maybe think twice, But I enjoy simulator games.*** And if you want to give this game a try as your first Simulator game, Then i would recommend it!\n\nRecommendable? Yes, I recommend it to people who want to give Simulator games a try, This is a perfect one. (Or Euro Truck Simulator) Although if you're from the USA i recommend this one, Because Euro Truck Simulator has different driving rules than US, So you might get tickets for some things you don't know lol..",
      "When reading reviews for this game you'll generally find two camps. There are people who find DW:U incredibly deep and engaging, and there are those who find it incredibly obtuse and frustrating. The problem is they're both right. The game does feature a wealth of features, and you will almost certainly never experience them.\n\nEven for a player like me who is used to impenetrable strategy games like Europa Universalis this was difficult to play. Income see-saws drunkenly from crippling deficit to fabulous surplus and back again depending on what's happening this exact second. Land combat units are jam packed into impossibly tiny UI bars. AI factions have reams of vague, undefined character traits. The encyclopedia technically gives information on everything but is so poorly organized and unsearchable as to verge on useless.\n\nWith time, practice, and a lot of time spent researching on independent websites you can have fun with this game. But for sixty dollars you shouldn't have to, and quite frankly, don't. Find yourself one of the many excellent 4Xs in the store and pass over this ambitious but ultimately flawed gem.",
      "[I received this product for free from a giveaway]. Only played for a short time, but sheesh, it's a bit of a mess both visually and gameplay wise. There's not much I can really say that would differ from what's shown in the trailer (rather crude MS-paint looking drawings with a few short looping backgrounds). You jump when moving right or left, flappy-bird esque, you dodge stuff going across the screen and from the top, which is a bit boring to me, but some may enjoy it more. You also have to go out of the screen to dodge sometimes, but also if you go too far out (who knows how far) you'll die as well. It might be an okay time waster for free (like old flash games), but I wouldn't recommend spending your money on this.",

      "This now classic arcade made history as being one of the first twin-stick shooters that employed 3D arenas in an interesting manner - this was an important addition to the shmup genre, which really blew me away as a developer working in the same genre. But this also brought a problem: the gameplay was made harder by the 3D rotating camera. \n \nIt impacts overall visibility and the clarity of collision between the player and the enemies. Also, the game is often late with its warnings to the player related to the incoming appearance of enemies.\n \nThis makes the player die occasionally not because of their own error but due to visual glitches. \n \nI personally didn't like the upgrades because I found it unclear in what ways are they affecting the gameplay and they didn’t really help me achieve higher scores. \nOther noteworthy features include 12 battle modes including Paciﬁsm, King, Claustrophobia and 4 all-new modes, but also the local co-op.\n \nOverall this is an interesting addition to Geometry Wars franchise, but Geometry Wars 2 still sits on the throne. If you are a GW fan, I would recommend this game because it shines in all other aspects. \n\nIf you are looking for other interesting shooter games, I would like to invite you to check our community group on Steam:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/593680\n\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/593680/Rocking_Pilot/",

THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU!\n\nFor the rest, save your money.\n\nIt's so buggy, dark, poorly optimized, and confusing; you'll spend more time pulling your hair out than the rare moments that it actually manages to pull off a jumpscare. Also, it is NOT procedurally generated at all. Watched a YouTuber play this game and got the exact same map and jumpscares... er... \"jumpscares\" as they did. Not worth $10. If they can fix the bugs and tweak a few things, though, it'd at least be worth 5.\n",
      "As a cybersecurity professional , I would classify this game as malware, or at the least adware.\nWhy? It opens up a number, at least 10 when I checked, of connections to various points on the internet which have no purpose in running the game. They are only there so the vendor can spam you with advertising, track you, or for other unspecified activities. \nAs such, I can NOT recommend this game. \n\nTo verify, I disconnected my computer from the internet. The game ran fine without the advertising and tracking. \nThen I connected back to the internet, and launched the game. The game opened at least 10 connections(!).\nThen, while still connected to the internet, I blocked the game's network-connecting executables in the firewall. In such a case, the game behaves differently, apparently it sees there is an active connection so it runs for a while, then when it cannot make it's for-bad-purposes network connections, it terminates and you can't play. \nThis is bad behavior that I would only expect from spyware and malware. I hope the vendor fixes it so the software runs in the manner they declare - it is supposed to not require network connectivity after the initial run as they describe in the System Requirements. \nSteam should be reigning in this behavior as well.",
      "As i previously stated, i was going to play through metro fully and i have done so, so here is my update to this review. \nThis game is not the best selling triple A game in the world and it may have some bugs (like a table that wasnt solid or the objects in that room lol) however it is a decent game. the story is decent and the characters voices are way off but they sorta make up for it with their personalities. \n\nExploration in this game is by far one of the most interesting in my opinion and the way your character acts in the enviroment makes it more interesting aswell, for example wiping your visor when it gets dirty (wasnt that helpful for me in my play through but it was a nice touch) and your visor taking damage in combat adds to the immersive feel of this wasteland/paradise almost. Scavenging weapons and parts and combining them to make better equipment is quite intriguing and quick to do if you can find the parts. \n\nat the end of the day my final review of this is its a good game i would play it again even if it is a bit clunky sometimes (atleast it was for me lmao)\n\n\n\n\n\nOh and hopefully my punctuation is good enough so no one passes out this time lmao",
      "I've been completely in love with this game ever since the Mojam prototype \"Wasteland Kings\" was released. It's an insanely fun, fastpaced \"roguelike-like\" or \"roguelite\" with randomly generated worlds and tons of weapons to find. On top of that, the developers stream the development of the game on tuesdays and thursdays over at Twitch and they release updates to the game every week. To me, this is the best game of its kind and I've put tons of hours into mastering it (and I still die. Often. It's difficult okay?).",
      "I got this game on a whim because I once played this series like... a decade ago. DW3/4 to be specific. And even though I know full well that this sort of game is basically meant for consoles, I managed to play it just fine once I adjusted the key bindings to stuff that worked well for me. Anyway... game.\n\nIf, like me, you have played these games before, you pretty much know what you are in for. If you have never played any of these games, I'm not quite sure what else is quite like it. Basically it's a fighting game, except it is on large battlefield maps where you murder thousands of random and a handful of named NPC's while following objectives in order to complete each level. If that sounds repetitive... well it can certainly be that. It's the ultimate hack and slash-fest game, and if you get bored with murdering insane numbers of enemies, then chances are this game is not for you.\n\nThe game is based upon the Three Kingdoms era of Ancient China (184-280, roughly), and, despite the absurd outfits and personalities of many of the characters in the game, it is actually fairly consistent with what is known about the period. Or rather, it is consistent with the famous novel 'Romance of the Three Kingdoms' by Luo Guanzhong, which is basically a work of historical fiction that takes real events and bends them a bit according to the whims and views of the author. Which, of course, means that certain characters (particularly Shu-Han characters like Xuande/Liu Bei) are depicted as noble honorable sorts fighting for justice while others (like Mengde/Cao Cao) are depicted as villanous and driven by ambition. I don't want to dig too deep into this because there most likely are entire books written about how Luo Guanzhong messed around with the characters, but the depictions he made are pretty much what are found in this and all previous DW games. The nice thing though is that if you read between the lines (or maybe it's just because I am very familiar with the source material this game is based off of), you can see the flaws in the author's bias in the game as well. Namely that Liu Bei was a massive hypocrite every bit as ambitious as his rivals, and that Cao Cao, while not exactly the nicest guy around, wasn't the hellspawn other characters (like Liu Bei) called him.\n\nAnyway, the game follows the story decently well, though some creative license and trimming down obviously has happened. I still liked how the game depicted things most of the time. Perhaps my favorite was Lu Bu's campaign which, while maintaining the massive \"OMG ITS LU BU\" hype that all DW games have had, reveals exactly why the real Lu Bu got himself executed in chapter 19 of a 120 chapter book: that he was dumb as a brick, betrayed people constantly, and never listened to anyone's advice. While the old DW games I played did have storylines for him, they didn't take the historical route that this game's (default) story path takes. The same goes for the numerous character deaths shown, though many of these are made more dramatic than they actually were.\n\nAlso, while the playable character cast has increased to the point of total insanity (including some that may not have even existed or actually fought on battlefields), I did like that, in the time between DW4 and this, they added a number of characters that rounded out the cast further by including some of the other lesser-known strategists (Chen Gong, Lu Su) and characters who rose to prominence in the later parts of the story (Deng Ai, the sons of Guan Yu/Zhang Fei, as well as the entire Jin faction who were the ultimate winners of this whole mess). I thought that was a nice treat since these sorts had been badly neglected in past games, where everything seemed to stop at the year 234 (when Kongming/Zhuge Liang died), which was roughly the chronological halfway point of the entire story.\n\nOk, I better stop and just finish this up.\n\nIn short, It's a DW game. That means that on the one hand, the combat gets repetitive, many of the characters are very hard to take seriously, and many of the story events are overdramatized to the point of being kind of ridiculous. On the other hand, there is a MASSIVE amount of content (and all those DLC's for this \"Complete Edition\" are purely cosmetic), big battles are kind of fun, and one can even argue that the storyline's inherent cheesiness may actually be more a positive than a negative.\n\nIf you have never played one of these games before, this is the one i'd look at because (to my knowledge) it's the newest one and has an insane amount of content even compared to its predecessors. If you have played these and liked them before... why not? If you didn't like these games however, then most likely this will do nothing to change your opinion.\n\nFor all it's goofiness and repetition, DW is still entertaining enough for me to waste sizeable amounts of time with it. Hooray and stuff.",

Matches are fast paced, with the only goal being \"stay alive longer than your friends\". It almost reminds me of a competetive version of Super Crate Box (the gunplay feels similar). \n\nIf you're looking for a goofy game to play with some of your friends, whether locally or online, pick this game up.",
      "[strike][h1]Best Sex Language Synonym Reference Book 2016, 10/10[/h1][/strike]\n\n-Nah. Not really.\n\nEdit: Upon completing this game, here's something I'll have to claim in advance: while still recommending this great game with an 8 out of 10 and it has quite a solid story, I'll have to admit  that apart from Dorothy's hidden scenario, this game did not dig very deep into its cyberpunk/dystopian background, which is really a pity - and it's becoming the reason to expect another game (more specifically, A [b]SEQUEL[/b]!!!!! or prequel) from them :)\n\nVA-11 Hall-A - or Valhalla for convenience - while seemingly was a Waifu Bartending Simulation game, is actually somewhat [i]Papers, Please[/i] with excellent characters, vivid graphics, elaborated dialogues and not-so-mind-fucking gaming mechanics.\n\nDon't get me wrong: I love [i]Papers, Please[/i] and of course would rather NOT say that one is superior to another; they are both one of their unique kind, but with the very same root - under the daily life of dystopia denizens, truth and conspiracies weave with vague notices in advance; and just before you could think twice things are going really, really out of track.\n\nThat being said, I mean these two games are very similiar in story-telling: as long as you enjoy taking in all the random, weird stories as a bystander, just to find out that all these fragments come together and form a bigger picture, this game is definitely for you. And you get cyberpunk waifus, a Joshikousei hologram, a pretty cool onêchan as protagonist - and more!\n\nLast but not least, the developers of this game are nothing but truly [b]RESPECTABLE[/b]. We have crybabies on Kickstarter and Steam Early Access every focking day blaming everything for their faulty products, while this army of two whined [b]NOTHING[/b] about all the fuck-ups in Venezuela unless asked. Game dalayed? Only apologies, no excuses. That deserves a huge fricking medal and Developer of The Year.\n\nGrab the game if you want some real relax and good story before they grab Dorothy.

Stirpped down graphics can still be beautiful, no cutscenes and dialogue force the use of imagination (God forbid), both for player and desginer, in both telling the story and weaving it into gameplay, and the ambient music is both mysterious and foreboding; setting an atmosphere that makes the game's world feel all the more vast and unknown.\n\nOne of the best games this year, I'm calling it. One of the best gaming experiences I've had since Shovel Knight. There's no going wrong in picking up this title.

      "When I originally watched the anime, I heard a number of comments to the effect of 'this was kind of a bad adaptation, the visual novel is a lot more complete' Having completed it, I'm now of the opinion that both the show and the VN are a complete mess.\n\nSpoilers!\n\nGranted, I know WHY zero exists, it makes sense. The ending of the original VN and show needed justification, in some sense they are a great, unearned leap forward. A different Okabe had to go through a lot of character development, growth and maturing to become the person who could create the plan that would lead them all to the world line where no one suffers, that would let the original Okabe deceive the world, change the future without changing established details of the past.\n\nTo that end, SG0 aims to show that growth, to show the necessary suffering of the world, of his friends, of himself that allowed for him to become the person that could reach that future, that could make the right choice.\n\nAt its core, there's a meaningful message about generational suffering, about the meaning of history, about (stepping out of the fictional paradigm of world lines and time travel) how all of the past is needed to create a better future. Daru and other characters help Okarin realize this truth, that the world lines where they've suffered aren't wasted time, doomed worlds, that they were necessary steps toward reaching a better future.\n\nThat's all really great, honestly, so why do I so dislike SG0?\n\nWell, about 5% of the show and VN is about these themes, is about the necessity of growth, about accepting yourself, about the character development that's needed for Okabe. The conflicts are there, they're established, it's all set up, but then what does SG0 do with most of its time? \n\nFunctionally, nothing, it's full of dumb filler, harem tropes, and undeveloped characters that still get a lot of time spent on them. I'm talking about you, Kagari!\n\nThe original VN and show are, at first, a slow-burn mystery with rising tension as SERN closes in and chuunibyou fantasy becomes nightmarish reality. It becomes thrillingly-paced while simultaneously reflective and philosophical about its themes and the events that have unfolded, about the dangers of time travel, about the problems with altering established reality to suit one's whims. Okarin eventually undoes most of his meddling in time, and his final goal is NOT to change the past, but to trick the world that a better future might be made possible, that no one be a slave to fate.\n\nWhat the fuck is SG0 by comparison? It's such a monumental, frustrating mess.\n\nThe conflicts in the beginning are Okarin having PTSD about Kurisu and time travel, Suzuha being angry at him for giving up, Maho and Leskenin bringing Kurisu back into his life through Amadeus, Okarin's communicating with [Kurisu] being kept a secret, Maho's wanting to know more about what Okabe knows about Kurisu, about his time-traveling past. New world line shifts giving Okarin glimpses into horrific potential realities and reminding him that he can't run from his fears forever.\n\nSo much good setup! All the right themes are here! \n\nNaturally, you want these conflicts to lead to confrontations between the involved characters that force them to make hard choices, move the plot forward, and naturally lead to the resolution that we see by the end, with Mayuri going back to slap Okarin, with him rescuing Mayuri and Suzuha from the wastes of the past, with everything linking back up with the ending. \n\nYou want these conflicts to perfectly accentuate the primary themes and purpose of this show, to organically prod at the viewer's mind.\n\n(The VN even has some good ideas to this end, like perspective shifts away from Okabe to other characters. Honestly, great idea. Not even remotely used to the extent it needed to be to help SG0 accomplish its goals, though.)\n\nNone of this actually happens though.\n\nIf I'm giving a generous reading, I'll grant the following interpretation: Kagari is a sort of victim of Okarin's inaction, a living example of his failures. That's what she could be. What is she in practice, though? She's melodramatic and unnecessary. She adds more artificial conflict to the plot that isn't needed. \n\nWe have all the conflicts we need already, we don't need 'Amnesiac girl needs help recovering her time traveling memories, reuniting with Suzuha only to realize that, really, she was brainwashed and is going to kill them all' What the fuck does any of this serve?\n\nIn practice, a lot of these initial conflicts are set on the backburner, or bluntly resolved with little fanfare or zero meaningful thematic movement. Remember, the conflicts I listed as starting SG0 off are really all the show needs to propel its characters forward thematically and narratively toward the end. \n\nYet, we end up chasing Kagari's memories, reuniting her with Mayuri, dressing her up, having her faint, having people try to kidnap her, guarding her. None of it meaningfully moves us closer to the goal than we would've otherwise been had she not existed.\n\nOther themes are left on the table somewhat half-baked. Amadeus and Salieri obviously references the semi-historical fiction of Amadeus Mozart and Salieri's rivalry, well-known for the movie based on their relationship. \n\nMaho feels like the Salieri to the Mozart genius of Kurisu. So, that's a setup for some arc of finding value in yourself, believing in your ability to rise to the occasion, not framing yourself as only being worthy in light of others' accomplishments, etc etc. But, neither the VN nor the show really give these ideas full thematic completion, even if Maho vaguely mumbles to herself about her feelings of inferiority.\n\nThink about how the slow-burn of the original S;G, all the choices the characters make, the themes and ideas naturally flow into the second half, with everything that's happened having meaningful connections to the first half, everything making sense as a coherent whole.\n\nSG0 lacks this coherency completely. It has all its good ideas on the table, ready to play out through character choices and interactions, leading to conflicts, leading to choices, leading to climax, leading to natural resolution. \n\nInstead, it gets bogged down in artificial conflict, fan service, and dumb tropes until the end sort of just arrives, Okarin just kind of up and realizing what he needs to do without much character development having happened at all.\n\nYou'd get the complete experience just playing (or watching the equivalent episodes) the 1st hour of the game, then skipping to the ruined city chapter where he time leaps 2,000 times back to the past, gets punched by Suzuha, seeing Hououin Kyouma reawaken, and then seeing the ending play out. \n\nBasically, watch the very beginning, then watch the very end. Everything else is a complete waste of time.\n\nI don't know how they screwed it up this badly, their work was basically cut out for them, they had the opportunity to make something truly masterful, something that meaningfully added to the contextualization of the original VN and show, made it better.\n\nIt's truly disappointing, and I hope that someday, someone talented enough comes back, retcons the VN and the anime and rewrites them completely.",

      "TLDR:\n\n+ good AI\n+ beautiful graphics\n+ large armies\n+ not as twitchy as StarCraft\n+ good skirmish customization\n+ viable defenses\n+ good but not exceptional SP campaign\n+ good amount of maps\n\n- beefy hardware needed\n- difficult to distinguish units\n- UI / usability not quite where SC is (yet!)\n\nYou might like it if you:\n+ like Supreme Commander\n+ prefer a slower approach to RTSes\n+ like comp stomping alone or with friends\n+ like thousands of units on the screen at the same time.\n\nYou better skip it if you:\n- like StarCraft\n- don't like the SciFi setting\n- buy the game for its narrative / SP campaign\n- have a potato for a PC to run this on.\n\nIt has been said before, but Ashes is quite the spiritual successor to Supreme Commander. The focus is more on the strategic side, rather than the hectic button mashing that is found in StarCraft-like games. Armies move quite slowly, defenses are viable and unit abilities are \"centralised\" in \"orbital\" abilities. Although the game offers a campaign mode and various scenarios, the main focus is on skirmish maps. These skimishes offer a vast amount of options to adjust the rules to your liking (like no air units, defensive bonuses etc.). You can win games by eliminating the enemies HQ or by accumulating victory points by holding special locations. I could swear the AI was adapting its army composition to counter my armies and defenses. \nThe developer is known for supporting their games for a very long time and when you take a look at their design documents, you find that there is still stuff planned in the future:\n- more tech tiers,\n- naval units,\n- overall usability improvements \nand more.\n\nOn the negative side, I find the different units and buildings quite difficult to distinguish. While most of it is due to the fact, that its grounded in science fiction (its not like in Company of Heroes, where a thing that looks like an MG nest is indeed an MG nest and behaves as you think it would), its not clear what a building does just by looking at it. But as times goes by you get used to it.\nAlthough you can queue up multiple buildings and units (even on repeatable queues), or order reinforcements directly from the selected army, the overall usability could still be improved. Its not obvious that building blueprints and waypoints can be moved for excample and the different levels of icons shown when zooming out could be better adjusted.\nIts all rather nit picky though. I am sure that Stardock will keep improving the game!",
      "This is my first Formula One game, I never expected before to like this type of games but I do and I'm glad that the 2017 version was my first one because it's very polished and enjoyable.\n\nThe game is basically a simulator of real F1 racing with everything that belongs to it. The gameplay is very similar to what we are used to in Codemasters games - a carrer mode where you choose a team and try to meet their expectations. It's not easy, it needs a lot of skills and I don't recommend playing with a keyboard (I personally use an Xbox controller).\n\nWhen it comes to racing games I'm always mostly interested in multiplayer and I'm pleased that the multiplayer mode works well, it's cross-platform, supports up to 20 players and it's really fun.\n\nThe game was ported by Feral Interactive using Vulkan, the general optimization is great and the performance is very stable. I had an issue with constant crashing after ~5-10 minutes so I sent an e-mail to Feral and their Linux support team was very happy to help. The issue of mine was fixed in less than 3 days and they uploaded the fix on Steam using a beta release channel to let me test it so I'm more than happy with the level of tech support.\n\nNothing more to say, if you are looking for a competitive racing game with decent multiplayer then you shouldn't miss this game.\n\n[h1]System info & performance report[/h1]\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Platform[/td]\n        [td]Linux | Arch[/td]\n    [/tr]\n   [tr]\n        [td]Desktop environment[/td]\n        [td]Gnome Shell 3.26[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]API[/td]\n        [td]Vulkan[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]CPU/GPU/RAM[/td]\n        [td]i5 7300HQ / GTX 1050 Ti [396.24] / 12 GB[/td]\n    [/tr]\n [tr]\n        [td]Settings[/td]\n        [td]1080p, high[/td]\n    [/tr]\n [tr]\n        [td]FPS[/td]\n        [td]50-60 average[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\nhttps://youtu.be/UOssSi3a3PU\n[i][b]Note:[/b] ~10 fps loss due to recording[/i]\n\n[h1]Technical side[/h1]\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Available APIs[/td]\n        [td]Vulkan-exclusive[/td]\n    [/tr]\n\t[tr]\n        [td]Multiplayer[/td]\n        [td]cross-platform Linux <-> Mac OSX <-> Windows[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Config location[/td]\n        [td] ✓ Good | ~/.local/share/feral-interactive/F1 2017[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Linux version rating[/td]\n        [td]Perfect | 5/5[/td]\n    [/tr]\n   [tr]\n        [td]Controller support[/td]\n        [td]Excellent (tested with an Xbox 360 wireless controller, \"xpad\" Linux built-in (default) kernel module)[/td]\n    [/tr]\n   [tr]\n        [td]Any issues (fullscreen, performance, crashes...) ?[/td]\n        [td]Not anymore (fixed by Feral)[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Ported by[/td]\n        [td]Feral Interactive[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]",

      "So before i begin with this review : Yeah we all know Rust is a laggy piece of sh*t sometimes, so i won`t discuss this here.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n- Great concept.\n- Stunning graphics\n- Game mechanics are great\n- The combat system is good\n- The crafting system is very good\n- Weekly updates! Which is one of the most important things for an Early Access game!\n- Good and serious developers, who listen to the community\n- Modding is easy, and the community has almost full access to modding\n- Skins.\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n- Not optimised for extreme potato users, but that is not a main problem i.m.o\n- The community can be cancerous at times, but that is life! Not everyone you meet will be nice or help you!\n- Server creation is a little complicated, but if you are stubborn enough you will learn how to do it / manage it",
      "its a very stressful game and rly hard but the fact that u can lose all ur progress because of a mistake is on another level of insane but in the end if u r determined u will finish it and the feeling when u finish it after all the time is very good i never felt this good in my life about finishing a game or a puzzle its a rly good game i recommend",
      "Despite it's lack of official content and the dullness of the career mode, partly due to the sloppy AI, Assetto Corsa is simply the best racing sim ever developed. Everything smells the love of cars, from its jaw breaking physics to the amazing graphics, and just that feel of the car. A new benchmark for racing sims.",
      "In all honesty, I became a little bored in the middle of playing it. It wasn't until I was almost through with the story that I realized why it had gotten such high ratings. You have no idea how hard it hit me when I realized why he was at the hospital [him being at the hospital is not a spoiler btw], and how relieved I was when he had at last found peace. It was in that moment that I had no regrets in purchasing it and how it was worth my time. Despite how brief the game was, I'm gonna remember it for a while. \n\n",
      "Minesweeper influenced design feels like a fresh take on the Slay-the-Spire-like genre.  Now that I've won with all six classes, and done some of the unlockable difficulty levels, I feel that I've gotten my money's worth with the game, and I have enjoyed the time I've spent so far, but I don't expect great longevity beyond this point.\n\nI do have some minor gripes:\n\n* The pacing on unlocking new classes feels too slow.  It would be nice if the approach was the fairly standard one of unlocking a new class when you win with the previous one, but here there is a currency which is acquired throughout runs, and I found that I usually had to have two winning runs with the previous class to earn enough currency to unlock a new one.\n* Optimal play with some classes requires memorizing tiles which are revealed, and then on later turns these tiles are hidden.  Taking damage because I misremembered what was hidden behind a tile feels unfun and at-odds with what the game otherwise wants to be.\n* I would prefer if the harder difficulty settings were unlocked from the get-go, rather than grinding through easier difficulty settings to find the challenge.\n\nOtherwise, though, it's a fun game with an adorable art style, and not just a clone of the other Spire-likes around.  Recommended if your expectation is to get ten hours or so of strategic puzzling.",
      "[h1]AT A GLANCE[/h1]\n(Full review follows below)\n\n[list]\n[*] [b]Game Name:[/b] The Swapper\n[*] [b]Original Release:[/b] 2013\n[*] [b]Genre Tags:[/b] Atmospheric; 2D; Puzzle-Platformer; Sci-Fi \n[*] [b]My Overall Grade:[/b] A-\n[*] [b]Estimated Playtime (Campaign):[/b] 3-5 hours\n[*] [b]Multiplayer Aspect:[/b] None\n[*] [b]Recommended To:[/b] Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Aesthetes; Game atmosphere connoisseurs; Strong narrative advocates; Puzzle game aficionados\n[/list]\t\n\n[h1]REVIEW[/h1]\n[b]The Swapper[/b] is an enjoyable 2D puzzle-platformer that lacks gameplay innovation but rises above the crowd on the shoulders of its superbly well-designed atmosphere and provocative narrative.  The actual puzzle-solving aspect of the game is adequate, but with minimal diversity and accretion.  It is definitely a story-driven experience, with the gameplay taking a passenger seat.  If you can appreciate a game in that style, this is a good bet for you. \n\nThe entrancing narrative and the style in which it transpires work in concert with the mystifying ambiance to create a wondrous experience. The story touches on some thought-provoking metaphysical issues, while skillfully avoiding a fall too deep into the rabbit hole to keep the average person’s interest. Much of the rest of the narrative is comfortable, cliché sci-fi tropes that we all know and love.\n\nThe gameplay and the puzzles are far from [i]bad[/i], but they also are nothing special.  As I alluded to: they are sufficient, but fail to develop into anything overly interesting. Very little changes from the first puzzle to the last, so it does get a little bit dry.  That said, some of the later ones are quite tricky and a few require not only puzzle-solving ability but also decent reflexes. \n\nThe graphics are pleasurable and align perfectly with the vibe of the game. But the whole soundscape is what truly brings the atmosphere of [b]The Swapper[/b] to life. The ambient soundtrack, the cryptic chatter, and the selectively placed voice-overs contribute a wonderful blend of emotions and mystery. If you are into it, this is a game you might enjoy with the lights off and your headphones on (or however else you may get into the zone).  \n\n[b]The Swapper[/b] is a brief, interesting, and enjoyable experience. It is not a complex or intricate puzzle-platformer, but I recommend it to any fan of the genre who would appreciate the atmosphere and narrative.\n\n[i][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/murphyslawyercuration#curation]Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations![/url][/i]",
      "Great gameplay with baaad user experience. There are no tooltips or explanations as to what is going on at all, just kinda gotta figure it out. Otherwise the gameplay is smooth and there's a climb mode called spiral, slay the spire style, very fun. 5 different classes all able to level their decks and get new cards and abilities until lvl 30 I think, got my enchantress to 20 but still more to go. Story mode is more of a tutorial but still interesting.",
      "If you are looking for a review for this game this aint it, but if you want a fire brownie recipe then you are at the right place\n\nIngredients:\n185g unsalted butter\n185g best dark chocolate\n85g plain flour\n40g cocoa powder\n50g white chocolate\n50g milk chocolate\n3 large eggs\n275g golden caster sugar\n\nMethod:\nSTEP 1\nCut 185g unsalted butter into small cubes and tip into a medium bowl. Break 185g dark chocolate into small pieces and drop into the bowl.\n\nSTEP 2\nFill a small saucepan about a quarter full with hot water, then sit the bowl on top so it rests on the rim of the pan, not touching the water. Put over a low heat until the butter and chocolate have melted, stirring occasionally to mix them.\n\nSTEP 3\nRemove the bowl from the pan. Alternatively, cover the bowl loosely with cling film and put in the microwave for 2 minutes on High. Leave the melted mixture to cool to room temperature.\n\nSTEP 4\nWhile you wait for the chocolate to cool, position a shelf in the middle of your oven and turn the oven on to 180C/160C fan/gas 4.\n\nSTEP 5\nUsing a shallow 20cm square tin, cut out a square of non-stick baking parchment to line the base. Tip 85g plain flour and 40g cocoa powder into a sieve held over a medium bowl. Tap and shake the sieve so they run through together and you get rid of any lumps.\n\nSTEP 6\nChop 50g white chocolate and 50g milk chocolate into chunks on a board.\n\nSTEP 7\nBreak 3 large eggs into a large bowl and tip in 275g golden caster sugar. With an electric mixer on maximum speed, whisk the eggs and sugar. They will look thick and creamy, like a milk shake. This can take 3-8 minutes, depending on how powerful your mixer is. You’ll know it’s ready when the mixture becomes really pale and about double its original volume. Another check is to turn off the mixer, lift out the beaters and wiggle them from side to side. If the mixture that runs off the beaters leaves a trail on the surface of the mixture in the bowl for a second or two, you’re there.\n\nSTEP 8\nPour the cooled chocolate mixture over the eggy mousse, then gently fold together with a rubber spatula. Plunge the spatula in at one side, take it underneath and bring it up the opposite side and in again at the middle. Continue going under and over in a figure of eight, moving the bowl round after each folding so you can get at it from all sides, until the two mixtures are one and the colour is a mottled dark brown. The idea is to marry them without knocking out the air, so be as gentle and slow as you like.\n\nSTEP 9\nHold the sieve over the bowl of eggy chocolate mixture and resift the cocoa and flour mixture, shaking the sieve from side to side, to cover the top evenly.\n\nSTEP 10\nGently fold in this powder using the same figure of eight action as before. The mixture will look dry and dusty at first, and a bit unpromising, but if you keep going very gently and patiently, it will end up looking gungy and fudgy. Stop just before you feel you should, as you don’t want to overdo this mixing.\n\nSTEP 11\nFinally, stir in the white and milk chocolate chunks until they’re dotted throughout.\n\nSTEP 12\nPour the mixture into the prepared tin, scraping every bit out of the bowl with the spatula. Gently ease the mixture into the corners of the tin and paddle the spatula from side to side across the top to level it.\n\nSTEP 13\nPut in the oven and set your timer for 25 mins. When the buzzer goes, open the oven, pull the shelf out a bit and gently shake the tin. If the brownie wobbles in the middle, it’s not quite done, so slide it back in and bake for another 5 minutes until the top has a shiny, papery crust and the sides are just beginning to come away from the tin. Take out of the oven.\n\nSTEP 14\nLeave the whole thing in the tin until completely cold, then, if you’re using the brownie tin, lift up the protruding rim slightly and slide the uncut brownie out on its base. If you’re using a normal tin, lift out the brownie with the foil. Cut into quarters, then cut each quarter into four squares and finally into triangles.\n\nSTEP 15\nThey’ll keep in an airtight container for a good two weeks and in the freezer for up to a month.\n\n:Mic drop:",

      "One word to describe this game: cheap\n-cheap level design\n-cheap story\n-cheap hit boxes\n-cheap enemy placement(''just make them fight 6 enemies at one'')\n-cheap enviroments (The Grand Drangleic Castle, f*ckers could't even model the bridge to go all the way down so you can clearly see it floating)\n-cheap boss fight (''what is Dark Souls knows for?''

      "Great game! \nLooking foward for the next chapters of the game!\nI love the spritework, its amazing!\nEven the music is very catchy and memorable \nFor an Early Access game, this game is very charsimatic and has tons of personality!\n\nIts just a shame that it was short in my opinion, i know you are going to add more stuff obviously, but i was hoping to get much more out of it because i loved it alot xD.\n\nPirate Software, I can't stress enough how much my excitement for this game is,  the demo back in 2017 already left me intrigued, but now im excited to see how this all plays out!",
      "The weakest RE since RE6. \n\nFeels half baked as heck on a game design level. Too many damn cutscenes and areas where you're just on rails. Really, the game design seems to take a massive step back from RE7 and even a bigger step back in terms of puzzles. Really a shame.\n\nNot to mention the performance is pretty terrible and inconsistent. Not to mention the lack of full keyboard bindings and support. Really, this port feels like a whole afterthought to a game that already feels like an afterthought.\n\nIt does get better on the back end but not enough to balance out that weak front end.",
      "As much as I adore this game's visuals, soundtrack, story, and... THE MEMES... I unfortunately can't recommend actually playing it.\n\nI can parry bosses in Dark Souls or Elden Ring with less frustration than in this game. The parry system requires you to execute a light attack towards an enemy right before they go in for a hit against you, which is usually telegraphed with a red glare in their eye. Unfortunately, even while using the lock-on camera (and by the way, you are never directly informed of its existence), half of the time my opponent was partially, or even completely off-screen. This is a problem, not only because it makes seeing an incoming attack difficult, but also because movement is tied directly to the parry system. You must execute an attack TOWARDS the enemy. With the camera having a seizure every five seconds, this makes it even more irritatingly difficult to aim your parries. I died to Blade Wolf repeatedly, not because of my own skill, but because midway through an incoming attack, the camera would decide to turn 90 degrees to the left, causing my movement to also shift to the left, nullifying my parry. \nIt's consistently inconsistent.\n\nIf there is some system in place that actually does help explain a lot of these game mechanics, fantastic. However, I find it inexcusable that whatever I might be missing would be so out of the way that I'd never encounter it unless I went out of my way to do so.",
      "i would recomend it because the physics are great, the game has 8 or 9 level packs (i dont know if there will be a 9th because there are 7 at the time of this review) the units are diverse, there are a lot of secret units to find and i dont know for the final boss because the most expensive unit artimis isnt a good final boss like the dark pesant in the alphas but i hope that the games final boss unit is actually hard to kill and requires more than 7 archers because that wasnt hard or anything hopefully they will make the most expensive unit actually overpowered and unballanced because that would be a great final boss, the sandbox mode is great i like the custom campains , the custom units arent out yet so i cant say anything about that over all this game is worth the money and if its near a sale time like a few days away from a sale then get it on sale if not then just get it you wont regret it and if it lage turn off all the graphics settings",
      "I did not play this game, only the VR portion with a save game file I downloaded. I cannot stand third person over-the-shoulder cam games, and so I don't care about Ms. Tomb Raider. Frankly, after seeing her mansion, and hearing her stuck up voice, I kinda look upon her as a rich bitch, no matter how good she is at rock climbing.\n\nAs for the VR experience, it was pretty good overall, considering you can clearly tell it's a PSVR/PC thing, and so locomotion and playspace stuff is (almost necessarily) awkward. It's the Tomb Raider engine ported to Vr in a hot second, and overall it's fine technically. It's waaaay to damn dark though. I get that the manor is falling apart, and so the lights don't work, but it's just a waste of time to play VR experiences that are super dark. Well it's not dark, it's just very dim. IIRC I finished it but had to cheat, or maybe gave up just before the end and watched the conclusion on youtube. If you skip all the book readings and narration (as I did) it will be an hour of hunting and pecking around the castle for objects and secret doors. Not too shabby really. [spoiler]I'd have never gotten to this if not for the save game file though, phew.[/spoiler]",

      "i don't think i liked it :(\n\na richly illustrated nightmare fairy tale which warns of paranoid infighting and reaching for an unattainable ideal, broken apart by tedious and artificially difficult survival horror segments. i meet each hazard as intended and am often punished with unforgiving damage or by being taken to an instant game over, and while i fully accept that this very well might just be a skill issue on my part, it remains a significant hurdle that's barring me from engaging properly with the unfolding narrative.\n\ni'm not unfamiliar with the death-laden rpgmaker horror-esque titles which preceded LGTS and those it draws its inspirations from, its how it contextualises such flaws that becomes an issue. there are no \"skip seen dialogue\" options, with the fast forward made available to us after Elise's delayed inputs just slow enough to be annoying. on that note, bosses with instant death attacks have unskippable cutscenes prior making repeat attempts patronising. two core survival systems are made redundant within one of the in-game days. perhaps most tragically, the distinct visual style which once pleased the eye beings to blend into monotony and goes unappreciated after some hours.\n\nand like i'm sad about it! i wanted to like it! i really enjoyed how the story progressed and how my bond with my favourite lady bloomed and i liked the endings i've managed to get, but all these hiccups had me nearly just uninstalling early. it's a beautiful poetic horror title, but so many little things simply ended up overwhelming me.",
      "Please, bare with me here...I NEVER write reviews for anything (this is probably the third review I have ever written), but I feel like I need to write this one for so many reasons!!!  I grew up playing the Telltale/Lucas Arts Series: Monkey Island. After discovering and playing those, I figured out that I have an infinite amount of love for Point and Click adventure games. After finishing that series, I really only played the other games made by either Lucas Arts or Telltale (Mostly because I thought they were the only creators of Point and Click games...until about a year ago, when I discovered there's an entire genre/world of Point and Click).  Of course, I must also note: The Curse of Monkey Island will always be my fav, as it was the first Point and Click I ever played. Ok...NOW...with all of that being said, I recently discovered WADJET EYE GAMES and I am SO happy I did. I would recommend EVERY.SINGLE,GAME they sell. I have played all of their MAC/iOS compatible Point and Clicks, and I have yet to be (even slightly) disappointed. I had very high expectations going in as the Monkey Island games, Day of the Tentacle, Full Throttle, Grim Fandago, etc. are some of the best games in the history of Point and Click; however, all of the games I have played from Wadjet Eye have been amazing. They have actually been so amazing that I can 100% say Wadjet Eye is at the top of my list, right there with the Telltale/Lucas Arts games. I 100% recommend purchasing and playing every game made by Wadjet Eye to anyone who likes (even those who kinda sorta like) Point and Click games.",
      "I don't usually give negative reviews on games, but holy shit. The map is not even done and you can go outside the \"map\" so damn easy. You randomly go back to the main menu without any reason.",
      "[h1]Technology[/h1]\nThe game is (was?) awfully poorly optimized.\nI don't think this game looks good enough for the hardware it requires. Some old RTS games looked similar to this title but required much less to run (I am referencing how the technology is better but the \"PC to FPS\" ratio has gone downhills).\n\nI understand that calculating AI choices and the simulation take a lot of resources, but this is not a game with a few thousand AI players like e.g. EU4 is. This is a relatively small map with just some AI players. This game also does not look that much better than some other RTS/TBS titles and I had FPS issues even with the lowest settings.\n\nI first ran this title with R9 280, so a quite old GPU, but that GPU was fully capable of running many decently modern games. This is IMO unacceptable, the developer can't optimize the game, and releases poorly coded product. I tested different graphic settings and noticed nearly no differences in the framerate.\n\nI then upgraded my PC to the top AM4 CPU and a very new GPU card (6600XT, overclocked) and the game ran fine on the highest settings, but I would not call it super smooth. All the other games run perfectly.\nElden Ring, Baldurs Gate 3, Cyberpunk (absolutely 0 issues in Cyberpunk). I would say CA messed up their game and didn't care to optimize it.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThe game is rather decent, it's enjoyable and has a connection to the lore of Warhammer.\nYou can't say a bad word about the general RTS mechanics, the battles and whatever. Just a normal RTS...\n\nIt just isn't the greatest RTS/TBS. Compared to Heroes of Might and Magic 3, or titles like let's say Cossacks, Age of Empires, or maybe Supreme Commander... It is unique in the Total War way, but given the amount of games in the series, it's ... not unique really (I have seen everything this game offers in different titles over the years).\n\nJust a giant simulation with a surprising lack of mechanics for an RTS game (as in economic aspect, diplomacy, map tactics. I think Europa Universalis IV is a good example of a really advanced tactics model in an RTS/TBS game and Civ 6 would be a great example of map design/economics). I personally don't like the maps for real-time battles. These maps seem quite crude and the skirmishes are badly designed.\n\nIn order to inflict maximum casualties you would need to kill every single unit. It should be enough that you break the enemy and automatically win. It's also quite unbalanced. Depending on what you kill first the results can wildly vary (including the AI acting much differently every time and the proposed outcomes of auto-resolved battles are just unhinged).\n\n I probably would like this game more without the \"real-time\" battles, but I assume it's the \"Total War\" way. To me it's time intensive and just not interesting. I liked Warhammer 40k's battles much more. They felt more tactical. Placement of units in this game does matter, but I had more fun playing The Battle for Middle Earth 15 years ago than this. I think the units panic too quickly and the characters don't matter enough.\n\nIt's the closest to the HoMM in terms of map and characters, however it lacks many things that made HoMM great (like tailored character development with meaningful spells and ability to recruit units, find artifacts on the map etc). The cities feel kind of empty, the mechanics are rather poorly described/introduced and just weird for an RTS (for my liking). \n\nI am not sure why there is so little care about the main characters. It would be very cool to build them up, be able to find artifacts on the map (besides the Sword of Khaine, that's just one item) and do something else than just advance some skills in the skill tree. Even if you invest your time in them then they can be sieged and just die.\n\nI also don't like some mechanics, for example the corruption, or slaves (they are not much intuitive. I think they should create clearer GUI and work on the general set of game rules, rather than make every faction different but also following totally different rules. Are we supposed to compete in a campaign and how if we follow different rules?). \nSome game prompts are meant to \"help\" learning the game, but they not always load up and they also don't explain small logos (traits) of the units, it's pretty useless. You need to use web browser anyway. Why to bother?\nIn that aspect - I think the designers totally messed up the UI/UX.\n\n21st August 2023 update: I played Baldur's Gate 3 and imagine they paid enough of work to actually make icons explain the traits of characters or items, amazing is it not? Seems to be lack of care. Every single icon in BG3 is fully explained. I could learn the game's rules and effectively build my characters.\n\n[h1]Genre[/h1]\nThe game is pretty fine, it gives some fun when playing it. Feels like Warhammer I guess? I personally am more of the 40k fan, but a game in the old universe is making lots of sense and the character design with world design are high quality.\n\n[h1] Summary (what made me dump this game also) [/h1]\nThe character design is quite impressive and it seems that they cared about the \"vibe\", but the game is just a money grab. why are there 3 game titles instead of one? What is the main improvement in between all of these titles?\nEach one of them has dozens of DLCs. An average person surely won't spend 300$ just to play more factions.\n\nWhat angered me so much I stopped playing after the purchase:\nThe publisher releases a paid product that claims to have free DLCs - some of them are, but the most important one isn't, and without it the game has got only 50% functionality and feels like a demo.\nRTS game without skirmish mode or some kind of \"do whatever\" mode is a meme. This isn't a DnD campaign board (and ironically such a campaign would allow for much more than selection of 5 heroes on one map lol), but an RTS in a specific universe.\n\nEvery normal RTS game has got a skirmish/free play mode (The Battle for the Middle-earth, Command and Conquer, Supreme Commander, Cossacks, Starcraft. Like every single RTS EVER) and this is especially filthy when you proclaim to release FREE functionality for the title, but then the player gets informed that they must buy TWO titles (WH1 and WH2) to get functionalities in the one they wanted to expand. Such a money grab, and even then the game is still locked behind micro-transactions/DLCs. I wanted to play a game, not donate to the \"poor\" publisher in 10 different ways. If the publisher wants money then they can sell better games.\n\nAwfully lot of DLCs, that don't add many things into the game. The base game doesn't feel like a game, but a rather Free to Play game account, that has 80% of content locked. Choosing from like 4 factions, especially in a game which varies so wildly depending on the faction (the factions aren't meant to be following any common rules it seems).\n\nWhat I also dislike is the publisher urging you to create an account to claim some of the \"free\" DLCs - the purpose is to collect data, and force you into their own website I assume (to raise statistics and show it to the management?). Why bother releasing game on Steam if you can't offer free DLCs to Steam users? I don't want your stupid 3rd party website.\n\nI don't recommend this game. I like Warhammer, but CA is a terrible company. I updated this review and in the meantime there have been at least a few different internet dramas with them involved.\n\nI would personally rather pay 70$ to a company that cares and provides a fun product (e.g. Lorian), than a DLC-locked tech demo... that \"stock\" Warhammer sure is.",
      "This is how business is supposed to be done. \n\nFans ask for an old console favorite, to be ported to pc.\n\nPublisher and developer actually listen?!\n\nThey release a port that works, needs no day 1 patch, works just like the old one did.\n\nAND all at an affordable price..... these are behaviors that should be rewarded.",
      "Take Dota2, HoN or LoL. Strip away all the farming, item buying, running around and randomness. \nThat leaves you with pure fast paced battles in an arena. \nNo random effects, just skill based combat with WASD controls and mouse aiming.\nThat's Battlerite.",
      "Most of the negative reviews cover my complaints already. So I won't rehash the ones I've already read. \n\nHere's my biggest complaints: \n\n- Jumpscares have never been compelling to me. Doubly so on VR. Are you trying to injure me in my computer room? Stop. \n\n- Guns are fun. Not having ammo for them is not fun. (The game is pretty generous with ammo but it also encourages tediously conservative behavior, if you just unload clips at shit you'll run out pretty fast) \n\n- \"Continuous Turning\" feels so bad. Like, how can I turn my headset and everything looks smooth as butter, but as soon as I use the look stick for turning suddenly it's all choppy and looks wrong? I'm familiar with some of the motion sickness issues people get with turning in VR games, but this isn't that... \n\n\nThough honestly it seems like they just leaned really into the whole horror thing, which is fine, but also just super not my thing. \n\nIf the mechanics and some design choices had been better I might have slogged through it anyway. \n\n\nGame's beautiful, though, so they got that going for them.",
      "Ever since an indie game showcase a while back, Sumire interested me. Hooked by its beautiful artstyle and interesting concept.\n\nToday I finally managed to play it. Game is not perfect, menu controls feel inconsistent and counter intuitive. The dialogue might mess up while fast traveling, and there's an area with some broken lighting.\n\nHowever, as a stroytelling medium Sumire excels. The game is short about ~3 hours long. The game has many beautiful moments and scary moments. I made some mistakes, and by the end i almost didnt want to go on, what if because of my mistakes i couldn't do what i wanted. But i pushed on, and by the end I was happy that i kept going.\n\nIn summery, Sumire is a short game that ask you to make the most of one day. By end i felt deeply touched by the game and highly recommend it.\n",
      "Got this game on launch, never expecting that I would become addicted looking at a stickman beat the living hell out of other stick figures. A lot of cool Easter eggs to find in the game (funny mini games, cool achievements etc.), great music, incredibly fluent and exciting while only playing with the mouse. Got a few dollars to spare? Snatch up this game and you won’t be disappointed. The only thing I’m disappointed in are my own reflexes, as I’m currently stuck in a few levels that are just way to hard for my taste. But a true ninja never quits trying. \n\nI never played part one, which is a mistake I’ll correct soon as well.",
      "[h1]After over 600 hours (played a few months extra via gamepass), im ready to drop a 'goodbye' review[/h1]\n\n\nI've bought this game knowing what im getting myself into, as i was playing FH4 for roughly 500 hours, being in a discord community that is very engaging with the game and players and is in an overall high quality, it made me want to keep playing both Forzas for way more time than initially intended, so im really grateful to these discord groups and their staff and members for this reason.\nWith that being being said, playing on your own will make your experience way quicker to be burnt out than with a community (and i aint talking about co-op convoys, but just getting more content by other players you can befriend with and talk to online). Community-wise, the game feels kinda the same like GTA V online, where you're dropped into an unnamed massive server with random players around you, yet arent given enough tools to properly communicate with them. Add to that, the horrendous platform that is called MS store / Xbox console companion that feels so damn clunky that even befriending and chatting with other friends is a gauntlet on its own, and makes you feel like you really need to find an actual community on a 3rd party platform (discord is generally ideal for this), or else you're being left to play alone even if the game is in online mode. These hurdles can be felt regardless if playing the Steam version or MS version, as making a MS account is necessary for this game to work and be connected online.\n\n[b]Ok, enough chatter about friends. . . .[/b]\n\n\nThe game itself is great and welcoming for the car newbs and car nuts alike, and no matter where you are on the car spectrum IRL and in the gaming world, you will feel the fun of this game especially if this is your first or 2nd Forza Horizon experience (i.e - you havent played FH 1-3). FH4 was quite similar to this one but had a lot more passion put into it, while FH5 has been given lots of QoL updates over its predecessors. Things like increased amount of props and the ability to put props in route creation so now you can design your own tracks with props involved, turning this game into a gmod-like experience if you're so inclined, alongside adding 'rules' to the driving experience, turning any typical race into a minigame of its own, with different objectives than just 'finish first'.\n[b]Important side note - [/b]This game is mostly for arcade fun and not designed for sim racing in mind, meaning that any gripes you have about its physics, sound, lack of competitiveness, etc, are quite redundant as there is always a fragile balance between fun and realism. Also, this game will not fulfill your mid 2000's NFS vibes, at all. This game is its own sub-genre of sorts and is less about weeb car upgrades (tho there are plentiful overall) and nitro, and more about car veriety and making new builds.\n\nThe game is structured with a playlist system - Each month is divided into 4 seasons (4 seasons per month - one per week). The months are called 'series' which the game devs are pushing into the game, and you have a month-long content to enjoy, with a weekly 'reset' time for each season (happening every thursday afternoon). Each month has its own theme, e.g - japanese cars, offroad racing, classic cars,  high performance track cars, etc. Each week (season) you get a new playlist of objectives to do (this is generally referred to as 'the weekly grind') like certain tournaments and other stuff. Playing with no pause would take you about 5-10 hours to finish an entire weekly playlist, in a typical non tryhardy playstyle.\n\n[b]Other content in this game[/b]\n\n* Over 700 cars in total, and more are being added every month with new (free) updates.\n* A spacious open world map of Mexico where you can drive freely with other players, (randoms or friends), either as freeroam or as a grouped convoy.\n* Co-op mode with random lobbies or friends you invite ahead of time.\n* Online racing, when you're playing against upto 11 other players (no bots) in typical fashion racing for xp and money (in game currency, called cr for short).\n* Community-made tracks - This is where the real fun begins especially if you're a member of a group that delivers high quality custom tracks. These tracks can have any theme in them like high/low performance cars, any road type, etc.\n* Auction house - You can buy and sell cars in an auction with other players.\n* Forza-official radio stations with genres like EDM, pop music, hip hop, rock, and lots of latina-based music.\n* Community livery and tunes - You can create and share your own car tunes and liveries and take others' from the community database.\n* Countless other minigames like capture the flag, zombies, super7 (custom objective-based challenges), and even a full scale battle royale mode.\n\n\n[b]My GamerTag is Avees128, so check out my custom tracks / tunes if you feel like it![/b]\n\n\n\n[b]Game versions and DLC expansions - Which to buy?[/b]\n\nThis game has 3 versions - Standard, Deluxe, and Premium. In general, you should only be thinking to buy either the standard or the premium version, as the deluxe only gives the (base game and) car pass, which is a free access to a bunch of some other cars you could eventually get in game anyway, without paying for that game version. The premium version of the game also adds some other meaningless car packs and (more importantly) 2 expansion maps.\nNow, you could see the fairly negative reviews these 2 expansions (Hot Wheels and Rally Adventure) have on steam, and this is because the reviewers have compared these DLC's to the DLC's from the past FH games, which were objectively superior to these current ones in most ways. Do you care about Hot Wheels at all? If no, skip it. Are you a rally fanatic? If no, then skip this one as well.\nImo, these 2 DLC's dont give an enjoyable content (and im not even a fan of HW nor Rally), especially when being compared to the past DLC's from FH4 (personally played and loved every inch of it) and FH3 (have not played at all but i only hear positive things about it and its DLC's - which ironically, one of them was HW).\n\n\n[b]Performance - [/b]I have a Ryzen 9 5900x + AMD RX 5700xt. When testing the built-in benchmark a year ago, i was getting the following results:\n\n1080p high - 113 FPS\n1080p ultra - 79 FPS\n1440p high - 99 FPS\n1440p ultra - 69 FPS (nice)\n\nUpscaling (FSR/DLSS) in this game is really bad, both for AMD and nVidia tech, so avoid these if you can. I cant comment on Ray Tracing since i cant run any RT features with my GPU, but from what i can tell, its minimal RT at best (which also means minimal performance drops). The game really loves Smart Access Memory / reBAR, so make sure you have it enabled if you can for a great fps boost of about 20% !.\n\n\n[b]In conclusion - [/b]The game itself is great and is a legit time sink (for better and for worse), but if you're not engaged in a welcoming community, it will be a relatively short amount of time (50-100ish hours till you'll feel exhausted from the endless grind of everything, so bare that in mind). If you're unsure if this game fits your flavor of racing game, i would either opt for the standard version or just try it out via gamepass and see how it feels like (just note that there are NO cross saves between the MS store platform and steam, so you will need to start over if you're switching between versions!).",
      "First things first:\nYES, it has keyboard and mouse support.\nYES, you can use the Celestial Brush with the mouse.\nYES, you can skip any cutscenes and text without needing to complete the game first.\nYES, you can use a drawing tablet to play.\n[spoiler] NO, there is not the original song \"Reset\" in the entire game, be it from the end credits or the presents from Issun. [/spoiler]\n\nNow:\nAfter the first few minutes (16 to be exact), I felt all the childhood memories resurface in my mind, the excited fan inside me screaming to continue in this beautiful game. Used to play the game on the Wii with 480p resolution on a small screen, now with 1440p on a computer monitor large enough to be fully immersed in this work of art, I can't begin to imagine what 4K will look like. Not only all the textures are sharp, but the added post processing effects from the original on PS2 makes the experience simply better.\n\nThis newest edition of Okami allows both controller and keyboard/mouse support, the game open to the Playstation or the \"Wii\" playstyles. I have not tested the controller part yet, however for the keyboard/mouse part, all the controls can be rebound to your heart's content. The camera is controlled by the mouse, in case you are wondering.\n\nUsing the Celestial Brush feels natural, comfortably giving you full control on your line work without horrid wavering drawing (Wii version with its Wiimote not being stable in your hand, for example). I miss the ability to change the thickness of the brush freely like on PS2, although at least there's the ability to paint a constant, thicker line instead.\n\nYou can also change the refresh rate of the game, as well as the resolution and if you want it fullscreen, windowed, or borderless windowed. Either you can't change to a 1920x1200 resolution if you don't have a 16:10 screen (even if your 16:9 screen is bigger than that), or it's locked at 4:3 and 16:9 only. You might get some black lines if you are using a 16:10 screen.\n\nWith all the positive above, I do have to point out the controls overall can take a little while to get used to. As for framerate, the Fan Menu can go at 60 fps, while the game itself seems to be capped at 30 fps. In any case, the framerate of the game was not wavering at all on either situations, which is a mega plus compared to, say, an emulator.\n\nOverall, the game compared to its predecessing versions is simply stunning, completely worth the $20.00. This 30 hours game is a masterpiece, a classic, and simply a unique and fun experience. Now's your chance to play this amazing, way underrated work of art!\n\nP.S.: For the artists out there, try out your drawing tablets with the game and see if it works. If you can move your mouse cursor with a pen, so should the camera and Celestial Brush. This can be a unique way to play~\n\nEDIT: I forgot to point out by default, the right mouse button makes the alternate, thicker line. Now if you have some sort of plugin for a PS3 controller for detecting analog inputs, I wonder if the game will still recognize that data and allow you to draw variable lines, like on PS2...\n\nUPDATE: I can confirm that Okami is playable with a drawing tablet like Intuos Comic and the likes. It actually makes for a very interesting playstyle! However, the camera is a little bit hard to control unless you have a very high sensitivity, since you can't just reposition your pen like you would with your mouse in this case. For the first time, I finally was able to really draw in Okami...\n\nTIPS:\nIf you need to walk [spoiler]for the \"Pick Nami's clothes\" minigame[/spoiler], hold B on the keyboard. It will make Amaterasu walk instead of run when you move around.\n\nPressing the Fan Menu button twice allows you to skip nearly all dialog in the game, without the need to complete the game first.\n\nApplying Gold Dust on weapons apply different visual effects on them, no matter how subtle they are. It's easier to notice it now in this edition of the game!",
      "It's hard not to compare this with Divinity: Original Sin. Both were funded on Kickstarter, both have a 91% score on Steam, both are rich, engaging cRPGs, and they were released months apart. It's fair to say both games have been wild successes that have surprised even the developers. If you had to pick ONE of these to invest time in which should it be?\n\nTurn-based vs. Real-time with pause: I eventually came to accept and even enjoy the real-time with pause combat of Pillars, though I much prefer turn-based. Real-time combat presents many problems that aren't the result of player mistakes. On numerous occasions I'd have characters stuck in place because the pathfinding didn't work right. The real-time combat often felt like a jumbled, chaotic mess instead of the tactical plan I had set out. Divinity is much cleaner in this respect and offered a much better experience, especially with respect to using the environment as a weapon. With Divinity I felt each power had a time and place, whereas with Pillars I ended up spamming the same powers and hoping for the best.\n\nStory: Pillars of Eternity definity wins out here. While the story in Divinity:OS wasn't bad, I would call it playful to the point of campy. Pillars had a deep, mature fantasy story worthy of a novel. While it was almost too much reading at times, the story was serious, dark, and dealt with real themes. \n\nArt: Pillars harkens back to the golden age of Infinity Engine games like Balgur's Gate, Icewind Dale, Planescape Torment, etc. The scenes are appealing, but prerendered and they felt a little static. This helps stoke the nostalgia for the late 90s, but Divinity feels up-to-date and immersive. Couple the art style of Divinity with it's highly interactive environments, and the world of Original Sin ends up feeling much more alive. \n\nMusic: Both were great soundtracks but Pillars feels just a bit derivative of the Lord of the Rings movies. They aren't bad at all, but almost generically fantasy at times. Music is important here because when you spend tens of hours in these worlds, you're gonna get this music stuck in your head.\n\nIn short, you should play both if you love deep, isometric, high-fantasy, western computer RPGs. If you MUST pick, consider the following choice. Choose Pillars of Eternity if you favor story and choose Divinity: Original Sin if you prefer combat. Both are hallmarks of a great RPG and each specializes beautifully."

      "Oh boy. This is a beautiful game. There's unlockable items, a hidden boss, lots of enemies, and characters that change your play styles. Numerous ways to make the game accessible for you!\n\nBut is the game fun? I'd say no, the game was just ok. I wasn't really solving puzzles so much dealing with a RNG generator. Ironically the bosses felt slower and more boring than the levels, they are a battle of patience, wait until the potions fall - hit them 3 or 4 times - repeat.\n\nWould I revisit this game after some patches or dlc? No, probably not. Unfortunately I think this game has some base design problems and not content or quality problems.",
      "Blows every single PFS game of the last decade out of the water, even those shitty D**M games that people who never played FPS games before seems to worship in order to look cool. Smooth and fast gameplay with a lot of variety. Great visuals even on medium/high settings.

Writing has always been the worst part of the series, dont be delusional retards.",
      "Steins;Gate Elite is a great Visual Novel when looked at in isolation. The main problem is that Steins;Gate (the original) exists. I don't mind the difference in art styles, that is a matter of personal preference anyway. Graphics in Elite are a lot more animated, images in the original are more static but also more detailed. What I have an issue with is the missing parts in the story.\n\nThere are a few situations where Elite eliminates choices when compared to the original. I won't spoil details, but in one of the early chapters you can choose to ignore or answer a phone call, leading to alternate branches in the story (they join again soon after, but each branch still contains unique content). Well, you can choose in the original. In Elite, you automatically answer the phone, the other branch is no longer in the game.\n\nAt a later point in the game, I noticed that quite a sizeable chunk of a previously linear story progression (not even an alternate branch) concerning Faris was completely cut out. Again, I won't spoil details in case you just want to decide which version of the game to get and don't know the story yet. It has been some time since I played the original, so I might have missed more instances of missing story parts, but at least this one part was really obvious.\n\nThe missing branches and parts are not really relevant to the overall story, but you probably want them if you want to know more about the characters. Elite is more streamlined, but at least all of the alternate endings are still here. So while there is missing stuff compared to the original, there is quite a bit more when compared to the anime. Then again, the anime added more story after the true ending of the original game. I was hoping that Elite added (and maybe fleshed out) this extra content as well, but no luck here, Elite ends at the same point as the original.\n\nIf you don't mind the art style of the original, play that one instead. The second game (Steins;Gate 0) only exists in it's original form anyway. Elite might still be worth it if heavily discounted since it is the only way to get the \"free\" Linear Bounded Phenogram. You can justify it as buying LBP and getting Elite as a free extra.",
      "So, I've been playing games for 36 year now. All the genres, like them all. Most of all RPG, turn based strategies, WW2 shooters (BF) etc. And just achieved victory in Slay the spire, after 206 hours of hugely enjoyable play. I would say this is in top 5 games of all times for me. Maybe even top 2, together with Card Hunter. Those two games are so far the two games I would take to a deserted island.

I am not the kind of person to normally go in for conceptual hipster nonsense, and I say that because that's what I thought this game was. \n\nIn reality, it has some of the best atmosphere and writing I've seen in a game in a very long time.

      "Mori's 3-Part Review:\n1. Bare minimum information and recommendations to improve your playthrough\n2. Background information on me and my playthrough\n3. More extensive non-spoiler reactions\n \nPart 1: Recommendations for You\nIf you're like me and you try to get all the extra scene dialogue, then please, if you take nothing else from this, give yourself time to play this game yourself. There is actually so much content here, I really want you all to take your time to experience it as you go. The game is just too long to binge in a reasonably short amount of time, and if you do binge, you're going to lose a lot.\n \nMy recommendations:\n1. Give yourself time to play the game. Let it sink in, and take notes- it'll be rewarded. The game is literally too dense and too long to binge reasonably if you like 100%ing.\n \n2. Get invested in the characters and pay attention to them, not just the (admittedly stellar) mysteries.\n \n3. Explore the game, its mechanics, and its dialogue yourself. Don't be afraid to restart a Somnium several times; the more options you pick, the more meaningful information you get.\n \n4. If you're a puzzle lover then try to solve the game yourself. You're going to have a blast if you manage it, and the game has tons of built-in hint systems to make it even easier, fairer, and more fun.\n \n5. Try to go in knowing at little as you can. The marketing has already done a great job. Focus on finishing the game and bringing it all together.\n \n6. On PC, force anti-aliasing on using your graphics card to make the game prettier. Game ran and controlled smoothly with few bugs.\n \n7. You don't need AI1 to play AI2, but I think AI2 does spoil AI1, though you could still enjoy them in reverse order.\n \n7. If you're sensitive to horny then just read less background dialogue in Ryuki side. Gore is pretty toned down, and there isn't any single huge CW.\n \nYou can stop reading now if you don't want your playthrough tainted by my reactions/expectations effected.\n \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nPart 2: Who am I, and how do I play?\nI'm an Uchikoshi fanatic. I've played all his English-translated games, and visual novels are my favorite genre of game. I've played a lot of visuals novels, but Uchizawa's are my favorites. I usually try to 100% complete all the scenes and see all the bonus dialogue. I've also played a lot of other genres of game, and I do like fun gameplay, but the most important things to me tend to be:\n \nA. An interesting story is absolutely what gets me invested\nB. Bunches of novel ideas like unique plot points I haven't seen before, philosophical ideas, or puzzles\nC. Characters that I at least don't actively hate; I can like a game for the above two, but characters still matter\nD. Deep personal connection, usually formed by connections to real people or how a game shaped my life\n \nThose are the ways I rate my top games. For the last 8 years, my top 2 favorite games have been the same:\n \nMy top favorite game of all time is Remember11. I love the plot, the ideas, the twists, the characters, and it's what got me truly invested in Uchikoshi. It's very much a mystery game first with an unravelling mystery and themes I love to explore.\n \nMy second favorite game is Virtue's Last Reward. I love the interactive moral dilemmas. VLR's use of the Prisoner's Dilemma jumpstarted my interested in Philosophy which led me to major in Philosophy. I don't like the characters as much save for a few, but it's still very important to me.\n \nNow, let me tell you how I've played AINI: I've basically been playing non-stop since June 13th.\n \nTake this with a grain of salt because I've been documenting as I play (the average main story playtime seems to be 20-35 hours, with 100% likely taking 50+), but right now, I have 97 hours of playtime. I have not gotten all the dialogue, achievements, or fully explored the abundance of extra mechanics. Instead, I have a 616-page reaction document full of constant laughs, cries, screams, passing out, and most of all love.\n \nPart 3: My Review\nThe R11 #1 and VLR #2 holy duology held true for 8 years. Also, AI1 isn't one of my favorite standalone games; it has huge personal connection for me because of the community and the AI1 ARG, but it wasn't my favorite as a game.\n \nI gave all that background because I want you to take me seriously when I say this:\nAI2 is my new favorite game. The #1 spot has been Easily dethroned.\n \nThe themes, twists, characters, ideas, gameplay, visuals, voice acting, fair mystery, presentation, mechanics, and comedy all of it resonates together perfectly. I don't even tend to value gameplay or visuals, but at many times, this game is fun to play while looking genuinely beautiful and cinematic.\n \nThe story reads like a proper Uchikoshi + Nakazawa return to form. The mystery is fair, interesting, meaningful, and complex told satisfyingly. There are many deep ideas, concepts, and themes utilized in thought-provoking ways.\n \nGameplay-wise, there are tons of mechanics that are utilized to make each Somnium unique; they all feel designed by love, fair, and reflective of the character through gorgeous symbolism. They blow the first game completely out of the water. Each one is its own experience to explore and a visual delight. There are also tons of mechanics for you to discover that make AI2 a fun game to play.\n \nThe animations, voices, and directing are cinematic; this game is actually breathtaking a lot of the time. It's backed up by great and charming character writing- despite the fact Mizuki is my favorite AI1 character with 0 contest, I grew to like much of the AI2 cast the same amount.\n \nAI2 is a story about halves and splitting, but also love and coming together- please, see it through until it's whole. I hope and believe you will all fall in love with AI2 like me; AI2 is all I've ever wanted. AI2 is my dream game come true; it's a gorgeous love letter to all Uchikoshi fans who love Zero Escape's puzzles, Infinity's mysteries, and AI's characters and humor.",
      "Holy crap.\n\nPowerful.\n\nThis game explores some serious life issues: Abuse. The pain of childhood, and of parenthood. Manhood and womanhood. Strength. Loss.\n\nThis game had me near crying at several points. The story is freaking powerful. It's also remarkably well written, and downright hilarious at times. \n\nAnd the gameplay? \n\nIt's fun enough that I want to play through it again right after beating it. This turn-based RPG is sometimes brutally difficult, in part because it slaps many old-school conventions in the face (e.g., sleeping can be dangerous). Battles are challenging. Tactical thinking is essential since many enemies are VERY dangerous and you're frequently outnumbered. I really applaud the AI as it keeps you on your toes. \n\nThe game doesn't hold your hand. There is no map, compass, or any attempt to make navigation easier. You just have to remember your way around, though there are plenty of memorable environments. \n\nCharacters will force you to make decisions with lasting consequences. There are dozens of hard choices to make along the journey, which brings me to another topic the game explores: decision. Will you save your friends, or your stuff? I got very attached to the buddies I picked up, only to have them devoured by a mutant, or bail on me when I least expected it. You just never know what you'll face, nor what to choose. Thinking back to many of those times, I don't know what I should have done. All the options sucked. \n\nBut I can't help asking myself, \"Did I make the right choice?\" \n\nHighly recommended.",
      "1 week before release i played the demo, it was a 20 minutes demo that was very underwhelming, but i still thought i should give the game a chance to see if it gets better later on.\n\nIt doesn't.\n\nSo the first thing i read about this game in the embed of the steam link was \"a fresh take on the jrpg genre\", and its probably the biggest problem of the game. It is really the most basic, mediocre turn base combat you can find.\n\nTurn base combat, rock paper scissor elemental types plus physical, materia base skills with few spots (i had only 4 skills activated),  no gear, no party. Does that sound like a fresh take to you?\n\nSo if the gameplay is so barebones it means is at least hard right? Well no, it is basic and easy. The start is easy, in the mid part they blow up the HP of enemies so you understand you should buy new skills, and once you do it the game is easy again. Mob enemies are generally harder than bosses because you are 1vs3 most of the time, while in bosses you can just debuff it and make it slow, while you have 2 turns to spam healings and hitting. There also some questionable decisions on the minor mechanics of the combat system but i don't think they matter (see some paragraphs below)\n\nNow here is what is really the \"fresh take\": the setting being cyberpunk. Everything is written with tech terminology. The mana is called data, block and delay turn is called cache, melee combat is called hack? some of the terms don't even make sense of what they actually do. Also because we obviously live in a technological society we have people called \"V-sync\" or \"Nullpointer\", expresions like \"Digits!\" or \"Oh my grind!\", you know, normal behaviour if you ask me.\n\nThe story is pretty standard for a futuristic setting, it wasn't bad but also it wasn't good, pretty normal.\n\nThe artstyle is cool, the music is generally cool, which i think its why most people would don't mind the boring gameplay and will just play for the story, which is also present in the game itself because you have options to either skip every random encounter (yeah we have those here) or to insta win every battle when you want it.\n\nSo if you want to try this game because of the \"fresh take in the jrpg genre\" you will be disappointed, if you have played jrpgs before there is nothing new in this game, you have already played it before.",
      "I am over 50. \nI have played a lot of games.\nThe Return of the Obra Dinn is one of the best games I have ever played.\n\nIt is one of those rare cases (though certainly by design) where everything comes together.  Story, game play, graphics, challenge level, feeling of accomplishment on advancement. Simply an outstanding piece of work that I enjoyed every moment (even when frustrated) and will remember fondly.",
      "I've read some of the negative reviews and name calling is petty so instead I'll just say a lot of those opinions are dumb.\n\nLook. This isn't Firewatch. This is a seven year old game that pissed off a lot of bros and continues (apparently, christ) to do so because it embraced not only being a walking simulator but a gay one at that. And yeah bro, 15 bucks seems steep for a game that you can finish in under an hour, but hell, maybe don't speed run? It's a walking simulator after all. Or maybe support indie game devs. *Or maybe* read the Steam tags that say \"short\" and \"walking simulator\" and then don't count that against the game. You don't review CS;GO and say \"not bad, but too much shooting\" right? RIGHT? \n\nLook. I've had some wine. And I've had some feelings. And Gone Home is a piece of video game history whether people want it to be or not. It's a game I wish I would have known about when it was first released. Hell I needed it five years earlier than that. \n\nIf you're pissed that Gone Home wasn't dramatic enough or that it's \"homosexual\" then maybe realize that this game wasn't made for you and that does not qualify it as bad. \n\nAnyway, that cat journal achievement was neat.",
      "For a company as big as Amazon, this game is extremely sub par. It feels as though it's in Early Access and some of the recent patch notes are very worrying for the game's future\n\nPros:\n- Stunning gfx. Especially for an MMO, the lighting in particular is amazing\n- Sound track is great and ambience adds personality to the zones\n- Some really cool zones to explore, feels as though you can get lost when you start\n- Controls/Keybinds are already really good imo, I only changed a few\n- Tutorial/Starter Quest chains do a great job of introducing you to the game without being too slow\n- Combat (when it works) Is really fun. Lots of action based fights\n- Wars are a really cool mechanic, they are ultimately flawed but are still a lot of fun\n\nCons:\n- Game is extremely shallow. It is borderline addicting for the first few levels, this soon dies off. When (If) You reach lvl 60, you ask yourself what do you do now?\n- As beautiful as the game is, a lot of it is copy and pasted. Literally. There are zones, towns, dungeons that are almost identical. Ruins immersion\n- Quests are extremely repetitive and boring. They consist of kill mobs, loot mobs, loot chests and that’s about it. No diversity\n- Combat can be laggy, you weapon swap and it doesn’t register sometimes. Wars can be a PowerPoint Presentation at times\n- Guild UI is awful. There is no guild bank, treasury ledger so you cannot monitor who donates money for wars etc. Makes running a guild a nightmare\n- There are countless exploits and duplications that have been abused upsetting economies, player numbers and the general integrity of the game\n- Server population has been decimated since launch leading to many dead servers. They’re merging already\n- There are some very worrying patch notes/future releases that are changing fundamental mechanics of the game. In some cases nerfs which punish players who didn’t rush to level cap\n- Watermark is a stupid progression system for gear. It forces you to run daily elite zone farm chains which get extremely repetitive\n\nIf this was a small indie dev company, I could give them the benefit of the doubt. However this is frickin’ Amazon. This product is totally unacceptable and needs to go back in the oven.\n",
      "I bought this game because it was supposed to be like Harvest Moon. I'm now close to finishing an ingame year.\n\n+ The town and art style is very much like Harvest Moon\n+ There are a lot of interesting characters with lovely art to socialize with\n+ The dog is helpful, barking on spots where you could dig out some items\n+ Some events, scenes and dialogues in this game made me smile to no end. This is a happy game.\n\n- You have a farmland of 40 tiles and farm by seeding tile by tile and watering tile by tile. The watering can is your only tool and upgradable to water 3x3 tiles.\n- Friendship is a grind, as is tradition in the genre. I once gifted a whole harvest to a girl without visable change in the 1 to 10 affection meter. After finishing the friendship grind on 3 villagers, the game seemed to reward me with... some random dialogue lines.\n- You can only bind the shovel and watering can. You cannot bind anything else like the brush or milking device or animal fodder. This makes the daily barn work quite nasty.\n\n\nIf you need a Harvest Moon on PC, this isn't what you want. Games like \"Friends of Mineral Town\" had a significantly larger focus on farming simulation. World's Dawn is a small town simulator with a little gardening on the side.",
      "You are an astronaut, you wake up in a rescue rocket, and against your wills you are shot from Theseus space station on Chori V planet. After landing on the planet you find a strange device that helps you get back on board and survive until help arrives.\n\nGreat game, get it on sale, because it is a bit short. I like games like Portal 2, The Talos Principle, and there is no point to compare this games, because they are completly different, even if they have few common things like solving riddles and story with fresh look at some philosophical questions. Point is that every one of them including The Swapper is good at what it do, and every one of them is unique. For me it is pleasure to play this game beacause of it atmospheric well done design, riddles and questioning the meaning of existence.",
      "Game is super realistic, got ahead of Hamilton and he pitted me into a wall going 180mph, just like real life!",
      "Edited\n\nI Didn’t have high expectations for this game. I read the reviews and expected a mediocre game from ubisoft. I was let down big time. I was given a watered down version of Syndicate that had terrible game mechanics.\n\tAs I navigated the first enemy compound I came across it felt difficult to navigate through the grass and between the buildings. Clearly not developed as a stealth game. Once I had given up on the whole stealth aspect of the mission I was very easily able to slaughter all of the guards in the compound. I trying using the bow but it’s hard to use compared to Tomb Raider and Far Cry Primal’s easy to use bow. Sword combat could have been improved but it wasn’t the worst I’ve seen. No skill required, just click the mouse button rapidly to kill all of the guards in your path. The devs clearly didn’t try that hard because they knew that people would by their game anyways because of Ubisoft and Assassin’s Creed fanboys.\n\tAssassin’s Creed: Origins could’ve been an amazing game that would revolutionize the series but no. The devs had to ruin that possibility by being lazy and making a watered down version of Syndicate. I’ve played Syndicate quite a bit and I thought it was a good game. Don’t get this game for the full price or even for $35. Let’s hope Ubisoft gets their shit together and doesn't fuck up Far Cry 5.\n\nThank you for your time.",
      "This game vs. HOI3:\n---------------------\n\nAdvantages:\n\n1.) The production system is more interesting and engaging, and far more balanced than the old IC system of HOI3. \n2.) The unit creation system is far more in depth and interesting, featuring many different brigade types and support companies, allowing you to change your divisions however you would like. \n3.) This game is far more stable than HOI3.\n4.) This game is updated regularly and has bugfixes regularly too, with content being added free along with every DLC. \n5.) The modding community of HOI4 is far larger with excellent mods such as Kaiserreich, Millenium Dawn, Red World, and Endseig.\n6.) HOI4 muliplayer is actually playable without making you want to shoot yourself.\n7.) China is no longer something Japan can take within 2 months.\n8.) An actual peace conference system and ideologies that actually impact the game.\n9.) Far easier to get into than HOI3.\n10.) Less railroading and the AI wont spaz if you do something ahistorical.\n11.) Planes are no longer as cancer as they used to be.\n12.) Far less micromanagement if you choose not to want to micro.\n13.) A better tutorial (still not a great one though.)\n\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n1.) The research system is bare bones in comparison to HOI3.\n2.) The War in the Pacific is basically nonexistant and naval warfare is awful (to be improved with next patch, being released eventually:tm:)\n3.) People dont really join the war in HOI4 unless theyre directly attacked, making continents like South America completely useless due to the fact that none of the countries there ever do anything but still build up their military, contributing lag.\n4.) Due to the game's engine, it can only use a single one of your processing cores, meaning regardless of your computer quality the game will run kinda slowly.\n5.) Speaking of slowly, the game is poorly optimized and frame loss is extremely common, especially 1942 onwards, when majors can have upwards of 300+ divisions. \n6.) The AI is often braindead, doing hilariously incompetent things such as charging endlessly into your lines, removing all its troops from your front, leaving major areas completely undefended, and completely ignoring the aerial aspect of the war.\n7.) Specific AI are even more braindead than the rest, specifically island nations, or nations that otherwise need to use navies and airforces more. Yes, the Japanese, American, and British AI are some of the worst in the game. In a WW2 game. \n8.) Your allies are completely useless and often you will find yourself doing all the fighting yourself, or even being hindered by your own allies. Playing as Germany the Italians likely wont place a single division in North Africa. In D-Day, you will either be the only one contributing anything or your allies will contribute so much that the supply is ruined and your troops all die of attrition. As the USSR you will recieve 0 lend lease, and as China you will get absolutely no support from the west. \n9.) HOI3 is a lot cheaper than HOI4\n\n\nOther things which I feel are worth mentioning but arent really advantages or disadvantages:\n\n1.) HOI4 contains a lot more alt-history options, which while not for everyone, are fun to try out. \n2.) The focus-tree system is something completely different from anything in HOI3.\n3.) The game has a less in-depth OOB(Order of Battle), which while to some people is nice because theyre bad with OOB, others dislike. Specifically this game lacks corps. \n4.) The battle-planning system of HOI4, while easier to use than the one in HOI3, is still flawwed. In HOI3 it did absolutely nothing, but in this game it is a core part of playing. Unless you want to mircomanage every single division, like you did in HOI3, you will use this system. \n5.) While simpler, the game still possesses a learning curve.\n\n------------------------\n\nOverall: \n\nHOI4 is a far less grounded and historical experience than HOI3. Is this a good or bad thing? That depends on your perspective. HOI4 obviously has significant advantages over HOI3 in certain areas but many consider HOI3 to be an overall better game. Personally I recommend HOI3 if you want a more micro-intensive, historical experience, and HOI4 if you want to just sit back and relax for a couple hours murdering millions of people. \n\nPersonally I would suggest either game, but thats just me.",
      "When reading reviews for this game you'll generally find two camps. There are people who find DW:U incredibly deep and engaging, and there are those who find it incredibly obtuse and frustrating. The problem is they're both right. The game does feature a wealth of features, and you will almost certainly never experience them.\n\nEven for a player like me who is used to impenetrable strategy games like Europa Universalis this was difficult to play. Income see-saws drunkenly from crippling deficit to fabulous surplus and back again depending on what's happening this exact second. Land combat units are jam packed into impossibly tiny UI bars. AI factions have reams of vague, undefined character traits. The encyclopedia technically gives information on everything but is so poorly organized and unsearchable as to verge on useless.\n\nWith time, practice, and a lot of time spent researching on independent websites you can have fun with this game. But for sixty dollars you shouldn't have to, and quite frankly, don't. Find yourself one of the many excellent 4Xs in the store and pass over this ambitious but ultimately flawed gem.",
      "Playing this game instantly brought back memories of me playing TMNT, Battletoads, Double Dragon, and Streets of Rage, with my little brother on the NES and Sega Genesis in the early 90s. Luckily this game doesn’t feature TMNT’s ridiculous water level or Battletoads' sadistic peed bike level. The graphics are perfect, the controls are great, the soundtrack is awesome (especially the Wu-Tang stage, and the Shredder stage), and the levels and overworld map are fun to navigate. I’ve played through the story mode with all 7 characters and have played through the arcade mode multiple times solo and many times in multiplayer and I’ve enjoyed every bit of it. This game is so much fun.\n\nThere are a few things I wish existed though. I wish there were more playable characters. I wish that you did not lose your 7 character’s progress in story mode when you start a new game. I wish you could see the difficulty level of the online arcade game you are joining. I wish there were cumulative stats you could see for arcade and story mode that showed the number of times you completed a stage, how many enemies you knocked out, objects you’ve destroyed, stage times, combo streaks, times taunted, etc. I wish you could create your own turtle and assigned moves, specials, jumps, taunts, and colors.",
      "I purposefully went into this game looking for bugs, seeing that it was in early access, and I have yet to find any. The only reason I stopped playing was because there was a fence that wasn't fully secured to the ground that I was able to get underneath, allowing me to get out of bounds. This lead to me falling into an area where I couldn't get out, and it wouldn't let me respawn at my most recent checkpoint. This would mean I'd have to start from the beginning, which I very much didn't want to do. Anyway, the biggest tips I can give to the developers is to make sure the map is 100% how they want it, and to make the audio design better. That's it. I may come back and change my review in the future.\n\nFINAL RATING: 4 / 10",
      "In my personal opinion,Total War Warhammer 3 is better than its predecessor in every way.\n\nFactions:\nThey did an excellent job t fine tuning the older factions to the point where every faction now feels fully fleshed out and playable. The starting units are fun and the starting areas are usually in a better position. Sure, some factions start off in a really awkward ass places with really strong armies surrounding them, but overall, everything feels much more thought out.\n\nThe new factions they added to this game are fun altho for someone who might be just getting into the game, id recommend going with someone like Grand Cathay and move on from there.\n\nMap:\nThe world map is huge and i love it. The battle fields you fight in are detailed and look absolutely stunning. Fights look like movies sometimes so grab some popcorn and watch your armies die since you were munching on popcorn and not moving your units.\n\nRTS:\nthe RTS side of this game is what got the biggest improvement in my opinion. Everything is so much more clear and the battles just look insanely good. The game feels a bit more fast phase which i don't mind at all since WH2 felt like a battle of attrition sometimes and missile infantry seemed really bad.\n\nOverall i can safely say this i my favorite game currently. The multiplayer is super fun but judging by the reviews some of you leave on this game, its safe to say you have no friends to play with. \n\nDLC might cost bit more than it used to but people will complain about anything if its not free.",
      "If I could get my money back, I would. AI as usual is hot garbage, cant even take turns without getting LITERALLY BODIED by the AI drivers. The new progression system really sucks. Cool that they wanted to try something different, but I really dont feel like leveling every god damn car in the game just to modify it. If you wanted multiple of same car you would have to level those duplicate cars you purchase. My experience with the physics is just... eh. I mean I sure do love loosing grip just from barely tapping the gas. Constantly fighting my wheel just to stay stable. Driving its probably fine for controller players, I wouldnt on wheel. Credits are only used to buy cars now. Also kinda runs like crap. All i wanted was a Gran Turismo on PC and this... this is not it. Game is mid, move on me thinks.\n\nEdit: I put in a request for a refund and Valve did indeed approve it. I thought I was over the time limit for sure. Don't be me and spend 100 USD for early access. Thanks Valve, you're the best!",
      "While still a work very much in progress, Nuclear Throne is currently one of my favorite games. It's a roguelike dungeon crawler with heavy \"bullet-hell\" elements and a little RPG sprinkled on top. When you begin a session of Nuclear Throne, you choose from one of several well-designed & freakish \"mutants\", each with their own special attributes which, in itself, does much to add variety (there's also a random-select option which is a fun idea in this particular case). The goal of each stage is to exterminate all of the enemies. After doing so, a portal opens which takes your mutant freak to the next level. There are a great many weapons with which to inflict meyhem on your adversaries. As you gain experience points, in the form of green goo earned by killing enemies & also found in cache jars, you'll be able to choose new persistent perks for your character (such as more HP or certain weapons doing more damage). Every so-often, you'll encounter a boss. The bosses tend to pop in during the height of an already-in-progress battle which makes beating them all-the-more difficult & hectic.\n\nOriginally, this game did not have controller support which was a great disappointment (though I had been ejoying it anyway, using the keyboard and mouse). However, a recent update rectified this and the gameplay using a dual-analog controller (such as that of the Xbox 360) is just fantastic. Like Ultratron before it (another very similar game which is also worth a look; I also wrote a review for it, if you're interested in checking it out), Nuclear Throne throws you straight back to the arcades of yore and plops you in front of a Smash TV cabinet.\n\nAs a roguelike dungeon-crawler, the replay value is extremely high (due to the fact that the level and enemy layout is totally different from one session to the next). The rather extreme difficulty doesn't hurt either, as playing entails dying and thus restarting... a lot. Fortunately, said difficulty isn't of the variety that compels you to smash your controller/keyboard in frustration. Every death feels like the fault lay squarely on *your* shoulders (if only you had moved to dodge a little faster or conserved ammo a little better!), as opposed to the game feeling like it's cheating. Another stand-out feature which I think I need to bring up is the soundtrack. ...Just wow! Nuclear Throne's score is totally original and extremely surreal. It goes *miles* in lending its own atmosphere to the game. \n\nSome might consider the current price of $12.99 to be just a *little* steep for a game in this class, but considering how well it's made overall and the fun I've gotten from it (especially being in its currently pre-release/beta state), I consider it to be well worth the price. As of the time of this writing, the developer(s) is very active and updates are coming quite frequently.\n\nUPDATE 01/12/16: I hadn't played this game in quite a while (at least 6+ months) and I wanted to check out the progress that the devs have made, etc. Well... The game starts but as soon as I select a character, it totally locks up. I can't play it at all. To make matters worse, I've heard that the devs have since \"abandoned\" development of this game (so it's not likely that whatever is causing the crashes for me is going to be fixed any time soon - or ever). Bummer man. I loved this game...",
      "Yes, the Origin client is somewhere between annoying and broken, depending on your hardware.

      "Playing this game for the first time six years after its initial release proved to be a delight in disguise. With all the memes and jokes established, I was finally able to understand what the fuss was all about back in 2011. Despite not having the best gameplay, story or graphics out there, something about this title just made me want to finish every quest I deemed worth completing. \n\n9/10 - mods recommended",
      "People in the reviews don't understand this game.\n\n1. This is not Final Fantasy Tactics and it has a good reason for it.\n2. They barely removed any skills compared to the previous version and you will find most of those \"lost\" skills integrated into new skills or mechanics while certain broken mechanics were removed for a good reason. They also made things more challenging which i see as a welcome change. Things are also generally more viable and that is never a bad thing.\n3. You don't need to grind in this game, so why do i see people bring up grinding? Sure there's 40 weapon levels but in the endgame you get max level after like a couple battles if you really feel like you need to grind it out. In the previous version you had to level up a ton of different skills and some of them went up very slowly so there's actually a lot less grinding in this one.\n4. The reason you're struggling with doing damage is not because the game is bad, it's because you're not looking at what your equipment does or you don't understand it. The attack value in weapons is a base value which is used to penetrate your targets armor. It makes sense to do 1 damage against a person wearing heavy armor if you're firing an arrow at them. All the various boosts that you get in this game are applied to the damage you do AFTER you penetrate your targets armor. In order to do real damage to heavily armored targets you need to either use the right kind of weapon to attack them or make use of the new elemental system since now every character has an element that can be used to deal more damage OR you can simply apply a debuff to them since debuffs affect their defensive value directly. So yes this is not a game where you always win by rushing at your enemy and pressing attack. You have to understand how the game works and going through that process has been incredibly fun for me.\n5. You don't need to worry about those permanent stat gain cards or leveling your unit in a certain class to get the best possible stats. What you get from doing that isn't really going to make a difference if you're not playing well enough BUT if you really want to have a super powerful godlike unit, this game still allows it through those mechanics.\n6. The buff cards on the field are also not something you're required to make use of to beat the game, they're just there to make the battlefields more interesting and a way to make boss-characters stronger without directly cheating their stats.\n7. They removed random battles but you don't need random battles for anything because you can recruit units in the various long dungeons or simply go back in time to recruit a specific unit from any level in the postgame.\n\nIn summary it's a game that requires you to think a little bit but as you understand more you can also make things that seemed underwhelming at first viable because you found a way to make use of them. The story is also integrated into the gameplay so it's easy to keep interested in it especially since you get to make choices that affect both the story and gameplay. As a remake it definitely feels like they remade the game completely as it's so different from all the original versions. It's not for everyone and it doesn't have to be but hopefully the enjoyers of games like FFT or fire emblem will not dismiss this because of the reviews since this might become one of your favorite rpgs if you just bother to look into it without wanting it to be a cheap remake. It's too easy to jump into conclusions when we live in a world filled with terrible \"remakes\" popping up each year. This is all so ironic too as the spirit of this game when it comes to the story and gameplay alike is that you will never truly win by jumping into conclusions and there will always be something you didn't consider.\n\nUpdate: Replying to comments and addressing things for people who are familiar with the originals: \n\nI don't think they took away anything so vital that it would ruin the game. I can't really think of anything important other than the rogue class myself. You can call it removal but I'd rather say that they moved a lot of stuff to a different place from the list of skills and changed a lot of them to better fit the new card system and the new skill/spell limits. \n\nYes in my original review I didn't mention anything about the skill limit being reduced from 8 to 4. I think this change mostly just made the game easier to understand and when it comes to strategy I don't think anything was lost. You were going to use those extra 4 skill slots for things like strengthen or spellcraft either way and with the new scouting system moving around 8 skills before each encounter would probably be a little tedious (as it already feels tedious to setup units with the current system). \n\nAnd when it comes to spells, I simply can't understand why I would want to have access to more or all equipable spells as it would result in casters being a lot stronger than what they are supposed to be. This also makes each caster class more defined instead of them just being some kind of upgrades of each other so that a lategame class like the shaman can be a lot less useful in certain situations than your starting mage class because they don't have access to debuff spells but in return they hit super hard with their damaging spells.\n\nWhat else did they remove? They reworked the weird elemental system  into something that's always in play and I find this change very welcome as it adds another layer of strategy to the game especially through finishers and equipment bonuses even for non-spellcasters (but is still a little weird to get the hang of at first). They removed spell scrolls... yeah i probably dont have to mention why I see that as a good thing as well.\n\nAnd sure you can dislike these changes but we have to remember that steam reviews are black and white. Posting a negative review based on a subjective change is indistinguishable from saying \"this game is trash don't even look at it\" when it comes to statistics which is what everyone first sees when they open the store page of a game. \n\nI'm completely on the same page with you about playing your own favorite version, whatever you prefer and I myself would like to mess around more with things like One Vision in the future. But imo giving this game a negative review is also bad for the reputation of other versions of tactics ogre.\n\nAnd ofc the game is definitely not perfect there's still imbalances and some skills are pretty underwhelming compared to what they used to be (RIP Rampart shadows...). But imo this is better than what I've seen from literally any other game remake ever so I simply can't agree with calling it a bad remake.",
      "This review only relates to the single player campaign. At 50 years old I have zero interest in multiplayer.\n\nAfter playing Gears of War 4, I was looking forward to this title. I wasn't disappointed. I found the new upgrade system with Jack enjoyable. The campaign was fun to play with minor exceptions. Graphics, sound, and voice acting were amazing. Campaign took me about 11 hours to beat. I consider that well worth the $60 I paid for the game.\n\nMy only real gripe about the single player campaign:  As a father of 3 girls, I'm all for strong female leading characters. Kait just isn't it, though. I didn't care for her in 4 and that didn't change in 5. For me she seems out of her league and just isn't believable as a team member. She's like Elizabeth Swan, the governor's daughter in Pirates of the Caribbean. She's a kidnapped damsel in distress in one movie, and the Pirate King in the next. It just doesn't work, for me anyway.",
      "A Short Hike is a relaxing, casual game about exploring an expansive, mountainous island park and eventually making your way to its summit so you can get cell phone reception.\n\nYou play as Claire, a bird who can climb, glide, and flap to great heights using a stamina system based upon how many golden and silver feathers you’ve collected. Along the path to the mountaintop you’ll encounter Animal Crossing-style characters who are friendly, punny, and usually have some minor task for you to solve, ranging from finding lost items to making deliveries.\n\nHelping residents of the island is completely optional, as is just about every activity in the game other than locating a few feathers and reaching the summit; as a result, length can range from an hour if you don’t stop to smell the roses to a few hours if you decide to make friends with everyone and see all the park has to offer.\n\nActivities include filling out a fishing journal by trading in your catches, digging in suspicious spots, solving treasure map clues, parkour racing, and opening up shortcuts by breaking blocked entrances and watering bouncy flowers. \n\nA Short Hike has a charming aesthetic and a lovely, peaceful soundtrack. I felt driven to see everything the game had to offer despite not being forced into any of it and never lost interest until I did so. It’s a beautiful little world that will make fans of Animal Crossing feel right at home.",
      "Two words: Modding Heaven. This is probably one of the most modular games I've ever played. \n\nYou wanna play Mount and Blade in a historical time period instead of Calradia? OK, which one? Don't answer, it doesn't matter, there's probably a mod for it. \n\nWanna add in some magic and play in a fantasy universe? There's mods for that. \n\nHow about a game set in the modern day? Or in a sci-fi universe? Or a post-apocalypse wasteland? Or the Wild West? Or maybe something specific like throwing your hat into the Game of Thrones, or defending the World of Men in Lord of the Rings, or taking over the Empire from Star Wars?\n\nPerhaps you'd like to set sail on the seven seas as a pirate in a nautical adventu-! Oh, wait, OK, there aren't any of -those-. \n\n...but there's mods for all of the others, with even more being made every day! \n\n\nI guarantee, if you buy this and are open to modding your game, you will never go another year without playing Warband. Maybe a week, maybe a few months-- but just when you think you're done with it, you'll find another mod based on your favorite movie series popping up to pull you back in. \n\nIt is worth well above whatever you'll pay for it.\n\n",
      "Really fun for the first few rounds... Then the game changes your control scheme without telling you, and with no way to turn it back. This has lead to several hours of frustration, trying to revert it. From what I've read, this is 'intended' to make the game more difficult, but really, is just incredible stupid. If I wanted the game to be more difficult because of a more annoying control scheme, I'd play with a god damn dance pad.\n\nThe game is really fun, but this has frustrated me to the point that I can't enjoy it any more unless it's fixed, and therefore I can't recommend it either",

      "Steins;Gate Elite is a great Visual Novel when looked at in isolation. The main problem is that Steins;Gate (the original) exists. I don't mind the difference in art styles, that is a matter of personal preference anyway. Graphics in Elite are a lot more animated, images in the original are more static but also more detailed. What I have an issue with is the missing parts in the story.\n\nThere are a few situations where Elite eliminates choices when compared to the original. I won't spoil details, but in one of the early chapters you can choose to ignore or answer a phone call, leading to alternate branches in the story (they join again soon after, but each branch still contains unique content). Well, you can choose in the original. In Elite, you automatically answer the phone, the other branch is no longer in the game.\n\nAt a later point in the game, I noticed that quite a sizeable chunk of a previously linear story progression (not even an alternate branch) concerning Faris was completely cut out. Again, I won't spoil details in case you just want to decide which version of the game to get and don't know the story yet. It has been some time since I played the original, so I might have missed more instances of missing story parts, but at least this one part was really obvious.\n\nThe missing branches and parts are not really relevant to the overall story, but you probably want them if you want to know more about the characters. Elite is more streamlined, but at least all of the alternate endings are still here. So while there is missing stuff compared to the original, there is quite a bit more when compared to the anime. Then again, the anime added more story after the true ending of the original game. I was hoping that Elite added (and maybe fleshed out) this extra content as well, but no luck here, Elite ends at the same point as the original.\n\nIf you don't mind the art style of the original, play that one instead. The second game (Steins;Gate 0) only exists in it's original form anyway. Elite might still be worth it if heavily discounted since it is the only way to get the \"free\" Linear Bounded Phenogram. You can justify it as buying LBP and getting Elite as a free extra.",
      "I like furry art, but first and foremost im a RPG gamer, and as such I will rend judgment impartially. \n\nThe story is not bad, but still falls in the average category and it is predictable, gameplay is the same as the first Fuga (I have no problems there) but there are few new enemies,  so the strategy to beat the regular battles is very repetitive. My biggest complain remains the same since Tail Concerto and it is the dificulty... which is way too easy, there is no hard / nightmare mode for veteran players, Im not asking to die repeatedly like in dark souls but Cyberconnect2 needs to understand some players like a challenge in their games.\n\nMusic is ok and Hack is the best character of the lot (Tah tah tah tah  taaah!!!!!) I would play Fuga 3 just for him.\n\nIt pains me to give the thumbs down, but Cyberconnect2 needs to work a little harder.",
      "[h1]SMOOTH RIDING WITH A FEW BUMPY ROADS[/h1]\n\nFirst off, I am going to get this out of the way. If you are planning to buy this game and wondering which version to get, ask yourself this. If you are a minimalist, standard is fine. If you want the expansions, get ultimate. Deluxe on the other hand I think is worth skipping entirely. If $99.99 is too much for you for Ultimate, just wait for a sale. Ultimate is definitely my choice for recommendation. The amount of content you get is impressive and worth the price of admission. \n\nForza Horizon 4 is a car collector's dream, with a roster of over 700 cars (with Ultimate). And also a racing enthusiasts dream playground with a decently sized map with tons of racing variety and events to play around with. I have tons of racing games on Steam personally, and none have held my interest as much as Forza Horizon 4. It's a shame though that this came so late to Steam. But even still, I got my money's worth with over 120 hours of playtime at the time of writing this. \n\nIs Forza Horizon 4 perfect though? Sadly, it is not. The Steam version is hampered with some unfortunate bugs. People may experience random crashes, which while not happening often after the last few updates, still do happen, as this game is a few versions behind the Microsoft store's own version. Something I don't know if will ever be fully fixed. Also online racing can be hit or miss with issues. Those issues usually lie in the wait times sadly, so it might be offputting for those looking to race with others. Luckily there is more than enough content without having to do online races to keep most people happy. \n\n I'm still giving this a recommend regardless of that issue, just because more often than not, the game does run smoothly. \n\nIf you happen to just get the standard version of the game you get access to the main map which is a caricatured version of Great Britain, which includes many race events ranging from your standard street races, dirt tracks and even full blown off road events. There are also other events which include speed traps, drifting, massive jumps, promotional events (like racing the Halo Warthog, racing against trains, and more), and some cool little story events like racing for Top Gear, or even opening your own businesses. There's plenty of content for sure. If you decide to get the expansions, you get other maps, including Fortune Island, which is, well, an Island, complete with both low and high altitude locations, lots of off roading, some impressive night time visuals (Aurora Borealis anyone?), and more. You also get the Lego Speed Champions map which is a fun and impressively designed map based on the Lego toys which features it's own variety of fun and unique settings, including a beach riddled with pirate ships, a haunted lighthouse, a stunt arena, and more. Also it gets it's own radio station that plays just 1 song on loop. If you guessed that song is \"Everything is Awesome\", you'd be right, Both expansions also come with a unique way of progression and their own vehicles to collect. Fortune Island will have you progress to unlock a variety of treasure hunts, that each unlock 1 million credits, and the Lego expansion has you doing different tasks to collect studs which can be used to build your house and also collect new cars. Both expansions will also include a majority of the types of events you will be used to in the base game, with their own unique flair. \n\nWith 700 cars luckily there is enough variety for anyone. But for those looking for more, you can custom tune each vehicle to your own liking, with a variety of parts and overhauls, including full blown engine swaps. For those who are not gear heads, the community has you covered and you can even download custom tunes from others. Forza Horizon 4 is one of the most generous racing games I have ever played with the sheer amount of cars they dump on you. You can win cars from events. You can win cars from wheelspins. you can win cars from leveling up. You can win cars from performing certain tasks. You can win cars from barn finds, which are like little treasure hunts. You can also buy cars from both an auto show, or take your chances at an in game auction house, which is also a great way to make money, to well, buy more cars. Basically, Horizon does not let you down with the cars. It's like Pokemon for car lovers. And once you have that dream car, don't forget to give it that unique look. Most cars can have some visual parts swapped out, ranging from spoilers to bumpers and more, and you can add custom designs to the paint jobs too. Want to race around in Jurassic Park Jeep? Want to race around in the Bandit 1 from Smokey and the Bandit? Forza has you covered. And if you just want to look at the cars in all their glory, Forza also has a nice little feature called Forzavista which allows to do things with your car like opening and closing doors, and for some vehicles you can open up trunks and hoods and look inside at the engines. If you get the James Bond pack, you can even look at those nifty little gadgets like the machine guns mounted to some of the Bond vehicles. Pretty neat stuff. \n\nAt the end of the day, is Forza Horizon 4 worth it? I'd say yes.",

      "This game is pure art, I enjoyed every second of it. The mechanics are great and the puzzles can get quite challenging. Sadly its only a little over 3 hours of playtime.\n\nOne of the best games I've played in a long time!",

People who have problems with flashing lights should avoid this game since the game isn't as good as it is with some options turned off.[/i]\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1]In-Depth Review[/h1]\n\n[h3]Visuals[/h3]\nThe developer spends a lot of effort crafting beautiful, quality cutscenes. Some scenes show the beauty of the night sky while others show what the main character is feeling from close range. Food images look so carefully made that I couldn't believe that it was a pixelated image at first. Every scene does a good job in supporting the story, combined with the relaxing music that is running in the background.\n\nBlurry effects are applied on the screen, whether it's just to make a certain area stand out or create a cool-looking effect for the cutscenes. The game relies on a lot of transitions in its cutscenes, some can leave you shocked with the inverted images and flashes of red colors at intense moments. People that have problems with these can soften the red color in the option with the downside of making the scene to be less effective. Moreover, since the option affects all red colors in the game, some scenes will look weird with the faded color.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441881358 \n\n[h3]Story[/h3]\nThe story is a relaxing one, set in a place where people are helpful and empathetic to your actions. Every character gives a positive vibe through their attitude and kindness, supporting you whenever you are down or helping you to enjoy the moment. Reading the interaction between characters warm my heart, especially when accompanied by the relaxing music that is playing in the background.\n\nThe storytelling is wonderfully done with the combination of visuals and music to let you drown in the story. Sometimes, an intense moment kicks in, changing the scenery into one full of effects and transitions. The fast-paced music also helps to set the mood with its upbeat tone, increasing the intensity. The ending is told in a similar manner, although instead of an intense moment, it crafts a touching scene instead that is fit for an ending. Some people will find a small part of the ending not to make any sense, although luckily, it won't affect the overall experience.\n\n[h3]The Game[/h3]\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nThe game is focused on reading memories of an object to progress. Your hidden ability to read an object's memory by touching it will help you to solve various tasks, ranging from looking a lost object to finding a hidden area. There are some limitations though - some objects have no memories that you can read while other objects can't be interacted with until they are discovered. Fortunately, they are quite easy to discover as long as you spam the space button and/or pay attention to the dialogues.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441881785 \n\n[b]Puzzles and Minigames[/b]\nThe rest of the gameplay is focused on the usual adventure games where you have to pick up items and use them to pass through the area. Most problems that you will have to solve has the same theme as the building you are in. It's nice to see how puzzles are related to the corresponding area while still being unique at the same time.\n\nMost puzzles and minigames are easy to solve except for a select few. I found the last one to be the trickiest because not only does it cover a huge area, but it also requires you to use the mechanic from a previous area, something which never happened in other puzzles. It's still easy to solve as long as you are attentive enough, but if you happen to get stuck, the game offers subtle hints in the form of memories that you can read.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441883206 \n\n[b]Length and Replayability[/b]\nI finished the game in 9.7h after experiencing all the bad endings. Although the game only offers one manual save slot, it has an extra checkpoint slot that you can load before the story branches off. A hidden secret can also be found after you finished the game, which might take a long time to find due to its randomness. I found it to be a waste of time though, especially since there isn't much that you can learn from the secret. You'll also be left with more questions than answers, giving more reason not to look for them unless if you are an achievement hunter or the curious type.\n\n[b]Problems[/b]\nDespite the game requires you to restart the game several times, you can't skip the cutscenes. Some parts of the game will lead you to a bad ending and the unskippable cutscenes can take a significant amount of time if you don't know how to bypass it. Moreover, checkpoints tend to be placed minutes before the story branches off, wasting more of your time. Lastly, the game isn't very clear whenever it autosaves your game. I had to save manually whenever I took a break from the game because of this.\n\n[h1]Specs[/h1]\nIntel Core i5-9300H 2.40GHz, 8GB RAM, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nThe game has a lot of elements that complement each other. The nice-looking visuals, the calm and relaxing music that can heat up in intense moments, the superb effect - everything blends well to make the story stands out. The detailed cutscenes are done well to capture the emotion that can't be portrayed with a simple portrait and character animation, while portraits are expressive enough to handle simple expressions. The game is designed with quality in mind and although it can be slow sometimes, the relaxing music helps you to savor the moment.\n\n[quote]This game was reviewed with a key provided by the developer for free through [url=https://discord.gg/xc22zZP]Reviewers' Paradise[/url], a group that connects both developers and reviewers in one place[/quote]\n\n[quote]Visit SaveOrQuit.com for detailed game reviews, posted daily![/quote]",
      "While it seems grindy at times, you will probably feel greatly rewarded when you can get enough resolve to spec out a specific build exactly how you want it. I think the progression of the tower abilities and gold gain is great, but even the burdens available don’t seem to switch it up quite enough. I’m on ng+4 and i feel like it’s getting a tad stale. I still like playing it of course. Some classes like the chef make the idea of playing anything else not quite worth it. I’m sure there’s some great niche builds but keep that in mind. Overall, this game keeps you on your toes. If you get hit, it’s almost always because you did something wrong. I LOVE the movement abilities in this game.

      "Before you buy: What you enjoy about Her Story (and maybe Telling lies) will very much affect your enjoyment of this game. \n\nIf you enjoyed the acting, the non-linear story telling, and the *movie* part of those games, this will probably be the best in the trilogy. HOWEVER, if you enjoy the detective aspect, the puzzles, the mental challenge, this game is probably not for you.\n\nThe gameplay is a big departure compared to Her Story and Telling Lies, and in my opinion, doesn't make for much of a challenge at all. In the 10 hours I spent on the game, 9 were just me watching clips and clicking random objects in the background. I found the actual movie stuff to be really fun (and especially seeing the process of how movies are made), but that kind of fun is very different to the kind I had with the previous two games.\n\nI don't dislike the game but I don't recommend it either, at least to a decent chunk of the fanbase (those being fans of detective puzzle games).",

Finally you can now play 1v1 ranked and spectate any previous matches that was played including spectating ongoing games in the lobby\n- You can add, remove and create your very own custom music tracks in-game for both Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert however you want\n- All of Frank Klepacki's overly iconic classical and remixed tracks are here including various modern remixed that was composed solely for this remastered collection!!!\n\n[b]The Bad:[/b]\n\n- Minor bugs (though not a real dealbreaker)\n- The gameplay meta among factions/units remains as unbalanced as ever. Kinda of a tradeoff for being too faithful to the original titles\n- Multiplayer is still officially limited to a maximum of 4 players total per map in Tiberium Dawn, while in Red Alert the limit is a maximum of 8 players total\n- FMV cutscenes are all still heavily compressed in SD resolution extracted from the Playstation home console version and further artificially enhanced via AI upscaling due to the fact that the original master footage tapes for both Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert are still yet to be found\n\n[b]The Kinda Ugly:[/b]\n\n- Certain mission on hard difficulty are completely unbalanced. This is already another insult to injury as the AI blatantly cheats when it comes to resource procurement and unit build time. The fault of a clear lack of playtesting",

If Harada agreed that the addition of Denuvo in Tekken 7 was a mistake, so should NetherRealm.\nI also don't like that 2 characters that are going to be in the Kombat Pass are already in the game (Ermac and Quan Chi). Just give us these characters and come up with other ones for the KP. This is super greedy and lazy.\nIt's even worse than Sektor and Cyrax in MK11, at least you didn't let us play them, period. this time you decide to not make them playable (even thought they work for the AI) AND sell them at a later date? That's awful.\n\nThe game is good but needs improvement and shouldn't ship with performance issues, 30fps content, microtransactions, Denuvo and greedy DLC tactics. I would put a \"meh\" review if I could because of the negatives but for that reason I have to say \"no\".",
      "The game itself is great, but Square Enix really dropped the ball by removing the true PC version and leaving us with this Switch port as the only option. It's a huge visual downgrade, but it has more content. Luckily though, a small handful of incredible modders have taken the time to painstakingly transfer the old, high-quality PC assets over to this version which is what saved it for me. Without the mods, I would not have kept playing.\n\nIf you're on the fence, I'd say catch it on sale, then head over to a modding site (Nexus is what I used) and start installing the mods that restore this game to its full PC potential. It's probably the easiest-to-mod game I've ever dealt with too btw. You don't have to be super savvy to get things the way you want them and you don't need any additional software. Just grab the .pak files, slap them into the game's pak folder, enjoy. It really is that simple. (You may want to edit some .ini files to tweak things to your liking, but that's as complex as it gets. If you can open Notepad, you can do this.)\n\nAs for the core gameplay, it's an incredibly solid JRPG with a likable cast and well thought out story. There's plenty of content to enjoy here and it has a good end game. The music is absolutely phenomenal as well. Visually, it's very vibrant and the aesthetic is charming. I think it's a fantastic game overall and is very enjoyable as is, but playing it in 1440p/144Hz with high resolution character and texture assets with better lighting/animation mods and subtle character/NPC/monster upgrades totally elevated it to the next level.\n\np.s. If you do install mods, I HIGHLY recommend grabbing the one that removes the black borders around characters! That gives the game a clean and refreshing new feel that greatly improves it in my opinion!",
      "The Graphics of this game don't match the high price tag",
      "It's strange how this will be the first review I ever write for a game. I always thought it would be written for a game like Fallout, Elderscrolls or some huge open world survival horror. And yet it's this little piece of art that has me aching to write something, if only for a minute.\nWhen I had finished this, a few minutes ago, I couldn't believe that they only charge a pittence for it. I thought to myself that if people can charge you 70 euro for games that are poorly executed and badly made from start to finish, then this game should have a much higher pricetag. It wasn't before looking up and seeing that I just finished the first episode in a mere three hours that I understood their reasoning. I feel, however, obliged to tell you all that the three hours spent in this game were worth more to me than the hundreads of hours I've spent in most other games combined. Not because the story was awsome, or the graphics made me gape in awe, but rather that every single aspect of the game in combination managed to grip me and pull me in so that time became temporarily meaningless. Imagine if games held this standard. Imagine if your favorite action, your favorite adventure game or even your favorite driver had this kind of execution. \nYou can tell a good story in a bad way, and you can tell a bad story in a good way. The story in this game might not be the most interesting story you've ever heard, but it's good, and in the execution of it you are drawn in, captured by it, moved by it.\n\nMost adventure games will entertain, they'll give you some ups and downs along the way, but ultimately they will feel like games.\nI've never felt so fulfilled after \"playing a game\" as I did today. Original, beautiful and masterfully executed. I can't wait for the next episode.",
      "Events that took place:\n\nDid not want to sell player,\nGot an offer for said player,\nRejected the offer,\nPlayer demaned to be allowed to speak to the club,\nGot a second offer from said club,\nEssentially forced to accept the offer,\nPlayer reached an agreement with the club,\nWished player the \"best of luck\" in his future endeavours,\nPlayer is angry that he is leaving,\nPlayer considerers his new club a \"step down\" in his career,\nReminder: Player demanded to go to said club,\nMe finding solice in the fact that FM19 although lacking in the football department, delivers a brilliant experience in dealings with manic and psychotic people.\n\nAllow me to grant you an insight into SI's employee knowledge on the subject their games are about. I once engaged in a conversation with a developer at SI about FM, and football in general. After some talking about premier league, and me slightly confused, I eventually understood that this developer thought that Tottenham Hotspurs were located in Liverpool. So I posed him the following question: \"Then why do they call any matches between Tottenham and Arsenal the 'North London Derby'?\" to which he responded that he did not know, but he assured me that Tottenham F.C was located in Liverpool. I had to resort to showing him the borough of Tottenham in London for him to understand that Tottenham Hotspurs is not lovated in Liverpool, but in fact in London.\n\nThis will be the last edition of this game series I will ever purchase. In a football management simulator such as this, letting SI and their employees (including the one that responded to this review) tell you various aspects of football, is like having a pervert preach to you about the virtues of sexual absitence. They know nothing, and since the core game has not progressed the slightest in 10 years, it would be a fair assumption that they do not care neither.\n\nFuck SI, Fuck their beloved \"devs\" and fuck Charlton Heston while you're at it.",
      "As the holder of a degree in Plant Sciences, I wholeheartedly endorse this game.\n\nReal talk: One of the best things about this game is how it totally commits to the old-timey apothecary/greenhouse theme-- it’s extremely atmospheric.

If the prospect of discovering and using plants to solve problems (or mayhap even a grim mystery) appeals to you, I recommend trying this game.",

      "[h1]AT A GLANCE[/h1]\n(Full review follows below)\n\n[list]\n[*] [b]Game Name:[/b] The Swapper\n[*] [b]Original Release:[/b] 2013\n[*] [b]Genre Tags:[/b] Atmospheric; 2D; Puzzle-Platformer; Sci-Fi \n[*] [b]My Overall Grade:[/b] A-\n[*] [b]Estimated Playtime (Campaign):[/b] 3-5 hours\n[*] [b]Multiplayer Aspect:[/b] None\n[*] [b]Recommended To:[/b] Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Aesthetes; Game atmosphere connoisseurs; Strong narrative advocates; Puzzle game aficionados\n[/list]\t\n\n[h1]REVIEW[/h1]\n[b]The Swapper[/b] is an enjoyable 2D puzzle-platformer that lacks gameplay innovation but rises above the crowd on the shoulders of its superbly well-designed atmosphere and provocative narrative.  The actual puzzle-solving aspect of the game is adequate, but with minimal diversity and accretion.  It is definitely a story-driven experience, with the gameplay taking a passenger seat.  If you can appreciate a game in that style, this is a good bet for you. \n\nThe entrancing narrative and the style in which it transpires work in concert with the mystifying ambiance to create a wondrous experience. The story touches on some thought-provoking metaphysical issues, while skillfully avoiding a fall too deep into the rabbit hole to keep the average person’s interest. Much of the rest of the narrative is comfortable, cliché sci-fi tropes that we all know and love.\n\nThe gameplay and the puzzles are far from [i]bad[/i], but they also are nothing special.  As I alluded to: they are sufficient, but fail to develop into anything overly interesting. Very little changes from the first puzzle to the last, so it does get a little bit dry.  That said, some of the later ones are quite tricky and a few require not only puzzle-solving ability but also decent reflexes. \n\nThe graphics are pleasurable and align perfectly with the vibe of the game. But the whole soundscape is what truly brings the atmosphere of [b]The Swapper[/b] to life. The ambient soundtrack, the cryptic chatter, and the selectively placed voice-overs contribute a wonderful blend of emotions and mystery. If you are into it, this is a game you might enjoy with the lights off and your headphones on (or however else you may get into the zone).  \n\n[b]The Swapper[/b] is a brief, interesting, and enjoyable experience. It is not a complex or intricate puzzle-platformer, but I recommend it to any fan of the genre who would appreciate the atmosphere and narrative.\n\n[i][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/murphyslawyercuration#curation]Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations![/url][/i]",
      "While i'm not far into it, so far it is great. All negative reviews are due to the stuttering. I have a 3070 and I googled a solution.\n\nWIth Nvidia GPUs go to Nvidia control panel and change the global shader cache size in 3d settings to unlimited. Also limit the fps of Elden Ring, I have it set to 60 fps. So far no problems on my end. Hope this helps somebody choosing to get the game.\nIf u have AMD GPUs I don't know specifics so please ask google sorry for not being able to help, but I know it is a similar process.\n\nNow 30hrs in the game is so good too\n\nNow done with the game it is amazing",
      "After the past few years of broken, buggy AAA games I've started to lose the passion I once had for the industry. This masterpiece came out of no where and completely reignited my love for gaming. PLEASE do not sleep on this game, it's such a breath of fresh air from the garbage you'd normally expect from modern day companies. Definitely taking a spot in my top 5 favorites and I haven't even scratched the surface of the game yet, it's just that good. Beautiful art style, crisp animations, a unique concept, FUN gameplay, its everything I've been wanting and more. Kudos to the devs for making this absolute banger <3",
      "I realise this is intended to be a darkly humored game, but it is still fucked up nonetheless. I just can't fathom how such degraded humor can be seen as funny.",
      "The core game is fun, and scratches an itch for miniatures combat that I often have.\n\nTwo reasons I don't recommend: \n(i) the single player AI is quite easy once you figure it out.  You can face challenging scenarios but it's because at higher difficulty levels the AI adds sheer weight of numbers. It doesn't get appreciably smarter, so the only challenge you face is how to funnel larger, dumb formations of enemies to come at you.  The campaign mode is just a series of battles against randomly generated forces with extremely thin randomly-generated narrative interludes of about a paragraph in length, with no strategic map, or concepts of supply or resources. It does not meaningfully extend the length of time single player is fun.\n\n(ii) Multiplayer relies on too many things that are opaque to people who have just played single player.  There are a lot of rules and features (like how you get sub-commanders - it comes down to arcane placement of cavalry troops in setup), that are not documented in the rules or in any tutorial.  Unless you are willing to read the forums for both this game and the original game and try to glean this information, you will be perpetually at a disadvantage against the majority of the community who have been playing since the first game.  \n\nIf you like miniatures tabletop gaming and have lots of spare time to devote to the game to learning it in spite of the game not fully explaining its mechanics or giving feedback to you on enemy actions, it will be worthwhile.  Otherwise, the single player experience by itself doesn't warrant buying at full price. Worth it at 50% off.",
      "Having accumulated over 13400 hours in-game with [i]Arma 3[/i], I would certainly recommend it to others. \n\nIf you enjoy tactical shooters and playing online with friends, it's well worth a look; especially if you appreciate a high dose of military realism!",
      "Playing this game instantly brought back memories of me playing TMNT, Battletoads, Double Dragon, and Streets of Rage, with my little brother on the NES and Sega Genesis in the early 90s. Luckily this game doesn’t feature TMNT’s ridiculous water level or Battletoads' sadistic peed bike level. The graphics are perfect, the controls are great, the soundtrack is awesome (especially the Wu-Tang stage, and the Shredder stage), and the levels and overworld map are fun to navigate. I’ve played through the story mode with all 7 characters and have played through the arcade mode multiple times solo and many times in multiplayer and I’ve enjoyed every bit of it. This game is so much fun.\n\nThere are a few things I wish existed though. I wish there were more playable characters. I wish that you did not lose your 7 character’s progress in story mode when you start a new game. I wish you could see the difficulty level of the online arcade game you are joining. I wish there were cumulative stats you could see for arcade and story mode that showed the number of times you completed a stage, how many enemies you knocked out, objects you’ve destroyed, stage times, combo streaks, times taunted, etc. I wish you could create your own turtle and assigned moves, specials, jumps, taunts, and colors.",
      "I fucking love this game (and the original Guacamelee as well). It's excellent, challenging platforming with a hilarious sense of humor. I'm an archaeologist who works in Mexico and this game is littered with funny and well-researched nods to Mexican history and pre-history. I imagine that matters less to the non-archaeologists out there, but the fact that they took the time to research all their jokes speaks to the care that went into this game.",

      "For the past 4 years I couldn't get myself to finish a single game without having to force myself to do it(and even then I failed). I couldn't enjoy SP games no matter how good the gameplay or the story was. I kept buying games hoping to find that one game that would do the trick. This was FF XV for me. Despite of all my friends advising me against buying it because it was just going to be another game that would sit around in my library, I decided to give it a try.\n\nIt actually felt like I went back in time to when I could play SP games for hours without getting bored after an hour or two.\n\nI admit I skipped most sidequests and I'll try going back to them sooner or later, although it may not be the best game out there in terms of content(you can finish the game on easy skipping most secondary quests in about 20-25 hours) or story development, playing through it felt like a new experience. In fact, even after finishing the game there's still plenty of things to do and in my opinion, even playing it through again just to spend more time with Noctis and his friends is worth it.\n\nThe story is not mindblowing, the combat system is really fun but far from flawless, most sidequests aren't well written but at its core, at least for me, FF XV has something to it that other games lack. I can't say it magically restored my old passion for gaming but it has given me a reason to at least try to get into it again.\n\nIf you haven't played it yet I sincerely envy you, I would love to experience it all over again from the start, it has been a memorable journey to say the least and I hope that you are willing to give it a try. ^^",

      "If you like management type games and RPGs, this is the perfect mix. It's just enough management to allow you to thrive with mostly strategy without feeling bogged down, and just enough RPG elements to get you invested in not just your squad, but each individual character in it. \n\nHere's a tale from my experience with the game;\n\nThis is the kind of game to change your entire perspective on life itself. Failure is not the end, nor the beginning, but a constant in this world that you can either let destroy you or make you stronger. Allow me to tell you a story. The story of New Battlehill. \nNear the Shek city of Squin, not far east, was a small town. It went through many names. The first that stuck was Firstyeet, totally not a placeholder. It wasn't an notable settlement, merely consisting of a shack, an iron processor, and some walls to mildly inconvenience the roving gangs of Dust Bandits that liked to bully the residents. After being evicted from their own city once again, the residents, Denver, Soto, Ruka, and Meow, vowed to take back their home. After training and buying the best weapons and armor they could, they made their way back to Firstyeet. To their surprise, however, they would not have to fight. One of the bandits had picked a fight with a herd of goats. The bandits' defense failed against the caprine assault. From this, the town would get its second name - Densorumego. Den for Denver. So for Soto. Ru for Ruka. Me for Meow. And Go for the true heroes, the goats.\nPeace would not last long but soon the residents of Densorumego would become strengthened by their constant fighting. On the elevated, somewhat round land on which Densorumego sat, there were many large fights involving a lot of people. If only there was some sort of name to reflect this... \nAnd from that, the town was renamed for the last time, to Battlehill.\nThings were looking up. The town built its first farms and expanded to be almost four times its original size. But this peace would not last. Battlehill's new ambitions of self sufficiency would attract the attention of a new foe - The Shek Kingdom.\nThe Shek claimed ownership of the land Battlehill was on, and as such, demanded all food grown there be given to them. Confident from their many victories against the Dust Bandits, the Battlehillites refused the Shek demands. Their risk was calculated... but man were they bad at math.\nAll but one were nearly killed in the ensuing battle, and the one person that wasn't knocked into a coma was stuck on the wall because part of the wall was destroyed and he could no longer reach the stairs because of that. The people knew they couldn't fight the Shek, but they would not allow themselves to be subservient either. And so began their malicious compliance. The Shek would get all the food in Battlehill, as it would be none - The Battlehillites were moving.\nI could write entire books about their journey around the west. The Fogmen, the ruins, the Screeching Bandits, there's many a tale. But, eventually, the people would find a new home. In the harsh and Beak Thing infested land of Vain, homeland of the Western Hive, they would found their new home - New Battlehill.\nJump to now, the city is thriving, they have more bread than they know what to do with, they've grown strong from defending their home from the Beak Things, and their population has grown. They are currently planning a reconquest of Battlehill, which was occupied by Dust Bandits shortly after they left.\n\nThere is a part I left out, between Firstyeet and Densorumego - I had repeatedly failed to retake Firstyeet, and I was about to quit the game. I was frustrated that I'd gone and bought the best arms and armor and still failed. And when I tried to set up a training ground on a mountain near Squin, bandits again came and defeated me. I went as far as to try and get a refund, which was denied. That refund being denied was the best thing that could've happened. I decided to give the game another try, and to try accepting my failures and growing from them. And if I hadn't done that, I would never have founded New Battlehill. None of the legend worthy tales my squad has been through would have happened. And I'd never have had the fun of going through all of them.\n\nIn short, get this game. It is just great.",
      "Very fun game. Best wave shooter on the market that I've ever seen. The roguelike nature of it is very fun. Each run hits you with different challenges in building your weapons.\n\nBiggest critiques - \n1. Achievements locked behind multiplayer in a dead game. God I hate when devs do this. It luckily lets you play through normal mode when queuing, but its still very annoying. The last achievement I needed was \"get to wave 50 of multiplayer gauntlet mode\". I've so far been able to play 2 games of multiplayer. One, my partner had no voice coms. Second, my partner started with extremely staticy voice coms and it cut out at about wave 5. We pushed through to wave 48. Aaaaaaaaaand network error. It took about an hour and a half to get that far just for the game to crash and lose it all. Devs, please stop hiding achievements behind multiplayer when you know full well your game won't have a huge online player base.\n\n2. You get TWO GUN ARMS! This is AMAZING AND AWESOME! Except for the fact that a ton of the attachments for your weapons affect every part on your gun. So by not just making one super mega death arm, you are effectively chopping your total strength into two parts. There are a few pieces that only give you buffs for \"dual wielding\" or having a firing barrel on each arm. But these are not very common, and the stats you get from them pale in comparison to just making a super gun on one arm and keeping the other arm clenched for punching enemies that get up to your face, or putting on a single melee weapon on the other hand for the same purpose. \n\n3. The variety of guns is fun, but in the end it ends up turning into \"hold the fire button, aim for enemies, walk in a circle to trick enemy aim as best as possible, and occasionally punch an enemy that gets to you\". The biggest change to this system is getting either the rocket launcher or the Barrel Barrel which shoots massive barrels at the enemies. They have a very slow fire rate and do best when aiming the shots more precisely. But even then, with some weapons having a spooling time, and others outputting a hale of bullets, the best strategy is to just keep the trigger held 24/7 and strafe your aim from enemy to enemy.\n\nI really enjoyed my time with this game, but don't try to 100% it. The multiplayer achievement isn't worth it. Network is terrible. There's too much going on on screen when you have 2 players in the mix so crashing is likely. If I were the Completionist I would give this game a rating of Finish It. Play through the game with all the unique starting bonuses, all the difficulties. But stay away from multiplayer unless you have a friend to dedicate multiple hours to trying the gauntlet with.",
      "Noita is a great indie rogue-lite 2D adventure where every pixel has his own life. The controls with mouse and keyboard are simple and the principle of the game as well easy to learn (and hard to master). Just get as deep, as far as possible. You only have one life. If you die you start all over. \n\nGameplay video: https://youtu.be/6N4Boz1YA2Y\n\nI very much enjoy playing Noita, even if it is sometimes a bit unfair and the procedural generated levels aren't always giving you the same amount of luck. The game still needs some more balance in the gameplay, as well as optimizations since I experienced little stutters here and there.\n\nSince it is early access, I expects improvements in this sense. Overall the game is fun and definitely an added-value to every indie library or rogue-lite gamers collection.\n\nTherefore, I can recommend the game! \n\nPS: Restarting a run shouldn*t restart the application, @developers.",
      "My previous review reflected the terrible state of the game as it was on launch day. After years of improvements, the game has had its map design & cover placement tweaked, pretty-boy playermodels have been dirtied up, cringy voicelines were adjusted & a bunch of new content has been added. A lot of my complaints were addressed and I recognize the amount of work the team has done to bring the game back. It finally feels content complete and has reached an acceptable level of quality that should've been there when it came out.\n\nHowever, I am still disappointed to say it falls very short of its predecessors in terms of gameplay, map design and atmosphere. I see no reason to play this instead of BF3/BF4. \n\nPlay the map Grand Bazaar in Battlefield 3. Look at all of the particle effects, post processing and detail that map has. It has such a thick rainy atmosphere. Play it through to the end and you'll see how players tear up the map and make it look destroyed. In BF4's Paracel Storm, the foliage will sway & the waves will rise as the strong winds of a storm approaches the map. Watch as a sandstorm creeps up in Gulf of Oman and eventually engulfs it in a torrent of chaos. These landscapes have so much drama that the ones in 2042 lack. Sure, there are sandstorms and tornadoes, but they still look so sterile compared to the previous games this title stands upon.\n\nConceptually, 2042's world is supposed to be on its knees. The growing reality of extreme climate, natural disasters becoming commonplace and the world powers fighting over the last resources Earth has to offer depicts a dire situation to immerse ourselves in. This makes me imagine maps where earthquakes adjust the layout of flags throughout the round, or tsunamis roll in and what once was a playable area is now flooded. Giant tornado events that tear down skyscrapers. Sandstorms that turn the widest of maps into a close-quarters brawl. \n\nThe maps in the game have some aspects of this concept but nowhere to the amount that it should. The technology is there. The previous games have had a genuinely impressive level of immersion and atmosphere. 2042 did not have this on launch and it still doesn't. This could have been the wild natural disaster Battlefield game where we see SHTF.\n\nI don't care that we have 128 player matches or goofy butt specialists to play as. They missed the mark with 2042 and no update can fix that, conceptually, it never was able to realize its potential.",

This game is pure feeling.\n\n\nthat aside, this game is pretty much a perfect game for me, the story is really interesting, the music is beautiful and the art is gorgeous, and the characters and the atmosphere are so fucking believable i think i know everybody in this game, or atleast i feel so.\n\nAs a small town dude i really relate with a lot of thing in this game.\n\nThis game is special, its special for me.",
      "   I just finished playing the 5th episode 😭. It feels incredibly sad to say \"Good Bye\" to this game. While playing I had a chance to get to know every in game character, especially Max and Chloe. They've become like my new friends, we've been through so much together, and realizing that it's over now, it's hella tough. \n   I've seen a lot of great games before, but never did a game make me feel SO connected to its characters. And every time you need to make a choice, you start seeing everything you've been through before and thinking how to make things even better. But I think the most important thing here is not to overthink (I mean not to try to Google what consequences your choice is going to have because it kills all the excitement of not knowing). Just do what feels right and what your heart tells you even if you might be wrong. I guess that's the lesson I learned in here. \n   Other important things that make Life Is Strange my favorite game: The developers paid attention to the smallest details, some of them you don't even notice playing for the first time, but the fact that they're there makes me appreciate it even more. The graphics is hella amazing, you just have to see it for yourself :) The plot and the music complement each other in subtle ways, and I can guarantee you'll have at least several of the soundtracks in your favorites playlist ;) \n   The game's definitely worth its money and even more. I wish I'd be able to forget everything that happened in the game and start playing it from the very beginning, so I'd be able to feel everything with the same intensity I did during my first playthrough. But I'll definitely come back to it after some time just to do it all over again. \n   Dear Developers, THANK YOU so much for Life Is Strange. I wish you all the best and I'm looking forward to seeing more masterpieces from you.",

      "This is the purest Megaman experience I've had in years. I don't remember the last time I sat down with a Megaman-style game like this and just had pure Fun, and got fully engrossed in it over everything else. 20XX? No. Fangames? No. Even Megaman 11 didn't grab me this hard. This is it. This is the game people wanted when they saw Mighty Number 9 the first time. This is the Megaman successor we've been waiting for.\n\nIf I had to say anything negative about it, it'd be the music. It's mediocre at best. It's Meh. It does its job and fills dead air, but I'm not rushing to download the OST any time soon. I can't think of a single track that I went \"wow I need that\" for.

      "The cognitive dissonance in the original Space Quest games between the box cover art telling you that \"Roger Wilco is hapless!\" and the player's necessary mental exertion involved to solve the puzzles, is laid bare the moment you can type in the name you will be called by in the game.\n\nIt's one of the hardest lines to walk when narrative is the main driver of an interactive work:  balancing the player's actions with the personality of the character they are directing in a world that is clearly alive, regardless of the players's presence.\n\nThe Excavation of Hob's Barrow's succeeds in this fully with the denizens and everyday life of the town of Bewlay.\n\nFrom the moment Thomasina Bateman starts recounting the events that led to her writing a letter to her mother, any ambiguity is dispelled: the player is helping Thomasina relive her time in starkly bucolic Bewlay. But as players spend more time within the memories and stories Thomasina shares, the more off putting the narration becomes. It's not just that Thomasina is an unreliable narrator—the implications of the traumatic events that occured at Hob's Barrow are still a puzzle to be worked out. \n\nThis is the strength of the narrative design and writing in Hob's Barrow: as entertainingly crafted as linear story or film, but with eartnest player engagement required to work out what's happening in the very deep shadows of this cursed place.\n\nThe fantastic writing is supported by equally fantastic pixel art, music, and some of the best voice work I've heard in games…ever? The codgers, critters, and countryside all sound fantastic, the bleakness of the moors churning from peaceful to menacing with expert orchestration. Visual direction is solid, too, with sparingly, effectively used pixel portraits and closeups to highlight details both grotesque and filled with character. The dark undercurrent of humour throughout the game also adds some replayability for achievement hunters: some encounters are worth revisiting!\n\nI played this entirely on Steam Deck, mostly curled up in bed at night, but enjoyed the grand finale while docked on my TV. Performance and control was flawless, regardless.\n\nOne of my favorite games released in 2022, and definitely one of my favorite adventure games of all time.",
      "[i] THIS MATCH WILL BE RED HOT. HERE GOES [/i]\n\nLord knows what attempt number, and you again hear the ring bell. The level boss keeps laughing, taunting your every failure. The brainwashing music is starting to give you a headache, your eyes are moving on their own, the difficulty is boiling your blood to the very cells and the controller screams for mercy as every retry gets more and more intense. The anger flows and the addicted child in you claims it will be the last try.

A punishing yet immensly satisfying game of bullet hell, mixed with a beautiful and just so goddamned perfectly recreated animation technique that will have you wondering what crazy stuff they will make up next. This is a game that yells nostalgia and effort in every moment. It’s a wonderful experience that at every turn you can tell they didn't just put blood, tears, effort and sweat at every second of work for the last years, they put so much LOVE. Love for the past and love for an era long gone but never forgotten.\n\nThe most pure fun I had raging in the whole year. Absolutely recommended to anyone up for a challenge that will give as much as it takes.",
      "I hold this game in as high esteem as games such as Undertale and Oneshot.\nIt would be a mistake to dismiss this game, as I once did.\n\nThis game made me really care about it. It's one of those games where the writing, music, graphics, and gameplay all work together to give life to the characters within it. Even though the setting takes place in a small area (comprising of 2 buildings, 3 caves, and a bake stand), it still feels like an entire world that had a past from before you started playing and a future that unfolds after you stop playing. Every part of the game serves towards this purpose. The developer took the time and effort to make sure every small, nuanced detail felt right. Whether it's a quirky little animation, the presence (or absence) of circumstance-fitting music, or the sound effects that make every footstep and enemy strike sound just right, this game does a phenomenal job making sure that every contributes an immersive experience. You’re not interacting with a piece of software, you’re interacting with a world.\n\nHowever, this game, as is all games, is not perfect. The combat can be a bit unintuitive owing to the fact that enemies can attack you while you are selecting your move, but you will PROBABLY get used to this and after that, boy, does it become quite an exciting experience. In addition, this game has many mentions of death. While this sounds terrible on paper, the game does manage to pull out some interesting game choices out of it. Unless you have trouble discerning fiction from reality (or are uncomfortable with the mention of death), you should be fine. All other flaws I won't elaborate on because they're subjective nitpicks (ex. didn't like a word choice; thought a certain sprite looked weird; thought that the music overplayed the \"spooky\" instruments that one time in the game).\n\nIf you're looking for a game that will make you invested in a new experience, you might have just found it.\n",
      "everyone posting 16 gb ram specs and saying it runs well, lul\n\ni have 8 gigs of ram with a gtx 660 (yep) and a fx-8350 and it runs around 45-60 FPS (i cap it at 60) at High settings. yeah. REALLY well optimized, considering this computer is nearing the end of its life and the visuals are gorgeous.\n\nEDIT: 1080p :)\n\noh, and it's fun too, right.\n\nEdit 2- Actual review\n\nGame is pretty easy. I forget if there was a hard mode, but if there was I picked normal mode, and the game feels like it should be on easy. I've yet to break a sweat on a boss (currently chapter 5), and the only thing stopping me from taking on enemies 10+ higher than me is that the game auto-nerfs your damage if the enemy is too far above you. I've actually found the game very relaxing as a result, because there isn't the frustration of having to redo bosses after getting wiped, so it's not entirely a bad thing. But if you were looking for a challenge in your battles, this isn't your game.\n\nAs for story, it's also fairly basic, and rides off of having a sizeable to-do list as sidequests. Recruiting new citizens, doing major sidequest chains, unlocking new stuff, it's got a good amount to do in-game to keep you occupied, unless you're a \"main quest line only\" player. It helps that the warp system is easy to use (and you will use it often) and the game is gorgeous, so you don't really feel too bored doing the same shet over and over again. \n\nThere are several elements to the gameplay. \n\nOne, the overworld traversing. Overall, I'm ambivalent to it. It can feel slightly sluggish at parts, but collecting the shiny areas is surprisingly addicting (maybe because I'm a sem-completionist), as are finding chests. The unfortunate part is that most of these chests contain utterly useless items, so don't really feel that rewarding. \n\nTwo, dungeon crawling. Have to admit this is one of the weaker parts for me. The dungeons are basic, and don't really have much in the way of puzzling elements. Could change later, highly doubt it will. I do like how the battles are seamless, though.\n\nThree, army battles. Also not much of a fan of this, but only because it seems like a side addition without much depth to it. Fortunately it's not a major part of the game, so meh.\n\nFour, kingdom management. Holy cow I love this part of it. People might complain it feels like a mobile game with the wait times and whatever, but since you can warp straight back to your castle whenever you want, it's not that big of an issue. I do wish your gains accumulated while you're offline (or tabbed out, at least...), but idk something about managing the kingdom and making it grow/level up is stupidly addicting.\n\nOverall, if you're looking for a challenging or engaging JRPG, this might not be the game for you. If you're looking for a game with gorgeous visuals, fantastic voice acting (using JP), laid-back atmosphere, and want to be the president of the United States serving some random kid as his vassal, highly recommended.\n\nHighly recommend to play on controller. I'm using the Switch Pro Con.",

However given their statement on this video, that's meant to be the point these days.\n\nThe Graphics for the main game are basic but it's fitting for the Genre. Also they have dropped the random battles with on screen monsters to avoid if you want to not fight (And you still have the option to start a battle through the main menu). The fighting system is identical to CSC too which I've enjoyed but I can understand those who may not like it. The Animation for the transformations are incredible...except I'm always stuck watching them every single time which can get very tedious.\n\nThe story is clever, and they provide \"Translations\" for the Ole English of Shakespeare...but a lot of the translations are jokes and very silly ones at that.\n\nThere isn't a LOT of replay value but you will enjoy the story enough you'll want to play it again eventually.\n\nThere is no New Game Plus mode...yet but given how they patched it into CSC later on I'm certain they're do that here eventually.\n\nI say the game is incredible for the price range and is entertaining for all ages.\n\n\nVIDEO REVIEW: https://youtu.be/wuw9pJPowqM",
      "[h1]Dishonored 2.[/h1]\n[i]If old Samuel could see me now...[/i]\n\n[b][u]Introduction[/u][/b]\nAt its core, Dishonored 2 is little more than a mechanically and narratively contiguous continuation of the Dishonored formula. This isn't a bad thing - the first Dishonored was one of the best stealth-action games of all time - but innovation is too often overlooked in the games industry. DH2 does bring some nuance to the franchise, but new drawbacks are packaged in as well. Put plainly, Dishonored 2 is a game I adore just as much as the original, but there are aspects that certainly left me wishing for better.\n\n[b][u]Plot[/u][/b]\nThe game begins 15 years following Empress Jessamine's assassination, and her daughter, Empress Emily Kaldwin, has ruled the isles since that time. Her father and Lord Protector, Corvo Attano, advises and keeps close watch over her at court. Quickly after Dishonored 2's opening however, the Duke of Serkonos, Luca Abele, comes to Emily's royal tower - bearing a gift. He brings Emily's supposed long lost aunt, Delilah Kaldwin, who then immediately stages a coup in a bid to take the throne. She is successful, and you must escape the city of Dunwall as either Emily or Corvo (more on that later). You then travel to Karnaca, the capital of Serkonos, where you begin a personal crusade to [i]take back what's yours.[/i]\n\n[b][u]Technical Revamp[/u][/b]\nShifting focus for a look at DH2's presentation, the game is gorgeous. There's a hint of the old, comic-book-like aesthetic that was present in the original game, but the graphical fidelity has been greatly improved in this sequel. The textures, lighting, animations, visual effects, and environments are all elegantly rendered. It's easily one of the most beautiful games of 2016. As for the audio; sound effects and voices are realistic, and the OST is as iconic, if not more so than the first game's. Although, when it comes to performance, Dishonored 2 clearly falters. DH2 was a technical mess on launch, and while it runs decently now; some bugs, stutters, and crashes still persist. Overall the presentation is good, but the performance is surely sub-par.\n\n[b][u]Setting & Exploration[/u][/b]\nAs stated earlier, Dishonored 2 is set in Serkonos's city of Karnaca; known as The Jewel of the South. Gone are the dark grays and subdued browns of Dunwall, as Karnaca replaces them with bright, pastel blues and yellows. The metropolis has distinct cultural differences from Dunwall as well, whether it's the widespread use of wind-power over whale oil, or Karnaca's reliance on silver mining to employ its working class. In terms of level design, DH2's stages are much more expansive than anything seen in the first game too. There's lots to explore in every district of Karnaca, especially when verticality and hidden locations are taken into account. There's several routes toward all objectives as well; emphasizing Arkane's \"play your way\" motto. All considered, Dishonored 2's game world is exceedingly well-built.\n\n[b][u]Depth in the Details[/u][/b]\nOne of the most effective ways DH2 differentiates itself from its predecessors is through what I'd call 'structural gimmicks.' To break up the standard pacing, a couple of the game's missions have special set-pieces which can completely turn gameplay convention on its head. An example of this is the 'Clockwork Mansion' on the fourth level. This inventor's home has levers in essentially every chamber that reconfigures a room's layout - such as turning a trophy room into a grand hall. These levers can be used to access new areas or evade enemies, and even reveal traversable spaces behind the walls. It's this degree of imaginative design depth that distinguishes Dishonored 2 from most other games in its genre.\n\n[b][u]Stealth & Combat[/u][/b]\nMoving over to the core gameplay loop, not much has changed from the first game. The stealth and combat are still just as exquisitely implemented as before, with only a couple of refinements. The deviations that come to mind are that drop-assassinations can now be used non-lethally as drop-knockouts, and assassination animations are a much more brutal (but cathartic) spectacle to watch than before. Dishonored 2's central mechanics are near flawless to be sure, but this sequel suffers by adding few new gameplay elements to the mix. Except - well - there is one big feature I've neglected to elaborate on as of yet.\n\n[b][u]Emily [i]or[/i] Corvo[/u][/b]\nIn Dishonored 2, you can play as either Emily Kaldwin, [i]or[/i] Corvo Attano. When Delilah first takes the throne you get a moment to choose one or the other, after which the character you don't pick is turned into a cold, stone statue. Both Emily and Corvo have separate voice actors and personalities, but they share the same goal throughout the game's duration: to save the last of their family, and reclaim the throne for the true Kaldwin heiress. After receiving the mark of The Outsider, Emily and Corvo have different magical abilities too. Where Corvo has blink, Emily has far reach; or where Corvo can stop time, Emily can chain together the lives of her enemies, and kill or incapacitate several people at once. All in all, the decision to allow the player to progress the campaign as either Emily or Corvo was a stroke of brilliance in my estimation.\n\n[b][u]Main Story[/u][/b]\nReturning to the main story - it's another point of criticism for me. There are some magnificent aspects; such as the nostalgic callbacks to events in the first Dishonored or reappearances of some of the original game's best characters, but all considered most of the writing is retreading a beaten path. Just as in Dishonored 1, the game flows from mission to mission where the chief objective is simply to eliminate a key player obstructing your path to the throne. This is perfectly fine from a gameplay perspective, but it can lead to a bit of déjà vu from a narrative outlook. Dishonored 2's writing quality isn't poor, but it doesn't distance itself from the comfortable story-staging of its predecessor, making it feel slightly lazy.\n\n[b][u]A Reactive World[/u][/b]\nOn the other side of the same coin, the narrative reactivity of Dishonored 2's world to your choices is truly admirable. Playing DH2 in high chaos; where you murder many people throughout the game, results in huge environmental storytelling changes compared to low chaos. Here's an example. If you flood the streets of Karnaca red with blood, subsequent levels show you've harmed the city's inhabitants before you even arrive. Citizens’ moods and perceptions will have soured as they become depressed or monstrous in the wake of their crumbling city - causing suicides and murders to spike throughout Karnaca. And corpses bring bloodflies, which further tarnishes The Jewel of the South in a vicious cycle. You can, of course, avoid all this... by showing a whole lot of care in your actions toward others.\n\n[b][u]Conclusion[/u][/b]\nWhen all is said and done, the Dishonored formula is a fantastic one that it's hard to not have fun with. Karnaca is riddled with environmental detail, the stealth mechanics are flawless, combat is devilishly enjoyable, and the game judges you intelligently on your choices. The Dishonored IP is incredibly strong... The tweaks provided are appreciable; I just wish DH2 had made a concerted effort to make it even stronger. But, god-dammit, I enjoyed Dishonored 2 way too much over it's 20+ hour campaign to critique it any longer. Get the game and play it - despite all my pissy complaints, you won't be disappointed.\n\n[h1]Personal Rating: 9/10 - Absolutely Outstanding[/h1]",

      "Game concept is good, but execution is bad. Add to that the attitude of the dev team, and I recommend you don't encourage this kind of community censorship.\n\nDon't buy this. Devs close topics because their fanboys get flamey when you bring up any kind of criticism. Like how the servers with anti-cheat and server saving (which doesn't save player status/location) functions enabled kick all players from the server every 30-60 minutes. I wouldn't mind reconnecting if my location and hunger/thirst got saved during this \"server save\". But apparently trying to open a discussion on the topic is considered flaming and they close down your topic. Horribly handled.\n",
      "As much as I adore this game's visuals, soundtrack, story, and... THE MEMES... I unfortunately can't recommend actually playing it.\n\nI can parry bosses in Dark Souls or Elden Ring with less frustration than in this game. The parry system requires you to execute a light attack towards an enemy right before they go in for a hit against you, which is usually telegraphed with a red glare in their eye. Unfortunately, even while using the lock-on camera (and by the way, you are never directly informed of its existence), half of the time my opponent was partially, or even completely off-screen. This is a problem, not only because it makes seeing an incoming attack difficult, but also because movement is tied directly to the parry system. You must execute an attack TOWARDS the enemy. With the camera having a seizure every five seconds, this makes it even more irritatingly difficult to aim your parries. I died to Blade Wolf repeatedly, not because of my own skill, but because midway through an incoming attack, the camera would decide to turn 90 degrees to the left, causing my movement to also shift to the left, nullifying my parry. \nIt's consistently inconsistent.\n\nIf there is some system in place that actually does help explain a lot of these game mechanics, fantastic. However, I find it inexcusable that whatever I might be missing would be so out of the way that I'd never encounter it unless I went out of my way to do so.",

      "For the past 4 years I couldn't get myself to finish a single game without having to force myself to do it(and even then I failed). I couldn't enjoy SP games no matter how good the gameplay or the story was. I kept buying games hoping to find that one game that would do the trick. This was FF XV for me. Despite of all my friends advising me against buying it because it was just going to be another game that would sit around in my library, I decided to give it a try.\n\nIt actually felt like I went back in time to when I could play SP games for hours without getting bored after an hour or two.\n\nI admit I skipped most sidequests and I'll try going back to them sooner or later, although it may not be the best game out there in terms of content(you can finish the game on easy skipping most secondary quests in about 20-25 hours) or story development, playing through it felt like a new experience. In fact, even after finishing the game there's still plenty of things to do and in my opinion, even playing it through again just to spend more time with Noctis and his friends is worth it.\n\nThe story is not mindblowing, the combat system is really fun but far from flawless, most sidequests aren't well written but at its core, at least for me, FF XV has something to it that other games lack. I can't say it magically restored my old passion for gaming but it has given me a reason to at least try to get into it again.\n\nIf you haven't played it yet I sincerely envy you, I would love to experience it all over again from the start, it has been a memorable journey to say the least and I hope that you are willing to give it a try. ^^",
      "holy fucking shit everything about this fucking mongoloid game is so fucking bad i can't even begin to understand. this was supposed to be better than the first piece of shit, but i dunno, maybe a tiny bit.\n\ndon't be like me and get baited into wasting your hard earned money for this fucking shit even if it's on like -90% sale.\n\nspecial mention to worst fucking controls in the history of fucking gaming. fuck these fucking mongoloid fucking retard faggots for making a game this fucking bad. uninstalled.",
      "It's a pretty game, but there's no option for manual saves, and autosaves only happen once in a great while instead of immediately after solving each puzzle or progressing through conversations. I also felt like the walking was extremely clunky with the mouse and keyboard, and I'd prefer click-to-walk.",
      "UPDATE: This remains to be one of the best games I have ever played. The company that created the game though... One more launcher that is completely unnecessary. The performance with the 'next-gen' update is horrible. I have half the fps I used to have on the very same rig and that is after going lower with the settings that I used to have. Why did you have to do this b U Ll $I t?\n\n\nThe best way to embrace the true greatness of this game is to look on how the series has improved since the first and the second part of The Witcher. You simply won't find anything that hasn't changed for the better.\n\n- Vast open world that IS NOT randomly created and filled with dull stuff,\n- Story which engages you from the first 10 minutes to the very end,\n- Graphics, even despite the whole controversy of a thing called downgrade, still makes this game THE BEST LOOKING RPG ever created,\n- Soundtrack, it finally goes back to the style presented originally in The Witcher 1, something that makes you forget that's just the video game, it gives you the feeling you are in there, in some village, city or that you are fighting with someone / something, which turns every single battle into an unforgettable memory,\n- Every single side quest, and believe me, there is A LOT of them, is actually a little story that keeps you playing with the same force as the main quests - I call it - a new quality in RPGs,\n- Choices and their impact on the story - even a small choice that seems insignificant at the time can wage on the whole world around you,\n- THIS GAME IS MATURE, finally a game dealing with a lot of subjects which are usually handled very childishly or not at all,\n- Combat - nothing more to add, it's decent, though it's nothing to be praised really, you won't be able to mash buttons and win - you have to dodge, use signs, and on higher difficulties get yourself ready to have an oil for a specific enemy and a bomb to be able to put an end to his or her misery.\n\nThe Witcher 3 is not a game without its flaws, although nothing that can't be fixed - some balance issues, economy basically showing Geralt as a very wealthy person (who he should not be), small performance problems like stuttering in Novigrad and in my opinion very limited after the end content (fixed by the expansions). Many of the things I struggled with have been already fixed and there is no need to disclose them. \n\nAll in all, one of the best games in the last few years (even a decade).",
      "This is a poor excuse for a Korean mobile port in a long line of them with the lack of sound, spelling errors, bad translations, ugly UI, log-in issues and so much more and it has P2E crypto/NFT garbage and P2W.\n\nNot even the small number of upskirts and jiggly boobs can save this one.",
      "People in the reviews don't understand this game.\n\n1. This is not Final Fantasy Tactics and it has a good reason for it.\n2. They barely removed any skills compared to the previous version and you will find most of those \"lost\" skills integrated into new skills or mechanics while certain broken mechanics were removed for a good reason. They also made things more challenging which i see as a welcome change. Things are also generally more viable and that is never a bad thing.\n3. You don't need to grind in this game, so why do i see people bring up grinding? Sure there's 40 weapon levels but in the endgame you get max level after like a couple battles if you really feel like you need to grind it out. In the previous version you had to level up a ton of different skills and some of them went up very slowly so there's actually a lot less grinding in this one.\n4. The reason you're struggling with doing damage is not because the game is bad, it's because you're not looking at what your equipment does or you don't understand it. The attack value in weapons is a base value which is used to penetrate your targets armor. It makes sense to do 1 damage against a person wearing heavy armor if you're firing an arrow at them. All the various boosts that you get in this game are applied to the damage you do AFTER you penetrate your targets armor. In order to do real damage to heavily armored targets you need to either use the right kind of weapon to attack them or make use of the new elemental system since now every character has an element that can be used to deal more damage OR you can simply apply a debuff to them since debuffs affect their defensive value directly. So yes this is not a game where you always win by rushing at your enemy and pressing attack. You have to understand how the game works and going through that process has been incredibly fun for me.\n5. You don't need to worry about those permanent stat gain cards or leveling your unit in a certain class to get the best possible stats. What you get from doing that isn't really going to make a difference if you're not playing well enough BUT if you really want to have a super powerful godlike unit, this game still allows it through those mechanics.\n6. The buff cards on the field are also not something you're required to make use of to beat the game, they're just there to make the battlefields more interesting and a way to make boss-characters stronger without directly cheating their stats.\n7. They removed random battles but you don't need random battles for anything because you can recruit units in the various long dungeons or simply go back in time to recruit a specific unit from any level in the postgame.\n\nIn summary it's a game that requires you to think a little bit but as you understand more you can also make things that seemed underwhelming at first viable because you found a way to make use of them. The story is also integrated into the gameplay so it's easy to keep interested in it especially since you get to make choices that affect both the story and gameplay. As a remake it definitely feels like they remade the game completely as it's so different from all the original versions. It's not for everyone and it doesn't have to be but hopefully the enjoyers of games like FFT or fire emblem will not dismiss this because of the reviews since this might become one of your favorite rpgs if you just bother to look into it without wanting it to be a cheap remake. It's too easy to jump into conclusions when we live in a world filled with terrible \"remakes\" popping up each year. This is all so ironic too as the spirit of this game when it comes to the story and gameplay alike is that you will never truly win by jumping into conclusions and there will always be something you didn't consider.\n\nUpdate: Replying to comments and addressing things for people who are familiar with the originals: \n\nI don't think they took away anything so vital that it would ruin the game. I can't really think of anything important other than the rogue class myself. You can call it removal but I'd rather say that they moved a lot of stuff to a different place from the list of skills and changed a lot of them to better fit the new card system and the new skill/spell limits. \n\nYes in my original review I didn't mention anything about the skill limit being reduced from 8 to 4. I think this change mostly just made the game easier to understand and when it comes to strategy I don't think anything was lost. You were going to use those extra 4 skill slots for things like strengthen or spellcraft either way and with the new scouting system moving around 8 skills before each encounter would probably be a little tedious (as it already feels tedious to setup units with the current system). \n\nAnd when it comes to spells, I simply can't understand why I would want to have access to more or all equipable spells as it would result in casters being a lot stronger than what they are supposed to be. This also makes each caster class more defined instead of them just being some kind of upgrades of each other so that a lategame class like the shaman can be a lot less useful in certain situations than your starting mage class because they don't have access to debuff spells but in return they hit super hard with their damaging spells.\n\nWhat else did they remove? They reworked the weird elemental system  into something that's always in play and I find this change very welcome as it adds another layer of strategy to the game especially through finishers and equipment bonuses even for non-spellcasters (but is still a little weird to get the hang of at first). They removed spell scrolls... yeah i probably dont have to mention why I see that as a good thing as well.\n\nAnd sure you can dislike these changes but we have to remember that steam reviews are black and white. Posting a negative review based on a subjective change is indistinguishable from saying \"this game is trash don't even look at it\" when it comes to statistics which is what everyone first sees when they open the store page of a game. \n\nI'm completely on the same page with you about playing your own favorite version, whatever you prefer and I myself would like to mess around more with things like One Vision in the future. But imo giving this game a negative review is also bad for the reputation of other versions of tactics ogre.\n\nAnd ofc the game is definitely not perfect there's still imbalances and some skills are pretty underwhelming compared to what they used to be (RIP Rampart shadows...). But imo this is better than what I've seen from literally any other game remake ever so I simply can't agree with calling it a bad remake.",
      "This does what I wish AAA RPGs with narratives would do; choices actually feel like they make an impact and the gameplay changes that reflect this are dynamic in nature and provide meaningful differences in the conversations.\n\nIt doesn't feel this way on a macro scale, the meaning is more in the individual encounters with some exceptions. To word it a little differently, I felt like my choices had very little impact on the story as a whole and I could easily (a little too easily) steer the final outcome at any time but, within individual interrogations, what I chose to do had a major affect on the immediate narrative.\n\nThat being said, it is a wonderful game to play for four to six hours on a Sunday and at $15 USD it is cheap and entertaining enough to only need a single playthrough to feel like you've gotten your money's worth. Although I haven't started my second playthrough, I'm already thinking about when I want to sit down and have another go.",

      "Been playing now for 56 hours and love it apart from one thing.... too many press conferences! Seems like every other minute I'm told I'm due to go into a press meeting... so, apart from that, I'm enjoying the game. Have to confess as a 60 year old woman, I do cheat... have much fun creating a team, buying loads of top players and winning every match... so satisfying! Anyway, can't cope with the action games and find the pace of this right up my street. Have been playing since the original Championship Manager games back in the 90s so would call myself a fairly seasoned player!",

I was tempted to play, and will do so for a few hours in future, may be a demon has possessed me...or may be I just don't waste my money that I have spent on it.

      "Let's get this out of the way: If you're into Chris Avellone/Obsidian/Black Isle kind of games and know what that even means, you know what you're getting. Another clunky game with writing so good you'll forgive any of its flaws. It's another one of those games: a Baldur's Gate, NWN2, Kotor 2, Fallout: New Vegas, Alpha Protocol kinda game.\n\nIf that paragraph didn't make any sense, the rest of this review is for you. Planescape: Torment tends to be less hack-and-slash than it looks, playing according to a system roughly based on second edition Dungeons & Dragons. But in a big departure from both, you can solve a huge amount of your problems with minimal combat and the real meat of the game comes in your decision making, mystery solving, and dealing with people around you. True to the Planescape setting, Torment is a game about the power of belief and the battlefield of ideas.\n\nI don't want to oversell that because you *will* be attacked by random thugs, some combats are downright mandatory, and there is a very real difficulty spike about three quarters through the game. But the allies you keep and the knowledge you gain can help you bypass some encounters or at least trivalize them under mountains of xp gained from unraveling cosmic questions. \n\nIt's a grim, often macabre journey back and forth across the boundaries of life and death where even the happiest endings are pretty heavy, but it's also a brilliantly written, thought-provoking experience that's well worth the time and money. Just make sure to go deep on wisdom, okay, berk? Don't need some dusty penning you in the deadbook because you couldn't see the dark of things, cutter.",
      "After sailing around for an hour or so, killing some huge crabs and collecting some reports from new islands I had discovered, I was running low on fuel and supplies. The game reminded me of this with a prompt titled \"Desperate Measures,\" so I was left with little choices on the matter.\n\n I tried to use my last two boxes of supplies in a vain attempt to desperately scrape together some fuel so I could reach the port of Fallen London -- I failed. Now I was faced with the problem of starvation, on top of the whole fuel fiasco. \n\n  Fear was setting in, as was hunger, fuel was low, as was hope, so I decided to beseech the gods of the Unter-Zee for help, and help they did. I was, for lack of a better word, teleported to some kind of temple dedicated to the gods, and that was where things went from bad to worse. \n  \n   This temple couldn't be further away from Fallen London, and therefore aid, than I could have gotten on my own. So I decided to beseech the gods again, this time my pleading went unanswered, a cruel cold-shoulder delivered to an ingrateful neophyte. The only purpose my inane begging to a higher power served was to unsettle my crew and drive us all to the brink of sanity.\n\nSo I abandoned ship and we all died, lol. 11/10.",

[/h1] \n\n\n[h1]===[ General Consensus ]===[/h1]\n\n[b]This was the baseline for two entire generations of Single-Player FPS[/b]\n\n[u]The Half-Life series is considered to be one of the \"Grandfathers\" of modern FPS. Along with some other titles of its generation, it revolutionized the shooter genre, giving games a new depth and even bigger focus on storytelling and big setpieces, remeniscent of action genre movies. And naturally, Half-Life 2 is remembered one of the finest games to be realized and developed, even after a tumultuous and bumpy development.[/u]\n\n\nI only came to the awareness of this game's status in the gaming world a few years ago. I never really heard too much about it or even payed to much attention to it; back in my childhood I remember seeing it around the internet but it never really talked to me.\nSo a few years back I bought the whole HL franchise here on Steam, already acquainted with the game's praise. \n\nAfter a couple of failed attempts to play HL2, but getting stuck on the same part, I finally got to finish the game. \nAnd I must say I'm totally on board with all the praise and status!\n\n\n[h1]PLOT:[/h1]\n\nThe story continues after the events of Half-Life 1, where Gordon Freeman, a scientist working on the Black Mesa Research Facility, fights his way through hords of aliens brought to Earth by a portal that Gordon himself opened.\n\nWe wake-up to a dystopian future where the Black Mesa and the alien infestation led to a very different world of ours, where humans live in a opressing society on the likes of the book \"1984\", where everyone is meticulously controlled by the \"system\".\nThis hugely different and creative setting really talked to me and even made me more interested in the narrative.\n\nFrom then on, Freeman tries to lead a group of \"resistence\" fighters to oppose and tear down the ruller of Earth, the former administrator of the Black Mesa Facility, Wallace Breen, (whom also \"negotiated\" a peace agreement with the aliens, right after the events of HL1).\n\nI must say this story is a very creative and different experience of those found in other FPS games.\nI always found myself on the edge of my seat, eager to know what was gonna happen next, and while also amazed by all the environmental storytelling.\nIt's truly one of the game's strongest points and even though your character doesn't speak, you will find yourself completely imersed on the narrative. Even all these years after, this political and social matter that Valve went for and explored is one of the game's strongest points really!\n\nAnd not to forget about all of those fantabulous and explosive setpieces seen throughtout the game that are really solid and entretaining, having inspired other games like Uncharted and the Call of Duty campaigns, just to say a few. You are really put in some tricky and tough situations.\n\n\n[h1]GAMEPLAY:[/h1]\n\nThis is your average FPS gameplay. Nothing you haven't seen before, but HL2 is certainly a gold standard of how to excell and give variety in your gameplay.\n\nYou've got your normal 2000's arsenal, like Pistols, the series' signature weapon the Crowbar, a Revolver that packs a serious punch, an SMG, Assault Rifle, Shotgun (THAT FEELS SO GOOD TO SHOOT), Grenades, Crossbow, Rocket Laucher and a new \"toy gun\" the Gravity Gun.\n\nAt the time, Valve was developing a new physics engine never seen before that went on to shake and revolutionize games at the time, but in order to really make usage of this new technology, [u]the developers of Half-Life 2 introduced the Gravity Gun to the weapons roster [/u]. \nWith it you can \"grab\" multiple objects, such as crates, file cabinets, gasoline tanks or even buzzsaw blades to throw at oponents. It's a very creative way to make usage of the different environment assets while showing off new technology.\nIt's also another tool to help you get out of sticky situations like puzzles, something that Half Life 2 really experiments with. \nWith this engine, Valve pushed the physics to bring different puzzles that just feel natural to solve.\n\nGameplay feels really natural and it's what we have grown accostumed to in the FPS genre, but very competent and polished.\n[spoiler](the shotgun just feels awesome and sooooo satisfying to shoot)[/spoiler]\n\n\n[h1]SOUND AND MUSIC:[/h1]\n\nSound feels like a very big step-up comparing to Half-Life 1 and every weapon sound much better when firing.\n\nEnvironmental sound is really good and pushes you even more to the game's immersion. Every area of the game is masterfully design, to the sewer sections that feel so claustrophobic and tense to walk through, to the more city like big places where you can sense the real sense of scale of the space through the sound design. \n\nI must say it's really top notch.\n\nBut there were times where I felt that the sound mixing was a little off, having sounds playing with a really pumped up volume that really distracted me and put me off.\n\nIn the other hand, the Music is just amazing. It's 00's techno and rock like music that just injects you with such adrenaline and makes you feel really awesome with gunning down opponest. VERY SATIFYING INDEED.\n\n\n[h1]GRAPHICS:[/h1]\n\nIn all honesty this is a hard category to judge, because obviously the graphics are going to look a bit dated to what we have today (in 2020), but honestly everything look really good.\n\nFrom characters and enemies, to the environments, to the fire and explosion effects, it all looks very good and has a great level of quality to them. Specially the alien creatures. I felt utterly disturbed by those \"facehuggers\" like creatures. Everytime they jumped at my face I would equally jump, but of my seat with disgust... \n\n\n[h1]CONCLUSION:[/h1]\n\n[b]To summ it up, I think that Half-Life 2 is a must play game. \n\nReally, if you are like me and you have heard about it, but was like \"meh maybe this game is old and dated and its now crap\", just cut the argument and go play a really good and polished experience.\n\nFor those out there, if you want a polished and strong game that still challenges most contemporary games, with an interesting narrative, and some awesome moments just grab yourself a copy of this. It's dirt cheap, no excuses...[/b]",

      "ORIGINAL REVIEW Posted: Nov 27, 2016:\nExtremely fun and addictive game! That IS if you practice and learn the way the game is supposed to be played.\n\nActually requires a lot of patience, aim control, learning of map locations, etc.\n\nEdit Dec 7, 2018: Stupid crazy full with hackers, now that it's F2P i feel like it's gonna get taken over by even more hackers... RIP 2012 CSGO.\n\nEDIT 2021/09/03: Some of you are morons here... Clearly a huge \"fan\" base of CSGO. I've gathered around 9,000+ hours in total (in my other account as well) No. I wasn't a \"Noob\" or had no skill. I was GE for a very long time.\n\nThis review is from 2018. After all the new updates came into place. I LOVED the game, It was my addiction. After those updates, everything went down hill. MORE toxicity, MORE blatant hackers, and I for one wasn't a big fan of the newest updates. So I decided to leave, updated this review with my most recent experience.\nReviews are meant to talk about your experience, Not to kiss ass and make things look good when they aren't.",

      "This is my first Formula One game, I never expected before to like this type of games but I do and I'm glad that the 2017 version was my first one because it's very polished and enjoyable.\n\nThe game is basically a simulator of real F1 racing with everything that belongs to it. The gameplay is very similar to what we are used to in Codemasters games - a carrer mode where you choose a team and try to meet their expectations. It's not easy, it needs a lot of skills and I don't recommend playing with a keyboard (I personally use an Xbox controller).\n\nWhen it comes to racing games I'm always mostly interested in multiplayer and I'm pleased that the multiplayer mode works well, it's cross-platform, supports up to 20 players and it's really fun.\n\nThe game was ported by Feral Interactive using Vulkan, the general optimization is great and the performance is very stable. I had an issue with constant crashing after ~5-10 minutes so I sent an e-mail to Feral and their Linux support team was very happy to help. The issue of mine was fixed in less than 3 days and they uploaded the fix on Steam using a beta release channel to let me test it so I'm more than happy with the level of tech support.\n\nNothing more to say, if you are looking for a competitive racing game with decent multiplayer then you shouldn't miss this game.\n\n[h1]System info & performance report[/h1]\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Platform[/td]\n        [td]Linux | Arch[/td]\n    [/tr]\n   [tr]\n        [td]Desktop environment[/td]\n        [td]Gnome Shell 3.26[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]API[/td]\n        [td]Vulkan[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]CPU/GPU/RAM[/td]\n        [td]i5 7300HQ / GTX 1050 Ti [396.24] / 12 GB[/td]\n    [/tr]\n [tr]\n        [td]Settings[/td]\n        [td]1080p, high[/td]\n    [/tr]\n [tr]\n        [td]FPS[/td]\n        [td]50-60 average[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\nhttps://youtu.be/UOssSi3a3PU\n[i][b]Note:[/b] ~10 fps loss due to recording[/i]\n\n[h1]Technical side[/h1]\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Available APIs[/td]\n        [td]Vulkan-exclusive[/td]\n    [/tr]\n\t[tr]\n        [td]Multiplayer[/td]\n        [td]cross-platform Linux <-> Mac OSX <-> Windows[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Config location[/td]\n        [td] ✓ Good | ~/.local/share/feral-interactive/F1 2017[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Linux version rating[/td]\n        [td]Perfect | 5/5[/td]\n    [/tr]\n   [tr]\n        [td]Controller support[/td]\n        [td]Excellent (tested with an Xbox 360 wireless controller, \"xpad\" Linux built-in (default) kernel module)[/td]\n    [/tr]\n   [tr]\n        [td]Any issues (fullscreen, performance, crashes...) ?[/td]\n        [td]Not anymore (fixed by Feral)[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Ported by[/td]\n        [td]Feral Interactive[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]",
      "I don't like rogue-likes ( or rogue-lites). Don't get me wrong, I've tried! I'll buy some well-reviewed game like Enter the Gungeon, boot it up, play for an hour or two, then let it sit in my library until time immemorial. It's a cycle I was loath to repeat which is why despite enjoying the rest of Supergiant's games I stayed away from Hades for about a year.\n\nThis is not like other rogue-likes.\n\nThere are going to be a lot of reviews about Supergiant's signature visuals, rocking soundtrack, and tight combat( or about how Cerberus is a good boy). These are all true, and if you already like the rogue-like genre should sell you on this game, but if you're like me that's not enough. The reason I've played more of this game than any other rogue-like is because of Supergiant's ability to combine story and gameplay. In a lesser game, picking up a powerup consists of a menu screen or a short visual cue, but in Hades picking a boon means learning more about the crazy gods on mount olympus. Is Poseidon jealous of Zeus? Does Athena resent Ares? Is Dionysis drunk?  You'll get to experience all of these little dramas and more as you progress through a run, but where Hades really sets itself apart from the rest of genre is what happens after a run. \n\nDying in Hades isn't like losing, it's like coming home. \n\nYou'll get to check in on all of the characters in the masters house, from hypnos the sleepy doorman, your mentor Achilles, to mother night herself. Not to mention the adorable house-keeper. Sometimes it's not about Zagreus, but the relationships all of these colorful characters have which each other which will develop over each failure as you return to the house of Hades. Afterwards I can unlock new weapons (or weapon aspects), new powerups, or see the new items I've collected and prepare for my next run. It's a thoroughly satisfying loop, so even if you don't think this is your type of game, you should give it a shot.",
      "Disclaimer: This is review from player who prefer story-rich game and haven't played any game by Arkhouse Telegraph.\n\nThe good:\n+ Outstanding 80's-esque visual pixel artstyle. It reminds me of few SNES/Atari/Gameboy games.\n+ Fairly good soundtrack.\n+ Some cutscene/area have fascinating atmosphere.\n+ Run well with Steam proton, so it's likely this game is playable for Linux/Steam Deck user. Although the platformer area might show too many small detail for 7\" display.\n+ Game OST/artbook is available for free on Arkhouse website.\n\nThe bad:\n- While i understand nature of this game require player to find out most thing and go through trial-and-error, some parts definitely need to be explained better. I refer to lack of autosave (for most part of the game), not letting player know about manual save (you can do it by head left after exit for cylinder elevator until you see display/sign \"< S\" and suggestion to visit block H (where you get some guidance).\n- While the manual say i can play R. U. N. E. 3000 first, i have hard time understanding the story and lore/world building. Conversation such as \"DO? DORODO!\" is mostly gibberish and i only can make vague guess based on few specific term (\"V2\", \"50/50\", etc.) and area i've visited. Short recap of previous games (even it's on the manual) could be really helpful for newcomers.\n\nThe ugly:\n* I experience a bug where i fight boss i'm not supposed to fight yet. In detail, [spoiler] after i exit from P block to get symbol cracking code, i was thrown to G block where i fight G-Cat/10th boss. The worst part is the boss HP bar started with red color and auto 3-60 cannon never perform attack. Fortunately the bug doesn't occur again after i load from manual save.  [/spoiler].\n* The gameplay variation/idea is very interesting, but the execution is mixed bags (more explanation on below paragraph)\n\nSaturn Quest: R. U. N. E. 3000 has lots of gameplay variant/modes (Adventure, Shoot'em up, Platformer and many more) to keep the game fresh. While each area/boss have different reason why it's challenging/difficult, many of those is very unbalanced. For example, [spoiler] Bioplatus M-3D/6th boss [/spoiler] require you to have extraordinary eye-hand coordination and multitasking skill. Among all enemy that resemble boss fight, i only managed to beat 6-7 boss without using cheat.\n\nThis game also has very few checkpoint on each area/boss. On adventure/platformer area, you could restart from beginning after spending 10-20 minutes where you have to avoid same trap or collect same item again. On boss fight, that means you'll need to repeat whole fight most of the time. It's could be annoying because since you're forced to find out boss behavior the hard way or repeating tedious part of the fight.\n\n3 HP and lack of difficulty option could be irritating for most modern player. There are time when i found out i only lose 3-10 HP when i use cheat and beat the boss. If there's easier difficulty where i have 6-10 HP, i could beat more boss by myself. But don't get me wrong, i feel really satisfied each time i beat boss (which i deemed can be beaten with practical amount of effort) without cheat. If the developer bother add easy difficulty which has higher player HP, give more Nana and slightly lower boss HP, far more people could enjoy this unique piece of artwork.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nWhile i have some rant, it's really unique experience even though i've played few hundred games. In overall, i have more positive sentiment than negative sentiment of this game. But even though i choose \"Yes\" when Steam ask \"Do you recommend this game?\", i'd rather choose \"Neutral\" or \"Information\" instead. If you're fan of 80's game or really like difficult game, you might come to like this game. But for most people, i'd recommend you to seek other game. Although if you really insist to play this game, you could use Cheat Engine and modify HP/Nana using value type Double (also called float64 or 8-byte float).\n\nP.S. I definitely will play the sequel (Episode IV-VI: White Meteor Saga according to the artbook) [b]IF[/b] the developer bother add easy difficulty option and more checkpoint during boss fight/exploration.",

      "[h1]One of the few multiplayer games that reminds me that people can be amazing[/h1]\n\nI've been playing games for a long time, I've seen some sh*t. I've seen people crumble, I've lost friends, I've watched people eat each other even when they are winning. When people are supposed to be working together and yet they would rather treat their ally like trash because they refuse to take the blame for their own wrongdoing.\n\nSquad is a game in which I have seen true potential. A group of 40 individuals work together to plan, execute, and accomplish masterful plans to outsmart their enemy. I've seen teams rally from the depths of defeat and flip unwinable games into incredible victories. Heros emerging from the storm of mortars landing upon their bunker, to squad leaders risking their own lives to save those of their squad.\n\nSquad is not a game for the light hearted. To enjoy squad to the fulllest, you must communicate, work together, and form a bond with the soldiers at your side. You are a team, you are a unit, and you will never win alone. Be it a medic patching the wounds of your comrades, a logistics driver supplying your team with the supplies they need at the front line, or a squad leader putting the responsibility of 8 individuals on your shoulders, each person is a vital component of the team.\n\nFor this reason, Squad has now become my most played game on steam. The depth, the people, the comraderie, it's an amazing experience that no other game captures. I encourage you all to try it out on a free weekend as I originally did, I have been playing it ever since.\n\nI'll see you on the front line.",
      "Minutes ago, this reviewer completed the game Gorogoa. And now, an attempt will be made to describe the experience. It won’t be easy…….\n\nIn 1968 this player went to the theatre to see a brand-new movie: 2001: A Space Odyssey. What crossed the screen wasn’t so much a story in the filmmaking sense., but rather an experience. Views of Earth from space (before such images existed IRL), and a final scene that perhaps no one understood, but clearly was meaningful beyond simply the ability, or need, for words to express. Gorogoa left this player with a very similar feeling of inexplicable fulfillment.\n\nGorogoa might be described as a puzzle game, but certainly not in any typical sense. More accurately, Gorogoa is a game about travel, but traversing distance in more ways than just spatially. It’s about travel within, and travel to places unknown (perhaps outside of dreams.) It’s about traveling through space, time, life (and lives), and travel through the experience that is mankind. And perhaps more, it’s about the journey necessary for each player to experience in order to be able to complete the experience that is Gorogoa.\n\nGorogoa provides very little information or assistance, beyond the option for hints about the areas of each image that need be considered for game progress. (It’s difficult to imagine a first-time player succeeding without such hints, so no stigma should be associated with them, especially if they prevent the need for outside resources as may well be the case.) Almost nothing more can be said without compromising some aspect of this game, so this review will be brief, and likely almost as mysterious as the game itself. Learning the goal is as much a puzzle as is the process of reaching that goal. Images are moved, shrunk, expanded, combined, variously manipulated…….ENOUGH! \n\nPlay, and learn about possibilities unimagined until now. In a single word…genius.\n\nThank you.\n\n(As with most Steam games, offline game time is not tracked.)",
      "\"You've played for 1000 hours. Would you recommend this game to other players?\"",
      "It's a pretty game, but there's no option for manual saves, and autosaves only happen once in a great while instead of immediately after solving each puzzle or progressing through conversations. I also felt like the walking was extremely clunky with the mouse and keyboard, and I'd prefer click-to-walk.",
      "[h1] 8.5/10 [/h1]\n\n[b] Please note that The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles is a very independent entry in the Ace Attorney series in terms of plot. Even if you have not played any of the Ace Attorney titles before, it will not affect your understanding of the game's plot. [/b]\n\nThis courtroom text adventure game in late 19th century Japan and British have a lot of features, even with the previous Ace Attorney works are very different. With the detailed character costumes and backgrounds, the strong sense of history and atmosphere, the majestic music, and excellent characterization, along with the game's detailed 3D character animation, players can experience an unprecedented adventure. In the plot, The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles presents a layer-by-layer, cocooning type of plot development, each chapter of the story is closely linked, and ambiguous, no chapter is meaningless, and in the final unraveling of all the mystery, the feeling of shock and excitement brought to the player is unprecedented in any text adventure game.\n\nThe reviews of The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles tend to be polarized, and not without reason. The progression of the plot brings with it an overwhelming lack of tension in the first and middle stages of the game. The design of many of the cases in the game seems rather undisciplined, neither interesting nor deep... The Great Ace Attorney: Adventure, as the first half of the game, though the development of the subsequent plot paved a lot of ambushes, the design of the plot and puzzles makes it less interesting and often difficult to motivate players to continue playing. The climax of the game comes too late, whether the player can persist to this point is a huge problem. At the same time, the Steam version of the game globally locks 30 frames, and can not set the Japanese voice is also a very huge drawback, and very damaging to the player's gaming experience.\n\nThe quality of The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles is actually not that bad. But this can only be concluded after you have experienced the entire game in its entirety... And I think this is actually the biggest drawback of this game because the ability to keep the player until the climax of the plot is the biggest pain point of this work. If you are very patient, love the Ace Attorney series, and love the suspenseful story of players, then The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles will not let you down. If you do not have any of the above elements, perhaps The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles will not give you a memorable experience.",
      "Excellent game, but has an awful-abrupt ending that comes out of nowhere and doesnt make sense and leaves way too many plot elements unexplained.\n\nIn the last game they introduce a secret society of energy sucking vampires that are hunting Rosa and Joey yet they are never mentioned again and instead the end of series villian is some random messed up ghost that randomly has end of the world magic powers.\n\nAwful.",

Bear with me. My career isn't accessible. Let me restart the client and get back to gushing over the game.

      "Impulse Control is a lazy, badly made ripoff of Angry Birds, with slightly less features and options, poorer physics, worse quality assets, and overall worse gameplay.  But to differentiate, they slapped a Facebook style personality quiz on the front, much like putting a hat on Frankensteins Monster works well as a disguise, you know.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, the game doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.\n\nThere's no options to change the resolution for the game or customise the graphics settings.  There's no way for gamers to ensure this is running at the native resolution of their displays... there's no guarantee this game will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.  There's no way for gamers to try improve the low quality graphics.\n\nThese technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.\n\nThe game is completely free.  This is noble a gesture that shows dedication to both gamers, and the gaming industry.  Nothing speaks more to a developers belief in themselves and their product than making their game available for everyone without remuneration.  It's a shame in this case that the implementation is below the minimum standards a dedicated PC game should offer to enthusiasts.  The quality here is simply too low for me to recommend, even for free.  I really feel like this should have been a mobile app, like the Angry Birds game this is a blatant ripoff of, but then it would have to compete with Angry Birds.  It certainly doesn't belong on PC.  Sometimes the only way to win is not to play.",
      "Normally, I am hard-set on if a game is good, or bad. This game? its in the middle. I mean, a lot of the game is actually really cool, it looks great, it doesn't explain why basically almost every single person is a walking hunk of muscle, but there are some serious flaws. Not just the weird ones like \"kitchen knives break after you stab someone 3 times\" or \"I just ran over an entire sidewalk of people, and the police are nowhere to be found\", but some seriously terrible glitches that make the game unplayable. Such as the whole space-car thing. \"lalala... driving along the road...\" all of the sudden KABAM your car goes flying, hits the ground, explodes, you die, and you get charged money. You use a car to try and get back to where you were going, and BANG same thing happens again. Also, the cops, even though they are extremely spread out and don't appear to have any form of 911 or anything, are nuts with guns. You, who are supposed to be some sort of superultracop, don't even carry a knife. A FREAKING KNIFE. So if you want a gun, you have to kill a police officer, BUT WAIT HE DIDN'T DRAW HIS GUN AND YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE A HOLSTER so you have to wait until another police officer shows up, hope that he tries to shoot you instead of tackling you, and then run up to him while he shoots at you, press f when you are right in front of him, and grab his gun. Meanwhile the entire police force is going to where you are. Thats just how to get a pistol. Whats that? You want a real gun? One that doesn't take 7 shots(literally) to kill a unarmored policeman? Well, you have to hole up in some building, which its hard to find one with an interior, and just keep shooting the police officers when they charge in. Eventually, after maybe 30 officers are dead, they send in their \"elite team\" of guys... with no helmets... no armor other than a vest... and either a shotgun or a submachine gun. The farthest I have gotten to is with these guys dressed in all grey with helmets and assault rifles, they are meant to be the wall, because it can take up to an entire clip of your submachine gun to take one down. Oh, and back to the cars, WHAT THE HECK IS WITH THE CAR ATTACKING. It made me almost fall out of my chair laughing when I realized that I could use my car to \"lunge\" left and right, and take out other cars. I guess the devs didn't know that cars can't drive straight sideways. Your character has no weapons as well, so it looks kinda stupid when you are blocking and punching a bunch of guys with tire irons, knives, and whatnot. Oh yeah, the weapons break after you swing a few times. The game also has weird weapons. You can pick up an umbrella, a purse, heck even a grocery bag, or a take-out box, to use as a weapon, but these things are one use, and deal less damage then a punch. Overall, this game is a little too unrealistic, to the point where it really removes you from the game. Not to mention the glitches, you would think that the \"new and improved\" sleeping dogs would be \"new and improved\" not the horrible, glitchy mess it is now. I really tried to play it, but I just got tired of being gunned down while I am trying to break into a car and start it up, which takes like a good 20 seconds, which is a lot of time when you have 10 cops unloading their bottomless clips at you. I got tired of randomly being flung into space. I got tired of a cop arresting me, and instead of allowing me to break free and whatnot, me and the cop take a \"small adventure\" gliding across the road through cars and buildings. I got tired of a game thats supposed to be fixed and nearly glitchless, when in reality most early access games play better. I am sorry.",

      "Bioshock Infinite is the third and (presumably) final game in the venerable Bioshock series of narrative driven FPS action games.  Gameplay, as always, consists of somewhat linear FPS combat with a \"genetic\" progression advancement system that lets you upgrade your abilities through \"splicing\" \"plasmids\".  This gives you somewhat supernatural abilities to augment the more traditional shooting of enemies with guns that we all enjoy from FPS games.  There's also the usual gamut of minigames, with a carnival theme to them. \n\nFrom the technical perspective, even though this is getting a little old, it's a AAA game and it shows.  Everything gamers expect is delivered here in terms of visual tweaks, control customisation, 4K support and a lot of graphics fine tuning options to allow gamers to experience a perfectly optimised experience.  There's not much else to say when developers get it right!  The visuals are equally top notch. \n\nWhile a great technical implementation is a must, and a minimum requirement for a recommendable game, of course Bioshock Infinite goes beyond that to deliver a masterpiece story that will leave gamers hooked, and perhaps a little bereft once it's over, but that's how all great stories should be.\n\nBioshock Infinite is a must-play for fans of narrative FPS games, although I do recommend trying Bioshock 1 & 2 first.  It's not required, but just like you wouldn't enjoy it as much if you watched Return of the Jedi first, you should try the first two episodes of Bioshock before the third one.",

This game made me feel like I'm in an another world back then. I had dreams of my companion and Drippy. It was such a nostalgic moment when I opened this game, and I was abit sad because I wished that I could turn back time and finish this game when I was a kid. I wasn't able to finish it at that time due to my brother taking away the PS3 overseas. Because now, after getting older, there are so many responsibilities that I must hold on to. Playing games like this during childhood truly changes the vibe of experiencing it. Now I only got a glimpse of it when I opened it for an hour or so.

      "This is easily one of the funniest games I played in 2017.  In the 20 hours it took me to solve it the first time, I pretty much did nothing else until I had finished it, despite the fact that I was supposed to be studying.\n\nThe game is set in absurd western themed world where humour is so baked into the fabric of everything that there is virtually nothing that isn't some kind of joke.  This could easily fall flat if it were poorly written, but I found the writing to be fantastic.  Obviouslly humour is subjective so if you aren't onboard with it's humour you proably won't get much out of it.  For everyone else you are due for a hell of a ride as the game is an absolute hoot.\n\nThe game takes place in a kind of openinsh world with your character setting out from a location on their horse. You can either select to \"Wander\" in which case you will make a broad loop out and around, potentially unovering new map locations or encountering a random encounter.  You can also direct travel to locations you have found and will also be told about map locations from NPC's or as the outcomes of various quests.    The world is feels quite expansive with a lot of interesting locations to explore.  There are a couple of central plot quests to pursue and a bunch of side quests as well.  In my 20 hour playthrough I managed to complete the main story but still had a few side things Id managed to miss all the clues for.\n\nCombat in the game takes place in a turn based format that should feel familiar to anyone has played a JRPG before.  You stand on one side, your foes tand on the other and you select your various attacks and abilities from a list specific to each characters class.  As you gain XP  you can choose what skills you buy so you can tailor your character to your play style, with higher skill levels costing increasing amounts of XP.  You can further personalise your character with a swathe of various equiment, almost all of which is humorous and absurd.  The combat is not particularly complex but its good enough and the humour is so good that it really does the heavy lifting for keeping you engaged.\n\nAs you can see from the screenshots the graphics portray everything in stick figures, but everything is surpisingly detailed and the great animation and the little touches really add to the charm of world.  A still screenshot doesn't really do justice to how much fun this game is to see in motion.\n\nThe music and sound are suprisingly good too, with twangy guitars and banjos mixed with good old time whistling and other wild west sounding stuffness.  Once again is better than you have any right to expect from such an overtly daft title and between the lively graphics and relelentless humour It's just another layer of polish to draw you into the games odd version of the wild west.\n\nLook I flat out loved this game. It was a delight. As I said, your milage may vary if the humour doesn't tickle your funny bone but I can tell you now, never have I laughed so hard at a game as I did digging through the spitoons in West of Loathing.\n\nGold.\n\n9 out of 10",

      "Oh, that The Resident Evil (The RE)… One of the best stories in the gaming industry! The Capcom is well done that decided to remake games. Many players criticize The RE3, but I understand them, the game is quite short, there are no horror elements in the game. But the game has become easier, for example, a knife does not wear out. The players did not forget to criticize the Nemesis too, saying that there is no element of surprise and persecution, and there’s no sense of the constant presence of someone, who can mutilate you. The Nemesis means in English as “a good script”. However, the game creators tried to convey the atmosphere of The RE and the horror that the doomed city is filled with. Well-chosen actors, excellent voice acting, correctly conveyed the atmosphere of the city. I would add more moving elements on the destroyed streets of the city, like people or zombies\nTotal score: 8.5/10",
      "Easy to pick up, fun to learn, and great fun to die. Infinitely replayable, and co-op makes it even better. Unless you hate the roguelite formula, this is worth a buy.",
      "My first console was an Atari 400 so, I may be a bit partial and nostalgic.\nHowever. its not like I haven't played these games in forty years.\nThis is a truly amazing release that I hope other developers follow.\nIt's a documentary, a museum, and a games collection. They meld into brilliance. This is well worth the price of admission. You get documentary segments interwoven with artifacts, internal documents AND THE GAMES.\nDid you just watch a segment, read the internal documents from development? Yeah? Why not give the game a quick go!?!\nTons of games spanning the beginning arcade to the Jaguar, with all the tasty history thrown in.",
      "Took me a while to play this because there were some critical bugs during release day, but the devs worked hard to fix everything up.\n\nNow, this is the premium version of Mad Father which is not just a straight re-release of the free version, but an upgraded one (in many ways, I'm told). Better graphics, better level design, better everything. It's a really tight experience without any filler and with an interesting story, so any fans of RPGMaker-type horror games will find this a highly enjoyable experience.\n\nYou can also increase the game's window size, so don't worry if you're running a high-resolution display. This is a feature that is not exactly common for these types of games, but this game has got you covered.\n\nI'm looking forward to future games from the dev!",

It seemed pretty interesting but when she started making her own cards. As an IRL witch I was WAY more interested. The game itself is great, I love making cards and learning their meanings and seeing how how the story changes changes based on your deck and the cards drawn. And the replaybility of it is amazing given its price. 10/10 from me. Need more games like this.\n- everyone posting 16 gb ram specs and saying it runs well, lul\n\ni have 8 gigs of ram with a gtx 660 (yep) and a fx-8350 and it runs around 45-60 FPS (i cap it at 60) at High settings. yeah. REALLY well optimized, considering this computer is nearing the end of its life and the visuals are gorgeous.\n\nEDIT: 1080p :)\n\noh, and it's fun too, right.\n\nEdit 2- Actual review\n\nGame is pretty easy. I forget if there was a hard mode, but if there was I picked normal mode, and the game feels like it should be on easy. I've yet to break a sweat on a boss (currently chapter 5), and the only thing stopping me from taking on enemies 10+ higher than me is that the game auto-nerfs your damage if the enemy is too far above you. I've actually found the game very relaxing as a result, because there isn't the frustration of having to redo bosses after getting wiped, so it's not entirely a bad thing. But if you were looking for a challenge in your battles, this isn't your game.\n\nAs for story, it's also fairly basic, and rides off of having a sizeable to-do list as sidequests. Recruiting new citizens, doing major sidequest chains, unlocking new stuff, it's got a good amount to do in-game to keep you occupied, unless you're a \"main quest line only\" player. It helps that the warp system is easy to use (and you will use it often) and the game is gorgeous, so you don't really feel too bored doing the same shet over and over again. \n\nThere are several elements to the gameplay. \n\nOne, the overworld traversing. Overall, I'm ambivalent to it. It can feel slightly sluggish at parts, but collecting the shiny areas is surprisingly addicting (maybe because I'm a sem-completionist), as are finding chests. The unfortunate part is that most of these chests contain utterly useless items, so don't really feel that rewarding. \n\nTwo, dungeon crawling. Have to admit this is one of the weaker parts for me. The dungeons are basic, and don't really have much in the way of puzzling elements. Could change later, highly doubt it will. I do like how the battles are seamless, though.\n\nThree, army battles. Also not much of a fan of this, but only because it seems like a side addition without much depth to it. Fortunately it's not a major part of the game, so meh.\n\nFour, kingdom management. Holy cow I love this part of it. People might complain it feels like a mobile game with the wait times and whatever, but since you can warp straight back to your castle whenever you want, it's not that big of an issue. I do wish your gains accumulated while you're offline (or tabbed out, at least...), but idk something about managing the kingdom and making it grow/level up is stupidly addicting.\n\nOverall, if you're looking for a challenging or engaging JRPG, this might not be the game for you. If you're looking for a game with gorgeous visuals, fantastic voice acting (using JP), laid-back atmosphere, and want to be the president of the United States serving some random kid as his vassal, highly recommended.\n\nHighly recommend to play on controller. I'm using the Switch Pro Con.\n- Hello Charlotte is not a game; it is a confessional.\nIf you're here you've probably already realized, but I wish to place massive emphasis that Hello Charlotte, and Hello Charlotte 3 especially, has very little gameplay, and what is present is very standard RPGMaker fare. If you are the kind to balk at visual novels, HC3 will not be your cup of tea. Watch a playthrough or something if you're interested, but don't expect any kind of engaging play.\nWith that said: Hello Charlotte 3 (and its DLC, Heaven's Gate) has been one of the most emotional, impactful pieces of art I've ever engaged with. It is horrifically honest, incorrigibly vulnerable, and, as previously stated-- more a confessional than a game. With everything I know how to say and with everything I have to say about it, I cannot find a way to truly articulate what Hello Charlotte made me feel (still makes me feel) and how it has affected me.\n\nHello Charlotte: Childhood's End is from the perspective not of the Charlotte of the previous two games, but a new, blank slate PC. While not necessary to play the previous two games, I strongly recommend it. It develops on the themes of the previous two games, and in doing so, completely recontextualizes them. C and Anri of HC2 return, as does Scarlett, though not in the forms we are accustomed to. We are finally given a full understanding on the nature of Charlotte and the False Realm, and what we are in relation to it.\netherane's art has markedly improved since the second game, with impressive sprite and background artwork, though their style is still recognizable. The music (some composed by etherane, others outsourced) is varied and distinctive. Most prominent about etherane's work, however, are the themes and writing, which have matured considerably since the release of HC2. Though often garish and on the nose, HC3 is a poignant commentary on the nature of art and fiction, the impact we have on one another, and our understanding of realness itself.\nYou will experience confusion. You will experience whiplash. The game intends to make you unsure and uncomfortable in its consumption, <i>deliberately</i> so. In the process it becomes a jarring, distinctive work of art unique to its creator and an important representation of the Millenial psyche. It's a psychological horror game and by God will it force you to experience psychological horror.\n- [h1]First of all, NISA... the elephant in the room needs addressing.[/h1]\nIf you're going to use D3D11 and try to do stuff multi-threaded, use a 64-bit executable.\n\nMemory allocation and thread pooling work much better in a 64-bit environment. 32-bit doesn't really expand your market share any but causes several compatibility headaches (including memory fragmentation in your resource manager). Please, NISA, stop fooling around with legacy APIs (i.e. WinMM for gamepad input and OpenGL 1.x as you did in Disgaea) and outdated ABIs.  D3D11 / 64-Bit should be the target environment for software longevity.\n\nI get the impression you believe that OLDER means more compatible, but you've got the whole PC development paradigm upside down. Old stuff is simply old, period.\n\nI would encourage you to review the guidelines for authoring Windows Store software, Microsoft's policies for Windows Store are designed to reduce legacy software maintenance problems. You need not follow them, but they will give you a pretty good idea of the APIs and ABIs that are relevant / native / not running through compatibility layer redtape. Do this and I believe you will find PC development much less troublesome.\n\n\n\n\n[list][i]With that out  of the way, I would like to point out that NISA patches their games more than any developer I have ever seen.[/i][/list]\n\n\nI personally believe this game is best suited for the Nintendo Switch, but PC will have a stable version by the time the Switch version ships. I have already authored a number of fixes for texture aliasing that guarantee image quality-wise, the PC version is where you would expect it to be. We just need NISA to polish the rest of the stuff :)\n\nTake early reviews with a grain of salt because NISA's going to be busy patching this game for months if Disgaea is any indication. Price complaints are probably the only aspect of current reviews that will remain valid. I tend to agree, the asking price is not what it should be for a game that's not exactly finished.\n\n\n\n[h1]I am leaving a positive review because I have faith NISA will stick with it, but ...[/h1]\n\n[list][list]You shouldn't rush to buy this game by any means. [b]Wait it out.[/b][/list][/list]\n- It's illegal that this game is free.\n- The premise is that you're a passenger on a ship, waking up on the morning after you've murdered your well-to-do husband. From that point, you're free to go anywhere on board to do whatever you can to avoid justice within the time limit. You could just try to play dumb and cover up enough evidence to put your guilt into doubt. If you're more devious you could try to frame one of your fellow passengers. You could even go the And Then There Were None route and murder everyone else on board just to be thorough, if you can pull it off.\n\nOverboard! was clearly designed for replayability. The ship is full of evidence and red herrings to tamper with, desperate schemes to attempt, and secrets to learn. The first playthrough reveals only a small slice of all this, leaving a collection of unsolved mysteries and unfollowed leads to pursue on the second. The second playthrough prepares you for the third, and so on, until finally you beat the game... but there's much more to it than that. Vague, but I don't want to spoil anything.\n\nThis game was released today without any kind of announcement beforehand from inkle. As usual, their writing and design are superb. If you're captivated by the premise, even by a little, you won't regret the purchase.\n- Gone Home is... okay. There's nothing particularly terrible about it, but it's hardly this amazing, revelatory experience that it's been portrayed as in the media. It's just a very short, straightforward game of exploration, in which a fairly simple story of teenage love and rebellion is fed to you through bits and pieces of notes and spoken journal entries you find while exploring a large, abandoned house. But this game does absolutely nothing innovative, unlike the pre-release hype proclaimed. There have been hundreds of games with more compelling stories, and this game introduces no original mechanics. I took my time and explored the entire house, and I beat the game in three sessions totalling 81 minutes.\n\nAgain, it's not bad, it's just an utter ripoff for $20. I got it in a large Humble Bundle package, paying about a dollar for it, and it's decent value at that price, but there's no way I'd pay more than five bucks, and even that is stretching it. I'd be pissed if I'd paid full retail for it. You can find many many games that will be far more engrossing, more entertaining, and just plain longer at this price point.\n- Zor strikes again, but agent phoenix is there to stop him! Another great VR puzzle game from Schell, with lot of jokes, hidden stuff and extra challenges for replayability. Took me 4h to finish base game, now time for achievements hunt!\n- [h1]Strategy at its finest[/h1]\n\nInto the Breach is Subset Game’s latest title, following on from their massive hit, FTL. I put off trying Into the Breach for a long while, but I finally got it when it dropped down to $10 on HB a couple of months ago and I’m so glad I did. This game isn’t for everyone, it’s kind of rogue-like mech chess, but if it clicks for you then it’ll be one of the best strategy games you’ll ever play.\n\n[h1]Positives:[/h1]\n[list][*]First up, the game looks fantastic. The pixel art here is great, from the backgrounds to the mechs and even the pilot portraits. The animations here area also really good. There’s nothing too complicated here but it’s all well executed. On the topic of appearances, I also really like the way the maps are laid out, the 8x8 grids on a plain background work really well here and it reminds me of simple boardgames. I think it works well for the game.\n\n[*]As with any good strategy game, it’s easy to pick up, but hard to master. You have a squad of three mechs (there are a few different mech groups to unlock with gold coins (?) and you can also create custom groups from the mechs you’ve unlocked). Each group has a unique element, but they all follow the basic structure of one close-range mech, one long-range mech and one support mech. Each mech has a different ability/weapon and they’re all well varied. The mech teams are really well designed here so that no one mech is super powerful and they all work really well as a unit. \n\n[*]The combat is excellent. It’s really simple but it works so well. You’ll quickly learn the different roles your mechs have and figure out the best strategies to use them. There are two ways to kill most enemies. Getting rid of all of their HP or pushing them into water/lava (with the exception of boss enemies or flying enemies). However, a lot of the time you probably won’t even be trying to kill your enemies in a given turn. You can always see what the enemies will do on their next turn and so you always want to be playing to react to/prevent their next move. Typically, enemies target civilian buildings or buildings related to your objective, so it’s usually better to focus on moving them away from these buildings rather than focusing on killing them. If you’re really smart/lucky you can also push enemies so that they attack each other, as friendly fire is a major part of this game. It’s really satisfying when you line it up right so the enemies are killing each other rather than attacking you or the buildings you defend. You can even block them from spawning by moving something on top of them!\n\n[*]Unlocks in this game are handled better than in FTL in my opinion. There are six actions that you can complete with each mech squad to earn those gold coins I mentioned in order to unlock new mech squads. The first three are the three possible victories: two, three and four island (more on that in a second) and then the other three achievements are unique to each mech squad. They’re centred around the unique aspect of each squad, tasking you to get a bit creative with the way that you’re playing. I know some players didn’t like the way that unlocks worked but I think it’s a really good way to handle it and encourages you to try new strategies. \n\n[*]The game has five islands, with one of those being the final boss fight. Each island is basically a different biome with different enemies and environmental hazards. They aren’t necessarily easier or harder than each other to start with, but the difficulty does increase as you move from island to island. There is some crossover with the enemies you’ll see, but they at the very least have a different appearance and most of them behave differently. There are also enemies unique to each island. \n\n[*]On each island, you’ll need to complete several missions before facing off against the island’s mini-boss. The missions all have different objectives for you to complete, though the win condition is always just to survive all of the turns (typically 5 turns). The different objectives vary but there are usual two, with some easier missions only having one and harder missions having three. Completing these objectives gets you certain rewards. You can either get stars, which are used upon completing an island to purchase new pilots, abilities or weapons. There is grid power which restores or increases the grid power you start with (grid power is lost when buildings are destroyed, losing all grid power results in a loss). Lastly, some of the missions award power cores (usually you only see this as the third reward for a hard mission) which allow you to upgrade your mech’s weapons or abilities (super handy). The mission variety is fairly good.\n\n[*]There are a range of different pilots in the game. You always start with one ‘special’ pilot and two regular pilots but more can be found in cryo-pods or bought at the end-of-island store. All pilots earn xp at the end of missions and when they level up they get some kind of upgrade, like more mech health or an extra movement per turn. The ‘special’ pilots all have some kind of special ability, such as being able to attack twice if you don’t move or the ability for the piloted mech to fly. Some of these require a power core, but they’re definitely worth it.  [/list]\n\n[h1]Negatives: [/h1]\n[list][*]Honestly, I’m clutching at straws here for negatives. One thing I would mention is that I don’t think this game will have as much replay value as FTL does for most people (completionists have an awful lot to do here) which shouldn’t put you off from getting it, but is something to base your expectations on. I also felt like Chris Avellone was a bit wasted on this game, his writing is fantastic but there just isn’t much of it. [/list]\n\n[h1]Verdict: [/h1]\n\nInto the Breach is as close to a perfect strategy game as I’ve ever played and it’s an excellent follow-up to FTL. This game is easy to pick up, hard to master and it looks beautiful the whole time you’re playing this weird mech chess. I can’t recommend this enough and at $15 it’s an absolute steal. This was easily one of my favourite releases of 2018 and anyone who likes strategy absolutely needs this in their library. \n\nIf you found this review helpful, please check out my other reviews over at [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33633486/]Kemo's Corner.[/url]\n-     \nI was impatient for this game and i am very satisfied with it!\n\nThe Graphics are polished as would expect, the new circuits in Las Vegas and Losail in Qatar are very good together with others that we run at night the effects of the lights in conjunction with the illuminated buildings are incredible!\n\nBraking Point 2 is so satisfying it takes between 8 to 10 hours to complete, no spoilers i think but we have a lot of characters and some familiar faces from the past!\n\nNew F1 World, offers a structure of different Series, each one is a chain of events with having a primary objective that needs to complete to progress to the next, secundary objectives can be pursued for extra rewards!\n\nCareer Mode identical to the previous ones!\n\nRed Flag Deploying will teleport the cars to the pits where we can change our strategy to restart the race!\n\nDriving and Feedback, overall there is a big improvement more precise and dynamic the ffb on the steering wheel is very good, with Gamepad it's easy to adapt and get top times!\n\n\nWhen an update comes out just don't screw up the handling!\n\nF1 23 is better than the previous ones in every way!\n  \n\n- [H1]At this price point it's hard not to recommend it, but there's a lot -better- bullet hell games out there...[/H1]\n\nDanmaku unlimited as a series is great. Don't get me wrong. It really is. But it suffers the curse of being put in with a field on Steam that is made up of even greater company. Bug Princess by Cave has the brutal difficulty angle sewn up, Ikaruga has the absolute classic angle nailed, Jamestown has the glorious pixel-art sorted. In order to stand out in this genre, you absolutely have to bring something new to the table.\n\nAs good as Danmaku Unlimited is, it does not bring anything new to the table. It brings a lot of -good-, but nothing -new-. The greatest sin here is that if you've played a lot of bullet hells, this is going to feel immensely familiar, and you're going to blast through it fast, nothing is prone to catch you out. At all. Now that may be a plus point, if that's what you're after, but if you're seeking something to change up the formula? Yeeeeee-no.\n\n[H1]So it's the Bullet Hell version of Destiny?[/H1]\n\nMechanically, it works great. You have a ship with a teeny tiny hitbox, same as most \"Eastern\" BHell games, you have anywhere between \"Mildly offensive\" and \"Absolutely terrifying\" levels of hostile fire coming toward you, and you pump out similarly scary levels of fire back, with your only choice generally being \"Do I spam the screen with lots of little beams or do I fire ONE BIG BEAM at something that needs cracking open like a walnut.\"\n\nIt has good Bullet Hell music, albeit not outstanding music, it has good graphics, albeit not outstanding graphics, you see a pattern here? If a game could ever nail what I'd define as the absolute essence of an \"8 out of 10\", this would be it. The problem is there's games out there such as Revolver360 Re:Actor that do -better-.\n\nThe problem is that for all the good it does, it's been beaten to it by other games, maybe not in every field, but in each area I can name at least two or three games that stand above it. The one area it does win out on is bang for the buck. It's kinda hard to argue with this kind of quality at this kind of price point. It's a very, very solid return on investment, particularly if you're a bullet hell fan.\n\n[H1]Closing Thoughts[/H1]\n\nDoes that make this a \"Do not buy\"? Far from it. If you're a fan of bullet hells, chances are you already own it. If you don't, eventually you should, but I'd genuinely suggest you look around first, there's a decent market now on Steam for this genre, and there's more innovative and interesting options around. If however you've already consumed them and you need a fix of something fairly solid and fairly entertaining, then sure, this works, it will scratch the itch quite nicely.\n\nVerdict : [b]Buy, definitely worth grabbing on a sale, if only to put in the \"To do\" list,[/b]\n- Write a review they said.. alright.. here it is... \n\nI am at year 5, day 29, Population 250, its winter right now in my little village.. my vikings are freezing, but they should not be. I have stores of coal available to them but they just do not go get it. \n\non a scale of 1 - 10, right now.. a solid solid 7. Why just a 7, well.. its new.. its not finished yet.. and still a tiny bit buggy. \n\nGameplay. It's good.. but i would really like to be able to grab the map with a left click hold and drag it around that way. The camera movement when trying to move the map is slow.. too slow for me. Also the fact that you have to clear whatever you have selected before you can selected the next thing you want to build. \n\nGraphics... VERY nice.. love it.. everything has great detail. People walking really nicely. Now for the not great part.. zoom in on a fishing boat.. boats moving.. oars. well.. they are not moving, I think I have even seen a fisherperson sleeping in the boat as well.. little more on the animations will probably be inserted at a later time.. but I thought it humorous, People also do tend to walk right into the side of a mountain and vanish.. then poof.. they walk back out at another area. \n\nHousing:  Great looks on both the poor and good housing. the option to just upgrade from poor to good would be nice.. \n\nStorage: Storage needs some work.. seriously.. So you have the Wood storage and you have stone storage.. they are basicly the same looking building.. I'd like to see them combined, with that being said.. please add COAL and IRON as well. Make it so that we can set whats to be stored in that building and make it have workers.. that way we can have dedicated vikings move the specific stuff.. \n\nWater: Please allow the area of coverage to overlap.. OR. make the coverage a square so we can fully cover the areas.\n\nFOOD: You gave us these great fields to use. But um.. can we grow something other than wheat and barley? like. potatoes? carrots? I mean, the vikings didn't only eat meat and bread?(but i am also aware the games still in progress)\n\nThe only real issue I have had with the game so far on my system is I was spending point on the tree and when I went back to the village it was gone and I had to reload. I do know once in a while a reload will fix the workers from gathering resources but it doesn't always work.\n\nSo over all I really enjoy this game. I'd definitely recommend  this game to anyone who enjoys city building survival type game. \n\nHope everyone enjoys this game...\n- Hi dev, if you were wondering whether anyone would actually use your HDR feature, I am. thanks\n- When I first played Battlefield 1 it literally sent me to the hospital, cause you’re supposed to seek immediate medical attention if your erection lasts longer than 4 hours.\n\nThis is easily one of the most badass games  in history. The music, the landscape, the gunplay, the hit register and the satisfying kill effect, EVERYTHING is just amazing. The last true Battlefield game. I enjoyed every second of this amazing game.  \n\nBF1 isn’t fully historically accurate but it is historically immersive. The war stories in this game genuinely made me emotional sometimes and I’m not ashamed to admit that. \n\nAs someone who is more on the “historical accuracy” side of games, I can say without a doubt that Battlefield 1 did an incredible job. Hell, they were even able to be diverse without pandering to anybody! The 1st Russian Women’s Battalion of Death, the Harlem Hellfighters, people from French-occupied northwestern Africa, the list goes on. What sets this game’s inclusivity of a variety of people and groups from other games is that it does so when it has a reason to and is still accurate to the time and setting. \n\nThat’s one of the main reasons why Battlefield 5 pissed me off so much. Instead of a British woman with a prosthetic arm wielding a cricket bat in WW2, why not include Lyudmila Pavlichenko, aka Lady Death, a female Russian sniper who had 309 confirmed kills? What about the French women who fought? They were in extremely small numbers, but they were a thing. Historically accurate inclusion is fucking awesome, and I love when games do it. But inclusivity for its own sake is terrible and it cheapens said character’s presence in the game’s setting. \n\nEven the DLC are fantastic. I remember how amazing I felt when the “for the Tsar” DLC came out and I first played it. I have never seen people fight so hard to the death in a video game without a whole lot of rage. It was amazing. I felt like I was part of the Russian revolution. Please do yourself a favor and buy this game.\n\n9/10\n\nOnly gave it a 9 ‘cause the 1 is already there…\n- I purposefully went into this game looking for bugs, seeing that it was in early access, and I have yet to find any. The only reason I stopped playing was because there was a fence that wasn't fully secured to the ground that I was able to get underneath, allowing me to get out of bounds. This lead to me falling into an area where I couldn't get out, and it wouldn't let me respawn at my most recent checkpoint. This would mean I'd have to start from the beginning, which I very much didn't want to do. Anyway, the biggest tips I can give to the developers is to make sure the map is 100% how they want it, and to make the audio design better. That's it. I may come back and change my review in the future.\n\nFINAL RATING: 4 / 10\n- One of the best most fun and addicting all-time games. However, the plants should be nazi's and the zombies should be jews. There is also a hispanic snail in your garden that sleeps on the job.\n- EDIT:\n\nWhile I have played Squad quite a bit for a few years, the large update named \"V6.0 Infantry Combat Overhaul\" unfortunately did not sit well with me.\n\nThe goals for the update:\n\n- Increase length of fights.\n- Reduce the impact of lone wolfs (solo players).\n- Increase emphasis on teamwork mechanics, which mainly meant supression.\n- Increase gunplay diversity, to create choices between optics, since the old meta meant that the magnified optics were greatly outperforming iron sights and holo sights.\n\nWhile I do not disagree with some of the goals, the implementation of them left a lot to be desired.\n\nAfter the update most gunfights became a mess of supression, without either side being able to effetively kill each other beyond 200m.\nGunhandling was also drastically nerfed, creating the sense that your character has never held a rifle before, or even used an optic for that matter.\n\nI can unfortunately no longer recommend this game, since I myself no longer feel drawn to play it.\n\nIf enough changes are made, I may revisit the game and this review, but for now there are better options out there.\n\n\n** OLD REVIEW ** \n\nCan the game be amazing and fun - yes! Do I recommend this for everyone? - No.\n\nThe experience of the game largely depends on what servers / communities you play with. If you play the core game with no moderation (no rules or admins), the game will become a race to make the first unit and lock others out and a race to get armor, then proceed to rush the enemy and end up spawnkilling them near their main spawn.\n\nIf you play on moderated servers with established rules and active admins, then you may experience a great sense of teamplay - other times not so much.\n\nBefore you buy it though...\n\n- Microphone and willingness to use it is REQUIRED for a good experience (People will quickly kick or become hostile towards you, if you do not communicate)\n- This is not battlefield or call of duty, running of solo to pull off 360 noscopes will probably get you kicked/ killed.\n- You will die without knowing from where and you will get into situations in which you have no option to survive, especially if you're new to tactical shooters.\n- You will end up running... A lot..\n- Armor is not like battlefield or call of duty, you need a driver, gunner, commander and possibly a loader (has a machinegun). Where you hit the enemy matters as much as what you hit him with (Armor piercing on his front turret will likely bounce, but even a high explosive may hurt if you can hit him up the rear)\n\nStill here... ?\n\nIf I haven't scared you off, here are my personal tips:\n- Play. The. Tutorial.  Like really...\n- Try different graphic settings, shadows especially makes a big difference in enemy visibility (game looks better with them though)\n- Start as infantry and pick rifleman, but remember to join a squad.\n- Find a server that seems to have active admins and have a ruleset you agree with.\n- Try NOT to give up when you die, generally it isn't worth throwing away a ticket to respawn if you have friendlies within 100m. Sometimes it is the right choice, but before you know which is which, it's a good idea to hold on for a medic.\n- Not all squad leaders know what they're doing, do not be afraid to join another squad if it turns out your squad leader is a fool.\n- Defending is often as important (if not more), than attacking... But you may end up waiting 30 minutes without getting shot at or shooting anyone.\n\n\nAs you can probably tell... Squad is a community based game, with in-depth enough mechanics, while also being easily accessable.\nIf you want a good sense of what the game is, check out some lesser known streamer playing it (bigger streamers will often give you the wrong sense of what a game is like)\n\nHope this helped you make an informed decision.\n\nbut for now there are better options out there.\n- BE ADVISED!!!\nif u are from asia, just don't buy it! there is no server for us.\nwe can't found any server even from EU & NA\n- Stephen's Sausage Roll is a game that the developer doesn't want normal people to buy, it seems. The description is literally, \"A simple 3d puzzle game.\", there is one video that shows you nothing about the game, and it's priced at $32 CND.\n\nFortunately, I'm here to tell you to get off your ass and to buy this wonderful game. The graphics are alright, the music is OK, but the puzzles are sublime.\n\nIn each level, the goal is the same: cook all the sausages and exit the level by standing on the exit level sign in the right orientation. You cook sausages by pushing them over a grill. Like in sokoban games, you can't pull the sausage (yet...), only push it. Another huge wrinkle is that sides of the sausage can only touch the grill once. If you touch a cooked side of a sausage to the grill, it will be burned and you fail the level. This little wrinkle will make you pull your hair out in some levels as you try and figure out how the hell you are going to maneuver the sausages around so they get cooked properly. A neat thing about the game is that if you fail, you can still continue playing the level, which might help you figure out how to play it.\n\nYou'll have a section (part of an island) that has a number of puzzles for you to solve in any order, so if you get stuck, you can try another one (until you get to the last puzzle of the section). Once you complete a section, a new section will open up with more puzzles.\n\nYour little guy has tank controls, which you will find extremely useful, as turning to the left or right near a sausage will push it in different directions. A nice detail is that the all of the puzzles make up the island section. When you activate a puzzle, the rest of the island drops away into the sea, leaving you on a tiny puzzle island.\n\nEach section introduces new mechanics into the game. First you'll just be pushing the sausages, but then you'll be stacking them, skewering them (you would think this would make things easier, but no! You can't turn when you have a skewered sausage!), walking on them...\n\nI would say that these levels are on the level of Snakebird, though I found many of them easier than Snakebird's puzzles (maybe I'm better at sokoban games than I know?). These are the kind of puzzles that you walk away from frustrated, but come back to a few hours later with the solution. This is the game where there are so many ah-ha! moments that make you feel smart. You have no idea what to do at first, but eventually you get better and better. You might not see solutions at first, but you begin to see where you need to go to solve the puzzle, and then work backwards from there. It's wonderful!\n\nIf you're having trouble, there's a community guide that has all the solutions, which is super helpful (though not as much when I was playing because it wasn't complete!).\n\nIt might be expensive, but I took 36 hours to solve all the puzzles and it was worth every penny.\n- [b]Playing status:[/b] 100% achievement\n[b]Grindy Achievement(s):[/b] No.\n[b]Optional Achievement(s):[/b] Yes (9 achievements).\n[b]Difficult Achievement(s):[/b] No.\n\n[h1]Intro[/h1]\nYou were sure that you weren't supposed to be here: a dark forest with a thick mist surrounding over it. Where is this place? Can you go back? Join Kihara Kashin in her adventure, looking for a way to return to where she belongs in [b]Tales of the Black Forest[/b].\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n- Heartwarming stories\n- 2 endings\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n- Dialogues might be hard to understand with the untranslated words and a lot of Japanese names that are given at once\n\n[b]Specs[/b]\nIntel Core i5-9300H 2.40GHz, 8GB RAM, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650\n\n[h1]Should you buy this game?[/h1]\n[b]Yes.[/b]\n[i]If you like to play games with a heartwarming story and don't mind reading a lot of texts, buy this game. You might want to familiarize yourself with Japanese terms though.[/i]\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1]In-Depth Review[/h1]\n\n[h3]Visuals[/h3]\nThe game is presented in 2D pixelated art. As an RPG Maker game, all of its assets and interfaces have been customized, leaving no trace of the default one. It does a good job with the interface though - everything looks beautifully made and straight to the point. The maps are also done well to promote the areas, whether it's the bustling city or the abandoned village. The areas, although usually depicted at night, are still easy to see with their blue-ish colors. Everything is done well to help you enjoy the scenery.\n\n[h3]Story[/h3]\nThe main selling point of the game is in its storytelling. The world of [b]Tales of the Black Forest[/b] is separated into 3 interconnecting chapters, each focusing on someone and the event that was happening around them. The story has a different vibe on each chapter, although one thing is certain: it does a good job in delivering a heartwarming story at the end. I know that creating good storytelling with just 2D sprites is not easy, but this game does it seamlessly.\n\nSince the storytelling focuses on a different person in each chapter, the story is obviously non-linear. You'll find some clues of what was happening to a certain event, which will help you in understanding another event in a bigger picture. It might be hard to keep track of all of them, especially with the recurring names, but the game is kind enough to give you some explanation about it. There might still be some mysteries lying around, but I found it to be concluded nicely at the end.\n\nThe translation might hinder you from enjoying the story to its fullest. It tends to not translate some words, whether it's some locations or simple terms. Some words like \"komusume-chan\" can be translated into English nicely without ruining the sentences, but the translator decides to just give a translation note surrounded in brackets when you encounter it for the first time. People who do not know Japanese terms might have trouble understanding these words sometimes, especially when you also have to remember a lot of Japanese names in the process.\n\n[h3]The Game[/h3]\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nAlthough the story is the main focus of the game, there were times when you have to walk around, whether to initiate another cutscene or solve some puzzles. Important objects are marked in the game, making it easier to locate where you are supposed to look. If you are the adventurer type, some additional dialogues will also available to give a conclusion to some characters after you progress the story. They are not related to the main story though, so you can safely ignore them if you choose to do so.\n\nSeveral puzzles are available to break the repetitiveness. Puzzles in the first half of the game usually take the form of finding some number combinations based on the provided hints, although the second half of the game starts to be more creative with its puzzle-like minigame. I wish that the game will do these puzzles right from the start since it helps to break the monotonous pace.\n\n[b]Length and Replayability[/b]\nThe game lasts for about ~5h. Despite it having two endings, the point of no return is obvious and the game is kind enough to tell what you have to do to reach both endings. That being said, there is no point to replay the game since you can save before the point of no return to unlock both endings at once.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nIt's been a while since I found a quality RPG Maker game on Steam. I didn't expect that it will do a good job with its storytelling. The music, art, and dialogue - everything helps to enhance the story, giving this heartwarming feeling after you read it. I was satisfied with the story, although I admit that I got bored sometimes because of the number of dialogues that I had to read. The game is completely not for those who don't like visual novels, and people who appreciate the story aspect in a game will enjoy it to the fullest.\n\n[quote]Visit SaveOrQuit.com for detailed game reviews, posted daily![/quote]\n- This is trash, I mean if you eat shit for breakfast I'm sure you'll like it.

Bare minimum information and recommendations to improve your playthrough\n2. Background information on me and my playthrough\n3. More extensive non-spoiler reactions\n \nPart 1: Recommendations for You\nIf you're like me and you try to get all the extra scene dialogue, then please, if you take nothing else from this, give yourself time to play this game yourself. There is actually so much content here, I really want you all to take your time to experience it as you go. The game is just too long to binge in a reasonably short amount of time, and if you do binge, you're going to lose a lot.\n \nMy recommendations:\n1. Give yourself time to play the game. Let it sink in, and take notes- it'll be rewarded. The game is literally too dense and too long to binge reasonably if you like 100%ing.\n \n2. Get invested in the characters and pay attention to them, not just the (admittedly stellar) mysteries.\n \n3. Explore the game, its mechanics, and its dialogue yourself. Don't be afraid to restart a Somnium several times; the more options you pick, the more meaningful information you get.\n \n4. If you're a puzzle lover then try to solve the game yourself. You're going to have a blast if you manage it, and the game has tons of built-in hint systems to make it even easier, fairer, and more fun.\n \n5. Try to go in knowing at little as you can. The marketing has already done a great job. Focus on finishing the game and bringing it all together.\n \n6. On PC, force anti-aliasing on using your graphics card to make the game prettier. Game ran and controlled smoothly with few bugs.\n \n7. You don't need AI1 to play AI2, but I think AI2 does spoil AI1, though you could still enjoy them in reverse order.\n \n7. If you're sensitive to horny then just read less background dialogue in Ryuki side. Gore is pretty toned down, and there isn't any single huge CW.\n \nYou can stop reading now if you don't want your playthrough tainted by my reactions/expectations effected.\n \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nPart 2: Who am I, and how do I play?\nI'm an Uchikoshi fanatic. I've played all his English-translated games, and visual novels are my favorite genre of game. I've played a lot of visuals novels, but Uchizawa's are my favorites. I usually try to 100% complete all the scenes and see all the bonus dialogue. I've also played a lot of other genres of game, and I do like fun gameplay, but the most important things to me tend to be:\n \nA. An interesting story is absolutely what gets me invested\nB. Bunches of novel ideas like unique plot points I haven't seen before, philosophical ideas, or puzzles\nC. Characters that I at least don't actively hate; I can like a game for the above two, but characters still matter\nD. Deep personal connection, usually formed by connections to real people or how a game shaped my life\n \nThose are the ways I rate my top games. For the last 8 years, my top 2 favorite games have been the same:\n \nMy top favorite game of all time is Remember11. I love the plot, the ideas, the twists, the characters, and it's what got me truly invested in Uchikoshi. It's very much a mystery game first with an unravelling mystery and themes I love to explore.\n \nMy second favorite game is Virtue's Last Reward. I love the interactive moral dilemmas. VLR's use of the Prisoner's Dilemma jumpstarted my interested in Philosophy which led me to major in Philosophy. I don't like the characters as much save for a few, but it's still very important to me.\n \nNow, let me tell you how I've played AINI: I've basically been playing non-stop since June 13th.\n \nTake this with a grain of salt because I've been documenting as I play (the average main story playtime seems to be 20-35 hours, with 100% likely taking 50+), but right now, I have 97 hours of playtime. I have not gotten all the dialogue, achievements, or fully explored the abundance of extra mechanics. Instead, I have a 616-page reaction document full of constant laughs, cries, screams, passing out, and most of all love.\n \nPart 3: My Review\nThe R11 #1 and VLR #2 holy duology held true for 8 years. Also, AI1 isn't one of my favorite standalone games; it has huge personal connection for me because of the community and the AI1 ARG, but it wasn't my favorite as a game.\n \nI gave all that background because I want you to take me seriously when I say this:\nAI2 is my new favorite game. The #1 spot has been Easily dethroned.\n \nThe themes, twists, characters, ideas, gameplay, visuals, voice acting, fair mystery, presentation, mechanics, and comedy all of it resonates together perfectly. I don't even tend to value gameplay or visuals, but at many times, this game is fun to play while looking genuinely beautiful and cinematic.\n \nThe story reads like a proper Uchikoshi + Nakazawa return to form. The mystery is fair, interesting, meaningful, and complex told satisfyingly. There are many deep ideas, concepts, and themes utilized in thought-provoking ways.\n \nGameplay-wise, there are tons of mechanics that are utilized to make each Somnium unique; they all feel designed by love, fair, and reflective of the character through gorgeous symbolism. They blow the first game completely out of the water. Each one is its own experience to explore and a visual delight. There are also tons of mechanics for you to discover that make AI2 a fun game to play.\n \nThe animations, voices, and directing are cinematic; this game is actually breathtaking a lot of the time. It's backed up by great and charming character writing- despite the fact Mizuki is my favorite AI1 character with 0 contest, I grew to like much of the AI2 cast the same amount.\n \nAI2 is a story about halves and splitting, but also love and coming together- please, see it through until it's whole. I hope and believe you will all fall in love with AI2 like me; AI2 is all I've ever wanted. AI2 is my dream game come true; it's a gorgeous love letter to all Uchikoshi fans who love Zero Escape's puzzles, Infinity's mysteries, and AI's characters and humor.\n- I thought I liked this game....  but after completing about half, I am super bored.  I quit the game after every battle.\n\nDeck building is super basic and kinda pointless.   No reason to adjust deck after you complete a few maps.  The maps are super easy.\n\nYou can basically just run around with 1 unit and kill everything...   Since movement costs a card, you either move one unit many times, or many units 1 time.   Easier to just move 1 strong unit around.\n\nI think I am the wrong demographic.  The storyline is for kids.   So maybe the target audience is 10 year olds with no strategy gaming experience.\n- This innocent-looking golf game really is not a golf game. Except it is a golf game. Except it isn't. Essentially, WTG? uses \"golf game\" as its medium, through which it tells a staggering number of jokes and punchlines. Expect the unexpected. But always expect there to be puns.\n- Are you looking for a medival game with great design and clever AI? Well then! ...keep looking. Just stop and turn around. I am serious. I know my \"game time\" says what? 10min? But its at least 2-3hours. \n\nI just sat there, trying to figure out what the heck I was supposed to do. Such as resources... why arent my people doing what I tell them to? My people just stand there and does nothing when i tell them to do something. \n\n\nIts like the developers decided \"meh, lets release and hope stupid people buy it so we can break even on this project\" becouse that attitude reflects how the game is. \n\n\nSave your money, walk away and spend them on something else. Litterly anything else...\n- Honestly I've put over 400 hours into 20XX and this game is even better! Even though it's unfinished as of current it's still a fantastic time and truly stands out on it's own.\n- [h2] Visual Novel Reviews [/h2]\n\n[b] TLDR [/b] Two scenes, no customization, no choices, character development needs work, but the Extremely short story delivered (If you know what I mean) a whopping 38 minutes of game play for me. \n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [th]Question[/th]\n        [th]Answer[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Buy Again[/td]\n        [td]No, I wouldn't.

[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[h3] Story: [/h3]\nThis game revolves around a neighbor that is sleeping with the mom and the daughter (Separately) and trying not to get caught. Someone is the neighborhood knows the whole story, but who \ncould that be? \n\n[h3] Overall Score: [/h3]\n\nScore: 3.8 - Length, Character Development, and Storytelling leaves a lot to be desired with this game. This is the second game that this developer has released, so I am not disappointed that I spent 5$ dollars on a game that they created, but I will say that I will think Long and Hard (No Pun Intended) before purchasing another game from this studio.\n- Getting 100% was... very fun in this cute metroid-vania where you basically act as your own level designer.\n\napproximate amount of time to 100%: 20-30 Hours\nEstimated achievement difficulty: 5/10\nMinimum number of playthroughs needed: One (Most likely 2 if you go in blind)\nMultiplayer achievements: No.\nMissable achievements: Yes. Sequence Break, \nPoint of no return: No. After the game's ending you can return and explore.\nGrinding Achievements:  No.\nDLC-Only achievements: No.\nTime-gated achievements: No.\nSpeed-run achievements: Yes. 4 hour Speed run (and another 4 hour Speedrun but with 100% Secrets/gold etc...)\nRNG-achievements: No.\nIs there a good guide available: I recommend Demajen's Guide on steam with the super usefull map.\nDoes difficulty affect achievements: Yes, Medium recommended. (There's also a 0 death achievement)\nFirst achievement unlock: Defeat the first boss in the tutorial temple.\n\n* I can't remember how this game ended up in my account (might have been some promotional giveaway...) but I'm so glad it did.\n\nThis game has some of the best Quality of life I've seen. It's extremely enjoyable and the 100% journey is challenging but not too problematic. Wholeheartedly recommend this one.\n- My gambling addict friend said if I post a review on this game and it gets 150 likes and 25 Awards that he will buy me a case of beer. So I'm just gonna leave this here\n- This game is set to release in early October, but I definitely wouldn't buy it anytime soon. It's not ready. It's full of weird little errors, the mechanics and UI are clunky as hell, there's a lot of information you really need but don't get, the \"events\" are incredibly repetitive, half the time the wording is so bad you're left confused what's actually happening, even the basics aren't there- random capitalization, no consistency from panel to panel or objective to objective... This game needs another 6 months in EA.\n- Been playing now for 56 hours and love it apart from one thing.... too many press conferences! Seems like every other minute I'm told I'm due to go into a press meeting... so, apart from that, I'm enjoying the game. Have to confess as a 60 year old woman, I do cheat... have much fun creating a team, buying loads of top players and winning every match... so satisfying! Anyway, can't cope with the action games and find the pace of this right up my street. Have been playing since the original Championship Manager games back in the 90s so would call myself a fairly seasoned player!\n- HOW?? WHY?? WHY IS THIS GAME SO GOOD?? IT HAS NO REASON TO BE THIS GOOD WTF?\nThe trailers or advertisements will not even give anything close to a sense on how good this story, build up, characters and mechanics (did I mention the story?) really is.\n\nShu Takumi and Yasumasa Kitagawa, you've done it again, from Ace Attorney to this. I can 100% say if you haven't played this game, you are definitely missing out.\n\n10/10!!!\n- An instant classic.\n---\n\nThe original [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/kunovega/recommended/264200]One Finger Death Punch[/url] was an unexpected treat for me. The refined simplicity of just two buttons that require masterful timing to create a legitimate fighting experience laid out to a selection of music that reminds you of the classic Kung-fu movies of the 1970's but packaged with a carefree stickman aesthetic.\n\nOne Finger Death Punch 2 is a respectable sequel in most ways. The core gameplay is fundamentally the same while the visual indicators and special attack animations have been upgraded and made more fanciful. Other things are changed simply to give you a new experience.\n\nEvery aspect of the game is polished from the interesting tutorial to the many additional modes (survival, gauntlet, etc.) that exist beyond the (very long) main campaign. Once you get into the groove there's potentially dozens if not hundreds of hours of fun to squeeze from this.\n\nThis is a game that just has to be played to truly appreciate it as the feel of your interaction along with the music is what really defines the experience. Simply watching it or looking at the screenshots doesn't do it justice.\n\nThere are a couple of (minor) controversial changes that may not appeal to some fans:\n1. The music in 2 includes a more modernized remix compared to the more traditional music from 1. Personally I love the soundtracks from both, but there are people who have a preference.\n2. The upgrades to special attacks in 2 can be a bit of visual clutter at times. I like both styles, but there are people who prefer 1 over 2.\n3. There are some sequences (like the lightsword rounds) which did not return in 2, replaced instead by other weapons. While I think it would have been cute to include all of that along with the new stuff, it's not a deal breaker. It does however mean that both games retain a bit of unique flair and a reason for you to play and experience them both. 2 is overall an upgrade, but it's also not a 100% replacement.\n\nI would strongly suggest that if you've never played either game, you should begin with the first one. I think it's a better entry point to the series and might have a slightly broader appeal. (it's also slightly cheaper).\n\nThen if you find yourself enjoying it, come back and pick up 2 and you'll find yourself with some remixed music, fancy new special attack animations and a whole new adventure to work through.\n\nJust to be very clear: Both of these games are fantastic and deserve more praise than I can properly express and I'll very likely be putting 100's of hours into this just like I did the first one.\n---\n\nBottom line: Simple to learn, hard to master, and super satisfying fighting along with a great soundtrack.\n---\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38232109/]While you are here, would you consider following my curator page?[/url]\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/kunovega/recommended/]Want to read all of my reviews and not just the curated ones?[/url]\n- It's about time i wrote a proper review for one of my favourite games ever.\n\nRivals of Aether is a platform fighter that tries to follow Super Smash Bros. Melee and P+'s footsteps by making a competitive focused game, but also while trying to keep it more accessible than the former. The game also has a very active workshop that allows players to create their own characters and play ones made by other creators, alongside custom made stages and buddies.\n\nI will focus on the purist aspect of the game first.\n\nAs for many \"smash clones\", the game will feel very familiar to people who already played a smash game, with the controls being nearly identical but with some key differences:\n\n1. THERE'S NO SHIELD. Rivals of Aether is probably the first game in its genre to forgo the iconic \"bubble\" shield, choosing it to replace it with a parry instead. Parries are riskier, staying out for a few frames, and will reward you immensely by either stunning the opponent or reflecting their projectiles. Since parrying is so risky, the game's neutral and defense (but also its offense) will be focused on movement, especially thanks to wavedashing, wavelanding alongside some more niche or character specific movement techs. \n\n2. THE STAGES HAVE NO LEDGES. This means your way to safety when you get knocked off the stage will be actually landing onto the main platform, rather than aiming for the ledges. Rightfully so, the game offers much more options when offstage compared to smash games, with every character having access to wall jumping, an airdodge that doesn't send in freefall and the ability to walljump and cancel special falls, allowing you to use your up special two times. This means the offstage game is a lot deeper than in other game, as there will always be a way back onto the stage since almost every character is allowed a lot of freedom while in disadvantage.\n\n3. THERE'S NO GRABS. There's not much to add here; the absence of a shield makes grabs unnecessary, and thus they're not present in the game. Some characters have command grabs, though.\n\nThere's a total of 14 characters in Rivals of Aether (free from the beginning), with 4 more to come in future patches. Although the cast might seem very slim for people who are used to smash games, it's incredibly diverse. Enough to probably warrant you to try every character. Each character has a lot of depth and can shape the stage in some way. Some fighters take inspiration from smash characters, such as Clairen having a tipper mechanic like Marth, or Absa having Ness and Mewtwo's movement turned up to 200 and Zelda's lightning kicks; this means you'll probably find a character you're familiar with in case you're not confident to play with a brand new character yet. It's also worth mentioning that the game is very balanced, with tiers being very subjective. Regardless, RoA's current top player plays the character that is considered the worst in the game by most, so that should prove that the balance state is very good.\n\nNetplay is not perfect, but it's very good and playable. As i'm writing this review, there's currently a beta build that includes rollback netcode, which presents a couple of bugs and desyncs but does its job quite well. Default build uses delay netcode, which also works just fine in case you're dissatisfied with the rollback beta. Rollback is expected to become the default build once the dev team fixes all its kinks.\n\nEvery stage has both an \"aether\" (casual, with hazards) mode and a \"basic\" (competitive, no hazards) mode. Every single stage in \"basic\" mode is tournament legal (with the exception of tempest peak in some regions), adding a lot of stage variety. Aether stages are aimed for a casual audience, with some spicy traps and whacky platform arrangements for a more casual and laidback experience.\n\nOn that topic, there's no items in this game, so the chaotic free-for-all  factor goes down by a notch, to the discomfort of players who like the party game side of platform fighters.\n\nThe community may be small, but it's very active and constantly organizes weekly and monthly tournaments, with the active (financial and whatnot) support of the game devs themselves, so you will quickly find a community in which to play. Sadly, though, having a small community means you'll be bound to experience some \"dead lobbies\" from time to time.\n\nSolo play, i'll have to be honest, is incredibly lackluster. This game was mainly thought to be played with other players and as a result, single player content is very scarce. There's an arcade-styled story mode which only features a handful of characters (the original 4+2 more), that will have you fight some random fighters until you reach your character's \"rival\" at the end of the story. The cutscenes go from average to bad, depending on the character's story. Each story is very simple and resolves itself in the course of 5 encounters, with a super boss+ a final cutscene once you complete every character's story mode\n\nThere's also \"endless abyss\" mode. It's similar to smash's multi-man mode, where you'll fight a never ending horde of weak cpus, with some minigames slapped inbetween, like a platforming section or explosive enemies. You will have to fight a weaker version of the story mode's boss after a set number of waves each time. The most interesting part of this gamemode is probably the rune system. The rune system will allow to buy runes with the in-game currency that will make your character stronger, be it by making them faster/more powerful or improving their moves. These runes can also be used in abyss versus, which is basically pvp but with runes.\nSadly, endless abyss can become repetitive very quickly, with its never changing waves and gimmicks and grind you have to go through to be able to buy (and use) your runes.\n\nThere's one more mode called Tetherball. It's actually a PvP mode, but i'm putting it in the solo play paragraph because it's a very casual mode. Simply put, the goal of this mode is to hit a beach ball that is attached to a pole by a string and make it spin around it. You score one point when the ball-on-a-string completely wraps the pole. You will have to fight your opponent to keep the control of the ball, as they can hit it as well and make the ball \"theirs\". It's a very fun but often shunned aside mode so i felt like putting it in this review. Please, play Tetherball with me. \n\n\nAs for workshop...\n\nIf you're not big on the competitive scene of platform fighters, this is probably why you came to this store page and. as you may have gathered, casual play is not very fleshed out, with only aether mode and some solo modes as your only options. That's where workshop shines! You'll be able to download hundreds of play made characters, some with the intent of being serious, competitive fighters, while others (most) are aimed to a more casual audience. Characters can go from original characters to the reckless wii mote guy, so you'll have plenty of fun by browsing the worshop page and finding the perfect character, be it an original character or a direct transposition of greninja from Smash Ultimate. Needless to say, you'll also have a huge choice of stages and music packs, alongside some hidden gems like new gamemodes that often pass under the radar. I bet you didn't know you could play Uno in Rivals of Aether!\n\n\n\nTo wrap things up, i'd like to comment on the great pixel art graphics which does its job very well and will appeal to retro gamers specifically, and give my shoutouts on the incredible OST made by flashygoodness. Every track fits the stage perfectly and gives the right atmosphere to this fast paced fighting game.\n\nIn other words this game is a very good purchase for both casual players, thanks to the workshop, and competitive players because of its deep yet accessible design. I hope this review made whoever is reading it consider buying Rivals of Aether and join the community.\n- Fun Tower-Defense style indie game. Definitely one where your skill improves every time you die. And you will die, repeatedly. :P Expect to try out many monster combinations per floor before you find something that can delay the hordes of adventurers long enough to set up the floor beneath! I would probably enjoy some more horizontal progression + permanent upgrades for long term re-playability, but it seems like a solo dev/small scoped project. Definitely worth the price for the current amount of content!\n- If you like management type games and RPGs, this is the perfect mix. It's just enough management to allow you to thrive with mostly strategy without feeling bogged down, and just enough RPG elements to get you invested in not just your squad, but each individual character in it. \n\nHere's a tale from my experience with the game;\n\nThis is the kind of game to change your entire perspective on life itself. Failure is not the end, nor the beginning, but a constant in this world that you can either let destroy you or make you stronger. Allow me to tell you a story. The story of New Battlehill. \nNear the Shek city of Squin, not far east, was a small town. It went through many names. The first that stuck was Firstyeet, totally not a placeholder. It wasn't an notable settlement, merely consisting of a shack, an iron processor, and some walls to mildly inconvenience the roving gangs of Dust Bandits that liked to bully the residents. After being evicted from their own city once again, the residents, Denver, Soto, Ruka, and Meow, vowed to take back their home. After training and buying the best weapons and armor they could, they made their way back to Firstyeet. To their surprise, however, they would not have to fight. One of the bandits had picked a fight with a herd of goats. The bandits' defense failed against the caprine assault. From this, the town would get its second name - Densorumego. Den for Denver. So for Soto. Ru for Ruka. Me for Meow. And Go for the true heroes, the goats.\nPeace would not last long but soon the residents of Densorumego would become strengthened by their constant fighting. On the elevated, somewhat round land on which Densorumego sat, there were many large fights involving a lot of people. If only there was some sort of name to reflect this... \nAnd from that, the town was renamed for the last time, to Battlehill.\nThings were looking up. The town built its first farms and expanded to be almost four times its original size. But this peace would not last. Battlehill's new ambitions of self sufficiency would attract the attention of a new foe - The Shek Kingdom.\nThe Shek claimed ownership of the land Battlehill was on, and as such, demanded all food grown there be given to them. Confident from their many victories against the Dust Bandits, the Battlehillites refused the Shek demands. Their risk was calculated... but man were they bad at math.\nAll but one were nearly killed in the ensuing battle, and the one person that wasn't knocked into a coma was stuck on the wall because part of the wall was destroyed and he could no longer reach the stairs because of that. The people knew they couldn't fight the Shek, but they would not allow themselves to be subservient either. And so began their malicious compliance. The Shek would get all the food in Battlehill, as it would be none - The Battlehillites were moving.\nI could write entire books about their journey around the west. The Fogmen, the ruins, the Screeching Bandits, there's many a tale. But, eventually, the people would find a new home. In the harsh and Beak Thing infested land of Vain, homeland of the Western Hive, they would found their new home - New Battlehill.\nJump to now, the city is thriving, they have more bread than they know what to do with, they've grown strong from defending their home from the Beak Things, and their population has grown. They are currently planning a reconquest of Battlehill, which was occupied by Dust Bandits shortly after they left.\n\nThere is a part I left out, between Firstyeet and Densorumego - I had repeatedly failed to retake Firstyeet, and I was about to quit the game. I was frustrated that I'd gone and bought the best arms and armor and still failed. And when I tried to set up a training ground on a mountain near Squin, bandits again came and defeated me. I went as far as to try and get a refund, which was denied. That refund being denied was the best thing that could've happened. I decided to give the game another try, and to try accepting my failures and growing from them. And if I hadn't done that, I would never have founded New Battlehill. None of the legend worthy tales my squad has been through would have happened. And I'd never have had the fun of going through all of them.\n\nIn short, get this game. It is just great.\n- DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU ALREADY OWN SHOVEL KNIGHT!!!!\n\nIt's a free update to the Original Shovel Knight if you purchased it.  Not a bad game by any means, has the same charm as the original S.K., but why pay for it here if you can get it free with the original (now called Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove).\n\n- I have a serious love/hate relationship with Sea of Thieves. It is both one of the best games I have ever played and one of the most frustrating games I have ever played, all wrapped into one. The gameplay of Sea of Thieves is INCREDIBLE. The sailing is the best in any game I have ever played. The feeling of exploration and discovery as you blast through treasure hunts and puzzles and mysteries is unlike any feeling you can get from any other game. The cooking mechanic, the healing from food, the not-terrible fishing mechanic... all subsystems that prop up the rest of the gameplay are unique and interesting in their own right. The land-based combat is relatively uninspired, yet still satisfying when part of the greater picture that the game presents. Some of my favorite memories in gaming, full stop, come from completing long nights on the high seas or doing long-form content available in the game. The game is gorgeous, some of the best ocean/water graphics in any game. The rest of the game is equally beautiful while perfectly conveying the environment of the map you are in. I swear to Gaben that I can freaking smell the wet sand or sulfurous lava on some of these islands. The music and sound design are some of the best in the industry. Outright, the game is incredible. \n\nBUT... Sea of Thieves sweaties ruin the game for me. There is absolutely nothing worse than having a night full of fun absolutely destroyed by some player who's enjoyment of the game is derived from eliminating anyone else's fun. I understand that PvP is part of the \"pirate life\", but it is by far the worst part of the game by far. I would be willing to pay money, hell a freaking monthly subscription, for the opportunity to play SoT as a strictly PvE game with just my friends and the rest of the server populated by bots. I actively avoid playing the game now because of how many of my last play sessions started with me spawning at an outpost and subsequently being sunk less than 15 feet off the dock by some sweaty that hasn't seen sunlight since the Obama administration. I know that this is an incredibly unpopular opinion in the greater SoT-sphere, but part of the enjoyment of games is letting players enjoy them how they wish, and I really freaking wish that I could enjoy the aspects of SoT that are fun to me without being the plaything of those pirates who live only to ruin the fun of others.\n- Plays and looks just like the Park Ranger and Cruise Director HOG series, if you enjoyed those then you will likely enjoy this series. Game is composed of hidden object scenes and simple puzzle transitions that have a loose story to bridge the movement between them. The hidden object scenes follow an older couple as they take their grandchildren to a variety of European counties on their vacation, they sprinkle in a few interesting facts between each location. There are collectibles in each scene along with a raccoon. I overall enjoyed it for a laid back experience and the weirdly fun photostock based scenes. It took me about 2.5 hours to play through the game along with the bonus scenes/puzzles.\n- Remember when Doom 2016 released the multiplayer beta test first, and we rightfully worried the game would be a flop? Thankfully, the campaign instead blew us away.\n\nI enjoyed my first run through 2016, but only moderately so. In the original Dooms, if you never stop moving, enemies truly can never hit you. With 2016, however, enemies lead their shots if you move predictably. Also, if you leave line of sight, the demons will fire several more predict shots, in case you re-engage from the same vantage point.\n\nI failed to adapt initially. Instead, I blamed the game, claiming it felt unfair compared to the originals.\n\nThen, I stumbled upon Clockner's playthrough of Doom. He showed me a skill ceiling I never dreamed possible. Next came ByteMe's speedrun performance at QuakeCon 2019. I noticed when the demons charged their shots, he would at times hold still and bait for them to aim before dodging at the last second.\n\nThe excuses were off. Doom has transformed after 25 years. The enemies are now more intelligent (yet not overly so). I too needed to evolve.\n\nAs I took on my Ultra Nightmare run (over 3-4 months), I developed a deep knowledge of every level, and in the process, became fond of every inch, as if the entire UAC and Hell were my homes. UN felt like such an accomplishment. After that, I tried to take on an all runes/weapons/challenges mastered run (no grinding). I failed the first two times. With Eternal around a day or two away, I just completed this challenge on my third try. Personally, I leave satisfied with nothing left.\n\nI initially had gripes with 2016, only to learn the developers were one step ahead. When a team/game proves me wrong, I am loyal forever.\n\nDoom 2016 will now be uninstalled from my machine, never again to be reinstalled. May your thirst for blood never quench. And may we never need you again.\n\nTo me, Doom 2016 is also Eternal 🙏.\n- Where's the atmosphere the first two games had?\nWhy can I only have 2 weapons at any time?\nWhy is this game a generic shooter?\nIf the game they had shown in so many videos previous to the release had come out, it'd have been a masterpiece, instead we got a severely watered down version of it.\nIt's a corridor shooter for the most part, with some parts where you're in a bigger room instead, really what I played the first two games for.\n- This is the best Civilization up to this point, and the DLC just made it even better. I will grant that the with all the add ons it would feel a tad crowded to anyone who hadn't played it before, but you have a crazy amount of options. The game series tagline of \"one more turn\" could not be more applicable.\n\nYou can strive for one of several victories: diplomatic, cultural, technological or domination. Each has its unique challengers to overcome and create a lot of the fun of the game. They are also not necessarily mutually exclusive and after completing one victory, you can go for the others. Each AI opponent has their own personality, and are pretty predictable in how they behave. Any one who has started the game next to Neopoleon or Ghengis Kahn knows they immediately have to have a decent military to repel invasion, while Ghandi will to muscle you out with religion and culture.\n\nThere are some important changes between Civilization IV and V. One of the most notable is that wars are plausible again as you dont constantly lose health in enemy territory and cities are easier to conquer. Additionally, culture doesn't automatically take over neighbor's cities anymore. \n\nThis game is easily worth the money. I'm not entirely sure how it stacks up to Civilization VI, but any game that I log 200+ hours on over a period of years and still haven't come close to doing everything is doing something right. A great game from a great series.\n- (If you're past a certain age, I can just say that this is Take Two Interactive's \"Bureau 13\" game, except actually done WELL. If not, keep reading.)\n\nTechnobabylon was one of the best games I played in 2017 (yeah I know it came out in 2015, shh). Wadjet Eye has done it again with Unavowed, one of the best games I played in 2018 and an amazing capstone to all of their work so far. You can play this game without having played the Blackwell series, but you'll get a little more out of it if you have.\n\nIt's also a rather dark piece of work, with a tone somewhere between Sleepy Hollow (the TV show) and something like Buffy. Your character (whose gender and former profession are chosen by you) gets possessed and goes on a year-long murderfestival rampage across New York City. Eventually the Unavowed, a brave supernatural-evil-fighting duo show up, and with the body back in your own control you sign up to fight evil with them. \n\nAs the game goes on, you recruit more characters in Bioware style, solve mysteries (all of which center around that year of hell your character went through), make Tough Choices and work to make the city a better place. All in absolutely gorgeous 640x480 resolution pixel art. \n\nThere were a couple of puzzles that slowed me down (the word \"LEGS\" is going to cause me to make faces for weeks) but this mostly flowed very smoothly. If you're at all a fan of past Wadjet Eye creations, this game needs to be in your life. If you're not, it's a good starting place, maybe the best starting place except that its quality might spoil you for the rough patches of past games.\n\nThis game contains some gore, some body/existential horror that might be jarring to some, and a lot of swearing.\n- Cthulhu Saves Christmas is another solid, fast-paced comedy jrpg from the folks at Zephoyd games. If you're looking for something bite sized, with some funny dialogue (most of it lands) and great combat this is a worthy purchase. I'd estimate an average playtime of 5-8 hours which is a perfect investment for a weekend jrpg.\n\nTLDR: If you enjoyed Cthulhu Saves the World and Cosmic Star Heroine, you're probably going to enjoy this game.\n- I don't understand why everyone is saying to stay out of the house? I went inside, they were super nice loving and caring people. The dude that owns the place is a butcher and has all kinds of quality meat. We had BBQ and showed me around the wheat farm. And his grandma, she can't see or hear very well, but she's incredibly sweet. They're both looking after a baby that's ABSOLUTELY ADORABLE!\n\nI don't get what all the fuss is about, I enjoyed my visit.\n- I had to purchase Scarlet Hollow after witnessing the excitement of Episode 4 through my friends. I immediately binged the first three episodes the following day and found myself and in rather different spot compared to their playthrough. The choices you make in SH are actually impactful - which is (unfortunately) quite refreshing for the genre! I've since run through several different routes to explore more of the story (and collect those achievements!). While you have the ability to skip through previously seen text, lines within replayed conversations are shaped by your selected traits, choices, and previously selected dialogue; you won't be skipping that many lines before seeing new content. Similarly, characters may be painted in an entirely different light based on choices you've made. The cast and writing truly nails the small town feel of SH (gossip and all). \n\nMake sure you eat the takeaway container in the fridge. Thank me later.\n- This game has such a HUGE potential like Stardew Valley in its early days!!\nCollecting stuff, helping people by crafting potions its so rewarding and lovely pls dear developers keep working on it. I BEG YOU! :D\nSure it has some bug right now but even on day one they managed to get some fast fixes and tried their best to make it work for everyone. \nThe controls were a bit tricky in the beginning (used Playstation 5 Controller) but its just a matter of time, its just not the normal controls like in other games.\nThe music was pretty nice and chill and also the animations were super cute, i love watching little Rubrum built his sandcastles over and over again. >3< \n\nOverall a good game, but could become even more better in the future, keep going guys!!\n- the game itself is pretty ok and fun for what it is, and runs great on deck. but man, F**K THE ALWAYS-ONLINE-DRM WHICH AT TIMES TAKES AGES TO CONNECT, GETTING THE GAME STUCK IN THE MENU WITH NOTHING TO DO!!\n\n>> Update after 20h played:\nI really enjoy playing the game. It is good, it is fun and runs great on the Steam Deck, which is especially important to me, as I tend to travel a lot as part of my job.\n\nThat being said, however, is core of the issue: The Always-On-DRM actually prevents me from playing this game on the go. Having this sort of DRM is, in my opinion, only predatory and inexcusable in any way. I get that the online-components of the game will not work when I am on the move, but I am mainly interested in the single player experience, from which I am also locked out. I am even locked out of the main menu without a stable internet collection, which is just ridiculous.\n- I reviewed the original Mark of the Ninja more than 4 years ago. I liked its stealth-based gameplay approach and praised the learning curve experienced throughout the story. I bought the [i]Special Edition[/i] which practically meant an add-on with some more levels, a custom and the option to replay the entire game in commentary mode. \n\nYou know some games get re-released due to the availability of a new console generation. This [i]Remastered[/i] edition is what was made available for PS4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch users not long ago. We, PC gamers (who already own the original Mark of the Ninja), can get this version free-of-charge in our library.\n\nThere's not much to say, really. I do not have a 4K display so this higher resolution I cannot enjoy. Compressed in-game art or not the original already looked very good. But the creators confirmed this will give us an enhanced experience even under 1080p resolution. \n\nWell, I did complete the game once again as this is how much I love MoN. I recommend that you do the same.\n\nPS: It may be possible that you are required to have the special edition of the original version to get the remastered version.\n- -This game is like the combination of old PC sidescroller like Duke Nukem (pre-3d), NES Contra, and arcade Metal Slug with 80s /90s cyberpunk and action movie tropes.\n-The cheesy humor, plot, and music is top notch. Might look like a shallow nostalgia at a glance but once you played it, they even spiritually nailed the silliness of similar games/story in that era. The guns, the character acting and lines, the costume design, etc.\n-It's not as fast paced as I thought it would be. But actually that makes it relaxing to play. Easy to get into and the challenge is just right for me without being frustrating. \n-I like how the enemies and characters are pretty diverse. \n-I haven't finished the game but I feel like this game will have similar replay value like Streets of Rage 4. Not because of there are many things to do or getting better at the game but because it's somehow just simply tight, fun, and arcadey to replay.\n- RPG Maker strikes again!\n\n\"Intergalactic traveler: The Omega Sector\" is one of hundreds of low effort retro-pixel RPG Maker asset/construction kit flips spamming the Steam catalog, made with the RPG Maker video game construction kit... in their own words, \"Our easy to use tools are simple enough for a child.\"  Like all RPG Maker \"games\", this is essentially a bunch of low quality/canned assets from RPG Maker coupled with a cringeworthy high school anime club fan fiction.\n\nAs with all RPG Maker games, the poor quality engine displays badly in fullscreen and doesn't have full HD support or any graphics tweaking options, making this unacceptable for any dedicated modern PC gamer.  The point can be made that the intention of RPG Maker is to make demos and small games to pass around friends, and shouldn't be used for \"professional\" game development.\n\nLike most RPG Maker shovelware and asset flips, the game features extremely low quality copy + pasted 2D retro pixel art, looks awful, and has even worse gameplay.  RPG Maker is an absolutely terrible construction kit, and never results in games of any reasonable quality or value to gamers.\n\nNotably the developer here couldn't work out how to use RPG Maker to make an RPG... and that's the only thing RPG Maker can do properly... except it's not even very good for making RPGs.  Instead, we have a simple 2D top down action/puzzle game where you blip around badly designed and godawfully bad looking mazes.  It's incredible the developer found a way to make RPG Maker even more crap than it is, this is truly a sensational achievement.  \n\nThe poor quality of this game is reflected by how many people spent time with it.  At the time of this review, SteamDB shows the game all-time peak player count was only ONE player.  That's right, only one person ever played this at a time.  When I played this for the purposes of reviewing it, I equalled the peak player count for the game.  OUCH.  The only player activity occurs once or twice a month, presumably someone loading it up to see what it is then quickly uninstalling it.  Considering there's over 120 million gamers on Steam and well over 50,000 games for gamers to choose from (over 9,000 completely free titles), the overwhelming lack of interest in this low quality game is to be expected.\n\n\"Intergalactic traveler: The Omega Sector\" is relatively cheap at $2, but it's not worth it. Given the defects and quality issues with the game, coupled with the unrealistic price, this is impossible to recommend.  Gamers who want a good retro JRPG experience would be better off playing the originals, like Final Fantasy, Star Ocean or Chrono Trigger.\n\n- So, I hated this game at first...\n\n I've never been into a MMO before, and I went into it with a mindset of \"FUCK YEAH! MULTIPLAYER SKYRIM LETS GO\" - In short don't do that. This isn't going to be like playing Skyrim, Oblivion, Morrowind. \n\nIt is when it all comes down to the core an MMO, it's set in Tamriel, it sounds like Tamriel and the storylines feel like an Elder Scrolls game. However being an MMO, it has a lot of grindy MMO style quests. And don't get me wrong, it's bewildering at first, all these mechanics, all these places to go....and before the 'One Tamriel' update if you chose the wrong faction, you were screwed, in a place all on your own surrounded by all these people who are WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY higher level than you. But thankfully they changed all of that. The game scales now, so you can rock up to a dungeon with your level V300 mate, and still have some fun slicing up enemies.\n\nSo I saw a friend playing the other day, and spent a few hours installing this to join him (By the way its like 70 Gig...If you have slow internet prepare for a few days of download), I got back on it after not playing for 14 months, but this time I was playing with a friend who was already Veteran Level 250, So I was in luck, he introduced me to everything and I got used to all the deconstructing of equipment to get my blacksmithing up, showed me about dungeons and bascially got me to enjoy the grind. I think my previous time was a bit lackluster because I got dropped in the middle of the Aldmeri Dominion on my own, without any of my friends. So I left.\n\nNow I know what I'm doing, and keep in mind I usually hate MMO's never played WoW or anything like that, this is the first one. I'm enjoying myself, I'm triple digits into this game time-wise and I don't see it stopping now. We've made a guild for noobies. To help them out, and get them to enjoy the game also. Because the community is nice...but you still get the elitist fucks from any competitive game kicking you out of dungeons because you're only level 14. But you won't get that when you're in a guild, having people to play with and explain all the mechanics did help, a lot. I've even gone as far as to buy this AGAIN on steam just to collect my hours and so on.\n\nAdd-ons are awesome being able to mod basic features of the game to help with information and quality of life improvements is a must. I'll provide an essential mods pack if any of you wish to know.\n\nFor those of you who actually got this far into this, well done. I didn't think I'd keep you captivated long enough to get to the end.\n\nIf any of you are new to the game, on EU server and would like to join a guild to show you the way, add me or visit our [url=www.godsofsalt.com]website[/url] and join us on teamspeak, or just message us in game @diseasedcrow.\n\nBut all in all if you like Elder Scrolls and you think you want to try this, just do, I'm glad I gave it a second chance.\n- [h1]An old classic that's fresher than lots of today's titles.[/h1]\n\n[i]Day of the Tentacle[/i] first launched in 1993. I remember, because I was a teenager then and couldn't play it as my PC didn't meet the minimum requirements! This was actually the sequel to an earlier game, [i]Maniac Mansion[/i], which was released in 1987. I played [i]Maniac Mansion[/i] a few years after it came out, but did not complete it as the game's movement and controls were just too dated and clunky for me (even back then) to be bothered with. \n\nPlaying [i]Maniac Mansion[/i] is not at all necessary in order to enjoy [i]Day of the Tentacle[/i], though those who have will definitely find greater connection to the game's characters, especially the Edison family.\n\n23 years later, [i]Day of the Tentacle Remastered[/i] is essentially the same as it was before, but with sleeker graphics and a more modernised interface. While the story hasn't changed, it surprisingly (or not) hasn't aged one bit either - tentacle mutates and seeks to conquer the world, and only you (and your friends) can stop him! Though straightforward, the game's charm is in its various amusing time travel locations and the weird and wonderful characters you meet along the way. This is a prime example of where [i]\"it's all about the journey, not the destination.\"[/i]\n\n\n[h1]Yays![/h1]\n\n+ Vibrant, colourful, hi-res cartoon-style graphics.\n+ Well-designed rooms, locations and scenery.\n+ Fully voiced, with good voice acting for the most part. (The guy who plays Dr Fred is awesome.)\n+ Interesting, memorable characters.\n+ Fun, amusing story.\n+ Wacky humour.\n+ Clear goals.\n+ Cool easter eggs. (Under \"achievements\".)\n+ Contains a free game ([i]Maniac Mansion[/i])!\n+ Puzzles are mostly enjoyable and require some creative thinking.\n+ Many gameplay hours.\n+ Trading cards.\n\n[h1]Nays.[/h1]\n\n- [url=steamcommunity.com/app/388210/discussions/0/392184522713202518/]Audio starts stuttering[/url] after a while, due to memory problems.\n- Achievements remain hidden, even after the game is completed, so you can't see what you're missing.\n- Some puzzles have illogical or nonsensical solutions.\n- Bugs: e.g. When looking at one of the items, Laverne's voice sounds when Bernard speaks.\n- No mouse command to fast-forward dialogue; instead, you have to press \".\" which is really inconvenient, especially when the whole point of a point-n-click game is to [i]not[/i] have to use your keyboard!\n- Some counter-intuitive puzzle set-ups: E.g. For the videotape puzzle, a button which looks like the \"STOP\" button, is actually the \"RECORD\" button. Anyone who's ever used a VCR or tape recorder would know that the square symbol denotes \"STOP\", while the round button denotes \"RECORD\". \n- Hoagie's periodic belches sound absolutely disgusting!\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nThis was a hugely enjoyable experience from start to finish. Though the nostalgia factor played a part in my case, even if you've never heard of the [i]Maniac Mansion[/i] series, as long as you count yourself a point-n-click adventure game fan, this is a must-play because it just gets so many things right. Add to that the timeless plot and wacky characters, and you have yourself a game that will play just as fresh & new decades down the road.\n\n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [td][u]Disclaimer:[/u] [i]Game played for free, with many thanks to my dear friend [url=steamcommunity.com/id/kflorence]KFlo[/url]. :)[/i][/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n- Normally, I am hard-set on if a game is good, or bad. This game? its in the middle. I mean, a lot of the game is actually really cool, it looks great, it doesn't explain why basically almost every single person is a walking hunk of muscle, but there are some serious flaws. Not just the weird ones like \"kitchen knives break after you stab someone 3 times\" or \"I just ran over an entire sidewalk of people, and the police are nowhere to be found\", but some seriously terrible glitches that make the game unplayable. Such as the whole space-car thing. \"lalala... driving along the road...\" all of the sudden KABAM your car goes flying, hits the ground, explodes, you die, and you get charged money. You use a car to try and get back to where you were going, and BANG same thing happens again. Also, the cops, even though they are extremely spread out and don't appear to have any form of 911 or anything, are nuts with guns. You, who are supposed to be some sort of superultracop, don't even carry a knife. A FREAKING KNIFE. So if you want a gun, you have to kill a police officer, BUT WAIT HE DIDN'T DRAW HIS GUN AND YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE A HOLSTER so you have to wait until another police officer shows up, hope that he tries to shoot you instead of tackling you, and then run up to him while he shoots at you, press f when you are right in front of him, and grab his gun. Meanwhile the entire police force is going to where you are. Thats just how to get a pistol. Whats that? You want a real gun? One that doesn't take 7 shots(literally) to kill a unarmored policeman? Well, you have to hole up in some building, which its hard to find one with an interior, and just keep shooting the police officers when they charge in. Eventually, after maybe 30 officers are dead, they send in their \"elite team\" of guys... with no helmets... no armor other than a vest... and either a shotgun or a submachine gun. The farthest I have gotten to is with these guys dressed in all grey with helmets and assault rifles, they are meant to be the wall, because it can take up to an entire clip of your submachine gun to take one down. Oh, and back to the cars, WHAT THE HECK IS WITH THE CAR ATTACKING. It made me almost fall out of my chair laughing when I realized that I could use my car to \"lunge\" left and right, and take out other cars. I guess the devs didn't know that cars can't drive straight sideways. Your character has no weapons as well, so it looks kinda stupid when you are blocking and punching a bunch of guys with tire irons, knives, and whatnot. Oh yeah, the weapons break after you swing a few times. The game also has weird weapons. You can pick up an umbrella, a purse, heck even a grocery bag, or a take-out box, to use as a weapon, but these things are one use, and deal less damage then a punch. Overall, this game is a little too unrealistic, to the point where it really removes you from the game. Not to mention the glitches, you would think that the \"new and improved\" sleeping dogs would be \"new and improved\" not the horrible, glitchy mess it is now. I really tried to play it, but I just got tired of being gunned down while I am trying to break into a car and start it up, which takes like a good 20 seconds, which is a lot of time when you have 10 cops unloading their bottomless clips at you. I got tired of randomly being flung into space. I got tired of a cop arresting me, and instead of allowing me to break free and whatnot, me and the cop take a \"small adventure\" gliding across the road through cars and buildings. I got tired of a game thats supposed to be fixed and nearly glitchless, when in reality most early access games play better. I am sorry.\n- I love this game. In fact, I've loved it since I was in highschool about 8 years ago. My friend and I used to play this game together all the time on my flashdrive. We were always discussing & trying to understand the ins-&-outs of the game and how to get a specific ending depending on what you did. Playing this brought me back to those good times in that library.\n\nThe OSTs are nostalgic, the gameplay is about the same and the artwork is amazing as ever(actually the graphics are much better with this remake).\nThe only complaint I have is that it lags at random times(though usually in the menu). The original IB on RPGMaker never did that.\nOverall I'm glad I bought this so I could support the Dev and thank them for all those years of entertainment-\nI just wish there wasn't so much lag over an RPGMaker game.\n- This game is for sure not perfect, but worth buying for a specific type of gamer.\n\n[b]What is good in this game?[/b]\n- It has a pretty solid gun gameplay. The movement is quick and polished as well.\n- One level is on average 20 seconds. It's fun to improve your gameplay to get better times in the small levels. \n- It's really a blast getting a perfect run, killing enemies in bullet time or exploiting the enemies weakspots.\n- There is content for around 10-15 hours. Maybe more if you consider going for 100%.\n\n[b]Anyway there are also some flaws: [/b]\n- In Neon White or Ghostrunner the movement and pace through the levels often feels like a perfect choreographic \"dance\"\n- The levels and the areas in Warstride are verry tight. I often lost pace through \"stupid\" placed rocks or small doors.\n- There is not much to explore. The levels are verry linear. While in Neon White it was so much fun to explore shortcuts or other hidden possibilities to improve ur time there are no such mechanics in Warstride at all. I'd love to have some exploration at least in the \"long levels\".\n- It could get repetitive for some players as it's a core element to complete the levels on 5 different difficulties. \n\n[b]Conclusion: [/b]\nIf you like fast paced games like Ghostrunner, Neon White or Doom and you have no problem in repeating short levels several times and u don't except an extraordinary game u will have fun for several hours on a low price.\n\n- Delete the intro.\n\nHonest Edit:\n\n Actually pretty sweet game.  Lots of things I don't like in terms of menu navigation and difficulty curve, but conceptually one of the better games I've played in awhile.  I just wish the controls weren't so poor. Very tedious with doubletap movement to dodge/counter (keyboard)\n\nAlso not very optimized for steam link or the steam controller. In general the worst parts of this game are directly attributed to the fact that this is a port. One of the worst port jobs i've seen to be honest.  Definitely play with a good controller. \n\nThe game also does a poor job of introducing the \"extended\" story, I nearly missed what i would consider the best part of the game just because I stopped after the first round of credits. There is actually a ton more content afterwards. Very worth investing the time into watching everything play out.\n- WHERE ARE MY OG DS FANS OF THIS GAME? REJOICE BRUDDAS!\n\nNo but seriously, I loved this game to DEATH when it first came out on the DS and to now see an HD version of this game on steam. It's quite a whiplash but a good one! To anyone who loves mystery/ detective games, YOU NEED TO GET THIS!!! Good story, soundtrack and gameplay <3 AHHHHHH!!!\n- Cassette Beasts: it's high time we dispel the notion that it's merely a Pokémon clone. Developed by Bytten Studio, this game offers a fresh and exhilarating take on the monster taming genre that stands tall on its own merits. Here, we'll dive into what makes Cassette Beasts so unique and why it's a complete masterpiece.\n\nA Unique Twist on Monster Taming:\nAt first glance, some may draw parallels between Cassette Beasts and the Pokémon franchise. After all, both involve capturing and battling creatures, but Cassette Beasts distinguishes itself with its innovative \"cassette\" mechanic. Unlike Pokémon, where you simply capture creatures, in Cassette Beasts, you capture abilities and splice them together to create your own unique monster hybrids. This adds a layer of strategy and creativity that sets it apart from the traditional monster taming formula.\n\nA Riveting and Fast-Paced Story:\nOne of Cassette Beasts' most outstanding features is its gripping storyline. From the moment you step into this pixel-art world, you'll find yourself engrossed in a narrative that unfolds at a breakneck pace. The plot is full of unexpected twists, complex characters, and thought-provoking themes that keep you invested from start to finish. It's not just about capturing monsters; it's about uncovering the mysteries of the world and your character's place in it.\n\nChallenge for the Experienced Gamer:\nCassette Beasts doesn't hold your hand. It offers a refreshing challenge for those seeking a more demanding gaming experience. Battles are strategic and require careful planning. The variety of cassette combinations and the dynamic AI make each encounter a thrilling puzzle to solve. It's a game that rewards skill and strategy, keeping even seasoned gamers on their toes.\n\nVisually Stunning Graphics:\nThe game's pixel-art style is a work of art in itself. The attention to detail in every environment, creature design, and character is astounding. Cassette Beasts manages to evoke a sense of nostalgia while still pushing the boundaries of what pixel art can achieve. It's a visual treat that enhances the overall immersion in the game.\n\nA Masterpiece in the Monster Taming Genre:\nIn summary, Cassette Beasts is nothing short of a masterpiece in the monster taming genre. It successfully distances itself from the Pokémon comparisons with its innovative mechanics, and it offers a captivating story, challenging gameplay, and stunning visuals that set a new standard for the genre.\n\nWhile Pokémon may have laid the foundation for monster taming games, Cassette Beasts takes bold steps in its own direction. Bytten Studio's creation deserves recognition for its dedication to delivering an unforgettable gaming experience that stands tall on its own. Cassette Beasts is more than a clone; it's a genre-defining title that has undoubtedly earned its place among gaming greats.\n\n10/10\n- Basically Wizard of Legend, but from a different viewpoint. Same composer, both pixel art, similarly fast paced boss fights with good telegraphs, combos are a little less deliberate, though. Very satisfying build making, with solid build variety. Has couch co-op which is very nice. It has some beautiful pixel art, truly. This game is a feast for the eyes and ears with cutscenes, voice acting, and more. Ok, I just love this game. It's so damn good.\n- This is mostly a worse version of the much better \"Slay the Spire\". Slightly different gameplay (Inscryption has a 'field' and some very limited mechanics from Gwent-like games), but both are deck builders with card alteration and deck probability as a core mechanic. Really expected better from the reviews and a demo that promised more gameplay aspects than seem forthcoming. Not an awful game, and has potential, but it feels like they took a basic card game and never bothered to balance it or build better guidelines for the randomized encounters. \n\nPros\n-Atmosphere is decent\n-Gameplay core is fine and could have promise but is highly random. \n-The 'scale' system works well in concept - winner must be X damage points above the opponent, not a set amount of life. X is too small.\n\nCons\n-'Roguelike' aspects are minimal so far. Even as I get more familiar with gameplay my runs are as likely to end on the first or second map. Grinding the same level doesn't get you anywhere in terms of improvements, since the end game 'summary' is determined by random cards you obtained during your run... which can be very poor. Even then, these seldom show up on future runs in my experience.\n-Few ways to guarantee what cards/powerups you get if you want to focus on any specific type of build. Additionally certain paths are OP, while others are next to worthless. With STS there are far more viable builds, and while some are better than others, most times you could construct one to get you far.\n-Powerups sometimes do nothing (e.g., Instant kill on a card with zero attack is... worthless, but if you add 1 attack it suddenly works), and sometimes create amazing combos.\n-Highly variable battles, often hinging on 1 turn or card draw. Get your top card first? Battle is won. Keep drawing the wrong 'fuel' (card summoning) source? You've lost. Sometimes you'll get 1-2 cards that are a permanent squirrel card, other times you'll need to spend a 1-2 draw actions to even summon a card.\n-Overall atmosphere is interesting, but highly limited and very repetitive. Narrative only changes when you advance and isn't skipable so spending 1 minute each death doing the same death sequence 5 times in a row ruins it. \n-You can't just quit a run. Also the stupid UI that has you click + drag to use the menu system. \n-The room, which functions as your 'rogue-like' element is limited, and once explored is dull. Late 90's graphics, low light. Puzzles are mostly bound by gameplay and even completing a puzzle and adding a card to the pool of possible draws isn't that useful. \n\nThe game needs more features to allow for 'controlled randomness' (e.g., lock certain starting cards for each run, set a preferred powerups/creature type, start encounters with +1-2 cards in hand, expand # of result possibilities, better 'rarity' parity), better permanent powerups (expand past # of \"helper items\" that can be held), scale needs to be larger (once you get the right set-up the game is over the next turn, conversely some scenarios the computer can 'rush' you and a match is over by turn 3-4). Possibly expand # of slots for cards and allow player to have 2 rows, like AI does - would also allow certain powers to be more interesting.\n- tldr:\nits sniper elite 3,5.\nnot all that bad but then i look at good vs bad, bad wins.\nsince valve/steam still cant be bothered to implement a neutral thumb, its thumbs down from me.\nbuy it on sale if you must, not worth an AAA price tag for sure.\n\n--------\n\nsniper elite 4 is what sniper elite 3 should have been.\nthe maps are much bigger, the melee is far better/fluid, the xray cam is how you wanted it to be and it looks and feels overall pretty nice.\n\nso why didnt i like it, no thumbs up?\nbecause it also feels like its an update to sniper elite 3, nothing more and nothing new. at all.\nand there a re few things that really stuck out and which are just a big NONO:\n\n- the campaign is shockingly short. i read in someones review that they finished it in 6 hours. and i needed 10 or 11. disappointing\n\n- multiplayer is medicore.still.\nit feels half done; copied over from sniper elite 3; and i can never play more than 3 rounds before getting bored. \nand i dont think im alone because most of the time you find as average 3 lobbys for team deathmatch game types.\nbut multiplayer being multiplayer, everyone feels different about it so you may disregard this point if you wish.\n\n- the voice acting is one of the worst you will ever hear. the italian mobster you talk to sounds so bad that i literally started laughing.\nthe lady who gives you intructions via radio before each level sounds like someone working at a XXX hotline.\n\n- i have yet to encounter the high praised AI.\nthey are decent, yes, slightly better than sniper elite 3, on close and mid range... but if you actually manage to get to a high vantage point and snipe across the map, say 400,500m+? , (which is extremely rare btw), then the AI fails horribly.\nyou kill 2 people far away, the AI goes into alert and then calls the search off 5 seconds later because the game realizes you are far, far away and the alerted soldiers would need 5 minutes to get to you, kinda.\nso you can snipe at your hearts content, just wait every so often between shots.\ni have actually cleared an entire level that way. i didnt even move, never got spotted and no one ever knew where the shots came from. \nonce everything was dead, i just visited the objective checkpoints.\n\n- a sniping game that considers shots 100m+ \"Long Shots\" .\n... wut?\n\n- one of the things that bugs me most. dont let the big maps fool you. you only can ever go two ways, on one map 3.\nand finally it doesnt matter which way you go because you have to do all checkpoints anyway, which are both ways.\nthe majority of the map is covered with obstacles and terrain that can not be passed/traversed, forcing you on pre-determined paths.\nits a real themepark where you are forced to go where the developers want you to go. \nit becomes painfully obvious when there are high grass patches strategically placed along your way where the devs think that you should hide there because there you have an opportunity to stealth something for a bit.\nthere really is no freedom of choice when it comes to the map,how you approach things etc.\nall you can do is...left or right? and all guns blazing or try to stay semi-hidden.\nmeeh...\n\n- i remember watching a dev stream that introduced the game ,way before release. i already noticed a DLC button in their alpha client. i knew that was a bad sign...\nright after game release i found half of the items locked for DLCs that havent even been released yet.\ntake that plus very short campaign and below medicore multiplayer and you have zero reason to ever buy any DLC. \njust doesnt make any sense. \nwhy would you, what for?\n\n- releasing a game together with seperate dlcs the same day?\ni didnt expect that from rebellion.\nvery.shabby \n\nnow, having ranted like this....it is not a terrible game all together.\ni had fun while it lasted but it does not justify the price tag,ever.\nit could have been so much more but i guess greed and publisher pressure won at the end.\ni was looking forward to it and left disappointed.\n\nthe ending of the campaign already suggests there will be a sniper elite 5 but this time i shall wait until its on an 85% sale.\n- On the Steam Store page for [i]Candle[/i] I saw:\n\n1. The game's description: \"Candle is an adventure with challenging puzzles.\"\n2. The 5 most popular tags for the game: Indie, Adventure, Hand-Drawn, Puzzle & Fantasy\n3. The beautiful screenshots\n4. The 'very positive' reviews\n\nSo I bought it. I should have actually read some of the reviews, though. It turns out [i]Candle[/i] is just another platformer game. Granted, it's a \"puzzle-platformer\" but still a platformer where agility, dexterity and a lot of trial & error are key to finishing the game, although there is some light puzzling involved, as well. I don't like platformers. I also don't like pixel hunting for items, which is what you need to do in [i]Candle[/i] to find all the items you need to advance. You see, some items are almost absorbed in the background and frustratingly hard to spot. So there will be a lot of backtracking, unless you follow a guide, which then kills part of the fun anyway.\n\n[b]In summary, just a friendly warning: if you think [i]Candle[/i] is a beautiful point & click adventure game, like I did, don't be fooled. It's actually a beautiful, frustrating platformer game with some light puzzling.[/b]\n- its in a forest\n- And that's it, after 278 hours of play, the adventure is over... \nThis type of game that you wish you could forget so you could rediscover it like the 1st time, where you discover everything, a bit like a child\nIt's a game made with passion for video games, to tell a story, to make the player laugh too, and to make him a little melancholic or horrified or even sickened sometimes\n\n[u]Divinity OS 2 will have marked my young adult life[/u], like Sonic and megadrive games, Pokémon, FFTactics, Zelda and gameboy / gamecube games, Warcraft3 (TT), or Mass Effect and other PC games did in my childhood and adolescence (I surely forget so much excellent games)\n\nIt's a 20/20 for me. The work is titanic. The game is really made with passion. The studio is very talented.\n\nSo when Steam asks me [i]\"Do you recommend this game\"[/i], I say:\nYes! Because this is where you feel that video games are an experience, an adventure to live! \nI went through Rivellion with my buddy, like I went through Kanto (Pokémon), or Ivalice in FF Tactics as a kid!\n\n\n[u][b]Atmosphere:[/b][/u]\nMany of us probably remember our adventures in Pokémon or other games in our childhood. We roamed, discovered and lived in these worlds!\n\nHere, it's the same thing, and not alone this time: I was with a very good friend! \nWe met frequently to venture into the world of Divinity as a lightning lizard warrior or a skeletal assassin with a mysterious past...\n\nWith our companions Lohse and Ifan, and Maladie, and Gareth, and Jahan and Han the survivor kid and Sir Lora and so many others. Impossible to forget... \n[i]They exist! Stop lying, I know they exist ![/i]\n\nOur choices were important: We decided to do justice to this or that person, provoking reactions (or death) in certain characters, slapping a few Magisters around when necessary\nAnd of course, we STRONGLY decided to stea... Borrow a lot of spells and equipments from the merchants, while the other one was distracting by chatting...\n... What? We didn't have the money and we had to save the world ! Well, we had the money, but you never know, maybe one day we will need it... !\nAnd then stealing, it's fun. And exhilarating hehehe\n\n\n[u][b]Gameplay:[/b][/u]\nA 3D tactical turn-based game, to play with friends. Really ! Don't play this game alone, I'm sure that with at least 1 buddy (or 3!), you will exploit the game to its full potential!\n\nAlso, [u]you can change your skills and class at any moment in the game[/u], it's very flexible ! I played rogue all my game, and in the last chapiter, I decided to play with spear and War skills ! I really enjoyed being able to switch like this, as I want ! The game want you to take FUN, not \"suffering\" your \"bad\" class choices !\n\nToo bad, I don't know anyone who is ready to take on the role of a GM (Game Master), to live a personalized campaign! Because it is a mode apart from the main campaign!\n\n\n[u][b]Music:[/b][/u]\nExtremely good and fits perfectly with the atmosphere of the game. This kind of OST that we listen to when we work and that makes us live our adventures again when the song becomes EPIC!\n\n\n[u][b]In summary:[/b][/u]\nTitanic content, assured re-playability for those who wish to know what would have happened if they had answered something else than \"FIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT\", and I repeat, the fact of being able to play with friends makes the game so much more pleasant to do!\n\n\n[b]*Sob*[/b]\nBut no, I'm not crying... I'm just allergic to emotions!\n\nI would like so much to forget this game to be able to rediscover it\n\nPlease play it, at least give it a try, and let yourself be immersed in Div's world!\n\nIn our case, we will do it again in HARDCORE mode !\n\nPeace guys !\n- They shadow dropped an update that literally breaks the game and DLC, and for what? Ads.... ads for RS+\n\nNo wonder piracy is the answer in this day and age when stupid business decisions like this are implemented. If I were to write a review a week ago I'd of said yes and recommended this, but this is just another shovel of dirt in the company's deep DEEEEEEEP hole of failures. I'm officially done with Ubisoft because of this. This was a great gateway to learning guitar and even the CDLC made it possible to learn songs that aren't even apart of the + library.\n\nSomeone please get to making a pirated copy of this game with all DLC as that will sell better than anything ubi throws out and it'll be free at that.\n- This is less of a review and more of me gushing about how much im enjoying myself, but you can still get a idea of what the game is from it. I am not usually a puzzle game player, or even a \"chill\" game player. im usually all about quick shooters, fighters, and platformers, but i decided to give this game a shot and i am very glad i did. with a mechanic as simple as pushing trees i thought that it would be simple enough for me to have a good time, the last time i played a puzzle game was BaBa is You and i put 14 hours into it and never got past word 3, it was just too much for me. but this game manages to still be challenging even with it laying all the pieces out in front of me, it introduces new features not by putting one in a level and saying good luck, it makes you do something you have done before but gives a new outcome, because you never got to do that thing in that exact way before, and when puzzles start requiring you to do those things you wonder how you ever got that far without doing one of those things before. all of the mechanics and solutions also are based in logic, all your doing is pushing things, so you dont have to suspend your current understanding of things to learn a new mechanic. The world of the game is also very relaxing and sucks me right in, its a museum of the \"past\" of humans that takes place in the far future from the perspective of monsters who dont really understand human culture, and it is hilarious! the music is very chill and moves with your actions, when you push something in a specific way the music also does a specific things, and its part of the reason this game is so relaxing. most other puzzle games i have played frustrate me when i get stuck on a puzzle for a long time, but seeing the monster relax helps me relax and keep a level head to get to the next museum exhibit. i dont know how to end this review but if you read it i hope you dont feel like i wasted your time!\n- *LOOK INTO SAFETY/SECURITY RISKS BEFORE BUYING THIS GAME*\n\n     Playing this game online can be risky as hackers are able find your IP address, mess with your in-game / weapons / health / money, find out your personal information, install rats on your PC & even get into your computer. Although this isn't super common it's still a legitimate thing that people need to know about & should look into before spending their money on this game. It doesn't happen as much to random players but Streamers have to play this game in offline mode whenever they stream themselves playing otherwise the hackers will mess with whatever they're doing by trying to get them banned. \nPlease google \"Black ops 3 PC security risks 2022\". It really is a shame that Treyarch isn't coming back to fix this very serious problem in their game, but let's be real Activision  more than likely isn't letting them. \n\nTL;DR: Be cautious of potential security issues, but I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes Call of Duty Zombies / zombies in general or who wants to get into the Call of Duty Zombies franchise.\n\nNow for my review:\n     Best call of duty game ever for Zombies. Definitely can be a challenge to find multiplayer matches nowadays but zombie matches aren't hard to find as long as you're playing the \"popular\" maps. The \"less popular\" maps are more difficult to find a match on but it's still possible, especially if you search for a match at the right time of day. This goes for multiplayer as well, if you search for a match during specific times you will be more likely to find matches (I'm not entirely sure when these times are so I wont even leave my guess here). This is likely because of people in different time-zones getting up / getting off work or school and getting on the game.\n     This game is the best thing to ever happen to the Zombies series in terms of gameplay, storyline, progression & more. There are endless tasks, items & surprises in each map that keep you coming back for more and having a different experience each time! It truly is a wonderful & fun game that has offered me more re-play ability than any other game I've ever experienced, especially with custom zombies/mod tools. With community made maps there's literally endless maps/levels to play on, & because of mod tools we not only have the remakes that come with Zombies Chronicles but we also have the visually stunning remakes of Mob of the Dead, Call of the Dead & Town, with Buried as well as Die Rise on the way for 2023/2024! I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes Call of Duty Zombies / zombies in general or who wants to get into the Call of Duty Zombies franchise.\n- I am a 43 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he helped me. Loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.\nThank you <3\n- The fact that this VN used to be the highest rated game that hasn't been released outside Japan until, well, it was released outside Japan says it all. A must-buy position for every VN enthusiast and an insteresting position for any other player. Criminally underplayed (~55% of purchased copies haven't been started yet), true hidden gem. Consider buying it when on sale.\n- I would describe this game as a 'befriending sim' with a very shallow veneer of farming/resource gathering/'witchy' activities. The farming/mining/fishing is nowhere near as fun or sophisticated as other games e.g. Stardew Valley. And there are no customisation options - even very shallow ones - to make the game experience your own, e.g. the layout of your farm and buildings can't be changed or decorated, there's no home decoration, no character customisation or clothing options. So the game feels very linear and daily tasks are repetitive and grind-y. There's also a dearth of special/seasonal occasions which adds to the repetition.\n\nAnd even though this game majors on the social/befriending angle, which is largely ok, it still doesn't feel quite right. You can get to be 'good friends' with a character and they still repeat dialogue asking if you've met their family members (of course you have) and/or your character asks them really basic getting-to-know-you type questions that previous cutscenes have already answered. The voice acting is great though.\n\nI think this game would have been a lot better had it been done as an all-out graphic novel/choices matter game, and dropped the farming etc. As it is, it's a jack of all trades and master of none.\n- Do yourself a favor if you get eye-strain or nauseated from the forced motion blur and/or the chromatic aberration and go to %appdata%/Local/FinchGame/Saved/Config/WindowsNoEditor and open the \"Engine.ini\" file and copy in the following:\n\n[/Script/Engine.RendererSettings]\nr.SceneColorFringe.Max=0\nr.DefaultFeature.MotionBlur=0\n\nThis will disable both effects which in my case completely removed any strain I was having.\n- First, there was Guitar Hero. Now you've got Guitar Nero. \n\nIt's wild that this came out of nowhere, because this is easily one of the best games I've ever played. This is what I've been waiting for rhythm games to be like since Space Channel 5 on Dreamcast.\n- So um, I don't usually write reviews like this or much at all really. I mostly make unfunny jokes and call it a review or something super generic. I guess I'll just write whats on my mind.\n\nI really liked this game.\nI felt like I was a kid again playing Super Mario 64.\nSometimes I get tired of shooting guns. Or slashing fantasy monsters with some shiny sword. Or saving the magic land from evil. Or using hyper combos I never remember. Or collecting resources to build a quirky town. Or time managing some distant farm. Or driving some tricked out vehicles. Or investing in status points to make super strong characters. Or following a long and convoluted plot with crazy lore.\n\nSometimes I just wanna run and jump around while I pick up some cool looking stuff.\nI, uh, had a lot fun playing this game. \nThanks.\n- Not what the developers promised.\nFeels like a graphics mod for Chivalry.\n\nI'm not a fan of Chivalry either. I had some fun with it, but couldn't bear the clunkiness and wished for intuitive controls and realistic fights. Mordhau promised exactly that. \nAlthough it's equally clunky und even more buggy.\n\nAlso it doesn't offer the option to play in private rooms with your friends (duel mode) or only on paid servers. Inviting a friend to a local match should be a standard feature.\n\nAll the new content and features don't really matter - it's a PvP fighting game. I need only a couple of weapons that work, not 100+ that don't.\n- Launch controversy aside, what this game should have been called for the longest time is 'Early Access'. Around the time of the Beyond update is when I'd say would have been the true 'launch'. \n\nI didn't get this when it first came out, but even when I did it was a fragmented mess of a game. Now, finally, with the Beyond and Synthesis updates there's a solid game here that's almost (but not quite) like what Sean Murray promised way back at the beginning.\n\nPerformance on PC has dramatically improved with the switch over to the Vulkan API, and it finally supports Ultrawide and various other PC-specific options. The game itself provides a significant amount of variety, offering a combination of Elite-lite and 'Minecraft in Space' mechanics. There's plenty to see and do, and the exploration aspect is enjoyable - if a little bland. The planetary biomes and overall game could still do with further diversity, but there's plenty here to get to your teeth into.\n\nHello Games show no sign of slowing down their support for the game either, having just recently released a bizarre in-game music synthesizer of all things, and going by the evidence of their progress to date I can only see the game improving further as time moves on.\n\nEDIT - 24/09/2020 \"Origins\" Patch: well, you can ignore the previous comments about diversity being a bit on the low side. They already added things like living ships, derelicts, space creatures and robots since I made this review, and with the Origins patch the variety of experience on offer is on such a scale now that I don't think I'm going to be lacking for things to do for some time. Also, impressively, the game runs even better than it did when I originally posted this - and the rejigged UI looks fantastic on Ultrawide. \n\nBrilliant work by the team at Hello Games. I can't think of any game I've played (and I've been indulging since the late 80's) where I've ever gone from \"I can't stand this\" to \"this is one of my favourite games\". It's taken a while to get here, but No Man's Sky is definitely one of the greats.\n- I even set a calendar reminder so that I could get this on release. I wish I hadn't bothered. Going great guns until I got to the passage. Game over as I can't progress. Tried allsorts to drop the jammer but unable to do so. I guess it is a case of waiting for all the bugs to get resolved.\n- It is a total eyegasm with a captivating story/lore. If you're even a tiny bit interested in anything f*cked-up and mysterious (SCP-like), buy this.\n\nFrom the gameplay perspective, it is simply good. Nothing mind-blowing, but good nonetheless.\n\nI've completed the game with a couple of sidequests (there are more for me) in about 13 hours, and there are two story DLC + the Expeditions mode, so I anticipate at least another 10+ hours of gameplay. Which is great for the price.\n\nUpdate: I've put in ~10 more hours to complete the Foundation DLC. It is a good DLC, and brings a few more hours of joy living in this world. It also has some sick areas (like that dark cave with the TV). The overall design is a bit more dull, but I enjoyed the story.\n- Okay this is a weird situation. I personally don't like this game all that much, but I do still recommend it nonetheless. That's because despite me not being personally huge on it, I can't deny that it is a very well-crafted game that definitely will give people the experience they want if this is the type of game they're looking for. I, turns out, am not part of the crowd that is targeted for said experience. I just found the whole trial and error stealth RTS style of this game to just not be my cup of tea, but again I can't deny its very well-crafted. I also think the art style and voice acting and story are all very well done as well. So yeah, if you're fond of games of this type, then go for it. I'm sure you won't be disappointed. I, for one, don't think I'm entirely sold on it though.\n- 1 week before release i played the demo, it was a 20 minutes demo that was very underwhelming, but i still thought i should give the game a chance to see if it gets better later on.\n\nIt doesn't.\n\nSo the first thing i read about this game in the embed of the steam link was \"a fresh take on the jrpg genre\", and its probably the biggest problem of the game. It is really the most basic, mediocre turn base combat you can find.\n\nTurn base combat, rock paper scissor elemental types plus physical, materia base skills with few spots (i had only 4 skills activated),  no gear, no party. Does that sound like a fresh take to you?\n\nSo if the gameplay is so barebones it means is at least hard right? Well no, it is basic and easy. The start is easy, in the mid part they blow up the HP of enemies so you understand you should buy new skills, and once you do it the game is easy again. Mob enemies are generally harder than bosses because you are 1vs3 most of the time, while in bosses you can just debuff it and make it slow, while you have 2 turns to spam healings and hitting. There also some questionable decisions on the minor mechanics of the combat system but i don't think they matter (see some paragraphs below)\n\nNow here is what is really the \"fresh take\": the setting being cyberpunk. Everything is written with tech terminology. The mana is called data, block and delay turn is called cache, melee combat is called hack? some of the terms don't even make sense of what they actually do. Also because we obviously live in a technological society we have people called \"V-sync\" or \"Nullpointer\", expresions like \"Digits!\" or \"Oh my grind!\", you know, normal behaviour if you ask me.\n\nThe story is pretty standard for a futuristic setting, it wasn't bad but also it wasn't good, pretty normal.\n\nThe artstyle is cool, the music is generally cool, which i think its why most people would don't mind the boring gameplay and will just play for the story, which is also present in the game itself because you have options to either skip every random encounter (yeah we have those here) or to insta win every battle when you want it.\n\nSo if you want to try this game because of the \"fresh take in the jrpg genre\" you will be disappointed, if you have played jrpgs before there is nothing new in this game, you have already played it before.\n- The game is a masterpiece, just like the first one. After finishing PoE 1, I immediately started with the second one and I was treated to another marvel of a game. Here are some of my thoughts:\n\nThe Good:\n-Very good main story but the side content is what made this game great\n-Interesting and deep characters, both new ones and some returning from the first game, including companions\n-The story picks up after the events of the first game and is a direct continuation of the first game (just like with Baldur’s Gate 1 and 2)\n-If you still have the savegame-files from the first game, your decisions and consequences from the first game will carry over\n-There is so much lore, if you are into reading and listening to stories\n-A lot of voice-acting\n-A lot of pets you can collect and the equipped one has a small benefit to your party\n-Interesting races and sub-races, each with its own boons and downsides\n-Interesting classes and sub-classes, including the possibility of multi-classes\n-You can retrain your characters\n-You can make a new character to join your party at any time at tavern\n-Item and weapon diversity (including pistols)\n-You have the option to play the game as either turn-based (like divinity original sin) or real time (with game pause, just like Baldur’s Gate)\n-You can sail the seas as a pirate and attack any ship you meet without consequence. The ships on the map will respawn endlessly so you will never run out, which makes them a real great source of income.\n-Besides the ship you are given at the beginning, there are a few others you can buy. Each has its own benefits\n-Ship, crew and sailing require some management, but if you like this sort of stuff you can get real invested in it \n-Exploring the map by ship, if you are into that kind of stuff\n-When engaging other ships, you have a choice between boarding or naval combat\n-Endurance is no longer a thing so you only need to manage your Health during fights. You will like this if you were not a big fan of the Endurance vs Health system from the first game\n-The resting system has improved. Besides taverns, now you can rest anywhere you want as long as you have food\n-No inventory management is necessary. Your inventory is infinite so just pick everything up because sooner or later you might need things like explosives, potions, tools etc.\n-Choice matters, and boy are there a lot of different paths you can choose from\n-Romance options\n-Bounties are fun and offer good experience and money\n-DLCs are a bit shorter than the one from the first game, but they are just as good (will not describe them to avoid spoilers)\n\nThe Bad:\n-Loading screens are too long and too many\n-Just like in the first game, I reached max level at about 2/3 of the game(max level 20) so any experience gathered beyond that was pointless. By the end of the game could have easily reached level 30 if that was a thing\n-Naval combat is scripted, so it might not be as spectacular as you might imagine\n-Exploring islands on foot isn’t so much fun\n-The idea of factions might not be to everyone’s liking\n-After playing for a few hours, the game performance seems to decrease and my pc struggled with running it. Maybe the game has an optimization problem but it’s possibly that this one is on me and the game is fine. This might not be the case for other users.\n\nAdvice:\n-In the beginning of the game, try to reach Neketaka asap and do as many quests there as you can before heading out on your ship exploring the seas\n-Pick everything up. Your inventory space is infinite and you will end up needing diverse items like explosives, traps, tools etc.\n-Always have tools with you: hammer and chisel, prybar, lockpicks, grappling hook. You will really need them from time to time\n-Plundering other ships is a great source of experience, resources and money but be careful not to burn yourself out if you do it for too long\n-If you get stuck on a quest, just do some online research\n-Invest money in your ship and crew as soon as you can\n-Always have a tank and healer in the party\n-Make sure to diversify the skills of your party. It’s always good to have someone with Mechanics, Religion, Athletics or Diplomacy most of all\n-Enchant your items\n-When you get the white/grey colored legendary items, make sure to bind them to the character you equip them on and do the mini-quests inscribed on them to unlock new powers and features\n-Use summons, as they are great for distracting enemies. They can take a lot of hits and also dish it out\n\nMy game experience:\nI played on the classic (normal) difficulty, just like I do with every new game I start, and found the game not very hard but fun. I played the game in real time, because turn-based takes too long. As soon as I got my first ship working, I sailed to Neketaka, found the last companions I knew I wanted on my permanent team (Maia and Pallegina) and just quested away in the city until I had enough money and levels under my belt to start exploring the seas and attack other ships. I never did the scripted naval combat because I was having too much fun boarding the ships and watch my characters fight. My party consisted of my Watcher (Moon Godlike, Chanter, specced in summoning), Eder (because he’s a beast of a tank and has some fun interactions with others), Xoti (gotta have a healer, she’s also fun to have around), Maia Rua (very good ranged DPS and she comes with a pet cause she’s a ranger) and Pallegina, who is an excellent off-tank and support character. Once I took to the seas, I made my fortune by plundering ships, equipped my ship and characters with the best money could buy and then just catered to the different existing factions in the Deadfire, while not loosing sight of my main mission.\n\nI had a great time playing Pillars of Eternity 1 and 2. I consider they offer some great replay value and are great fun if you are into this style of RPG games. If you are a fan of games like the Baldur’s Gate, Icewind Dale, Diablo, Dragon Age, Neverwinter Nights and Divinity Original Sin series, you must try PoE 1 and 2.\nI really hope they make Pillars of Eternity 3.\n\n- Before I continue writing my review on this game, I got to say that the PC port of Valkyria Chronicles is one of the best, if not, [u]the[/u] best port. The game was originally exclusive for the PlayStation 3 back in 2008. The game was well received, but garnered low sales that would put the sequels Valkyria Chronicles 2 and 3 on the PSP. I actually never heard of this game before until a few week prior to the PC release on November 2014. That said, I will have to give a standing ovation to Sega for putting an effort to make the PC port well optimized in 1080p (or more) at 60 FPS (or more). Sega has my attention and I will present this review.\n \nValkyria Chronicles focuses on Welkin Gunther, a son of a legendary general who fought in the First Europan War, leads a platoon of some adults and teenage volunteers to defend their country against the invading forces of the Imperial Alliance. The game presents a mix of tactical strategy and third-person action that is very unique in the strategy game genre. Does this game deserve your attention? \n\nThe story takes place in a “fictional” European continent where the Second Europan War was fought primarily between the Atlantic Federation (think of all of the European countries, in a geographical sense) versus the Imperial Alliance (Russia, in a geographic sense). Gallia is a “neutral” country where it contains a unique resource known as Ragnite. Thus, the Imperial Alliance invade Gallia to get Ragnite to fuel up their war resources. One of the greatest parts about the game is how well the developers use analogies from World War II into the game and its execution is well-received. The analogies ranged from weapon designs (like the Gallian Scout weapons that look like the Soviet SVT-40 to the Imperial weaponry comparison to the real-life MP40 and STG44, and plenty others). The analogy extends to vehicles and geopolitical conflicts. \n\nThe character developments in the game are highly impressive, particularly with the relationship between Welkin (protagonist) and Alicia Melchiott (deuteragonist). The themes in Valkyria Chronicles consist a good mix of “light” moments (like hope as an example) and “semi-grotesque” themes of war (such as discrimination/racism, personal ambition over soldiers’ lives, and others themes that will unravel later on). Some reviewers criticized the game as being not serious on the themes about war. Honestly, I don’t think that the game is supposed to be depressing and a good mix between “light” and “dark” is best suited for the game. The story starts really slow in the beginning and actually begin to progress as you reach a certain point in the story. The plot is pretty good in most area while few scenes are a bit “awkward” in terms of sudden shifts between a sad event to a “positive motivation”. \n\nThe gameplay in Valkyria Chronicles is turn-based, but it is very unique because once you click on a character to choose, you can actually control the character to move to any location in third-person you like as long you have enough Action Points (basically, the movement bar). Experience points and money are earned by Ranks (like A, B, C, and D) by completing an objective within a certain number of turns (Example: Getting a ‘A’ rank within 3 turns or less to get the maximum amount of exp and money). However, it is possible that you can actually kill all of the enemies on the map, complete the objective, and still get an ‘A’ rank in the majority of missions (except for a few of them). \n\nWith the exp and money, you train your soldiers based on classes Scout, Shocktrooper, Lancer (Anti-Tank/Explosives), Engineers, and Sniper rather than individuals. The money are used up to upgrade weapons, buy tank parts, and purchasing “reports” from a reporter in certain chapters in the story. The game would last you a good 30-50 hours if you play the game in a smart, tactical manner or have an “OCD” on getting an “A” rank on every single mission in the story or a mix of both (like I did). \n\nThe game does have some faults, particularly when it comes to classes. Reviewers argued that Scouts are too overpowered, but in my view, it is best to say that scouts are too reliable since they have the most movement bar and top-tier weapons like the ZM Kar 8 (the game's version of Soviet PTRS-41 that can obliterate any enemy, even medium and heavy tanks if you shoot it in the back). Engineers are useless in the game since you won’t repair your tank very often (depending on your play style) and Scouts are the better alternative. There are some bugs in the game that is related to the monitor refresh rate (if you play it on a 144 Hz monitor like I did) in certain missions in the story. PC controls are a bit awkward when you control the tank. There are a few moments in the story that has some poor “transitions” (an example would be that an upsetting moment happened in the story and all of a sudden, some of the major characters wanted a medal for their part on a major battle in the next cutscene as if that upsetting moment never happen or affected them). \n\nThe game is often compared to XCOM when it comes to gameplay. This may be true, but Valkyria Chronicles is very unique since you can actually control the character in third person instead of the computer doing it for you when you command the character to move from Point A to B, in bird’s eye view. The game engine is very aesthetic and presents the story very well. I’m glad the Sega released Valkyria Chronicles to the PC and I am very pleased to hear that a (possible) new Valkyria Chronicles game is being trademarked (and hopefully in development) thanks to the PC sales. The default price of $20 is a good deal, -50% off is a great deal, -75% is a perfect steal. Valkyria Chronicles is one of my top games for 2014 due to its unique strategy gameplay and superb PC port optimization. I am looking forward for the new game that is being trademarked (or possible PC ports or revamp for VC2 and 3). This game has my highest recommendation for any strategy gamer who want to find something original, unique, and beautiful.\n- unprofessional review:\n\nits a really deep lore kind of game, very cool!\nit has some horror and grinding elements which i always love\ni havent finished the game just yet tho \nthe visuals are very cute\nas soon as i bought it was hooked!\noke theres many more but im to lazy to type :joy:\n\nover all ill give it a 10/10\nvery interesting lore wise\n- Originally a Skyrim mod known for its story and interesting main driving mechanic is made 100 times better here by having its own fleshed out art style and textures, deeper story and characters\n- Quite possibly the worst game ever.  The menus and navigation appear to have been designed to deliberately confuse the player.  At no point is there any guidance as to what the player should be doing.  Free roam is fun, but the driving physics are nonexistent.  \n\nInstruction comes in the form of a tiny text readout for a complicated step, and is never repeated or accessible.\n\nMost frustrating of all?  Its impossible to just simply quit the game without messing with the entire interface in a while goose chase for a way to exit the application.  I finally settled on ctrl-alt-del, but the game even withstood an end task and simply kept playing.  Had to hard boot my computer.\n\nTotal garbage.\n- This is a story about relationships.\nThis is a story about opposites.\nThis is a story about reflections.\nThis is a story about redemption.\nThis is a story about damnation.\nThis is a story about reconciliation.\nThis is a story about gods.\nThis is a story about paradoxes.\nThis is a story about love.\nThis is a story about hate.\nThis is a story about life.\nThis is a story about death.\nThis is a story about forgiveness.\nThis is a story about condemnation.\nThis is a story about time and time loops.\nThis is a story about multiverse theory.\nThis is a story about murder.\nThis is a story about betrayal.\nThis is a story about trust.\nThis is a story about freedom.\nThis is a story about happiness.\nThis is a story about sadness.\nThis is a story about boredom.\nThis is a story about a Princess.\nThis is a story about what looks like a Frog at one point.\n\nThis is a story about everything and nothing.  A poem and a screed.\n\nIt begins with a simple instruction: Go kill the Princess, and a simple choice: will you kill her, will you free her, or simply walk away?  Oh, you can also decide to let her remain a prisoner; choosing to do essentially nothing is still a choice.\n\nIt ends with a question: who is she?  Also, who are you?  More importantly, what are you to one another?\n\nThis review also ends with a question: \"Should you buy this game?\" and an answer: \"Hell yes, you should!\"\n- It was a nice little trip, about 8 hours of gameplay (A bit more if you feel like grinding)\nStory went along nicely from start to end, in no place felt rushed.All sidequest can be done as you progress on the story.\nCombat is nice, and gotta apply every mechanic you had learnt about to fight the final boss.\nThe music, both in fights and background is really nice, has some nice Cyber-future feel\nRecommended? Yes. \nRating 9/10. Hoping for DLC or sequel soon enough\n- Pretty fun and polished for a fast paced shooter.\nOn the technical side, the game ran well and I encountered very few bugs: in a few cases I got stuck in the level geometry, but then a failsafe teleported me back to a safe spot after a few seconds, and in another case I got softlocked by a broken level trigger but reloading the last checkpoint fixed it.\nAll the weapons are fairly useful and interesting, and they can be combined in creative ways instead of the extremely boring \"use A on B\" seen in Doom Eternal.\nEnemy variety is pretty good, even the lowest tiers are different enough to require a bit of attention.\nThe levels also aren't bad, but you have so much mobility that it's easy to sequence break by accident and in some cases skip past large chunks of them.\nSecrets aren't terrible, no wall humping required in this game, but given the sheer size of most levels they can be pretty tedious to find even when no attempt is made to hide them: in some cases, the opposite is true and you'll just walk into a \"secret\" by looking to your side as you follow the intended path.\nDifficulty is odd: I was playing on Street Cleaner (the middle of the 5 difficulty levels), and around the halfway point the game went from \"very easy\" to \"very hard\", with plenty of attacks dealing 300+ damage when the most you can stack is 200 health and 200 armor.\nAt least, the augments you collect in-game and the mutators you unlock by finding secrets offer plenty of ways to fine-tune the difficulty level: for example, you can enable infinite ammo and instagib to breeze through even the hardest difficulty, or disable all weapons but your chainsaw leg and triple enemy spawns to turn even the easiest difficulty into a bit of a challenge.\nFinally, there's a level editor and that's always nice.\n\nWorth playing, even at full price.\n- A dude looked at you funny? Punch him. Some guy is chilling by the river? Kick him in. A girl has a cute outfit on? Divekick her from across the street. Bought pizza at a food truck? Uppercut the staff. Violence is never the answer; It is in fact the question, and the answer is YES.\n- I bought the game and the mechanics are fun! The battle system is super impactful and just FEELS fun. It really gives you a sense of satisfaction. And it has interesting elements that really every game should have... but the UI sucks, the classes are genderlocked, and there are so many systems going on at once it's annoying. Like something as simple as a constant notification in the middle of the screen of some other person or random guild you know nothing about doing quests or getting skill points. It's a fun game, but has WAAAY too many minor (except genderlocked classes. Genderlock is never a minor thing) problems that just add up making it annoying to play\n- Why did i get this game???\n\nWell.. Mainly because i've always liked seeing those big trucks driving by me, So i wondered what it would feel like driving a big tractor trailer, And so i got this!\n\nHonestly, I can't say if it's anything like a real truck, But this game does get very very complicating when it comes to parking with your 53' container, And it makes me wonder, Wow! Those guys must really have some good practice! Because if i can't do it here, I for sure wont be able to do it in real life! xD\n\nMultiplayer is super fun as well, Driving next to other truck drivers and then honking at them, or meeting new friends, SOME actually truck drivers, and then traveling with them, Stopping to weight your freight, getting gas and such, It's a very fun experience.\n\nHonest Rating: 10/10 As of right now, Because I feel like i haven't played enough to experience any problems or bugs, But the game is very fun!! ***ONLY IF YOU LOVE SIMULATOR GAMES, If you don't, Then maybe think twice, But I enjoy simulator games.*** And if you want to give this game a try as your first Simulator game, Then i would recommend it!\n\nRecommendable? Yes, I recommend it to people who want to give Simulator games a try, This is a perfect one. (Or Euro Truck Simulator) Although if you're from the USA i recommend this one, Because Euro Truck Simulator has different driving rules than US, So you might get tickets for some things you don't know lol..\n- When reading reviews for this game you'll generally find two camps. There are people who find DW:U incredibly deep and engaging, and there are those who find it incredibly obtuse and frustrating. The problem is they're both right. The game does feature a wealth of features, and you will almost certainly never experience them.\n\nEven for a player like me who is used to impenetrable strategy games like Europa Universalis this was difficult to play. Income see-saws drunkenly from crippling deficit to fabulous surplus and back again depending on what's happening this exact second. Land combat units are jam packed into impossibly tiny UI bars. AI factions have reams of vague, undefined character traits. The encyclopedia technically gives information on everything but is so poorly organized and unsearchable as to verge on useless.\n\nWith time, practice, and a lot of time spent researching on independent websites you can have fun with this game. But for sixty dollars you shouldn't have to, and quite frankly, don't. Find yourself one of the many excellent 4Xs in the store and pass over this ambitious but ultimately flawed gem.\n- [I received this product for free from a giveaway]. Only played for a short time, but sheesh, it's a bit of a mess both visually and gameplay wise. There's not much I can really say that would differ from what's shown in the trailer (rather crude MS-paint looking drawings with a few short looping backgrounds). You jump when moving right or left, flappy-bird esque, you dodge stuff going across the screen and from the top, which is a bit boring to me, but some may enjoy it more. You also have to go out of the screen to dodge sometimes, but also if you go too far out (who knows how far) you'll die as well. It might be an okay time waster for free (like old flash games), but I wouldn't recommend spending your money on this.\n- 🎃 Tя!cked not Tяeated 🎃 full price $29.99 you can only play a 10 min Light Version. I had hoped that was a joke? I tried Steam \"Offline\" mode still blocked me from Full Monty 18+ XP Room 👎🏻\n\nSteam Refunded 😩 see discussions click 💭 icon\n\n⚪️ $29.99 is greedy money grab for no sex play content.\n⚪️ We can't get anyone to answer back how we buy 18+ Version.\n⚪️ I can see from the Web Site they have a Mobile VR Truck just for Sensual VR and look to now be renting rooms in popular restaurants around Germany. \n\nI honestly believe until the DEV's of this game have fully exhausted it's Euro revenue stream from VR Room Rentals and VR Mobile Truck. They will not sell us the public it's 18+ XP Room from it's Web Site.  \n\nNote to Publisher: Anything less than changing this to a Free Demo from all the above I've stated.  Then you don't belong on steam store.\n- This now classic arcade made history as being one of the first twin-stick shooters that employed 3D arenas in an interesting manner - this was an important addition to the shmup genre, which really blew me away as a developer working in the same genre. But this also brought a problem: the gameplay was made harder by the 3D rotating camera. \n \nIt impacts overall visibility and the clarity of collision between the player and the enemies. Also, the game is often late with its warnings to the player related to the incoming appearance of enemies.\n \nThis makes the player die occasionally not because of their own error but due to visual glitches. \n \nI personally didn't like the upgrades because I found it unclear in what ways are they affecting the gameplay and they didn’t really help me achieve higher scores. \nOther noteworthy features include 12 battle modes including Paciﬁsm, King, Claustrophobia and 4 all-new modes, but also the local co-op.\n \nOverall this is an interesting addition to Geometry Wars franchise, but Geometry Wars 2 still sits on the throne. If you are a GW fan, I would recommend this game because it shines in all other aspects. \n\nIf you are looking for other interesting shooter games, I would like to invite you to check our community group on Steam:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/593680\n\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/593680/Rocking_Pilot/\n- No additional account, no unnecessary launcher, no denuvo, no epic exclusivity, no microtransactions, just a video game as it always should be..\n\n【グループB】\n- Oh boy. This is a beautiful game. There's unlockable items, a hidden boss, lots of enemies, and characters that change your play styles. Numerous ways to make the game accessible for you!\n\nBut is the game fun? I'd say no, the game was just ok. I wasn't really solving puzzles so much dealing with a RNG generator. Ironically the bosses felt slower and more boring than the levels, they are a battle of patience, wait until the potions fall - hit them 3 or 4 times - repeat.\n\nWould I revisit this game after some patches or dlc? No, probably not. Unfortunately I think this game has some base design problems and not content or quality problems.\n- Blows every single PFS game of the last decade out of the water, even those shitty D**M games that people who never played FPS games before seems to worship in order to look cool. Smooth and fast gameplay with a lot of variety. Great visuals even on medium/high settings. Story and writing is shit but pretty much on the same level as rest of the Borderlands series with the exception of the Telltale one. Writing has always been the worst part of the series, dont be delusional retards.\n- Steins;Gate Elite is a great Visual Novel when looked at in isolation. The main problem is that Steins;Gate (the original) exists. I don't mind the difference in art styles, that is a matter of personal preference anyway. Graphics in Elite are a lot more animated, images in the original are more static but also more detailed. What I have an issue with is the missing parts in the story.\n\nThere are a few situations where Elite eliminates choices when compared to the original. I won't spoil details, but in one of the early chapters you can choose to ignore or answer a phone call, leading to alternate branches in the story (they join again soon after, but each branch still contains unique content). Well, you can choose in the original. In Elite, you automatically answer the phone, the other branch is no longer in the game.\n\nAt a later point in the game, I noticed that quite a sizeable chunk of a previously linear story progression (not even an alternate branch) concerning Faris was completely cut out. Again, I won't spoil details in case you just want to decide which version of the game to get and don't know the story yet. It has been some time since I played the original, so I might have missed more instances of missing story parts, but at least this one part was really obvious.\n\nThe missing branches and parts are not really relevant to the overall story, but you probably want them if you want to know more about the characters. Elite is more streamlined, but at least all of the alternate endings are still here. So while there is missing stuff compared to the original, there is quite a bit more when compared to the anime. Then again, the anime added more story after the true ending of the original game. I was hoping that Elite added (and maybe fleshed out) this extra content as well, but no luck here, Elite ends at the same point as the original.\n\nIf you don't mind the art style of the original, play that one instead. The second game (Steins;Gate 0) only exists in it's original form anyway. Elite might still be worth it if heavily discounted since it is the only way to get the \"free\" Linear Bounded Phenogram. You can justify it as buying LBP and getting Elite as a free extra.\n- So, I've been playing games for 36 year now. All the genres, like them all. Most of all RPG, turn based strategies, WW2 shooters (BF) etc. And just achieved victory in Slay the spire, after 206 hours of hugely enjoyable play. I would say this is in top 5 games of all times for me. Maybe even top 2, together with Card Hunter. Those two games are so far the two games I would take to a deserted island. I am actually seriously considering making my own card based game in the future. So just try this. Even my 10 year old son loves it. I just recorded The Slaying for him xD\n- Absolutely amazing. PLEASE don't judge this game based on how it looks. You must try it yourself! I thought it would be terrible but a friend convinced me to try it, and I'm glad he did. I haven't had so much fun in a game in a long time.\n- When I first heard of Undertale, I had no interest in playing it. I thought the fanbase was massively cringeworthy and the game was probably uninteresting. \nI was correct about the fanbase, but boy was I wrong about the game. \n\nI normally play action/adventure RPG games with the occasional sprinkling of singleplayer FPS. I am not the kind of person to normally go in for conceptual hipster nonsense, and I say that because that's what I thought this game was. \n\nIn reality, it has some of the best atmosphere and writing I've seen in a game in a very long time. And above all else, it manages to be heart-rendingly (no pun indended) sad at times and actually funny at other times. Plus, the music is fantastic and the whole package has a level of care I don't often see anymore. \n\nYou are doing yourself a disservice if you don't try this game out. And I don't say that lightly. \n\nStory/writing: 10\nMusic: 8\nReplay value: 7\nGameplay: 6 for the actual fun of it, but I'll give it a 7 just because of how inventive the mercy system is. This is an RPG you can play without killing anything. \n\n- Mori's 3-Part Review:\n1. Bare minimum information and recommendations to improve your playthrough\n2. Background information on me and my playthrough\n3. More extensive non-spoiler reactions\n \nPart 1: Recommendations for You\nIf you're like me and you try to get all the extra scene dialogue, then please, if you take nothing else from this, give yourself time to play this game yourself. There is actually so much content here, I really want you all to take your time to experience it as you go. The game is just too long to binge in a reasonably short amount of time, and if you do binge, you're going to lose a lot.\n \nMy recommendations:\n1. Give yourself time to play the game. Let it sink in, and take notes- it'll be rewarded. The game is literally too dense and too long to binge reasonably if you like 100%ing.\n \n2. Get invested in the characters and pay attention to them, not just the (admittedly stellar) mysteries.\n \n3. Explore the game, its mechanics, and its dialogue yourself. Don't be afraid to restart a Somnium several times; the more options you pick, the more meaningful information you get.\n \n4. If you're a puzzle lover then try to solve the game yourself. You're going to have a blast if you manage it, and the game has tons of built-in hint systems to make it even easier, fairer, and more fun.\n \n5. Try to go in knowing at little as you can. The marketing has already done a great job. Focus on finishing the game and bringing it all together.\n \n6. On PC, force anti-aliasing on using your graphics card to make the game prettier. Game ran and controlled smoothly with few bugs.\n \n7. You don't need AI1 to play AI2, but I think AI2 does spoil AI1, though you could still enjoy them in reverse order.\n \n7. If you're sensitive to horny then just read less background dialogue in Ryuki side. Gore is pretty toned down, and there isn't any single huge CW.\n \nYou can stop reading now if you don't want your playthrough tainted by my reactions/expectations effected.\n \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nPart 2: Who am I, and how do I play?\nI'm an Uchikoshi fanatic. I've played all his English-translated games, and visual novels are my favorite genre of game. I've played a lot of visuals novels, but Uchizawa's are my favorites. I usually try to 100% complete all the scenes and see all the bonus dialogue. I've also played a lot of other genres of game, and I do like fun gameplay, but the most important things to me tend to be:\n \nA. An interesting story is absolutely what gets me invested\nB. Bunches of novel ideas like unique plot points I haven't seen before, philosophical ideas, or puzzles\nC. Characters that I at least don't actively hate; I can like a game for the above two, but characters still matter\nD. Deep personal connection, usually formed by connections to real people or how a game shaped my life\n \nThose are the ways I rate my top games. For the last 8 years, my top 2 favorite games have been the same:\n \nMy top favorite game of all time is Remember11. I love the plot, the ideas, the twists, the characters, and it's what got me truly invested in Uchikoshi. It's very much a mystery game first with an unravelling mystery and themes I love to explore.\n \nMy second favorite game is Virtue's Last Reward. I love the interactive moral dilemmas. VLR's use of the Prisoner's Dilemma jumpstarted my interested in Philosophy which led me to major in Philosophy. I don't like the characters as much save for a few, but it's still very important to me.\n \nNow, let me tell you how I've played AINI: I've basically been playing non-stop since June 13th.\n \nTake this with a grain of salt because I've been documenting as I play (the average main story playtime seems to be 20-35 hours, with 100% likely taking 50+), but right now, I have 97 hours of playtime. I have not gotten all the dialogue, achievements, or fully explored the abundance of extra mechanics. Instead, I have a 616-page reaction document full of constant laughs, cries, screams, passing out, and most of all love.\n \nPart 3: My Review\nThe R11 #1 and VLR #2 holy duology held true for 8 years. Also, AI1 isn't one of my favorite standalone games; it has huge personal connection for me because of the community and the AI1 ARG, but it wasn't my favorite as a game.\n \nI gave all that background because I want you to take me seriously when I say this:\nAI2 is my new favorite game. The #1 spot has been Easily dethroned.\n \nThe themes, twists, characters, ideas, gameplay, visuals, voice acting, fair mystery, presentation, mechanics, and comedy all of it resonates together perfectly. I don't even tend to value gameplay or visuals, but at many times, this game is fun to play while looking genuinely beautiful and cinematic.\n \nThe story reads like a proper Uchikoshi + Nakazawa return to form. The mystery is fair, interesting, meaningful, and complex told satisfyingly. There are many deep ideas, concepts, and themes utilized in thought-provoking ways.\n \nGameplay-wise, there are tons of mechanics that are utilized to make each Somnium unique; they all feel designed by love, fair, and reflective of the character through gorgeous symbolism. They blow the first game completely out of the water. Each one is its own experience to explore and a visual delight. There are also tons of mechanics for you to discover that make AI2 a fun game to play.\n \nThe animations, voices, and directing are cinematic; this game is actually breathtaking a lot of the time. It's backed up by great and charming character writing- despite the fact Mizuki is my favorite AI1 character with 0 contest, I grew to like much of the AI2 cast the same amount.\n \nAI2 is a story about halves and splitting, but also love and coming together- please, see it through until it's whole. I hope and believe you will all fall in love with AI2 like me; AI2 is all I've ever wanted. AI2 is my dream game come true; it's a gorgeous love letter to all Uchikoshi fans who love Zero Escape's puzzles, Infinity's mysteries, and AI's characters and humor.\n- Holy crap.\n\nPowerful.\n\nThis game explores some serious life issues: Abuse. The pain of childhood, and of parenthood. Manhood and womanhood. Strength. Loss.\n\nThis game had me near crying at several points. The story is freaking powerful. It's also remarkably well written, and downright hilarious at times. \n\nAnd the gameplay? \n\nIt's fun enough that I want to play through it again right after beating it. This turn-based RPG is sometimes brutally difficult, in part because it slaps many old-school conventions in the face (e.g., sleeping can be dangerous). Battles are challenging. Tactical thinking is essential since many enemies are VERY dangerous and you're frequently outnumbered. I really applaud the AI as it keeps you on your toes. \n\nThe game doesn't hold your hand. There is no map, compass, or any attempt to make navigation easier. You just have to remember your way around, though there are plenty of memorable environments. \n\nCharacters will force you to make decisions with lasting consequences. There are dozens of hard choices to make along the journey, which brings me to another topic the game explores: decision. Will you save your friends, or your stuff? I got very attached to the buddies I picked up, only to have them devoured by a mutant, or bail on me when I least expected it. You just never know what you'll face, nor what to choose. Thinking back to many of those times, I don't know what I should have done. All the options sucked. \n\nBut I can't help asking myself, \"Did I make the right choice?\" \n\nHighly recommended.\n- 1 week before release i played the demo, it was a 20 minutes demo that was very underwhelming, but i still thought i should give the game a chance to see if it gets better later on.\n\nIt doesn't.\n\nSo the first thing i read about this game in the embed of the steam link was \"a fresh take on the jrpg genre\", and its probably the biggest problem of the game. It is really the most basic, mediocre turn base combat you can find.\n\nTurn base combat, rock paper scissor elemental types plus physical, materia base skills with few spots (i had only 4 skills activated),  no gear, no party. Does that sound like a fresh take to you?\n\nSo if the gameplay is so barebones it means is at least hard right? Well no, it is basic and easy. The start is easy, in the mid part they blow up the HP of enemies so you understand you should buy new skills, and once you do it the game is easy again. Mob enemies are generally harder than bosses because you are 1vs3 most of the time, while in bosses you can just debuff it and make it slow, while you have 2 turns to spam healings and hitting. There also some questionable decisions on the minor mechanics of the combat system but i don't think they matter (see some paragraphs below)\n\nNow here is what is really the \"fresh take\": the setting being cyberpunk. Everything is written with tech terminology. The mana is called data, block and delay turn is called cache, melee combat is called hack? some of the terms don't even make sense of what they actually do. Also because we obviously live in a technological society we have people called \"V-sync\" or \"Nullpointer\", expresions like \"Digits!\" or \"Oh my grind!\", you know, normal behaviour if you ask me.\n\nThe story is pretty standard for a futuristic setting, it wasn't bad but also it wasn't good, pretty normal.\n\nThe artstyle is cool, the music is generally cool, which i think its why most people would don't mind the boring gameplay and will just play for the story, which is also present in the game itself because you have options to either skip every random encounter (yeah we have those here) or to insta win every battle when you want it.\n\nSo if you want to try this game because of the \"fresh take in the jrpg genre\" you will be disappointed, if you have played jrpgs before there is nothing new in this game, you have already played it before.\n- I am over 50. \nI have played a lot of games.\nThe Return of the Obra Dinn is one of the best games I have ever played.\n\nIt is one of those rare cases (though certainly by design) where everything comes together.  Story, game play, graphics, challenge level, feeling of accomplishment on advancement. Simply an outstanding piece of work that I enjoyed every moment (even when frustrated) and will remember fondly.\n- I've read some of the negative reviews and name calling is petty so instead I'll just say a lot of those opinions are dumb.\n\nLook. This isn't Firewatch. This is a seven year old game that pissed off a lot of bros and continues (apparently, christ) to do so because it embraced not only being a walking simulator but a gay one at that. And yeah bro, 15 bucks seems steep for a game that you can finish in under an hour, but hell, maybe don't speed run? It's a walking simulator after all. Or maybe support indie game devs. *Or maybe* read the Steam tags that say \"short\" and \"walking simulator\" and then don't count that against the game. You don't review CS;GO and say \"not bad, but too much shooting\" right? RIGHT? \n\nLook. I've had some wine. And I've had some feelings. And Gone Home is a piece of video game history whether people want it to be or not. It's a game I wish I would have known about when it was first released. Hell I needed it five years earlier than that. \n\nIf you're pissed that Gone Home wasn't dramatic enough or that it's \"homosexual\" then maybe realize that this game wasn't made for you and that does not qualify it as bad. \n\nAnyway, that cat journal achievement was neat.\n- For a company as big as Amazon, this game is extremely sub par. It feels as though it's in Early Access and some of the recent patch notes are very worrying for the game's future\n\nPros:\n- Stunning gfx. Especially for an MMO, the lighting in particular is amazing\n- Sound track is great and ambience adds personality to the zones\n- Some really cool zones to explore, feels as though you can get lost when you start\n- Controls/Keybinds are already really good imo, I only changed a few\n- Tutorial/Starter Quest chains do a great job of introducing you to the game without being too slow\n- Combat (when it works) Is really fun. Lots of action based fights\n- Wars are a really cool mechanic, they are ultimately flawed but are still a lot of fun\n\nCons:\n- Game is extremely shallow. It is borderline addicting for the first few levels, this soon dies off. When (If) You reach lvl 60, you ask yourself what do you do now?\n- As beautiful as the game is, a lot of it is copy and pasted. Literally. There are zones, towns, dungeons that are almost identical. Ruins immersion\n- Quests are extremely repetitive and boring. They consist of kill mobs, loot mobs, loot chests and that’s about it. No diversity\n- Combat can be laggy, you weapon swap and it doesn’t register sometimes. Wars can be a PowerPoint Presentation at times\n- Guild UI is awful. There is no guild bank, treasury ledger so you cannot monitor who donates money for wars etc. Makes running a guild a nightmare\n- There are countless exploits and duplications that have been abused upsetting economies, player numbers and the general integrity of the game\n- Server population has been decimated since launch leading to many dead servers. They’re merging already\n- There are some very worrying patch notes/future releases that are changing fundamental mechanics of the game. In some cases nerfs which punish players who didn’t rush to level cap\n- Watermark is a stupid progression system for gear. It forces you to run daily elite zone farm chains which get extremely repetitive\n\nIf this was a small indie dev company, I could give them the benefit of the doubt. However this is frickin’ Amazon. This product is totally unacceptable and needs to go back in the oven.\n\n- I bought this game because it was supposed to be like Harvest Moon. I'm now close to finishing an ingame year.\n\n+ The town and art style is very much like Harvest Moon\n+ There are a lot of interesting characters with lovely art to socialize with\n+ The dog is helpful, barking on spots where you could dig out some items\n+ Some events, scenes and dialogues in this game made me smile to no end. This is a happy game.\n\n- You have a farmland of 40 tiles and farm by seeding tile by tile and watering tile by tile. The watering can is your only tool and upgradable to water 3x3 tiles.\n- Friendship is a grind, as is tradition in the genre. I once gifted a whole harvest to a girl without visable change in the 1 to 10 affection meter. After finishing the friendship grind on 3 villagers, the game seemed to reward me with... some random dialogue lines.\n- You can only bind the shovel and watering can. You cannot bind anything else like the brush or milking device or animal fodder. This makes the daily barn work quite nasty.\n\n\nIf you need a Harvest Moon on PC, this isn't what you want. Games like \"Friends of Mineral Town\" had a significantly larger focus on farming simulation. World's Dawn is a small town simulator with a little gardening on the side.\n- You are an astronaut, you wake up in a rescue rocket, and against your wills you are shot from Theseus space station on Chori V planet. After landing on the planet you find a strange device that helps you get back on board and survive until help arrives.\n\nGreat game, get it on sale, because it is a bit short. I like games like Portal 2, The Talos Principle, and there is no point to compare this games, because they are completly different, even if they have few common things like solving riddles and story with fresh look at some philosophical questions. Point is that every one of them including The Swapper is good at what it do, and every one of them is unique. For me it is pleasure to play this game beacause of it atmospheric well done design, riddles and questioning the meaning of existence.\n- Game is super realistic, got ahead of Hamilton and he pitted me into a wall going 180mph, just like real life!\n- Edited\n\nI Didn’t have high expectations for this game. I read the reviews and expected a mediocre game from ubisoft. I was let down big time. I was given a watered down version of Syndicate that had terrible game mechanics.\n\tAs I navigated the first enemy compound I came across it felt difficult to navigate through the grass and between the buildings. Clearly not developed as a stealth game. Once I had given up on the whole stealth aspect of the mission I was very easily able to slaughter all of the guards in the compound. I trying using the bow but it’s hard to use compared to Tomb Raider and Far Cry Primal’s easy to use bow. Sword combat could have been improved but it wasn’t the worst I’ve seen. No skill required, just click the mouse button rapidly to kill all of the guards in your path. The devs clearly didn’t try that hard because they knew that people would by their game anyways because of Ubisoft and Assassin’s Creed fanboys.\n\tAssassin’s Creed: Origins could’ve been an amazing game that would revolutionize the series but no. The devs had to ruin that possibility by being lazy and making a watered down version of Syndicate. I’ve played Syndicate quite a bit and I thought it was a good game. Don’t get this game for the full price or even for $35. Let’s hope Ubisoft gets their shit together and doesn't fuck up Far Cry 5.\n\nThank you for your time.\n- This game vs. HOI3:\n---------------------\n\nAdvantages:\n\n1.) The production system is more interesting and engaging, and far more balanced than the old IC system of HOI3. \n2.) The unit creation system is far more in depth and interesting, featuring many different brigade types and support companies, allowing you to change your divisions however you would like. \n3.) This game is far more stable than HOI3.\n4.) This game is updated regularly and has bugfixes regularly too, with content being added free along with every DLC. \n5.) The modding community of HOI4 is far larger with excellent mods such as Kaiserreich, Millenium Dawn, Red World, and Endseig.\n6.) HOI4 muliplayer is actually playable without making you want to shoot yourself.\n7.) China is no longer something Japan can take within 2 months.\n8.) An actual peace conference system and ideologies that actually impact the game.\n9.) Far easier to get into than HOI3.\n10.) Less railroading and the AI wont spaz if you do something ahistorical.\n11.) Planes are no longer as cancer as they used to be.\n12.) Far less micromanagement if you choose not to want to micro.\n13.) A better tutorial (still not a great one though.)\n\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n1.) The research system is bare bones in comparison to HOI3.\n2.) The War in the Pacific is basically nonexistant and naval warfare is awful (to be improved with next patch, being released eventually:tm:)\n3.) People dont really join the war in HOI4 unless theyre directly attacked, making continents like South America completely useless due to the fact that none of the countries there ever do anything but still build up their military, contributing lag.\n4.) Due to the game's engine, it can only use a single one of your processing cores, meaning regardless of your computer quality the game will run kinda slowly.\n5.) Speaking of slowly, the game is poorly optimized and frame loss is extremely common, especially 1942 onwards, when majors can have upwards of 300+ divisions. \n6.) The AI is often braindead, doing hilariously incompetent things such as charging endlessly into your lines, removing all its troops from your front, leaving major areas completely undefended, and completely ignoring the aerial aspect of the war.\n7.) Specific AI are even more braindead than the rest, specifically island nations, or nations that otherwise need to use navies and airforces more. Yes, the Japanese, American, and British AI are some of the worst in the game. In a WW2 game. \n8.) Your allies are completely useless and often you will find yourself doing all the fighting yourself, or even being hindered by your own allies. Playing as Germany the Italians likely wont place a single division in North Africa. In D-Day, you will either be the only one contributing anything or your allies will contribute so much that the supply is ruined and your troops all die of attrition. As the USSR you will recieve 0 lend lease, and as China you will get absolutely no support from the west. \n9.) HOI3 is a lot cheaper than HOI4\n\n\nOther things which I feel are worth mentioning but arent really advantages or disadvantages:\n\n1.) HOI4 contains a lot more alt-history options, which while not for everyone, are fun to try out. \n2.) The focus-tree system is something completely different from anything in HOI3.\n3.) The game has a less in-depth OOB(Order of Battle), which while to some people is nice because theyre bad with OOB, others dislike. Specifically this game lacks corps. \n4.) The battle-planning system of HOI4, while easier to use than the one in HOI3, is still flawwed. In HOI3 it did absolutely nothing, but in this game it is a core part of playing. Unless you want to mircomanage every single division, like you did in HOI3, you will use this system. \n5.) While simpler, the game still possesses a learning curve.\n\n------------------------\n\nOverall: \n\nHOI4 is a far less grounded and historical experience than HOI3. Is this a good or bad thing? That depends on your perspective. HOI4 obviously has significant advantages over HOI3 in certain areas but many consider HOI3 to be an overall better game. Personally I recommend HOI3 if you want a more micro-intensive, historical experience, and HOI4 if you want to just sit back and relax for a couple hours murdering millions of people. \n\nPersonally I would suggest either game, but thats just me.\n- When reading reviews for this game you'll generally find two camps. There are people who find DW:U incredibly deep and engaging, and there are those who find it incredibly obtuse and frustrating. The problem is they're both right. The game does feature a wealth of features, and you will almost certainly never experience them.\n\nEven for a player like me who is used to impenetrable strategy games like Europa Universalis this was difficult to play. Income see-saws drunkenly from crippling deficit to fabulous surplus and back again depending on what's happening this exact second. Land combat units are jam packed into impossibly tiny UI bars. AI factions have reams of vague, undefined character traits. The encyclopedia technically gives information on everything but is so poorly organized and unsearchable as to verge on useless.\n\nWith time, practice, and a lot of time spent researching on independent websites you can have fun with this game. But for sixty dollars you shouldn't have to, and quite frankly, don't. Find yourself one of the many excellent 4Xs in the store and pass over this ambitious but ultimately flawed gem.\n- Playing this game instantly brought back memories of me playing TMNT, Battletoads, Double Dragon, and Streets of Rage, with my little brother on the NES and Sega Genesis in the early 90s. Luckily this game doesn’t feature TMNT’s ridiculous water level or Battletoads' sadistic peed bike level. The graphics are perfect, the controls are great, the soundtrack is awesome (especially the Wu-Tang stage, and the Shredder stage), and the levels and overworld map are fun to navigate. I’ve played through the story mode with all 7 characters and have played through the arcade mode multiple times solo and many times in multiplayer and I’ve enjoyed every bit of it. This game is so much fun.\n\nThere are a few things I wish existed though. I wish there were more playable characters. I wish that you did not lose your 7 character’s progress in story mode when you start a new game. I wish you could see the difficulty level of the online arcade game you are joining. I wish there were cumulative stats you could see for arcade and story mode that showed the number of times you completed a stage, how many enemies you knocked out, objects you’ve destroyed, stage times, combo streaks, times taunted, etc. I wish you could create your own turtle and assigned moves, specials, jumps, taunts, and colors.\n- I purposefully went into this game looking for bugs, seeing that it was in early access, and I have yet to find any. The only reason I stopped playing was because there was a fence that wasn't fully secured to the ground that I was able to get underneath, allowing me to get out of bounds. This lead to me falling into an area where I couldn't get out, and it wouldn't let me respawn at my most recent checkpoint. This would mean I'd have to start from the beginning, which I very much didn't want to do. Anyway, the biggest tips I can give to the developers is to make sure the map is 100% how they want it, and to make the audio design better. That's it. I may come back and change my review in the future.\n\nFINAL RATING: 4 / 10\n- In my personal opinion,Total War Warhammer 3 is better than its predecessor in every way.\n\nFactions:\nThey did an excellent job t fine tuning the older factions to the point where every faction now feels fully fleshed out and playable. The starting units are fun and the starting areas are usually in a better position. Sure, some factions start off in a really awkward ass places with really strong armies surrounding them, but overall, everything feels much more thought out.\n\nThe new factions they added to this game are fun altho for someone who might be just getting into the game, id recommend going with someone like Grand Cathay and move on from there.\n\nMap:\nThe world map is huge and i love it. The battle fields you fight in are detailed and look absolutely stunning. Fights look like movies sometimes so grab some popcorn and watch your armies die since you were munching on popcorn and not moving your units.\n\nRTS:\nthe RTS side of this game is what got the biggest improvement in my opinion. Everything is so much more clear and the battles just look insanely good. The game feels a bit more fast phase which i don't mind at all since WH2 felt like a battle of attrition sometimes and missile infantry seemed really bad.\n\nOverall i can safely say this i my favorite game currently. The multiplayer is super fun but judging by the reviews some of you leave on this game, its safe to say you have no friends to play with. \n\nDLC might cost bit more than it used to but people will complain about anything if its not free.\n- If I could get my money back, I would. AI as usual is hot garbage, cant even take turns without getting LITERALLY BODIED by the AI drivers. The new progression system really sucks. Cool that they wanted to try something different, but I really dont feel like leveling every god damn car in the game just to modify it. If you wanted multiple of same car you would have to level those duplicate cars you purchase. My experience with the physics is just... eh. I mean I sure do love loosing grip just from barely tapping the gas. Constantly fighting my wheel just to stay stable. Driving its probably fine for controller players, I wouldnt on wheel. Credits are only used to buy cars now. Also kinda runs like crap. All i wanted was a Gran Turismo on PC and this... this is not it. Game is mid, move on me thinks.\n\nEdit: I put in a request for a refund and Valve did indeed approve it. I thought I was over the time limit for sure. Don't be me and spend 100 USD for early access. Thanks Valve, you're the best!\n- While still a work very much in progress, Nuclear Throne is currently one of my favorite games. It's a roguelike dungeon crawler with heavy \"bullet-hell\" elements and a little RPG sprinkled on top. When you begin a session of Nuclear Throne, you choose from one of several well-designed & freakish \"mutants\", each with their own special attributes which, in itself, does much to add variety (there's also a random-select option which is a fun idea in this particular case). The goal of each stage is to exterminate all of the enemies. After doing so, a portal opens which takes your mutant freak to the next level. There are a great many weapons with which to inflict meyhem on your adversaries. As you gain experience points, in the form of green goo earned by killing enemies & also found in cache jars, you'll be able to choose new persistent perks for your character (such as more HP or certain weapons doing more damage). Every so-often, you'll encounter a boss. The bosses tend to pop in during the height of an already-in-progress battle which makes beating them all-the-more difficult & hectic.\n\nOriginally, this game did not have controller support which was a great disappointment (though I had been ejoying it anyway, using the keyboard and mouse). However, a recent update rectified this and the gameplay using a dual-analog controller (such as that of the Xbox 360) is just fantastic. Like Ultratron before it (another very similar game which is also worth a look; I also wrote a review for it, if you're interested in checking it out), Nuclear Throne throws you straight back to the arcades of yore and plops you in front of a Smash TV cabinet.\n\nAs a roguelike dungeon-crawler, the replay value is extremely high (due to the fact that the level and enemy layout is totally different from one session to the next). The rather extreme difficulty doesn't hurt either, as playing entails dying and thus restarting... a lot. Fortunately, said difficulty isn't of the variety that compels you to smash your controller/keyboard in frustration. Every death feels like the fault lay squarely on *your* shoulders (if only you had moved to dodge a little faster or conserved ammo a little better!), as opposed to the game feeling like it's cheating. Another stand-out feature which I think I need to bring up is the soundtrack. ...Just wow! Nuclear Throne's score is totally original and extremely surreal. It goes *miles* in lending its own atmosphere to the game. \n\nSome might consider the current price of $12.99 to be just a *little* steep for a game in this class, but considering how well it's made overall and the fun I've gotten from it (especially being in its currently pre-release/beta state), I consider it to be well worth the price. As of the time of this writing, the developer(s) is very active and updates are coming quite frequently.\n\nUPDATE 01/12/16: I hadn't played this game in quite a while (at least 6+ months) and I wanted to check out the progress that the devs have made, etc. Well... The game starts but as soon as I select a character, it totally locks up. I can't play it at all. To make matters worse, I've heard that the devs have since \"abandoned\" development of this game (so it's not likely that whatever is causing the crashes for me is going to be fixed any time soon - or ever). Bummer man. I loved this game...\n- Yes, the Origin client is somewhere between annoying and broken, depending on your hardware. And yes, Dragon Age Keep is still a big jumble of poorly explained choices that affect your game in a thousand little ways if you choose to use it. And yeah, none of the old technical issues really got fixed before coming to steam - this isn't a remaster - so shiny hair and lips for everyone.\n\nBut it's nice to be able to take a walk in Thedas again, and sink into the story, and admire what is probably the last real Bioware game before EA completely turned them into another ouroboros of live service bullshit. \n\nGet it on sale, for the nostalgia if nothing else.\n- ---{ Graphics }---\n☐ You forget what reality is\n☐ Beautiful\n☐ Good\n☐ Decent\n☐ Bad\n☑ Don‘t look too long at it\n☐ MS-DOS\n\n---{ Gameplay }---\n☐ Very good\n☐ Good\n☐ It's just gameplay\n☑ Mehh\n☐ Watch paint dry instead\n☐ Just don't\n\n---{ Audio }---\n☑ Eargasm\n☐ Very good\n☐ Good\n☐ Not too bad\n☐ Bad\n☐ I'm now deaf\n\n---{ Audience }---\n☑ Kids\n☑ Teens\n☑ Adults\n☑ Grandma\n\n---{ PC Requirements }---\n☑ Check if you can run paint\n☐ Potato\n☐ Decent\n☐ Fast\n☐ Rich boi\n☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{ Difficulty }---\n☐ Just press 'W'\n☐ Easy\n☐ Easy to learn / Hard to master\n☐ Significant brain usage\n☑ Difficult\n☐ Dark Souls\n\n---{ Grind }---\n☐ Nothing to grind\n☑ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n☐ Isn't necessary to progress\n☐ Average grind level\n☐ Too much grind\n☐ You'll need a second life for grinding\n\n---{ Story }---\n☑ No Story\n☐ Some lore\n☐ Average\n☐ Good\n☐ Lovely\n☐ It'll replace your life\n\n---{ Game Time }---\n☑ Long enough for a cup of coffee\n☐ Short\n☐ Average\n☐ Long\n☐ To infinity and beyond\n\n---{ Price }---\n☐ It's free!\n☐ Worth the price\n☐ If it's on sale\n☐ If u have some spare money left\n☐ Not recommended\n☑ You could also just burn your money\n\n---{ Bugs }---\n☐ Never heard of\n☐ Minor bugs\n☐ Can get annoying\n☐ ARK: Survival Evolved\n☑ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n---{ ? / 10 }---\n☐ 1\n☑ 2\n☐ 3\n☐ 4\n☐ 5\n☐ 6\n☐ 7\n☐ 8\n☐ 9\n☐ 10\n\n\n\n\n- Playing this game for the first time six years after its initial release proved to be a delight in disguise. With all the memes and jokes established, I was finally able to understand what the fuss was all about back in 2011. Despite not having the best gameplay, story or graphics out there, something about this title just made me want to finish every quest I deemed worth completing. \n\n9/10 - mods recommended\n- People in the reviews don't understand this game.\n\n1. This is not Final Fantasy Tactics and it has a good reason for it.\n2. They barely removed any skills compared to the previous version and you will find most of those \"lost\" skills integrated into new skills or mechanics while certain broken mechanics were removed for a good reason. They also made things more challenging which i see as a welcome change. Things are also generally more viable and that is never a bad thing.\n3. You don't need to grind in this game, so why do i see people bring up grinding? Sure there's 40 weapon levels but in the endgame you get max level after like a couple battles if you really feel like you need to grind it out. In the previous version you had to level up a ton of different skills and some of them went up very slowly so there's actually a lot less grinding in this one.\n4. The reason you're struggling with doing damage is not because the game is bad, it's because you're not looking at what your equipment does or you don't understand it. The attack value in weapons is a base value which is used to penetrate your targets armor. It makes sense to do 1 damage against a person wearing heavy armor if you're firing an arrow at them. All the various boosts that you get in this game are applied to the damage you do AFTER you penetrate your targets armor. In order to do real damage to heavily armored targets you need to either use the right kind of weapon to attack them or make use of the new elemental system since now every character has an element that can be used to deal more damage OR you can simply apply a debuff to them since debuffs affect their defensive value directly. So yes this is not a game where you always win by rushing at your enemy and pressing attack. You have to understand how the game works and going through that process has been incredibly fun for me.\n5. You don't need to worry about those permanent stat gain cards or leveling your unit in a certain class to get the best possible stats. What you get from doing that isn't really going to make a difference if you're not playing well enough BUT if you really want to have a super powerful godlike unit, this game still allows it through those mechanics.\n6. The buff cards on the field are also not something you're required to make use of to beat the game, they're just there to make the battlefields more interesting and a way to make boss-characters stronger without directly cheating their stats.\n7. They removed random battles but you don't need random battles for anything because you can recruit units in the various long dungeons or simply go back in time to recruit a specific unit from any level in the postgame.\n\nIn summary it's a game that requires you to think a little bit but as you understand more you can also make things that seemed underwhelming at first viable because you found a way to make use of them. The story is also integrated into the gameplay so it's easy to keep interested in it especially since you get to make choices that affect both the story and gameplay. As a remake it definitely feels like they remade the game completely as it's so different from all the original versions. It's not for everyone and it doesn't have to be but hopefully the enjoyers of games like FFT or fire emblem will not dismiss this because of the reviews since this might become one of your favorite rpgs if you just bother to look into it without wanting it to be a cheap remake. It's too easy to jump into conclusions when we live in a world filled with terrible \"remakes\" popping up each year. This is all so ironic too as the spirit of this game when it comes to the story and gameplay alike is that you will never truly win by jumping into conclusions and there will always be something you didn't consider.\n\nUpdate: Replying to comments and addressing things for people who are familiar with the originals: \n\nI don't think they took away anything so vital that it would ruin the game. I can't really think of anything important other than the rogue class myself. You can call it removal but I'd rather say that they moved a lot of stuff to a different place from the list of skills and changed a lot of them to better fit the new card system and the new skill/spell limits. \n\nYes in my original review I didn't mention anything about the skill limit being reduced from 8 to 4. I think this change mostly just made the game easier to understand and when it comes to strategy I don't think anything was lost. You were going to use those extra 4 skill slots for things like strengthen or spellcraft either way and with the new scouting system moving around 8 skills before each encounter would probably be a little tedious (as it already feels tedious to setup units with the current system). \n\nAnd when it comes to spells, I simply can't understand why I would want to have access to more or all equipable spells as it would result in casters being a lot stronger than what they are supposed to be. This also makes each caster class more defined instead of them just being some kind of upgrades of each other so that a lategame class like the shaman can be a lot less useful in certain situations than your starting mage class because they don't have access to debuff spells but in return they hit super hard with their damaging spells.\n\nWhat else did they remove? They reworked the weird elemental system  into something that's always in play and I find this change very welcome as it adds another layer of strategy to the game especially through finishers and equipment bonuses even for non-spellcasters (but is still a little weird to get the hang of at first). They removed spell scrolls... yeah i probably dont have to mention why I see that as a good thing as well.\n\nAnd sure you can dislike these changes but we have to remember that steam reviews are black and white. Posting a negative review based on a subjective change is indistinguishable from saying \"this game is trash don't even look at it\" when it comes to statistics which is what everyone first sees when they open the store page of a game. \n\nI'm completely on the same page with you about playing your own favorite version, whatever you prefer and I myself would like to mess around more with things like One Vision in the future. But imo giving this game a negative review is also bad for the reputation of other versions of tactics ogre.\n\nAnd ofc the game is definitely not perfect there's still imbalances and some skills are pretty underwhelming compared to what they used to be (RIP Rampart shadows...). But imo this is better than what I've seen from literally any other game remake ever so I simply can't agree with calling it a bad remake.\n- This review only relates to the single player campaign. At 50 years old I have zero interest in multiplayer.\n\nAfter playing Gears of War 4, I was looking forward to this title. I wasn't disappointed. I found the new upgrade system with Jack enjoyable. The campaign was fun to play with minor exceptions. Graphics, sound, and voice acting were amazing. Campaign took me about 11 hours to beat. I consider that well worth the $60 I paid for the game.\n\nMy only real gripe about the single player campaign:  As a father of 3 girls, I'm all for strong female leading characters. Kait just isn't it, though. I didn't care for her in 4 and that didn't change in 5. For me she seems out of her league and just isn't believable as a team member. She's like Elizabeth Swan, the governor's daughter in Pirates of the Caribbean. She's a kidnapped damsel in distress in one movie, and the Pirate King in the next. It just doesn't work, for me anyway.\n- A Short Hike is a relaxing, casual game about exploring an expansive, mountainous island park and eventually making your way to its summit so you can get cell phone reception.\n\nYou play as Claire, a bird who can climb, glide, and flap to great heights using a stamina system based upon how many golden and silver feathers you’ve collected. Along the path to the mountaintop you’ll encounter Animal Crossing-style characters who are friendly, punny, and usually have some minor task for you to solve, ranging from finding lost items to making deliveries.\n\nHelping residents of the island is completely optional, as is just about every activity in the game other than locating a few feathers and reaching the summit; as a result, length can range from an hour if you don’t stop to smell the roses to a few hours if you decide to make friends with everyone and see all the park has to offer.\n\nActivities include filling out a fishing journal by trading in your catches, digging in suspicious spots, solving treasure map clues, parkour racing, and opening up shortcuts by breaking blocked entrances and watering bouncy flowers. \n\nA Short Hike has a charming aesthetic and a lovely, peaceful soundtrack. I felt driven to see everything the game had to offer despite not being forced into any of it and never lost interest until I did so. It’s a beautiful little world that will make fans of Animal Crossing feel right at home.\n- Two words: Modding Heaven. This is probably one of the most modular games I've ever played. \n\nYou wanna play Mount and Blade in a historical time period instead of Calradia? OK, which one? Don't answer, it doesn't matter, there's probably a mod for it. \n\nWanna add in some magic and play in a fantasy universe? There's mods for that. \n\nHow about a game set in the modern day? Or in a sci-fi universe? Or a post-apocalypse wasteland? Or the Wild West? Or maybe something specific like throwing your hat into the Game of Thrones, or defending the World of Men in Lord of the Rings, or taking over the Empire from Star Wars?\n\nPerhaps you'd like to set sail on the seven seas as a pirate in a nautical adventu-! Oh, wait, OK, there aren't any of -those-. \n\n...but there's mods for all of the others, with even more being made every day! \n\n\nI guarantee, if you buy this and are open to modding your game, you will never go another year without playing Warband. Maybe a week, maybe a few months-- but just when you think you're done with it, you'll find another mod based on your favorite movie series popping up to pull you back in. \n\nIt is worth well above whatever you'll pay for it.\n\n\n- Really fun for the first few rounds... Then the game changes your control scheme without telling you, and with no way to turn it back. This has lead to several hours of frustration, trying to revert it. From what I've read, this is 'intended' to make the game more difficult, but really, is just incredible stupid. If I wanted the game to be more difficult because of a more annoying control scheme, I'd play with a god damn dance pad.\n\nThe game is really fun, but this has frustrated me to the point that I can't enjoy it any more unless it's fixed, and therefore I can't recommend it either\n- My wife left and took the kids\n- unprofessional review:\n\nits a really deep lore kind of game, very cool!\nit has some horror and grinding elements which i always love\ni havent finished the game just yet tho \nthe visuals are very cute\nas soon as i bought it was hooked!\noke theres many more but im to lazy to type :joy:\n\nover all ill give it a 10/10\nvery interesting lore wise\n- Excellent game, but has an awful-abrupt ending that comes out of nowhere and doesnt make sense and leaves way too many plot elements unexplained.\n\nIn the last game they introduce a secret society of energy sucking vampires that are hunting Rosa and Joey yet they are never mentioned again and instead the end of series villian is some random messed up ghost that randomly has end of the world magic powers.\n\nAwful.\n- Great Game, but 70 dollars for a game that was console exclusive for years, then released exclusive to Epic, and finally released to Steam. Don't be greedy Enix.\n- Sticking with the usual air of cool and weird and the usual musical flair, the latest Cosmo D entry changes up the FPS gameplay for a dice rolling RPG with quirky characters and little surprises to be found (and making pizza, of course). Can be beaten in a couple of hours but rewards multiple playthroughs for different gameplay paths and endings that can be mixed up with difficulty modifiers and challenges.\n- Steins;Gate Elite is a great Visual Novel when looked at in isolation. The main problem is that Steins;Gate (the original) exists. I don't mind the difference in art styles, that is a matter of personal preference anyway. Graphics in Elite are a lot more animated, images in the original are more static but also more detailed. What I have an issue with is the missing parts in the story.\n\nThere are a few situations where Elite eliminates choices when compared to the original. I won't spoil details, but in one of the early chapters you can choose to ignore or answer a phone call, leading to alternate branches in the story (they join again soon after, but each branch still contains unique content). Well, you can choose in the original. In Elite, you automatically answer the phone, the other branch is no longer in the game.\n\nAt a later point in the game, I noticed that quite a sizeable chunk of a previously linear story progression (not even an alternate branch) concerning Faris was completely cut out. Again, I won't spoil details in case you just want to decide which version of the game to get and don't know the story yet. It has been some time since I played the original, so I might have missed more instances of missing story parts, but at least this one part was really obvious.\n\nThe missing branches and parts are not really relevant to the overall story, but you probably want them if you want to know more about the characters. Elite is more streamlined, but at least all of the alternate endings are still here. So while there is missing stuff compared to the original, there is quite a bit more when compared to the anime. Then again, the anime added more story after the true ending of the original game. I was hoping that Elite added (and maybe fleshed out) this extra content as well, but no luck here, Elite ends at the same point as the original.\n\nIf you don't mind the art style of the original, play that one instead. The second game (Steins;Gate 0) only exists in it's original form anyway. Elite might still be worth it if heavily discounted since it is the only way to get the \"free\" Linear Bounded Phenogram. You can justify it as buying LBP and getting Elite as a free extra.\n- I like furry art, but first and foremost im a RPG gamer, and as such I will rend judgment impartially. \n\nThe story is not bad, but still falls in the average category and it is predictable, gameplay is the same as the first Fuga (I have no problems there) but there are few new enemies,  so the strategy to beat the regular battles is very repetitive. My biggest complain remains the same since Tail Concerto and it is the dificulty... which is way too easy, there is no hard / nightmare mode for veteran players, Im not asking to die repeatedly like in dark souls but Cyberconnect2 needs to understand some players like a challenge in their games.\n\nMusic is ok and Hack is the best character of the lot (Tah tah tah tah  taaah!!!!!) I would play Fuga 3 just for him.\n\nIt pains me to give the thumbs down, but Cyberconnect2 needs to work a little harder.\n- [h1]SMOOTH RIDING WITH A FEW BUMPY ROADS[/h1]\n\nFirst off, I am going to get this out of the way. If you are planning to buy this game and wondering which version to get, ask yourself this. If you are a minimalist, standard is fine. If you want the expansions, get ultimate. Deluxe on the other hand I think is worth skipping entirely. If $99.99 is too much for you for Ultimate, just wait for a sale. Ultimate is definitely my choice for recommendation. The amount of content you get is impressive and worth the price of admission. \n\nForza Horizon 4 is a car collector's dream, with a roster of over 700 cars (with Ultimate). And also a racing enthusiasts dream playground with a decently sized map with tons of racing variety and events to play around with. I have tons of racing games on Steam personally, and none have held my interest as much as Forza Horizon 4. It's a shame though that this came so late to Steam. But even still, I got my money's worth with over 120 hours of playtime at the time of writing this. \n\nIs Forza Horizon 4 perfect though? Sadly, it is not. The Steam version is hampered with some unfortunate bugs. People may experience random crashes, which while not happening often after the last few updates, still do happen, as this game is a few versions behind the Microsoft store's own version. Something I don't know if will ever be fully fixed. Also online racing can be hit or miss with issues. Those issues usually lie in the wait times sadly, so it might be offputting for those looking to race with others. Luckily there is more than enough content without having to do online races to keep most people happy. \n\n I'm still giving this a recommend regardless of that issue, just because more often than not, the game does run smoothly. \n\nIf you happen to just get the standard version of the game you get access to the main map which is a caricatured version of Great Britain, which includes many race events ranging from your standard street races, dirt tracks and even full blown off road events. There are also other events which include speed traps, drifting, massive jumps, promotional events (like racing the Halo Warthog, racing against trains, and more), and some cool little story events like racing for Top Gear, or even opening your own businesses. There's plenty of content for sure. If you decide to get the expansions, you get other maps, including Fortune Island, which is, well, an Island, complete with both low and high altitude locations, lots of off roading, some impressive night time visuals (Aurora Borealis anyone?), and more. You also get the Lego Speed Champions map which is a fun and impressively designed map based on the Lego toys which features it's own variety of fun and unique settings, including a beach riddled with pirate ships, a haunted lighthouse, a stunt arena, and more. Also it gets it's own radio station that plays just 1 song on loop. If you guessed that song is \"Everything is Awesome\", you'd be right, Both expansions also come with a unique way of progression and their own vehicles to collect. Fortune Island will have you progress to unlock a variety of treasure hunts, that each unlock 1 million credits, and the Lego expansion has you doing different tasks to collect studs which can be used to build your house and also collect new cars. Both expansions will also include a majority of the types of events you will be used to in the base game, with their own unique flair. \n\nWith 700 cars luckily there is enough variety for anyone. But for those looking for more, you can custom tune each vehicle to your own liking, with a variety of parts and overhauls, including full blown engine swaps. For those who are not gear heads, the community has you covered and you can even download custom tunes from others. Forza Horizon 4 is one of the most generous racing games I have ever played with the sheer amount of cars they dump on you. You can win cars from events. You can win cars from wheelspins. you can win cars from leveling up. You can win cars from performing certain tasks. You can win cars from barn finds, which are like little treasure hunts. You can also buy cars from both an auto show, or take your chances at an in game auction house, which is also a great way to make money, to well, buy more cars. Basically, Horizon does not let you down with the cars. It's like Pokemon for car lovers. And once you have that dream car, don't forget to give it that unique look. Most cars can have some visual parts swapped out, ranging from spoilers to bumpers and more, and you can add custom designs to the paint jobs too. Want to race around in Jurassic Park Jeep? Want to race around in the Bandit 1 from Smokey and the Bandit? Forza has you covered. And if you just want to look at the cars in all their glory, Forza also has a nice little feature called Forzavista which allows to do things with your car like opening and closing doors, and for some vehicles you can open up trunks and hoods and look inside at the engines. If you get the James Bond pack, you can even look at those nifty little gadgets like the machine guns mounted to some of the Bond vehicles. Pretty neat stuff. \n\nAt the end of the day, is Forza Horizon 4 worth it? I'd say yes.\n- If you are looking for a game that you can never master, here is the game for you.\n- This game is pure art, I enjoyed every second of it. The mechanics are great and the puzzles can get quite challenging. Sadly its only a little over 3 hours of playtime.\n\nOne of the best games I've played in a long time!\n- [b]My playtime:[/b] 14.5h (based on Steam, 100% achievement)\n[b]Grindy Achievement(s):[/b] Yes (1+ achievement).\n[b]Optional Achievement(s):[/b] Yes (33 achievements).\n[b]Difficult Achievement(s):[/b] No.\n\n[h1]Intro[/h1]\nYou wake up in a place you don't recognize. Greeted by a traffic light, you tried to remember what was happening. It turns out that you have a unique ability: reading an object's memory. As unreal as it sounds, [b]UNREAL LIFE[/b] tries to help you make sense of everything through a series of adventures and events.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n- Multiple endings, with variations of bad endings and one true ending\n- Cleverly-executed puzzles\n- Subtle hints in case you're stuck\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n- Unable to skip cutscenes\n- People who have trouble with flashing lights can't fully experience the game\n\n[h1]Should you buy this game?[/h1]\n[b]Yes.[/b]\n[i]If you like to play atmospheric games, buy this at a sale. People who have problems with flashing lights should avoid this game since the game isn't as good as it is with some options turned off.[/i]\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1]In-Depth Review[/h1]\n\n[h3]Visuals[/h3]\nThe developer spends a lot of effort crafting beautiful, quality cutscenes. Some scenes show the beauty of the night sky while others show what the main character is feeling from close range. Food images look so carefully made that I couldn't believe that it was a pixelated image at first. Every scene does a good job in supporting the story, combined with the relaxing music that is running in the background.\n\nBlurry effects are applied on the screen, whether it's just to make a certain area stand out or create a cool-looking effect for the cutscenes. The game relies on a lot of transitions in its cutscenes, some can leave you shocked with the inverted images and flashes of red colors at intense moments. People that have problems with these can soften the red color in the option with the downside of making the scene to be less effective. Moreover, since the option affects all red colors in the game, some scenes will look weird with the faded color.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441881358 \n\n[h3]Story[/h3]\nThe story is a relaxing one, set in a place where people are helpful and empathetic to your actions. Every character gives a positive vibe through their attitude and kindness, supporting you whenever you are down or helping you to enjoy the moment. Reading the interaction between characters warm my heart, especially when accompanied by the relaxing music that is playing in the background.\n\nThe storytelling is wonderfully done with the combination of visuals and music to let you drown in the story. Sometimes, an intense moment kicks in, changing the scenery into one full of effects and transitions. The fast-paced music also helps to set the mood with its upbeat tone, increasing the intensity. The ending is told in a similar manner, although instead of an intense moment, it crafts a touching scene instead that is fit for an ending. Some people will find a small part of the ending not to make any sense, although luckily, it won't affect the overall experience.\n\n[h3]The Game[/h3]\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nThe game is focused on reading memories of an object to progress. Your hidden ability to read an object's memory by touching it will help you to solve various tasks, ranging from looking a lost object to finding a hidden area. There are some limitations though - some objects have no memories that you can read while other objects can't be interacted with until they are discovered. Fortunately, they are quite easy to discover as long as you spam the space button and/or pay attention to the dialogues.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441881785 \n\n[b]Puzzles and Minigames[/b]\nThe rest of the gameplay is focused on the usual adventure games where you have to pick up items and use them to pass through the area. Most problems that you will have to solve has the same theme as the building you are in. It's nice to see how puzzles are related to the corresponding area while still being unique at the same time.\n\nMost puzzles and minigames are easy to solve except for a select few. I found the last one to be the trickiest because not only does it cover a huge area, but it also requires you to use the mechanic from a previous area, something which never happened in other puzzles. It's still easy to solve as long as you are attentive enough, but if you happen to get stuck, the game offers subtle hints in the form of memories that you can read.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441883206 \n\n[b]Length and Replayability[/b]\nI finished the game in 9.7h after experiencing all the bad endings. Although the game only offers one manual save slot, it has an extra checkpoint slot that you can load before the story branches off. A hidden secret can also be found after you finished the game, which might take a long time to find due to its randomness. I found it to be a waste of time though, especially since there isn't much that you can learn from the secret. You'll also be left with more questions than answers, giving more reason not to look for them unless if you are an achievement hunter or the curious type.\n\n[b]Problems[/b]\nDespite the game requires you to restart the game several times, you can't skip the cutscenes. Some parts of the game will lead you to a bad ending and the unskippable cutscenes can take a significant amount of time if you don't know how to bypass it. Moreover, checkpoints tend to be placed minutes before the story branches off, wasting more of your time. Lastly, the game isn't very clear whenever it autosaves your game. I had to save manually whenever I took a break from the game because of this.\n\n[h1]Specs[/h1]\nIntel Core i5-9300H 2.40GHz, 8GB RAM, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nThe game has a lot of elements that complement each other. The nice-looking visuals, the calm and relaxing music that can heat up in intense moments, the superb effect - everything blends well to make the story stands out. The detailed cutscenes are done well to capture the emotion that can't be portrayed with a simple portrait and character animation, while portraits are expressive enough to handle simple expressions. The game is designed with quality in mind and although it can be slow sometimes, the relaxing music helps you to savor the moment.\n\n[quote]This game was reviewed with a key provided by the developer for free through [url=https://discord.gg/xc22zZP]Reviewers' Paradise[/url], a group that connects both developers and reviewers in one place[/quote]\n\n[quote]Visit SaveOrQuit.com for detailed game reviews, posted daily![/quote]\n- While it seems grindy at times, you will probably feel greatly rewarded when you can get enough resolve to spec out a specific build exactly how you want it. I think the progression of the tower abilities and gold gain is great, but even the burdens available don’t seem to switch it up quite enough. I’m on ng+4 and i feel like it’s getting a tad stale. I still like playing it of course. Some classes like the chef make the idea of playing anything else not quite worth it. I’m sure there’s some great niche builds but keep that in mind. Overall, this game keeps you on your toes. If you get hit, it’s almost always because you did something wrong. I LOVE the movement abilities in this game. You can feel like a speed runner with a few hours of practice gliding and jumping. This is a completely different game compared to rogue legacy 1 in all the best ways. 9/10\n- Before you buy: What you enjoy about Her Story (and maybe Telling lies) will very much affect your enjoyment of this game. \n\nIf you enjoyed the acting, the non-linear story telling, and the *movie* part of those games, this will probably be the best in the trilogy. HOWEVER, if you enjoy the detective aspect, the puzzles, the mental challenge, this game is probably not for you.\n\nThe gameplay is a big departure compared to Her Story and Telling Lies, and in my opinion, doesn't make for much of a challenge at all. In the 10 hours I spent on the game, 9 were just me watching clips and clicking random objects in the background. I found the actual movie stuff to be really fun (and especially seeing the process of how movies are made), but that kind of fun is very different to the kind I had with the previous two games.\n\nI don't dislike the game but I don't recommend it either, at least to a decent chunk of the fanbase (those being fans of detective puzzle games).\n- The British Forces give the Allies a bit of the German defensive capacities. It has the problem of adding too many buildings to a game that is, in its core, dynamic and based on movement and aggressiveness instead of turtling. The British units are diverse and interesting, bringing much to the table. \n\nThe DLC lacks a proper campaign for the Brits, unfortunately, even though Caen, Goodwood, Arnhem and Walcheren could have been done in some interesting missions. But, for a game focused on multiplayer, the Tommies are obligatory in everybody's library.\n- The problem with a lot of Steam reviews is that they don't really help you figure out whether you should buy / try the game. So, let me help. You are one of four people:\n\n(1) You've never played a Sam Barlow game before, and you've never played a point-and-click adventure game before. In which case, what's wrong with you?\n\n(2) You've never played a Sam Barlow game, but you have played a point-and-click adventure game before. In which case, you'll definitely know within two hours whether you like this game. But anyways, you're getting a decent bit of stuff for $20.\n\n(3) You've played a Sam Barlow game, and you didn't like it. In which case, you probably won't like this either. It's basically the same thing as Her Story and Telling Lies, but with a different story.\n\n(4) You've played a Sam Barlow game, and you did like it. In which case, you probably will like this too. It's basically the same thing as Her Story and Telling Lies, but with a different story.\n\nI think Immortality had the best story of the three Barlow games, and definitely the best acting and production value.\n- One of the best games I have ever played\n----------------------------------------------\n- Runs really well on most computers\n- Looks great regardless\n- Gameplay is heroin-tier addictive\n- High replay value\n- Big f-ing guns \n- If you like metal this game is for you\n- There isn't much wrong with this game\n- 10/10\n\nFLAWS\n----------------------------------------\n-You have the option to turn the music down\n- WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO DO THAT\n- Undoubtedly one of the best if not THE BEST modern video game remaster out there. I will summarize the pros and cons of this remaster into the following:\n\n[b]The Good:[/b]\n\n- Totally seamless transition into the new modern 4K visual from the old classic Win95 at a push of a key\n- Extremely faithful to the original titles (some might say that it is perhaps TOO faithful)\n- Game \"installation\" screen when you first boot up for both Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert is filled with God tier nostalgia \n- New UI with a complete revamp of the sidebar complete with higher quality artwork that totally feels in place\n- Plethora of never-before-seen bonus contents including exclusive missions and cinematic cutscenes for Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert that was only available on certain console platforms\n- You can queue multiple units while in production now\n- New multiplayer features and service is great. Finally you can now play 1v1 ranked and spectate any previous matches that was played including spectating ongoing games in the lobby\n- You can add, remove and create your very own custom music tracks in-game for both Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert however you want\n- All of Frank Klepacki's overly iconic classical and remixed tracks are here including various modern remixed that was composed solely for this remastered collection!!!\n\n[b]The Bad:[/b]\n\n- Minor bugs (though not a real dealbreaker)\n- The gameplay meta among factions/units remains as unbalanced as ever. Kinda of a tradeoff for being too faithful to the original titles\n- Multiplayer is still officially limited to a maximum of 4 players total per map in Tiberium Dawn, while in Red Alert the limit is a maximum of 8 players total\n- FMV cutscenes are all still heavily compressed in SD resolution extracted from the Playstation home console version and further artificially enhanced via AI upscaling due to the fact that the original master footage tapes for both Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert are still yet to be found\n\n[b]The Kinda Ugly:[/b]\n\n- Certain mission on hard difficulty are completely unbalanced. This is already another insult to injury as the AI blatantly cheats when it comes to resource procurement and unit build time. The fault of a clear lack of playtesting\n- The British Forces give the Allies a bit of the German defensive capacities. It has the problem of adding too many buildings to a game that is, in its core, dynamic and based on movement and aggressiveness instead of turtling. The British units are diverse and interesting, bringing much to the table. \n\nThe DLC lacks a proper campaign for the Brits, unfortunately, even though Caen, Goodwood, Arnhem and Walcheren could have been done in some interesting missions. But, for a game focused on multiplayer, the Tommies are obligatory in everybody's library.\n- Even with over 500 years difference between us, Andreas is one of the most relatable characters I've played this year because I too would rather try to ineffectively solve random mysteries than directly confront my depression.\n- If you want to play D&D but don't have friends, just get this game.\n- This is a passable if grindy 3D first person family friendly farming \"shooter\" with cartoony artwork.  You have a simple \"vacuum\" gun that you use to capture wild critters, throw them into pens, feed them, collect their stuff, sell it, rinse repeat.  \n\nThe implementation here is of high quality and works well on PC with a range of implementation options.  While the gameplay is somewhat repetitive and grindy, this is decent enough family friendly game that should be considered when on sale.  The retail price is too high, however, this game appears on sale and in bundles often enough.\n- Fun Tower-Defense style indie game. Definitely one where your skill improves every time you die. And you will die, repeatedly. :P Expect to try out many monster combinations per floor before you find something that can delay the hordes of adventurers long enough to set up the floor beneath! I would probably enjoy some more horizontal progression + permanent upgrades for long term re-playability, but it seems like a solo dev/small scoped project. Definitely worth the price for the current amount of content!\n- I appreciate the sincerity of Jusant. You can tell its creators have placed genuine care into their product, which has made the experience of playing it joyful and kind.\nThe visuals are stunning, the mechanics are not overwhelming, the soundtrack is soothing, and the puzzles are not frustrating. A great climbing game all around with an easy-to-follow yet gripping narrative. \nHopefully, Ukrainian localization will also be added soon.\n\n- We need a 60fps patch ASAP. Having 30fps content on PC in [current year] is not acceptable.\n\nOther than that the game is pretty solid! It looks great, it plays great, the story was good imo, the characters are interesting and the amount of solo content is decent.\n\nHowever, the gear system is not as elaborate as in Mk11 and the microtransations are NOT a welcome sight. Denuvo also has to go. If Harada agreed that the addition of Denuvo in Tekken 7 was a mistake, so should NetherRealm.\nI also don't like that 2 characters that are going to be in the Kombat Pass are already in the game (Ermac and Quan Chi). Just give us these characters and come up with other ones for the KP. This is super greedy and lazy.\nIt's even worse than Sektor and Cyrax in MK11, at least you didn't let us play them, period. this time you decide to not make them playable (even thought they work for the AI) AND sell them at a later date? That's awful.\n\nThe game is good but needs improvement and shouldn't ship with performance issues, 30fps content, microtransactions, Denuvo and greedy DLC tactics. I would put a \"meh\" review if I could because of the negatives but for that reason I have to say \"no\".\n- The game itself is great, but Square Enix really dropped the ball by removing the true PC version and leaving us with this Switch port as the only option. It's a huge visual downgrade, but it has more content. Luckily though, a small handful of incredible modders have taken the time to painstakingly transfer the old, high-quality PC assets over to this version which is what saved it for me. Without the mods, I would not have kept playing.\n\nIf you're on the fence, I'd say catch it on sale, then head over to a modding site (Nexus is what I used) and start installing the mods that restore this game to its full PC potential. It's probably the easiest-to-mod game I've ever dealt with too btw. You don't have to be super savvy to get things the way you want them and you don't need any additional software. Just grab the .pak files, slap them into the game's pak folder, enjoy. It really is that simple. (You may want to edit some .ini files to tweak things to your liking, but that's as complex as it gets. If you can open Notepad, you can do this.)\n\nAs for the core gameplay, it's an incredibly solid JRPG with a likable cast and well thought out story. There's plenty of content to enjoy here and it has a good end game. The music is absolutely phenomenal as well. Visually, it's very vibrant and the aesthetic is charming. I think it's a fantastic game overall and is very enjoyable as is, but playing it in 1440p/144Hz with high resolution character and texture assets with better lighting/animation mods and subtle character/NPC/monster upgrades totally elevated it to the next level.\n\np.s. If you do install mods, I HIGHLY recommend grabbing the one that removes the black borders around characters! That gives the game a clean and refreshing new feel that greatly improves it in my opinion!\n- The Graphics of this game don't match the high price tag\n- It's strange how this will be the first review I ever write for a game. I always thought it would be written for a game like Fallout, Elderscrolls or some huge open world survival horror. And yet it's this little piece of art that has me aching to write something, if only for a minute.\nWhen I had finished this, a few minutes ago, I couldn't believe that they only charge a pittence for it. I thought to myself that if people can charge you 70 euro for games that are poorly executed and badly made from start to finish, then this game should have a much higher pricetag. It wasn't before looking up and seeing that I just finished the first episode in a mere three hours that I understood their reasoning. I feel, however, obliged to tell you all that the three hours spent in this game were worth more to me than the hundreads of hours I've spent in most other games combined. Not because the story was awsome, or the graphics made me gape in awe, but rather that every single aspect of the game in combination managed to grip me and pull me in so that time became temporarily meaningless. Imagine if games held this standard. Imagine if your favorite action, your favorite adventure game or even your favorite driver had this kind of execution. \nYou can tell a good story in a bad way, and you can tell a bad story in a good way. The story in this game might not be the most interesting story you've ever heard, but it's good, and in the execution of it you are drawn in, captured by it, moved by it.\n\nMost adventure games will entertain, they'll give you some ups and downs along the way, but ultimately they will feel like games.\nI've never felt so fulfilled after \"playing a game\" as I did today. Original, beautiful and masterfully executed. I can't wait for the next episode.\n- Events that took place:\n\nDid not want to sell player,\nGot an offer for said player,\nRejected the offer,\nPlayer demaned to be allowed to speak to the club,\nGot a second offer from said club,\nEssentially forced to accept the offer,\nPlayer reached an agreement with the club,\nWished player the \"best of luck\" in his future endeavours,\nPlayer is angry that he is leaving,\nPlayer considerers his new club a \"step down\" in his career,\nReminder: Player demanded to go to said club,\nMe finding solice in the fact that FM19 although lacking in the football department, delivers a brilliant experience in dealings with manic and psychotic people.\n\nAllow me to grant you an insight into SI's employee knowledge on the subject their games are about. I once engaged in a conversation with a developer at SI about FM, and football in general. After some talking about premier league, and me slightly confused, I eventually understood that this developer thought that Tottenham Hotspurs were located in Liverpool. So I posed him the following question: \"Then why do they call any matches between Tottenham and Arsenal the 'North London Derby'?\" to which he responded that he did not know, but he assured me that Tottenham F.C was located in Liverpool. I had to resort to showing him the borough of Tottenham in London for him to understand that Tottenham Hotspurs is not lovated in Liverpool, but in fact in London.\n\nThis will be the last edition of this game series I will ever purchase. In a football management simulator such as this, letting SI and their employees (including the one that responded to this review) tell you various aspects of football, is like having a pervert preach to you about the virtues of sexual absitence. They know nothing, and since the core game has not progressed the slightest in 10 years, it would be a fair assumption that they do not care neither.\n\nFuck SI, Fuck their beloved \"devs\" and fuck Charlton Heston while you're at it.\n- As the holder of a degree in Plant Sciences, I wholeheartedly endorse this game.\n\nReal talk: One of the best things about this game is how it totally commits to the old-timey apothecary/greenhouse theme-- it’s extremely atmospheric. It also has a compelling story with recurring characters that you can affect with your choices. If the prospect of discovering and using plants to solve problems (or mayhap even a grim mystery) appeals to you, I recommend trying this game.\n- Valve ignored this game because it doesn't rake in the money like tf2/dota/csgo and thats why its good\n- \"it's a puzzle game dressed up as a wargame\"\n\n1. puzzle games don't have this much randomness\n\n2. it uses authentic hex wargame conventions/mechanics so it's more of a puzzle game built out of a wargame\n\n3. you can take the puzzle element out of it by customizing your game.yml file to allow +5 turns, then play each scenario slow\n- [h1]AT A GLANCE[/h1]\n(Full review follows below)\n\n[list]\n[*] [b]Game Name:[/b] The Swapper\n[*] [b]Original Release:[/b] 2013\n[*] [b]Genre Tags:[/b] Atmospheric; 2D; Puzzle-Platformer; Sci-Fi \n[*] [b]My Overall Grade:[/b] A-\n[*] [b]Estimated Playtime (Campaign):[/b] 3-5 hours\n[*] [b]Multiplayer Aspect:[/b] None\n[*] [b]Recommended To:[/b] Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Aesthetes; Game atmosphere connoisseurs; Strong narrative advocates; Puzzle game aficionados\n[/list]\t\n\n[h1]REVIEW[/h1]\n[b]The Swapper[/b] is an enjoyable 2D puzzle-platformer that lacks gameplay innovation but rises above the crowd on the shoulders of its superbly well-designed atmosphere and provocative narrative.  The actual puzzle-solving aspect of the game is adequate, but with minimal diversity and accretion.  It is definitely a story-driven experience, with the gameplay taking a passenger seat.  If you can appreciate a game in that style, this is a good bet for you. \n\nThe entrancing narrative and the style in which it transpires work in concert with the mystifying ambiance to create a wondrous experience. The story touches on some thought-provoking metaphysical issues, while skillfully avoiding a fall too deep into the rabbit hole to keep the average person’s interest. Much of the rest of the narrative is comfortable, cliché sci-fi tropes that we all know and love.\n\nThe gameplay and the puzzles are far from [i]bad[/i], but they also are nothing special.  As I alluded to: they are sufficient, but fail to develop into anything overly interesting. Very little changes from the first puzzle to the last, so it does get a little bit dry.  That said, some of the later ones are quite tricky and a few require not only puzzle-solving ability but also decent reflexes. \n\nThe graphics are pleasurable and align perfectly with the vibe of the game. But the whole soundscape is what truly brings the atmosphere of [b]The Swapper[/b] to life. The ambient soundtrack, the cryptic chatter, and the selectively placed voice-overs contribute a wonderful blend of emotions and mystery. If you are into it, this is a game you might enjoy with the lights off and your headphones on (or however else you may get into the zone).  \n\n[b]The Swapper[/b] is a brief, interesting, and enjoyable experience. It is not a complex or intricate puzzle-platformer, but I recommend it to any fan of the genre who would appreciate the atmosphere and narrative.\n\n[i][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/murphyslawyercuration#curation]Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations![/url][/i]\n- While i'm not far into it, so far it is great. All negative reviews are due to the stuttering. I have a 3070 and I googled a solution.\n\nWIth Nvidia GPUs go to Nvidia control panel and change the global shader cache size in 3d settings to unlimited. Also limit the fps of Elden Ring, I have it set to 60 fps. So far no problems on my end. Hope this helps somebody choosing to get the game.\nIf u have AMD GPUs I don't know specifics so please ask google sorry for not being able to help, but I know it is a similar process.\n\nNow 30hrs in the game is so good too\n\nNow done with the game it is amazing\n- After the past few years of broken, buggy AAA games I've started to lose the passion I once had for the industry. This masterpiece came out of no where and completely reignited my love for gaming. PLEASE do not sleep on this game, it's such a breath of fresh air from the garbage you'd normally expect from modern day companies. Definitely taking a spot in my top 5 favorites and I haven't even scratched the surface of the game yet, it's just that good. Beautiful art style, crisp animations, a unique concept, FUN gameplay, its everything I've been wanting and more. Kudos to the devs for making this absolute banger <3\n- I realise this is intended to be a darkly humored game, but it is still fucked up nonetheless. I just can't fathom how such degraded humor can be seen as funny.\n- The core game is fun, and scratches an itch for miniatures combat that I often have.\n\nTwo reasons I don't recommend: \n(i) the single player AI is quite easy once you figure it out.  You can face challenging scenarios but it's because at higher difficulty levels the AI adds sheer weight of numbers. It doesn't get appreciably smarter, so the only challenge you face is how to funnel larger, dumb formations of enemies to come at you.  The campaign mode is just a series of battles against randomly generated forces with extremely thin randomly-generated narrative interludes of about a paragraph in length, with no strategic map, or concepts of supply or resources. It does not meaningfully extend the length of time single player is fun.\n\n(ii) Multiplayer relies on too many things that are opaque to people who have just played single player.  There are a lot of rules and features (like how you get sub-commanders - it comes down to arcane placement of cavalry troops in setup), that are not documented in the rules or in any tutorial.  Unless you are willing to read the forums for both this game and the original game and try to glean this information, you will be perpetually at a disadvantage against the majority of the community who have been playing since the first game.  \n\nIf you like miniatures tabletop gaming and have lots of spare time to devote to the game to learning it in spite of the game not fully explaining its mechanics or giving feedback to you on enemy actions, it will be worthwhile.  Otherwise, the single player experience by itself doesn't warrant buying at full price. Worth it at 50% off.\n- Having accumulated over 13400 hours in-game with [i]Arma 3[/i], I would certainly recommend it to others. \n\nIf you enjoy tactical shooters and playing online with friends, it's well worth a look; especially if you appreciate a high dose of military realism!\n- Playing this game instantly brought back memories of me playing TMNT, Battletoads, Double Dragon, and Streets of Rage, with my little brother on the NES and Sega Genesis in the early 90s. Luckily this game doesn’t feature TMNT’s ridiculous water level or Battletoads' sadistic peed bike level. The graphics are perfect, the controls are great, the soundtrack is awesome (especially the Wu-Tang stage, and the Shredder stage), and the levels and overworld map are fun to navigate. I’ve played through the story mode with all 7 characters and have played through the arcade mode multiple times solo and many times in multiplayer and I’ve enjoyed every bit of it. This game is so much fun.\n\nThere are a few things I wish existed though. I wish there were more playable characters. I wish that you did not lose your 7 character’s progress in story mode when you start a new game. I wish you could see the difficulty level of the online arcade game you are joining. I wish there were cumulative stats you could see for arcade and story mode that showed the number of times you completed a stage, how many enemies you knocked out, objects you’ve destroyed, stage times, combo streaks, times taunted, etc. I wish you could create your own turtle and assigned moves, specials, jumps, taunts, and colors.\n- I fucking love this game (and the original Guacamelee as well). It's excellent, challenging platforming with a hilarious sense of humor. I'm an archaeologist who works in Mexico and this game is littered with funny and well-researched nods to Mexican history and pre-history. I imagine that matters less to the non-archaeologists out there, but the fact that they took the time to research all their jokes speaks to the care that went into this game.\n- A very easy game to get into, super popular at the moment so there is always someone to play with, and for only 5 EUR you can invest a lot of hours into the game\n- And that's it, after 278 hours of play, the adventure is over... \nThis type of game that you wish you could forget so you could rediscover it like the 1st time, where you discover everything, a bit like a child\nIt's a game made with passion for video games, to tell a story, to make the player laugh too, and to make him a little melancholic or horrified or even sickened sometimes\n\n[u]Divinity OS 2 will have marked my young adult life[/u], like Sonic and megadrive games, Pokémon, FFTactics, Zelda and gameboy / gamecube games, Warcraft3 (TT), or Mass Effect and other PC games did in my childhood and adolescence (I surely forget so much excellent games)\n\nIt's a 20/20 for me. The work is titanic. The game is really made with passion. The studio is very talented.\n\nSo when Steam asks me [i]\"Do you recommend this game\"[/i], I say:\nYes! Because this is where you feel that video games are an experience, an adventure to live! \nI went through Rivellion with my buddy, like I went through Kanto (Pokémon), or Ivalice in FF Tactics as a kid!\n\n\n[u][b]Atmosphere:[/b][/u]\nMany of us probably remember our adventures in Pokémon or other games in our childhood. We roamed, discovered and lived in these worlds!\n\nHere, it's the same thing, and not alone this time: I was with a very good friend! \nWe met frequently to venture into the world of Divinity as a lightning lizard warrior or a skeletal assassin with a mysterious past...\n\nWith our companions Lohse and Ifan, and Maladie, and Gareth, and Jahan and Han the survivor kid and Sir Lora and so many others. Impossible to forget... \n[i]They exist! Stop lying, I know they exist ![/i]\n\nOur choices were important: We decided to do justice to this or that person, provoking reactions (or death) in certain characters, slapping a few Magisters around when necessary\nAnd of course, we STRONGLY decided to stea... Borrow a lot of spells and equipments from the merchants, while the other one was distracting by chatting...\n... What? We didn't have the money and we had to save the world ! Well, we had the money, but you never know, maybe one day we will need it... !\nAnd then stealing, it's fun. And exhilarating hehehe\n\n\n[u][b]Gameplay:[/b][/u]\nA 3D tactical turn-based game, to play with friends. Really ! Don't play this game alone, I'm sure that with at least 1 buddy (or 3!), you will exploit the game to its full potential!\n\nAlso, [u]you can change your skills and class at any moment in the game[/u], it's very flexible ! I played rogue all my game, and in the last chapiter, I decided to play with spear and War skills ! I really enjoyed being able to switch like this, as I want ! The game want you to take FUN, not \"suffering\" your \"bad\" class choices !\n\nToo bad, I don't know anyone who is ready to take on the role of a GM (Game Master), to live a personalized campaign! Because it is a mode apart from the main campaign!\n\n\n[u][b]Music:[/b][/u]\nExtremely good and fits perfectly with the atmosphere of the game. This kind of OST that we listen to when we work and that makes us live our adventures again when the song becomes EPIC!\n\n\n[u][b]In summary:[/b][/u]\nTitanic content, assured re-playability for those who wish to know what would have happened if they had answered something else than \"FIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT\", and I repeat, the fact of being able to play with friends makes the game so much more pleasant to do!\n\n\n[b]*Sob*[/b]\nBut no, I'm not crying... I'm just allergic to emotions!\n\nI would like so much to forget this game to be able to rediscover it\n\nPlease play it, at least give it a try, and let yourself be immersed in Div's world!\n\nIn our case, we will do it again in HARDCORE mode !\n\nPeace guys !\n- For the past 4 years I couldn't get myself to finish a single game without having to force myself to do it(and even then I failed). I couldn't enjoy SP games no matter how good the gameplay or the story was. I kept buying games hoping to find that one game that would do the trick. This was FF XV for me. Despite of all my friends advising me against buying it because it was just going to be another game that would sit around in my library, I decided to give it a try.\n\nIt actually felt like I went back in time to when I could play SP games for hours without getting bored after an hour or two.\n\nI admit I skipped most sidequests and I'll try going back to them sooner or later, although it may not be the best game out there in terms of content(you can finish the game on easy skipping most secondary quests in about 20-25 hours) or story development, playing through it felt like a new experience. In fact, even after finishing the game there's still plenty of things to do and in my opinion, even playing it through again just to spend more time with Noctis and his friends is worth it.\n\nThe story is not mindblowing, the combat system is really fun but far from flawless, most sidequests aren't well written but at its core, at least for me, FF XV has something to it that other games lack. I can't say it magically restored my old passion for gaming but it has given me a reason to at least try to get into it again.\n\nIf you haven't played it yet I sincerely envy you, I would love to experience it all over again from the start, it has been a memorable journey to say the least and I hope that you are willing to give it a try. ^^\n- WHERE ARE MY OG DS FANS OF THIS GAME? REJOICE BRUDDAS!\n\nNo but seriously, I loved this game to DEATH when it first came out on the DS and to now see an HD version of this game on steam. It's quite a whiplash but a good one! To anyone who loves mystery/ detective games, YOU NEED TO GET THIS!!! Good story, soundtrack and gameplay <3 AHHHHHH!!!\n- If you like management type games and RPGs, this is the perfect mix. It's just enough management to allow you to thrive with mostly strategy without feeling bogged down, and just enough RPG elements to get you invested in not just your squad, but each individual character in it. \n\nHere's a tale from my experience with the game;\n\nThis is the kind of game to change your entire perspective on life itself. Failure is not the end, nor the beginning, but a constant in this world that you can either let destroy you or make you stronger. Allow me to tell you a story. The story of New Battlehill. \nNear the Shek city of Squin, not far east, was a small town. It went through many names. The first that stuck was Firstyeet, totally not a placeholder. It wasn't an notable settlement, merely consisting of a shack, an iron processor, and some walls to mildly inconvenience the roving gangs of Dust Bandits that liked to bully the residents. After being evicted from their own city once again, the residents, Denver, Soto, Ruka, and Meow, vowed to take back their home. After training and buying the best weapons and armor they could, they made their way back to Firstyeet. To their surprise, however, they would not have to fight. One of the bandits had picked a fight with a herd of goats. The bandits' defense failed against the caprine assault. From this, the town would get its second name - Densorumego. Den for Denver. So for Soto. Ru for Ruka. Me for Meow. And Go for the true heroes, the goats.\nPeace would not last long but soon the residents of Densorumego would become strengthened by their constant fighting. On the elevated, somewhat round land on which Densorumego sat, there were many large fights involving a lot of people. If only there was some sort of name to reflect this... \nAnd from that, the town was renamed for the last time, to Battlehill.\nThings were looking up. The town built its first farms and expanded to be almost four times its original size. But this peace would not last. Battlehill's new ambitions of self sufficiency would attract the attention of a new foe - The Shek Kingdom.\nThe Shek claimed ownership of the land Battlehill was on, and as such, demanded all food grown there be given to them. Confident from their many victories against the Dust Bandits, the Battlehillites refused the Shek demands. Their risk was calculated... but man were they bad at math.\nAll but one were nearly killed in the ensuing battle, and the one person that wasn't knocked into a coma was stuck on the wall because part of the wall was destroyed and he could no longer reach the stairs because of that. The people knew they couldn't fight the Shek, but they would not allow themselves to be subservient either. And so began their malicious compliance. The Shek would get all the food in Battlehill, as it would be none - The Battlehillites were moving.\nI could write entire books about their journey around the west. The Fogmen, the ruins, the Screeching Bandits, there's many a tale. But, eventually, the people would find a new home. In the harsh and Beak Thing infested land of Vain, homeland of the Western Hive, they would found their new home - New Battlehill.\nJump to now, the city is thriving, they have more bread than they know what to do with, they've grown strong from defending their home from the Beak Things, and their population has grown. They are currently planning a reconquest of Battlehill, which was occupied by Dust Bandits shortly after they left.\n\nThere is a part I left out, between Firstyeet and Densorumego - I had repeatedly failed to retake Firstyeet, and I was about to quit the game. I was frustrated that I'd gone and bought the best arms and armor and still failed. And when I tried to set up a training ground on a mountain near Squin, bandits again came and defeated me. I went as far as to try and get a refund, which was denied. That refund being denied was the best thing that could've happened. I decided to give the game another try, and to try accepting my failures and growing from them. And if I hadn't done that, I would never have founded New Battlehill. None of the legend worthy tales my squad has been through would have happened. And I'd never have had the fun of going through all of them.\n\nIn short, get this game. It is just great.\n- Very fun game. Best wave shooter on the market that I've ever seen. The roguelike nature of it is very fun. Each run hits you with different challenges in building your weapons.\n\nBiggest critiques - \n1. Achievements locked behind multiplayer in a dead game. God I hate when devs do this. It luckily lets you play through normal mode when queuing, but its still very annoying. The last achievement I needed was \"get to wave 50 of multiplayer gauntlet mode\". I've so far been able to play 2 games of multiplayer. One, my partner had no voice coms. Second, my partner started with extremely staticy voice coms and it cut out at about wave 5. We pushed through to wave 48. Aaaaaaaaaand network error. It took about an hour and a half to get that far just for the game to crash and lose it all. Devs, please stop hiding achievements behind multiplayer when you know full well your game won't have a huge online player base.\n\n2. You get TWO GUN ARMS! This is AMAZING AND AWESOME! Except for the fact that a ton of the attachments for your weapons affect every part on your gun. So by not just making one super mega death arm, you are effectively chopping your total strength into two parts. There are a few pieces that only give you buffs for \"dual wielding\" or having a firing barrel on each arm. But these are not very common, and the stats you get from them pale in comparison to just making a super gun on one arm and keeping the other arm clenched for punching enemies that get up to your face, or putting on a single melee weapon on the other hand for the same purpose. \n\n3. The variety of guns is fun, but in the end it ends up turning into \"hold the fire button, aim for enemies, walk in a circle to trick enemy aim as best as possible, and occasionally punch an enemy that gets to you\". The biggest change to this system is getting either the rocket launcher or the Barrel Barrel which shoots massive barrels at the enemies. They have a very slow fire rate and do best when aiming the shots more precisely. But even then, with some weapons having a spooling time, and others outputting a hale of bullets, the best strategy is to just keep the trigger held 24/7 and strafe your aim from enemy to enemy.\n\nI really enjoyed my time with this game, but don't try to 100% it. The multiplayer achievement isn't worth it. Network is terrible. There's too much going on on screen when you have 2 players in the mix so crashing is likely. If I were the Completionist I would give this game a rating of Finish It. Play through the game with all the unique starting bonuses, all the difficulties. But stay away from multiplayer unless you have a friend to dedicate multiple hours to trying the gauntlet with.\n- Noita is a great indie rogue-lite 2D adventure where every pixel has his own life. The controls with mouse and keyboard are simple and the principle of the game as well easy to learn (and hard to master). Just get as deep, as far as possible. You only have one life. If you die you start all over. \n\nGameplay video: https://youtu.be/6N4Boz1YA2Y\n\nI very much enjoy playing Noita, even if it is sometimes a bit unfair and the procedural generated levels aren't always giving you the same amount of luck. The game still needs some more balance in the gameplay, as well as optimizations since I experienced little stutters here and there.\n\nSince it is early access, I expects improvements in this sense. Overall the game is fun and definitely an added-value to every indie library or rogue-lite gamers collection.\n\nTherefore, I can recommend the game! \n\nPS: Restarting a run shouldn*t restart the application, @developers.\n- My previous review reflected the terrible state of the game as it was on launch day. After years of improvements, the game has had its map design & cover placement tweaked, pretty-boy playermodels have been dirtied up, cringy voicelines were adjusted & a bunch of new content has been added. A lot of my complaints were addressed and I recognize the amount of work the team has done to bring the game back. It finally feels content complete and has reached an acceptable level of quality that should've been there when it came out.\n\nHowever, I am still disappointed to say it falls very short of its predecessors in terms of gameplay, map design and atmosphere. I see no reason to play this instead of BF3/BF4. \n\nPlay the map Grand Bazaar in Battlefield 3. Look at all of the particle effects, post processing and detail that map has. It has such a thick rainy atmosphere. Play it through to the end and you'll see how players tear up the map and make it look destroyed. In BF4's Paracel Storm, the foliage will sway & the waves will rise as the strong winds of a storm approaches the map. Watch as a sandstorm creeps up in Gulf of Oman and eventually engulfs it in a torrent of chaos. These landscapes have so much drama that the ones in 2042 lack. Sure, there are sandstorms and tornadoes, but they still look so sterile compared to the previous games this title stands upon.\n\nConceptually, 2042's world is supposed to be on its knees. The growing reality of extreme climate, natural disasters becoming commonplace and the world powers fighting over the last resources Earth has to offer depicts a dire situation to immerse ourselves in. This makes me imagine maps where earthquakes adjust the layout of flags throughout the round, or tsunamis roll in and what once was a playable area is now flooded. Giant tornado events that tear down skyscrapers. Sandstorms that turn the widest of maps into a close-quarters brawl. \n\nThe maps in the game have some aspects of this concept but nowhere to the amount that it should. The technology is there. The previous games have had a genuinely impressive level of immersion and atmosphere. 2042 did not have this on launch and it still doesn't. This could have been the wild natural disaster Battlefield game where we see SHTF.\n\nI don't care that we have 128 player matches or goofy butt specialists to play as. They missed the mark with 2042 and no update can fix that, conceptually, it never was able to realize its potential.\n- This is such a faithful recreation of Star Ocean 2, I don't think I'll ever even consider playing the PS1 original, or the PSP remake. The beauty of the new HD landscapes and animations, added to the wonderful musical score, the various combat improvements and the classic story, this is one you won't soon forget.\n\n20 hours to beat\n2 main characters to see the story from different perspectives\n13 recruitable party members\na MASSIVE world to explore\nintense crafting system\nStorytelling as only the japanese could tell in the 90's\n\n100% recommend.\n- A fun game for drinking parties, take a shot every time you feel like you just wasted 19 cents.\n- This game is a cozy  winter morning, wrapped in a blanket, in the heat of the fireplace with your favorite cartoon on and cup of hot chocolate, it is x-files, it is the music that you hear while walking on the streat, it is people you know,  good people, bad people, real people. This game has the feeling of nostalgia while being totally contemporary and modern.This game is every young adult fear and existential crisis all at once. This game is pure feeling.\n\n\nthat aside, this game is pretty much a perfect game for me, the story is really interesting, the music is beautiful and the art is gorgeous, and the characters and the atmosphere are so fucking believable i think i know everybody in this game, or atleast i feel so.\n\nAs a small town dude i really relate with a lot of thing in this game.\n\nThis game is special, its special for me.\n-    I just finished playing the 5th episode 😭. It feels incredibly sad to say \"Good Bye\" to this game. While playing I had a chance to get to know every in game character, especially Max and Chloe. They've become like my new friends, we've been through so much together, and realizing that it's over now, it's hella tough. \n   I've seen a lot of great games before, but never did a game make me feel SO connected to its characters. And every time you need to make a choice, you start seeing everything you've been through before and thinking how to make things even better. But I think the most important thing here is not to overthink (I mean not to try to Google what consequences your choice is going to have because it kills all the excitement of not knowing). Just do what feels right and what your heart tells you even if you might be wrong. I guess that's the lesson I learned in here. \n   Other important things that make Life Is Strange my favorite game: The developers paid attention to the smallest details, some of them you don't even notice playing for the first time, but the fact that they're there makes me appreciate it even more. The graphics is hella amazing, you just have to see it for yourself :) The plot and the music complement each other in subtle ways, and I can guarantee you'll have at least several of the soundtracks in your favorites playlist ;) \n   The game's definitely worth its money and even more. I wish I'd be able to forget everything that happened in the game and start playing it from the very beginning, so I'd be able to feel everything with the same intensity I did during my first playthrough. But I'll definitely come back to it after some time just to do it all over again. \n   Dear Developers, THANK YOU so much for Life Is Strange. I wish you all the best and I'm looking forward to seeing more masterpieces from you.\n- This game is difficult and fun! But I wold hold off from purchasing right now. The game is very laggy and has many bugs. Here are some pros and cons.\n\nPros: \nFun\nDifficult\nLong\nGraphics\nOn the edge of your seat gameplay\n\nCons:\nLaggy\nLow FOV\nDoes not look as good as what was advertised.\nRTX low is super laggy and unstable\nbugs and glitches\n[spoiler]Not scary jumpscares[/spoiler]\n\nI'ma be honest, the game is fun and I still need to finish it. But if scott did not quit, the game would be more fun and better. Steel Wool kinda floped the game.\n(spoiler)\n\n\nBy the way does anyone have any tips on how to beat the daycare thing? I'm stuck.\n- This is the purest Megaman experience I've had in years. I don't remember the last time I sat down with a Megaman-style game like this and just had pure Fun, and got fully engrossed in it over everything else. 20XX? No. Fangames? No. Even Megaman 11 didn't grab me this hard. This is it. This is the game people wanted when they saw Mighty Number 9 the first time. This is the Megaman successor we've been waiting for.\n\nIf I had to say anything negative about it, it'd be the music. It's mediocre at best. It's Meh. It does its job and fills dead air, but I'm not rushing to download the OST any time soon. I can't think of a single track that I went \"wow I need that\" for. It doesn't hinder my opinion of the game, but I would have loved it even more if it had gotten this right.\n- Phat beatsies,\nSelf-deprecating humour that gives me self affirmation,\nPanders to my need for nostalgic nods,\nPlays smoothly, and so doesn't leave me stuck for hours helping me to feel like I have higher than average intelligence,\nMesses about with you based on the assumption of previous adventure game experience, which leads to making me go \"heh\" outloud more than three times.\n\nMildly amusing, could use more super space dust.\nPlayed on the \"hard\" difficulty option but activated other options out of curiosity, would recommend it for the extra shenanigans.\n\nIf I had to give it a score 8/10,\nWould pay for the soundtrack, that ear crack is cash money.\n\nA hell of a lot of work was put into this game & I suggest you press \" J \" on as many screens as you can handle to get some insight on the thought process behind this game, the effort and imagination that went into it.\n\nThe missing 2 points:\nfew bugs to work out, ain't no big but in a game where you are going to be thinking \"it's not progressing because I haven't mashed the appropriate non-sensical things together\" it needs to not bug out.\n\nSoundtrack not yet out - nah not actually taking points away from that, it'll be out soon as I understand it, but I need that fix Mr. Shellburger.\n- The cognitive dissonance in the original Space Quest games between the box cover art telling you that \"Roger Wilco is hapless!\" and the player's necessary mental exertion involved to solve the puzzles, is laid bare the moment you can type in the name you will be called by in the game.\n\nIt's one of the hardest lines to walk when narrative is the main driver of an interactive work:  balancing the player's actions with the personality of the character they are directing in a world that is clearly alive, regardless of the players's presence.\n\nThe Excavation of Hob's Barrow's succeeds in this fully with the denizens and everyday life of the town of Bewlay.\n\nFrom the moment Thomasina Bateman starts recounting the events that led to her writing a letter to her mother, any ambiguity is dispelled: the player is helping Thomasina relive her time in starkly bucolic Bewlay. But as players spend more time within the memories and stories Thomasina shares, the more off putting the narration becomes. It's not just that Thomasina is an unreliable narrator—the implications of the traumatic events that occured at Hob's Barrow are still a puzzle to be worked out. \n\nThis is the strength of the narrative design and writing in Hob's Barrow: as entertainingly crafted as linear story or film, but with eartnest player engagement required to work out what's happening in the very deep shadows of this cursed place.\n\nThe fantastic writing is supported by equally fantastic pixel art, music, and some of the best voice work I've heard in games…ever? The codgers, critters, and countryside all sound fantastic, the bleakness of the moors churning from peaceful to menacing with expert orchestration. Visual direction is solid, too, with sparingly, effectively used pixel portraits and closeups to highlight details both grotesque and filled with character. The dark undercurrent of humour throughout the game also adds some replayability for achievement hunters: some encounters are worth revisiting!\n\nI played this entirely on Steam Deck, mostly curled up in bed at night, but enjoyed the grand finale while docked on my TV. Performance and control was flawless, regardless.\n\nOne of my favorite games released in 2022, and definitely one of my favorite adventure games of all time.\n- [i] THIS MATCH WILL BE RED HOT. HERE GOES [/i]\n\nLord knows what attempt number, and you again hear the ring bell. The level boss keeps laughing, taunting your every failure. The brainwashing music is starting to give you a headache, your eyes are moving on their own, the difficulty is boiling your blood to the very cells and the controller screams for mercy as every retry gets more and more intense. The anger flows and the addicted child in you claims it will be the last try. The reactions become pure instinct, flowing in a quick, relentless succession of moving, shooting and dodging a thousand projectiles. But suddenly, it happens. \n\n[i]A KNOCKOUT![/i] \n“Phew, that was intense...time for the next one!”\n\nThis is the very essence of Cuphead. A punishing yet immensly satisfying game of bullet hell, mixed with a beautiful and just so goddamned perfectly recreated animation technique that will have you wondering what crazy stuff they will make up next. This is a game that yells nostalgia and effort in every moment. It’s a wonderful experience that at every turn you can tell they didn't just put blood, tears, effort and sweat at every second of work for the last years, they put so much LOVE. Love for the past and love for an era long gone but never forgotten.\n\nThe most pure fun I had raging in the whole year. Absolutely recommended to anyone up for a challenge that will give as much as it takes.\n- I hold this game in as high esteem as games such as Undertale and Oneshot.\nIt would be a mistake to dismiss this game, as I once did.\n\nThis game made me really care about it. It's one of those games where the writing, music, graphics, and gameplay all work together to give life to the characters within it. Even though the setting takes place in a small area (comprising of 2 buildings, 3 caves, and a bake stand), it still feels like an entire world that had a past from before you started playing and a future that unfolds after you stop playing. Every part of the game serves towards this purpose. The developer took the time and effort to make sure every small, nuanced detail felt right. Whether it's a quirky little animation, the presence (or absence) of circumstance-fitting music, or the sound effects that make every footstep and enemy strike sound just right, this game does a phenomenal job making sure that every contributes an immersive experience. You’re not interacting with a piece of software, you’re interacting with a world.\n\nHowever, this game, as is all games, is not perfect. The combat can be a bit unintuitive owing to the fact that enemies can attack you while you are selecting your move, but you will PROBABLY get used to this and after that, boy, does it become quite an exciting experience. In addition, this game has many mentions of death. While this sounds terrible on paper, the game does manage to pull out some interesting game choices out of it. Unless you have trouble discerning fiction from reality (or are uncomfortable with the mention of death), you should be fine. All other flaws I won't elaborate on because they're subjective nitpicks (ex. didn't like a word choice; thought a certain sprite looked weird; thought that the music overplayed the \"spooky\" instruments that one time in the game).\n\nIf you're looking for a game that will make you invested in a new experience, you might have just found it.\n\n- everyone posting 16 gb ram specs and saying it runs well, lul\n\ni have 8 gigs of ram with a gtx 660 (yep) and a fx-8350 and it runs around 45-60 FPS (i cap it at 60) at High settings. yeah. REALLY well optimized, considering this computer is nearing the end of its life and the visuals are gorgeous.\n\nEDIT: 1080p :)\n\noh, and it's fun too, right.\n\nEdit 2- Actual review\n\nGame is pretty easy. I forget if there was a hard mode, but if there was I picked normal mode, and the game feels like it should be on easy. I've yet to break a sweat on a boss (currently chapter 5), and the only thing stopping me from taking on enemies 10+ higher than me is that the game auto-nerfs your damage if the enemy is too far above you. I've actually found the game very relaxing as a result, because there isn't the frustration of having to redo bosses after getting wiped, so it's not entirely a bad thing. But if you were looking for a challenge in your battles, this isn't your game.\n\nAs for story, it's also fairly basic, and rides off of having a sizeable to-do list as sidequests. Recruiting new citizens, doing major sidequest chains, unlocking new stuff, it's got a good amount to do in-game to keep you occupied, unless you're a \"main quest line only\" player. It helps that the warp system is easy to use (and you will use it often) and the game is gorgeous, so you don't really feel too bored doing the same shet over and over again. \n\nThere are several elements to the gameplay. \n\nOne, the overworld traversing. Overall, I'm ambivalent to it. It can feel slightly sluggish at parts, but collecting the shiny areas is surprisingly addicting (maybe because I'm a sem-completionist), as are finding chests. The unfortunate part is that most of these chests contain utterly useless items, so don't really feel that rewarding. \n\nTwo, dungeon crawling. Have to admit this is one of the weaker parts for me. The dungeons are basic, and don't really have much in the way of puzzling elements. Could change later, highly doubt it will. I do like how the battles are seamless, though.\n\nThree, army battles. Also not much of a fan of this, but only because it seems like a side addition without much depth to it. Fortunately it's not a major part of the game, so meh.\n\nFour, kingdom management. Holy cow I love this part of it. People might complain it feels like a mobile game with the wait times and whatever, but since you can warp straight back to your castle whenever you want, it's not that big of an issue. I do wish your gains accumulated while you're offline (or tabbed out, at least...), but idk something about managing the kingdom and making it grow/level up is stupidly addicting.\n\nOverall, if you're looking for a challenging or engaging JRPG, this might not be the game for you. If you're looking for a game with gorgeous visuals, fantastic voice acting (using JP), laid-back atmosphere, and want to be the president of the United States serving some random kid as his vassal, highly recommended.\n\nHighly recommend to play on controller. I'm using the Switch Pro Con.\n- While I don't necessarily play medieval type games...I thought I should give this game a go...but tbh I was highly disappointed...this game is poorly optimized...full of glitches...poor characterization... terrible voice acting....& terrible facial expressions...only good thing about this game is the detailing of the rats...and some lighting effects...other than that this is just another pathetic excuse of a game.... wouldn't recommend it even on sale...it's a huge let down...tbh...\n- A new game from Zeboyd, you know I'm there! And this was such a fun game\n\nThis game is about as long as Cthulhu Saves Christmas and it's just as Linear. However given their statement on this video, that's meant to be the point these days.\n\nThe Graphics for the main game are basic but it's fitting for the Genre. Also they have dropped the random battles with on screen monsters to avoid if you want to not fight (And you still have the option to start a battle through the main menu). The fighting system is identical to CSC too which I've enjoyed but I can understand those who may not like it. The Animation for the transformations are incredible...except I'm always stuck watching them every single time which can get very tedious.\n\nThe story is clever, and they provide \"Translations\" for the Ole English of Shakespeare...but a lot of the translations are jokes and very silly ones at that.\n\nThere isn't a LOT of replay value but you will enjoy the story enough you'll want to play it again eventually.\n\nThere is no New Game Plus mode...yet but given how they patched it into CSC later on I'm certain they're do that here eventually.\n\nI say the game is incredible for the price range and is entertaining for all ages.\n\n\nVIDEO REVIEW: https://youtu.be/wuw9pJPowqM\n- [h1]Dishonored 2.[/h1]\n[i]If old Samuel could see me now...[/i]\n\n[b][u]Introduction[/u][/b]\nAt its core, Dishonored 2 is little more than a mechanically and narratively contiguous continuation of the Dishonored formula. This isn't a bad thing - the first Dishonored was one of the best stealth-action games of all time - but innovation is too often overlooked in the games industry. DH2 does bring some nuance to the franchise, but new drawbacks are packaged in as well. Put plainly, Dishonored 2 is a game I adore just as much as the original, but there are aspects that certainly left me wishing for better.\n\n[b][u]Plot[/u][/b]\nThe game begins 15 years following Empress Jessamine's assassination, and her daughter, Empress Emily Kaldwin, has ruled the isles since that time. Her father and Lord Protector, Corvo Attano, advises and keeps close watch over her at court. Quickly after Dishonored 2's opening however, the Duke of Serkonos, Luca Abele, comes to Emily's royal tower - bearing a gift. He brings Emily's supposed long lost aunt, Delilah Kaldwin, who then immediately stages a coup in a bid to take the throne. She is successful, and you must escape the city of Dunwall as either Emily or Corvo (more on that later). You then travel to Karnaca, the capital of Serkonos, where you begin a personal crusade to [i]take back what's yours.[/i]\n\n[b][u]Technical Revamp[/u][/b]\nShifting focus for a look at DH2's presentation, the game is gorgeous. There's a hint of the old, comic-book-like aesthetic that was present in the original game, but the graphical fidelity has been greatly improved in this sequel. The textures, lighting, animations, visual effects, and environments are all elegantly rendered. It's easily one of the most beautiful games of 2016. As for the audio; sound effects and voices are realistic, and the OST is as iconic, if not more so than the first game's. Although, when it comes to performance, Dishonored 2 clearly falters. DH2 was a technical mess on launch, and while it runs decently now; some bugs, stutters, and crashes still persist. Overall the presentation is good, but the performance is surely sub-par.\n\n[b][u]Setting & Exploration[/u][/b]\nAs stated earlier, Dishonored 2 is set in Serkonos's city of Karnaca; known as The Jewel of the South. Gone are the dark grays and subdued browns of Dunwall, as Karnaca replaces them with bright, pastel blues and yellows. The metropolis has distinct cultural differences from Dunwall as well, whether it's the widespread use of wind-power over whale oil, or Karnaca's reliance on silver mining to employ its working class. In terms of level design, DH2's stages are much more expansive than anything seen in the first game too. There's lots to explore in every district of Karnaca, especially when verticality and hidden locations are taken into account. There's several routes toward all objectives as well; emphasizing Arkane's \"play your way\" motto. All considered, Dishonored 2's game world is exceedingly well-built.\n\n[b][u]Depth in the Details[/u][/b]\nOne of the most effective ways DH2 differentiates itself from its predecessors is through what I'd call 'structural gimmicks.' To break up the standard pacing, a couple of the game's missions have special set-pieces which can completely turn gameplay convention on its head. An example of this is the 'Clockwork Mansion' on the fourth level. This inventor's home has levers in essentially every chamber that reconfigures a room's layout - such as turning a trophy room into a grand hall. These levers can be used to access new areas or evade enemies, and even reveal traversable spaces behind the walls. It's this degree of imaginative design depth that distinguishes Dishonored 2 from most other games in its genre.\n\n[b][u]Stealth & Combat[/u][/b]\nMoving over to the core gameplay loop, not much has changed from the first game. The stealth and combat are still just as exquisitely implemented as before, with only a couple of refinements. The deviations that come to mind are that drop-assassinations can now be used non-lethally as drop-knockouts, and assassination animations are a much more brutal (but cathartic) spectacle to watch than before. Dishonored 2's central mechanics are near flawless to be sure, but this sequel suffers by adding few new gameplay elements to the mix. Except - well - there is one big feature I've neglected to elaborate on as of yet.\n\n[b][u]Emily [i]or[/i] Corvo[/u][/b]\nIn Dishonored 2, you can play as either Emily Kaldwin, [i]or[/i] Corvo Attano. When Delilah first takes the throne you get a moment to choose one or the other, after which the character you don't pick is turned into a cold, stone statue. Both Emily and Corvo have separate voice actors and personalities, but they share the same goal throughout the game's duration: to save the last of their family, and reclaim the throne for the true Kaldwin heiress. After receiving the mark of The Outsider, Emily and Corvo have different magical abilities too. Where Corvo has blink, Emily has far reach; or where Corvo can stop time, Emily can chain together the lives of her enemies, and kill or incapacitate several people at once. All in all, the decision to allow the player to progress the campaign as either Emily or Corvo was a stroke of brilliance in my estimation.\n\n[b][u]Main Story[/u][/b]\nReturning to the main story - it's another point of criticism for me. There are some magnificent aspects; such as the nostalgic callbacks to events in the first Dishonored or reappearances of some of the original game's best characters, but all considered most of the writing is retreading a beaten path. Just as in Dishonored 1, the game flows from mission to mission where the chief objective is simply to eliminate a key player obstructing your path to the throne. This is perfectly fine from a gameplay perspective, but it can lead to a bit of déjà vu from a narrative outlook. Dishonored 2's writing quality isn't poor, but it doesn't distance itself from the comfortable story-staging of its predecessor, making it feel slightly lazy.\n\n[b][u]A Reactive World[/u][/b]\nOn the other side of the same coin, the narrative reactivity of Dishonored 2's world to your choices is truly admirable. Playing DH2 in high chaos; where you murder many people throughout the game, results in huge environmental storytelling changes compared to low chaos. Here's an example. If you flood the streets of Karnaca red with blood, subsequent levels show you've harmed the city's inhabitants before you even arrive. Citizens’ moods and perceptions will have soured as they become depressed or monstrous in the wake of their crumbling city - causing suicides and murders to spike throughout Karnaca. And corpses bring bloodflies, which further tarnishes The Jewel of the South in a vicious cycle. You can, of course, avoid all this... by showing a whole lot of care in your actions toward others.\n\n[b][u]Conclusion[/u][/b]\nWhen all is said and done, the Dishonored formula is a fantastic one that it's hard to not have fun with. Karnaca is riddled with environmental detail, the stealth mechanics are flawless, combat is devilishly enjoyable, and the game judges you intelligently on your choices. The Dishonored IP is incredibly strong... The tweaks provided are appreciable; I just wish DH2 had made a concerted effort to make it even stronger. But, god-dammit, I enjoyed Dishonored 2 way too much over it's 20+ hour campaign to critique it any longer. Get the game and play it - despite all my pissy complaints, you won't be disappointed.\n\n[h1]Personal Rating: 9/10 - Absolutely Outstanding[/h1]\n- Definitely not addictive.\n- Alright. **Frog Detective 3: Corruption at Cowboy County** is done and dusted.\n\nIn this latest mystery for the *Frog Detective* to solve, somebody has....stolen...all the Cowboy County resident's....HATS!!! \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3067651098\n\nWill you find the missing hats? Will you find the Hat Thief? These questions and more will be answered in this game!\n\nThis was actually the longest game in the series by a wide margin. Too about and hour forty to wrap up, and the game features two parts. The second part accessed after the credits roll.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3067650496\n\nEpiside 3 was an excellent wrap up to the series. It is completely Steam Deck compatible. Also...doing sick scooter tricks around the desert is pretty sweet.\n\nThis one is an easy recommendation, and presumably, you will have played the other two games anyway, so you'll want to finish the series.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3067651219\n\n[code]If you found this review helpful and would be interested in supporting my Curator group, it would be appreciated. Cheers.\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/curator/32549618/[/code]\n- Ever wanted to be a futuristic dual wielding samurai drummer with a penchant for slicing boxes? No? You didn't even know that was a thing? Well you will after playing this. \n\nProbably the most satisfying rhythm game out there, Beat Saber turns sword thrusts into dance. With notes expertly timed to the music and directional swipes that lead smoothly into each other creating an almost choreographed flow, you will find yourself naturally completing songs and feeling boss after every single track.\n\nWith a choice of difficulty settings and a huge array of modifiers, it is accessible to many skill levels and makes it perfect for newcomers, parties or just to simply show off VR, while remaining a huge challenge for those who wish to test themselves on the most hardcore difficulties.\n\nBeat Saber is a game that probably should be on the radar of any VR user, as it's pretty visuals and reliance on your motions makes it a perfect fit for VR. If you don't have this game I highly recommend you pick it up, as when you do, you may just find it hard to put it down.\n\nNow if you will excuse me, I have a few more hardcore songs I have to embarrass myself attempting.\n- Game concept is good, but execution is bad. Add to that the attitude of the dev team, and I recommend you don't encourage this kind of community censorship.\n\nDon't buy this. Devs close topics because their fanboys get flamey when you bring up any kind of criticism. Like how the servers with anti-cheat and server saving (which doesn't save player status/location) functions enabled kick all players from the server every 30-60 minutes. I wouldn't mind reconnecting if my location and hunger/thirst got saved during this \"server save\". But apparently trying to open a discussion on the topic is considered flaming and they close down your topic. Horribly handled.\n\n- As much as I adore this game's visuals, soundtrack, story, and... THE MEMES... I unfortunately can't recommend actually playing it.\n\nI can parry bosses in Dark Souls or Elden Ring with less frustration than in this game. The parry system requires you to execute a light attack towards an enemy right before they go in for a hit against you, which is usually telegraphed with a red glare in their eye. Unfortunately, even while using the lock-on camera (and by the way, you are never directly informed of its existence), half of the time my opponent was partially, or even completely off-screen. This is a problem, not only because it makes seeing an incoming attack difficult, but also because movement is tied directly to the parry system. You must execute an attack TOWARDS the enemy. With the camera having a seizure every five seconds, this makes it even more irritatingly difficult to aim your parries. I died to Blade Wolf repeatedly, not because of my own skill, but because midway through an incoming attack, the camera would decide to turn 90 degrees to the left, causing my movement to also shift to the left, nullifying my parry. \nIt's consistently inconsistent.\n\nIf there is some system in place that actually does help explain a lot of these game mechanics, fantastic. However, I find it inexcusable that whatever I might be missing would be so out of the way that I'd never encounter it unless I went out of my way to do so.\n- >Be me\n>Move to new city for job offer\n>Go straight to bed when I arrive, but still oversleep and miss meeting with business contact\n>Have a message, but no contact information, so at suggestion of greasy hotel guy, I start randomly asking people on the street and café if they’re who I’m looking for\n>No luck, but random stranger points me to a club\n>Meet a cool chick who actually doesn’t treat me like a jerk\n>She has a boyfriend\n>Sad feelings\n>She invites me to a cool party anyway\n>Second person I talk to gives me a drink that really messes me up\n>Black out within first half hour of party\n>Wake up at cool chick’s house, she’s on her way to work\n>For some reason when I try to talk to her, I come across as a total stalker type.\n>Go to sleep\n>Next day, watch a train crash over some sort of secret agent\n>Mysterious hooded figure shows up, looms over g-man, then flees\n>Finally, some content, I think\n>Follow mysterious figure\n>Go into store, chase her into the basement\n>Door locks behind her\n>Weird guy there, gives me some backstory I promptly forget\n>Ask him every question that comes to me, but it won’t advance the plot\n>Wander around, not sure what to do\n>Not having fun\n>Meet a cool guy\n>He gives me a hacking device\n>Tells me he’ll teach me how to use it some other time\n>So much waiting\n>Finally run into guy who hired me and told me to move to this town\n>Tells me I’m fired\n>Go back to club\n>See cool chick\n>(only one of two people who actually treats me like a human being)\n>Talk to her\n>She calls me a stalker, I’m not sure why\n>Unable to defend myself\n>Weird basement guy tells me not to worry, invites me to another party\n>All I do is wander around and go to parties\n>Flashbacks of my real 20’s\n>Kill time until party by opening random doors and hacking a frying pan\n>Maybe I started a fire\n>Pass out in front of weird laser gate\n>Did I get electrocuted, or did I just fall asleep?\n>Go back to party\n>Weird guy tells me to loosen up and talk to girls\n>Girls all give me cold shoulder\n>Against better judgement, I drink several beers\n>Carry empties around with me because I can’t set them on counter\n>Weird guy tells me about a test\n>Won’t tell me how to take test, where to take test, or what I need to know to pass test\n>Worst party ever\n>Cool chick shows up again\n>She’s actually happy to see me\n>Try not to sound like stalker, kinda succeed, but I think I’m missing half the conversation\n>Also, I think cool chick might have a drinking problem\n>Me too, I’m staggering around\n>Drink coffee to try and sober up\n>Doesn’t work\n>Not having fun\n>Leave party\n>Kick lamp\n>Go to bed\n>Not tired enough to fall asleep\n>Wander around town, stumbling drunk, at 5 AM\n>Flashbacks to a dark time in my real life\n>Take drugs so time passes faster, flashbacks intensify\n>Talk to strangers since what else am I supposed to do\n>No one wants to talk to me\n>Cringingly accurate simulator of awkward college party years\n>Not fun game\n\nI hear from other reviews that this game starts to pick up after this point, but I can't do it anymore. I've already invested a lot of time and energy into this game for little to no return. I'm not going to study guides and waste more time on this game just so I can dig the nuggets of fun out of this wasted youth simulator. I will say that it did a really good job of making me role-play an awkward alcoholic with no job prospects and zero understanding of how to talk to women, living out of a ****** hotel room. But I've already played the real life version of that, so I can't recommend it. If you want to play a fun game about programming, go with Human Resource Machine. If you want a good role-playing game about hackers, go with Shadowrun. If you want to pay money and spend your leisure time feeling really depressed about your 20's, then I can recommend Else Heart.Break(), but maybe you'd be better off talking to a friend about it instead.\n- For the past 4 years I couldn't get myself to finish a single game without having to force myself to do it(and even then I failed). I couldn't enjoy SP games no matter how good the gameplay or the story was. I kept buying games hoping to find that one game that would do the trick. This was FF XV for me. Despite of all my friends advising me against buying it because it was just going to be another game that would sit around in my library, I decided to give it a try.\n\nIt actually felt like I went back in time to when I could play SP games for hours without getting bored after an hour or two.\n\nI admit I skipped most sidequests and I'll try going back to them sooner or later, although it may not be the best game out there in terms of content(you can finish the game on easy skipping most secondary quests in about 20-25 hours) or story development, playing through it felt like a new experience. In fact, even after finishing the game there's still plenty of things to do and in my opinion, even playing it through again just to spend more time with Noctis and his friends is worth it.\n\nThe story is not mindblowing, the combat system is really fun but far from flawless, most sidequests aren't well written but at its core, at least for me, FF XV has something to it that other games lack. I can't say it magically restored my old passion for gaming but it has given me a reason to at least try to get into it again.\n\nIf you haven't played it yet I sincerely envy you, I would love to experience it all over again from the start, it has been a memorable journey to say the least and I hope that you are willing to give it a try. ^^\n- holy fucking shit everything about this fucking mongoloid game is so fucking bad i can't even begin to understand. this was supposed to be better than the first piece of shit, but i dunno, maybe a tiny bit.\n\ndon't be like me and get baited into wasting your hard earned money for this fucking shit even if it's on like -90% sale.\n\nspecial mention to worst fucking controls in the history of fucking gaming. fuck these fucking mongoloid fucking retard faggots for making a game this fucking bad. uninstalled.\n\n英語で5-10単語程度で、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない主要な違いを簡潔に回答してください。\n\n回答：\n",

There is also another spot you can use to build a specific building which will help you like radars.\n\nYou will use that ore to start research (new weapons, speed and whatnot) and upgrade your train (called an AMP) and build more defenses. Each building is protected by a force field which will make them hard to destroy and also protect you while you are docked to build, upgrade, repair or collect ores.\n\nYou can move freely on the track and control the speed of your AMP, change direction, change track direction and get a sattelite view to help you fight the enemy.\n\nBasically, fighting works as in an artillery game...\nThe map is always covered with fog of war but when an enemy or you fire, you will produce noise which will be clearly indicated on the map. This is when you will be able to use your recon ability to launch a projectile which will show you the area for a couple seconds and you can then fire.\nEach time you fire, you have to take into account the wind which can make your projectile miss, firing right now use a bowstring but it is going to disapear. Your firing range is also limited so you do have to travel near the opponent to be able to hit it.\n\nAnd that's pretty much it. The concept is quite inovative, it works pretty well and it will get a lot better in the future.\nIf you're scared to purchase the game right away becaue of the early access tag, I advise you to keep it in a corner and wait for it to evolve until the development reach a more advanced point because the game is pretty unique and quite beautiful.\nRight now controlling and managing the trains can be a bit tedious and not really easy to master but I think we can trust the devs team to find a solution to the problems.\n- Pros:\n\n+ Game mechanics that you would expect from a city builder\n\n+Built in modding tools\n\n+Beautiful Graphics\n\n+It's challanging (learning curve)\n\n+No lag, and I have a computer that doesn't meet the requirements\n\n+Lots of replayability\n\nCons:\n\n-takes over your life\n\n***\n\nSpecs that are below the minimum requirements:\n\n2.8ghz (3.0 is the minimum)\n\nAMD Radeon HD 8400 video card ( nVIDIA GeForce GTX 260, 512 MB  or ATI Radeon HD 5670, 512 MB is the minimum)\n\nEverything else is above the minimum required.\n- So, I only found this game because my favorite Vtuber Miilkywayz on Twitch played it. It seemed pretty interesting but when she started making her own cards. As an IRL witch I was WAY more interested. The game itself is great, I love making cards and learning their meanings and seeing how how the story changes changes based on your deck and the cards drawn. And the replaybility of it is amazing given its price. 10/10 from me. Need more games like this.\n- everyone posting 16 gb ram specs and saying it runs well, lul\n\ni have 8 gigs of ram with a gtx 660 (yep) and a fx-8350 and it runs around 45-60 FPS (i cap it at 60) at High settings. yeah. REALLY well optimized, considering this computer is nearing the end of its life and the visuals are gorgeous.\n\nEDIT: 1080p :)\n\noh, and it's fun too, right.\n\nEdit 2- Actual review\n\nGame is pretty easy. I forget if there was a hard mode, but if there was I picked normal mode, and the game feels like it should be on easy. I've yet to break a sweat on a boss (currently chapter 5), and the only thing stopping me from taking on enemies 10+ higher than me is that the game auto-nerfs your damage if the enemy is too far above you. I've actually found the game very relaxing as a result, because there isn't the frustration of having to redo bosses after getting wiped, so it's not entirely a bad thing. But if you were looking for a challenge in your battles, this isn't your game.\n\nAs for story, it's also fairly basic, and rides off of having a sizeable to-do list as sidequests. Recruiting new citizens, doing major sidequest chains, unlocking new stuff, it's got a good amount to do in-game to keep you occupied, unless you're a \"main quest line only\" player. It helps that the warp system is easy to use (and you will use it often) and the game is gorgeous, so you don't really feel too bored doing the same shet over and over again. \n\nThere are several elements to the gameplay. \n\nOne, the overworld traversing. Overall, I'm ambivalent to it. It can feel slightly sluggish at parts, but collecting the shiny areas is surprisingly addicting (maybe because I'm a sem-completionist), as are finding chests. The unfortunate part is that most of these chests contain utterly useless items, so don't really feel that rewarding. \n\nTwo, dungeon crawling. Have to admit this is one of the weaker parts for me. The dungeons are basic, and don't really have much in the way of puzzling elements. Could change later, highly doubt it will. I do like how the battles are seamless, though.\n\nThree, army battles. Also not much of a fan of this, but only because it seems like a side addition without much depth to it. Fortunately it's not a major part of the game, so meh.\n\nFour, kingdom management. Holy cow I love this part of it. People might complain it feels like a mobile game with the wait times and whatever, but since you can warp straight back to your castle whenever you want, it's not that big of an issue. I do wish your gains accumulated while you're offline (or tabbed out, at least...), but idk something about managing the kingdom and making it grow/level up is stupidly addicting.\n\nOverall, if you're looking for a challenging or engaging JRPG, this might not be the game for you. If you're looking for a game with gorgeous visuals, fantastic voice acting (using JP), laid-back atmosphere, and want to be the president of the United States serving some random kid as his vassal, highly recommended.\n\nHighly recommend to play on controller. I'm using the Switch Pro Con.\n- Hello Charlotte is not a game; it is a confessional.\nIf you're here you've probably already realized, but I wish to place massive emphasis that Hello Charlotte, and Hello Charlotte 3 especially, has very little gameplay, and what is present is very standard RPGMaker fare. If you are the kind to balk at visual novels, HC3 will not be your cup of tea. Watch a playthrough or something if you're interested, but don't expect any kind of engaging play.\nWith that said: Hello Charlotte 3 (and its DLC, Heaven's Gate) has been one of the most emotional, impactful pieces of art I've ever engaged with. It is horrifically honest, incorrigibly vulnerable, and, as previously stated-- more a confessional than a game. With everything I know how to say and with everything I have to say about it, I cannot find a way to truly articulate what Hello Charlotte made me feel (still makes me feel) and how it has affected me.\n\nHello Charlotte: Childhood's End is from the perspective not of the Charlotte of the previous two games, but a new, blank slate PC. While not necessary to play the previous two games, I strongly recommend it. It develops on the themes of the previous two games, and in doing so, completely recontextualizes them. C and Anri of HC2 return, as does Scarlett, though not in the forms we are accustomed to. We are finally given a full understanding on the nature of Charlotte and the False Realm, and what we are in relation to it.\netherane's art has markedly improved since the second game, with impressive sprite and background artwork, though their style is still recognizable. The music (some composed by etherane, others outsourced) is varied and distinctive. Most prominent about etherane's work, however, are the themes and writing, which have matured considerably since the release of HC2. Though often garish and on the nose, HC3 is a poignant commentary on the nature of art and fiction, the impact we have on one another, and our understanding of realness itself.\nYou will experience confusion. You will experience whiplash. The game intends to make you unsure and uncomfortable in its consumption, <i>deliberately</i> so. In the process it becomes a jarring, distinctive work of art unique to its creator and an important representation of the Millenial psyche. It's a psychological horror game and by God will it force you to experience psychological horror.\n- [h1]First of all, NISA... the elephant in the room needs addressing.[/h1]\nIf you're going to use D3D11 and try to do stuff multi-threaded, use a 64-bit executable.\n\nMemory allocation and thread pooling work much better in a 64-bit environment. 32-bit doesn't really expand your market share any but causes several compatibility headaches (including memory fragmentation in your resource manager). Please, NISA, stop fooling around with legacy APIs (i.e. WinMM for gamepad input and OpenGL 1.x as you did in Disgaea) and outdated ABIs.  D3D11 / 64-Bit should be the target environment for software longevity.\n\nI get the impression you believe that OLDER means more compatible, but you've got the whole PC development paradigm upside down. Old stuff is simply old, period.\n\nI would encourage you to review the guidelines for authoring Windows Store software, Microsoft's policies for Windows Store are designed to reduce legacy software maintenance problems. You need not follow them, but they will give you a pretty good idea of the APIs and ABIs that are relevant / native / not running through compatibility layer redtape. Do this and I believe you will find PC development much less troublesome.\n\n\n\n\n[list][i]With that out  of the way, I would like to point out that NISA patches their games more than any developer I have ever seen.[/i][/list]\n\n\nI personally believe this game is best suited for the Nintendo Switch, but PC will have a stable version by the time the Switch version ships. I have already authored a number of fixes for texture aliasing that guarantee image quality-wise, the PC version is where you would expect it to be. We just need NISA to polish the rest of the stuff :)\n\nTake early reviews with a grain of salt because NISA's going to be busy patching this game for months if Disgaea is any indication. Price complaints are probably the only aspect of current reviews that will remain valid. I tend to agree, the asking price is not what it should be for a game that's not exactly finished.\n\n\n\n[h1]I am leaving a positive review because I have faith NISA will stick with it, but ...[/h1]\n\n[list][list]You shouldn't rush to buy this game by any means. [b]Wait it out.[/b][/list][/list]\n- It's illegal that this game is free.\n- The premise is that you're a passenger on a ship, waking up on the morning after you've murdered your well-to-do husband. From that point, you're free to go anywhere on board to do whatever you can to avoid justice within the time limit. You could just try to play dumb and cover up enough evidence to put your guilt into doubt. If you're more devious you could try to frame one of your fellow passengers. You could even go the And Then There Were None route and murder everyone else on board just to be thorough, if you can pull it off.\n\nOverboard! was clearly designed for replayability. The ship is full of evidence and red herrings to tamper with, desperate schemes to attempt, and secrets to learn. The first playthrough reveals only a small slice of all this, leaving a collection of unsolved mysteries and unfollowed leads to pursue on the second. The second playthrough prepares you for the third, and so on, until finally you beat the game... but there's much more to it than that. Vague, but I don't want to spoil anything.\n\nThis game was released today without any kind of announcement beforehand from inkle. As usual, their writing and design are superb. If you're captivated by the premise, even by a little, you won't regret the purchase.\n- Gone Home is... okay. There's nothing particularly terrible about it, but it's hardly this amazing, revelatory experience that it's been portrayed as in the media. It's just a very short, straightforward game of exploration, in which a fairly simple story of teenage love and rebellion is fed to you through bits and pieces of notes and spoken journal entries you find while exploring a large, abandoned house. But this game does absolutely nothing innovative, unlike the pre-release hype proclaimed. There have been hundreds of games with more compelling stories, and this game introduces no original mechanics. I took my time and explored the entire house, and I beat the game in three sessions totalling 81 minutes.\n\nAgain, it's not bad, it's just an utter ripoff for $20. I got it in a large Humble Bundle package, paying about a dollar for it, and it's decent value at that price, but there's no way I'd pay more than five bucks, and even that is stretching it. I'd be pissed if I'd paid full retail for it. You can find many many games that will be far more engrossing, more entertaining, and just plain longer at this price point.\n- Zor strikes again, but agent phoenix is there to stop him! Another great VR puzzle game from Schell, with lot of jokes, hidden stuff and extra challenges for replayability. Took me 4h to finish base game, now time for achievements hunt!\n- [h1]Strategy at its finest[/h1]\n\nInto the Breach is Subset Game’s latest title, following on from their massive hit, FTL. I put off trying Into the Breach for a long while, but I finally got it when it dropped down to $10 on HB a couple of months ago and I’m so glad I did. This game isn’t for everyone, it’s kind of rogue-like mech chess, but if it clicks for you then it’ll be one of the best strategy games you’ll ever play.\n\n[h1]Positives:[/h1]\n[list][*]First up, the game looks fantastic. The pixel art here is great, from the backgrounds to the mechs and even the pilot portraits. The animations here area also really good. There’s nothing too complicated here but it’s all well executed. On the topic of appearances, I also really like the way the maps are laid out, the 8x8 grids on a plain background work really well here and it reminds me of simple boardgames. I think it works well for the game.\n\n[*]As with any good strategy game, it’s easy to pick up, but hard to master. You have a squad of three mechs (there are a few different mech groups to unlock with gold coins (?) and you can also create custom groups from the mechs you’ve unlocked). Each group has a unique element, but they all follow the basic structure of one close-range mech, one long-range mech and one support mech. Each mech has a different ability/weapon and they’re all well varied. The mech teams are really well designed here so that no one mech is super powerful and they all work really well as a unit. \n\n[*]The combat is excellent. It’s really simple but it works so well. You’ll quickly learn the different roles your mechs have and figure out the best strategies to use them. There are two ways to kill most enemies. Getting rid of all of their HP or pushing them into water/lava (with the exception of boss enemies or flying enemies). However, a lot of the time you probably won’t even be trying to kill your enemies in a given turn. You can always see what the enemies will do on their next turn and so you always want to be playing to react to/prevent their next move. Typically, enemies target civilian buildings or buildings related to your objective, so it’s usually better to focus on moving them away from these buildings rather than focusing on killing them. If you’re really smart/lucky you can also push enemies so that they attack each other, as friendly fire is a major part of this game. It’s really satisfying when you line it up right so the enemies are killing each other rather than attacking you or the buildings you defend. You can even block them from spawning by moving something on top of them!\n\n[*]Unlocks in this game are handled better than in FTL in my opinion. There are six actions that you can complete with each mech squad to earn those gold coins I mentioned in order to unlock new mech squads. The first three are the three possible victories: two, three and four island (more on that in a second) and then the other three achievements are unique to each mech squad. They’re centred around the unique aspect of each squad, tasking you to get a bit creative with the way that you’re playing. I know some players didn’t like the way that unlocks worked but I think it’s a really good way to handle it and encourages you to try new strategies. \n\n[*]The game has five islands, with one of those being the final boss fight. Each island is basically a different biome with different enemies and environmental hazards. They aren’t necessarily easier or harder than each other to start with, but the difficulty does increase as you move from island to island. There is some crossover with the enemies you’ll see, but they at the very least have a different appearance and most of them behave differently. There are also enemies unique to each island. \n\n[*]On each island, you’ll need to complete several missions before facing off against the island’s mini-boss. The missions all have different objectives for you to complete, though the win condition is always just to survive all of the turns (typically 5 turns). The different objectives vary but there are usual two, with some easier missions only having one and harder missions having three. Completing these objectives gets you certain rewards. You can either get stars, which are used upon completing an island to purchase new pilots, abilities or weapons. There is grid power which restores or increases the grid power you start with (grid power is lost when buildings are destroyed, losing all grid power results in a loss). Lastly, some of the missions award power cores (usually you only see this as the third reward for a hard mission) which allow you to upgrade your mech’s weapons or abilities (super handy). The mission variety is fairly good.\n\n[*]There are a range of different pilots in the game. You always start with one ‘special’ pilot and two regular pilots but more can be found in cryo-pods or bought at the end-of-island store. All pilots earn xp at the end of missions and when they level up they get some kind of upgrade, like more mech health or an extra movement per turn. The ‘special’ pilots all have some kind of special ability, such as being able to attack twice if you don’t move or the ability for the piloted mech to fly. Some of these require a power core, but they’re definitely worth it.  [/list]\n\n[h1]Negatives: [/h1]\n[list][*]Honestly, I’m clutching at straws here for negatives. One thing I would mention is that I don’t think this game will have as much replay value as FTL does for most people (completionists have an awful lot to do here) which shouldn’t put you off from getting it, but is something to base your expectations on. I also felt like Chris Avellone was a bit wasted on this game, his writing is fantastic but there just isn’t much of it. [/list]\n\n[h1]Verdict: [/h1]\n\nInto the Breach is as close to a perfect strategy game as I’ve ever played and it’s an excellent follow-up to FTL. This game is easy to pick up, hard to master and it looks beautiful the whole time you’re playing this weird mech chess. I can’t recommend this enough and at $15 it’s an absolute steal. This was easily one of my favourite releases of 2018 and anyone who likes strategy absolutely needs this in their library. \n\nIf you found this review helpful, please check out my other reviews over at [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33633486/]Kemo's Corner.[/url]\n-     \nI was impatient for this game and i am very satisfied with it!\n\nThe Graphics are polished as would expect, the new circuits in Las Vegas and Losail in Qatar are very good together with others that we run at night the effects of the lights in conjunction with the illuminated buildings are incredible!\n\nBraking Point 2 is so satisfying it takes between 8 to 10 hours to complete, no spoilers i think but we have a lot of characters and some familiar faces from the past!\n\nNew F1 World, offers a structure of different Series, each one is a chain of events with having a primary objective that needs to complete to progress to the next, secundary objectives can be pursued for extra rewards!\n\nCareer Mode identical to the previous ones!\n\nRed Flag Deploying will teleport the cars to the pits where we can change our strategy to restart the race!\n\nDriving and Feedback, overall there is a big improvement more precise and dynamic the ffb on the steering wheel is very good, with Gamepad it's easy to adapt and get top times!\n\n\nWhen an update comes out just don't screw up the handling!\n\nF1 23 is better than the previous ones in every way!\n  \n\n- [H1]At this price point it's hard not to recommend it, but there's a lot -better- bullet hell games out there...[/H1]\n\nDanmaku unlimited as a series is great. Don't get me wrong. It really is. But it suffers the curse of being put in with a field on Steam that is made up of even greater company. Bug Princess by Cave has the brutal difficulty angle sewn up, Ikaruga has the absolute classic angle nailed, Jamestown has the glorious pixel-art sorted. In order to stand out in this genre, you absolutely have to bring something new to the table.\n\nAs good as Danmaku Unlimited is, it does not bring anything new to the table. It brings a lot of -good-, but nothing -new-. The greatest sin here is that if you've played a lot of bullet hells, this is going to feel immensely familiar, and you're going to blast through it fast, nothing is prone to catch you out. At all. Now that may be a plus point, if that's what you're after, but if you're seeking something to change up the formula? Yeeeeee-no.\n\n[H1]So it's the Bullet Hell version of Destiny?[/H1]\n\nMechanically, it works great. You have a ship with a teeny tiny hitbox, same as most \"Eastern\" BHell games, you have anywhere between \"Mildly offensive\" and \"Absolutely terrifying\" levels of hostile fire coming toward you, and you pump out similarly scary levels of fire back, with your only choice generally being \"Do I spam the screen with lots of little beams or do I fire ONE BIG BEAM at something that needs cracking open like a walnut.\"\n\nIt has good Bullet Hell music, albeit not outstanding music, it has good graphics, albeit not outstanding graphics, you see a pattern here? If a game could ever nail what I'd define as the absolute essence of an \"8 out of 10\", this would be it. The problem is there's games out there such as Revolver360 Re:Actor that do -better-.\n\nThe problem is that for all the good it does, it's been beaten to it by other games, maybe not in every field, but in each area I can name at least two or three games that stand above it. The one area it does win out on is bang for the buck. It's kinda hard to argue with this kind of quality at this kind of price point. It's a very, very solid return on investment, particularly if you're a bullet hell fan.\n\n[H1]Closing Thoughts[/H1]\n\nDoes that make this a \"Do not buy\"? Far from it. If you're a fan of bullet hells, chances are you already own it. If you don't, eventually you should, but I'd genuinely suggest you look around first, there's a decent market now on Steam for this genre, and there's more innovative and interesting options around. If however you've already consumed them and you need a fix of something fairly solid and fairly entertaining, then sure, this works, it will scratch the itch quite nicely.\n\nVerdict : [b]Buy, definitely worth grabbing on a sale, if only to put in the \"To do\" list,[/b]\n- Write a review they said.. alright.. here it is... \n\nI am at year 5, day 29, Population 250, its winter right now in my little village.. my vikings are freezing, but they should not be. I have stores of coal available to them but they just do not go get it. \n\non a scale of 1 - 10, right now.. a solid solid 7. Why just a 7, well.. its new.. its not finished yet.. and still a tiny bit buggy. \n\nGameplay. It's good.. but i would really like to be able to grab the map with a left click hold and drag it around that way. The camera movement when trying to move the map is slow.. too slow for me. Also the fact that you have to clear whatever you have selected before you can selected the next thing you want to build. \n\nGraphics... VERY nice.. love it.. everything has great detail. People walking really nicely. Now for the not great part.. zoom in on a fishing boat.. boats moving.. oars. well.. they are not moving, I think I have even seen a fisherperson sleeping in the boat as well.. little more on the animations will probably be inserted at a later time.. but I thought it humorous, People also do tend to walk right into the side of a mountain and vanish.. then poof.. they walk back out at another area. \n\nHousing:  Great looks on both the poor and good housing. the option to just upgrade from poor to good would be nice.. \n\nStorage: Storage needs some work.. seriously.. So you have the Wood storage and you have stone storage.. they are basicly the same looking building.. I'd like to see them combined, with that being said.. please add COAL and IRON as well. Make it so that we can set whats to be stored in that building and make it have workers.. that way we can have dedicated vikings move the specific stuff.. \n\nWater: Please allow the area of coverage to overlap.. OR. make the coverage a square so we can fully cover the areas.\n\nFOOD: You gave us these great fields to use. But um.. can we grow something other than wheat and barley? like. potatoes? carrots? I mean, the vikings didn't only eat meat and bread?(but i am also aware the games still in progress)\n\nThe only real issue I have had with the game so far on my system is I was spending point on the tree and when I went back to the village it was gone and I had to reload. I do know once in a while a reload will fix the workers from gathering resources but it doesn't always work.\n\nSo over all I really enjoy this game. I'd definitely recommend  this game to anyone who enjoys city building survival type game. \n\nHope everyone enjoys this game...\n- Hi dev, if you were wondering whether anyone would actually use your HDR feature, I am. thanks\n- When I first played Battlefield 1 it literally sent me to the hospital, cause you’re supposed to seek immediate medical attention if your erection lasts longer than 4 hours.\n\nThis is easily one of the most badass games  in history. The music, the landscape, the gunplay, the hit register and the satisfying kill effect, EVERYTHING is just amazing. The last true Battlefield game. I enjoyed every second of this amazing game.  \n\nBF1 isn’t fully historically accurate but it is historically immersive. The war stories in this game genuinely made me emotional sometimes and I’m not ashamed to admit that. \n\nAs someone who is more on the “historical accuracy” side of games, I can say without a doubt that Battlefield 1 did an incredible job. Hell, they were even able to be diverse without pandering to anybody! The 1st Russian Women’s Battalion of Death, the Harlem Hellfighters, people from French-occupied northwestern Africa, the list goes on. What sets this game’s inclusivity of a variety of people and groups from other games is that it does so when it has a reason to and is still accurate to the time and setting. \n\nThat’s one of the main reasons why Battlefield 5 pissed me off so much. Instead of a British woman with a prosthetic arm wielding a cricket bat in WW2, why not include Lyudmila Pavlichenko, aka Lady Death, a female Russian sniper who had 309 confirmed kills? What about the French women who fought? They were in extremely small numbers, but they were a thing. Historically accurate inclusion is fucking awesome, and I love when games do it. But inclusivity for its own sake is terrible and it cheapens said character’s presence in the game’s setting. \n\nEven the DLC are fantastic. I remember how amazing I felt when the “for the Tsar” DLC came out and I first played it. I have never seen people fight so hard to the death in a video game without a whole lot of rage. It was amazing. I felt like I was part of the Russian revolution. Please do yourself a favor and buy this game.\n\n9/10\n\nOnly gave it a 9 ‘cause the 1 is already there…\n- I purposefully went into this game looking for bugs, seeing that it was in early access, and I have yet to find any. The only reason I stopped playing was because there was a fence that wasn't fully secured to the ground that I was able to get underneath, allowing me to get out of bounds. This lead to me falling into an area where I couldn't get out, and it wouldn't let me respawn at my most recent checkpoint. This would mean I'd have to start from the beginning, which I very much didn't want to do. Anyway, the biggest tips I can give to the developers is to make sure the map is 100% how they want it, and to make the audio design better. That's it. I may come back and change my review in the future.\n\nFINAL RATING: 4 / 10\n- One of the best most fun and addicting all-time games. However, the plants should be nazi's and the zombies should be jews. There is also a hispanic snail in your garden that sleeps on the job.\n- EDIT:\n\nWhile I have played Squad quite a bit for a few years, the large update named \"V6.0 Infantry Combat Overhaul\" unfortunately did not sit well with me.\n\nThe goals for the update:\n\n- Increase length of fights.\n- Reduce the impact of lone wolfs (solo players).\n- Increase emphasis on teamwork mechanics, which mainly meant supression.\n- Increase gunplay diversity, to create choices between optics, since the old meta meant that the magnified optics were greatly outperforming iron sights and holo sights.\n\nWhile I do not disagree with some of the goals, the implementation of them left a lot to be desired.\n\nAfter the update most gunfights became a mess of supression, without either side being able to effetively kill each other beyond 200m.\nGunhandling was also drastically nerfed, creating the sense that your character has never held a rifle before, or even used an optic for that matter.\n\nI can unfortunately no longer recommend this game, since I myself no longer feel drawn to play it.\n\nIf enough changes are made, I may revisit the game and this review, but for now there are better options out there.\n\n\n** OLD REVIEW ** \n\nCan the game be amazing and fun - yes! Do I recommend this for everyone? - No.\n\nThe experience of the game largely depends on what servers / communities you play with. If you play the core game with no moderation (no rules or admins), the game will become a race to make the first unit and lock others out and a race to get armor, then proceed to rush the enemy and end up spawnkilling them near their main spawn.\n\nIf you play on moderated servers with established rules and active admins, then you may experience a great sense of teamplay - other times not so much.\n\nBefore you buy it though...\n\n- Microphone and willingness to use it is REQUIRED for a good experience (People will quickly kick or become hostile towards you, if you do not communicate)\n- This is not battlefield or call of duty, running of solo to pull off 360 noscopes will probably get you kicked/ killed.\n- You will die without knowing from where and you will get into situations in which you have no option to survive, especially if you're new to tactical shooters.\n- You will end up running... A lot..\n- Armor is not like battlefield or call of duty, you need a driver, gunner, commander and possibly a loader (has a machinegun). Where you hit the enemy matters as much as what you hit him with (Armor piercing on his front turret will likely bounce, but even a high explosive may hurt if you can hit him up the rear)\n\nStill here... ?\n\nIf I haven't scared you off, here are my personal tips:\n- Play. The. Tutorial.  Like really...\n- Try different graphic settings, shadows especially makes a big difference in enemy visibility (game looks better with them though)\n- Start as infantry and pick rifleman, but remember to join a squad.\n- Find a server that seems to have active admins and have a ruleset you agree with.\n- Try NOT to give up when you die, generally it isn't worth throwing away a ticket to respawn if you have friendlies within 100m. Sometimes it is the right choice, but before you know which is which, it's a good idea to hold on for a medic.\n- Not all squad leaders know what they're doing, do not be afraid to join another squad if it turns out your squad leader is a fool.\n- Defending is often as important (if not more), than attacking... But you may end up waiting 30 minutes without getting shot at or shooting anyone.\n\n\nAs you can probably tell... Squad is a community based game, with in-depth enough mechanics, while also being easily accessable.\nIf you want a good sense of what the game is, check out some lesser known streamer playing it (bigger streamers will often give you the wrong sense of what a game is like)\n\nHope this helped you make an informed decision.\n\nbut for now there are better options out there.\n- BE ADVISED!!!\nif u are from asia, just don't buy it! there is no server for us.\nwe can't found any server even from EU & NA\n- Stephen's Sausage Roll is a game that the developer doesn't want normal people to buy, it seems. The description is literally, \"A simple 3d puzzle game.\", there is one video that shows you nothing about the game, and it's priced at $32 CND.\n\nFortunately, I'm here to tell you to get off your ass and to buy this wonderful game. The graphics are alright, the music is OK, but the puzzles are sublime.\n\nIn each level, the goal is the same: cook all the sausages and exit the level by standing on the exit level sign in the right orientation. You cook sausages by pushing them over a grill. Like in sokoban games, you can't pull the sausage (yet...), only push it. Another huge wrinkle is that sides of the sausage can only touch the grill once. If you touch a cooked side of a sausage to the grill, it will be burned and you fail the level. This little wrinkle will make you pull your hair out in some levels as you try and figure out how the hell you are going to maneuver the sausages around so they get cooked properly. A neat thing about the game is that if you fail, you can still continue playing the level, which might help you figure out how to play it.\n\nYou'll have a section (part of an island) that has a number of puzzles for you to solve in any order, so if you get stuck, you can try another one (until you get to the last puzzle of the section). Once you complete a section, a new section will open up with more puzzles.\n\nYour little guy has tank controls, which you will find extremely useful, as turning to the left or right near a sausage will push it in different directions. A nice detail is that the all of the puzzles make up the island section. When you activate a puzzle, the rest of the island drops away into the sea, leaving you on a tiny puzzle island.\n\nEach section introduces new mechanics into the game. First you'll just be pushing the sausages, but then you'll be stacking them, skewering them (you would think this would make things easier, but no! You can't turn when you have a skewered sausage!), walking on them...\n\nI would say that these levels are on the level of Snakebird, though I found many of them easier than Snakebird's puzzles (maybe I'm better at sokoban games than I know?). These are the kind of puzzles that you walk away from frustrated, but come back to a few hours later with the solution. This is the game where there are so many ah-ha! moments that make you feel smart. You have no idea what to do at first, but eventually you get better and better. You might not see solutions at first, but you begin to see where you need to go to solve the puzzle, and then work backwards from there. It's wonderful!\n\nIf you're having trouble, there's a community guide that has all the solutions, which is super helpful (though not as much when I was playing because it wasn't complete!).\n\nIt might be expensive, but I took 36 hours to solve all the puzzles and it was worth every penny.\n- [b]Playing status:[/b] 100% achievement\n[b]Grindy Achievement(s):[/b] No.\n[b]Optional Achievement(s):[/b] Yes (9 achievements).\n[b]Difficult Achievement(s):[/b] No.\n\n[h1]Intro[/h1]\nYou were sure that you weren't supposed to be here: a dark forest with a thick mist surrounding over it.

You might want to familiarize yourself with Japanese terms though.[/i]\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1]In-Depth Review[/h1]\n\n[h3]Visuals[/h3]\nThe game is presented in 2D pixelated art. As an RPG Maker game, all of its assets and interfaces have been customized, leaving no trace of the default one. It does a good job with the interface though - everything looks beautifully made and straight to the point. The maps are also done well to promote the areas, whether it's the bustling city or the abandoned village. The areas, although usually depicted at night, are still easy to see with their blue-ish colors. Everything is done well to help you enjoy the scenery.\n\n[h3]Story[/h3]\nThe main selling point of the game is in its storytelling. The world of [b]Tales of the Black Forest[/b] is separated into 3 interconnecting chapters, each focusing on someone and the event that was happening around them. The story has a different vibe on each chapter, although one thing is certain: it does a good job in delivering a heartwarming story at the end. I know that creating good storytelling with just 2D sprites is not easy, but this game does it seamlessly.\n\nSince the storytelling focuses on a different person in each chapter, the story is obviously non-linear. You'll find some clues of what was happening to a certain event, which will help you in understanding another event in a bigger picture. It might be hard to keep track of all of them, especially with the recurring names, but the game is kind enough to give you some explanation about it. There might still be some mysteries lying around, but I found it to be concluded nicely at the end.\n\nThe translation might hinder you from enjoying the story to its fullest. It tends to not translate some words, whether it's some locations or simple terms. Some words like \"komusume-chan\" can be translated into English nicely without ruining the sentences, but the translator decides to just give a translation note surrounded in brackets when you encounter it for the first time. People who do not know Japanese terms might have trouble understanding these words sometimes, especially when you also have to remember a lot of Japanese names in the process.\n\n[h3]The Game[/h3]\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nAlthough the story is the main focus of the game, there were times when you have to walk around, whether to initiate another cutscene or solve some puzzles. Important objects are marked in the game, making it easier to locate where you are supposed to look. If you are the adventurer type, some additional dialogues will also available to give a conclusion to some characters after you progress the story. They are not related to the main story though, so you can safely ignore them if you choose to do so.\n\nSeveral puzzles are available to break the repetitiveness. Puzzles in the first half of the game usually take the form of finding some number combinations based on the provided hints, although the second half of the game starts to be more creative with its puzzle-like minigame. I wish that the game will do these puzzles right from the start since it helps to break the monotonous pace.\n\n[b]Length and Replayability[/b]\nThe game lasts for about ~5h. Despite it having two endings, the point of no return is obvious and the game is kind enough to tell what you have to do to reach both endings. That being said, there is no point to replay the game since you can save before the point of no return to unlock both endings at once.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nIt's been a while since I found a quality RPG Maker game on Steam. I didn't expect that it will do a good job with its storytelling. The music, art, and dialogue - everything helps to enhance the story, giving this heartwarming feeling after you read it. I was satisfied with the story, although I admit that I got bored sometimes because of the number of dialogues that I had to read. The game is completely not for those who don't like visual novels, and people who appreciate the story aspect in a game will enjoy it to the fullest.\n\n[quote]Visit SaveOrQuit.com for detailed game reviews, posted daily![/quote]\n- This is trash, I mean if you eat shit for breakfast I'm sure you'll like it.  You have to pay to have access to graphics better than the PS2's, also your stuff gets deleted every week. All there is to do is punch a couple zombies.  Don't get this game.\n- Great game, Horrible new publishers who stole the IP from the original creators. Do not support these thieves\n- No better CO-OP Experience, even decent solo, just remember the golden CO-OP rules:\n-Never push buttons without the whole team green lighting\n-Always Rock and Stone back\n-Never steal another dwarves drink. \n-Dont double dip Resupply pods without asking\n\n\nIf you choose to accept a contract with Deep Rock Galactic, good luck brother, see you in the caves.\n- Mori's 3-Part Review:\n1. Bare minimum information and recommendations to improve your playthrough\n2. Background information on me and my playthrough\n3. More extensive non-spoiler reactions\n \nPart 1: Recommendations for You\nIf you're like me and you try to get all the extra scene dialogue, then please, if you take nothing else from this, give yourself time to play this game yourself. There is actually so much content here, I really want you all to take your time to experience it as you go. The game is just too long to binge in a reasonably short amount of time, and if you do binge, you're going to lose a lot.\n \nMy recommendations:\n1. Give yourself time to play the game. Let it sink in, and take notes- it'll be rewarded. The game is literally too dense and too long to binge reasonably if you like 100%ing.\n \n2. Get invested in the characters and pay attention to them, not just the (admittedly stellar) mysteries.\n \n3. Explore the game, its mechanics, and its dialogue yourself. Don't be afraid to restart a Somnium several times; the more options you pick, the more meaningful information you get.\n \n4. If you're a puzzle lover then try to solve the game yourself. You're going to have a blast if you manage it, and the game has tons of built-in hint systems to make it even easier, fairer, and more fun.\n \n5. Try to go in knowing at little as you can. The marketing has already done a great job. Focus on finishing the game and bringing it all together.\n \n6. On PC, force anti-aliasing on using your graphics card to make the game prettier. Game ran and controlled smoothly with few bugs.\n \n7. You don't need AI1 to play AI2, but I think AI2 does spoil AI1, though you could still enjoy them in reverse order.\n \n7. If you're sensitive to horny then just read less background dialogue in Ryuki side. Gore is pretty toned down, and there isn't any single huge CW.\n \nYou can stop reading now if you don't want your playthrough tainted by my reactions/expectations effected.\n \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nPart 2: Who am I, and how do I play?\nI'm an Uchikoshi fanatic. I've played all his English-translated games, and visual novels are my favorite genre of game. I've played a lot of visuals novels, but Uchizawa's are my favorites. I usually try to 100% complete all the scenes and see all the bonus dialogue. I've also played a lot of other genres of game, and I do like fun gameplay, but the most important things to me tend to be:\n \nA. An interesting story is absolutely what gets me invested\nB. Bunches of novel ideas like unique plot points I haven't seen before, philosophical ideas, or puzzles\nC. Characters that I at least don't actively hate; I can like a game for the above two, but characters still matter\nD. Deep personal connection, usually formed by connections to real people or how a game shaped my life\n \nThose are the ways I rate my top games. For the last 8 years, my top 2 favorite games have been the same:\n \nMy top favorite game of all time is Remember11. I love the plot, the ideas, the twists, the characters, and it's what got me truly invested in Uchikoshi. It's very much a mystery game first with an unravelling mystery and themes I love to explore.\n \nMy second favorite game is Virtue's Last Reward. I love the interactive moral dilemmas. VLR's use of the Prisoner's Dilemma jumpstarted my interested in Philosophy which led me to major in Philosophy. I don't like the characters as much save for a few, but it's still very important to me.\n \nNow, let me tell you how I've played AINI: I've basically been playing non-stop since June 13th.\n \nTake this with a grain of salt because I've been documenting as I play (the average main story playtime seems to be 20-35 hours, with 100% likely taking 50+), but right now, I have 97 hours of playtime. I have not gotten all the dialogue, achievements, or fully explored the abundance of extra mechanics. Instead, I have a 616-page reaction document full of constant laughs, cries, screams, passing out, and most of all love.\n \nPart 3: My Review\nThe R11 #1 and VLR #2 holy duology held true for 8 years. Also, AI1 isn't one of my favorite standalone games; it has huge personal connection for me because of the community and the AI1 ARG, but it wasn't my favorite as a game.\n \nI gave all that background because I want you to take me seriously when I say this:\nAI2 is my new favorite game. The #1 spot has been Easily dethroned.\n \nThe themes, twists, characters, ideas, gameplay, visuals, voice acting, fair mystery, presentation, mechanics, and comedy all of it resonates together perfectly. I don't even tend to value gameplay or visuals, but at many times, this game is fun to play while looking genuinely beautiful and cinematic.\n \nThe story reads like a proper Uchikoshi + Nakazawa return to form. The mystery is fair, interesting, meaningful, and complex told satisfyingly. There are many deep ideas, concepts, and themes utilized in thought-provoking ways.\n \nGameplay-wise, there are tons of mechanics that are utilized to make each Somnium unique; they all feel designed by love, fair, and reflective of the character through gorgeous symbolism. They blow the first game completely out of the water. Each one is its own experience to explore and a visual delight. There are also tons of mechanics for you to discover that make AI2 a fun game to play.\n \nThe animations, voices, and directing are cinematic; this game is actually breathtaking a lot of the time. It's backed up by great and charming character writing- despite the fact Mizuki is my favorite AI1 character with 0 contest, I grew to like much of the AI2 cast the same amount.\n \nAI2 is a story about halves and splitting, but also love and coming together- please, see it through until it's whole. I hope and believe you will all fall in love with AI2 like me; AI2 is all I've ever wanted. AI2 is my dream game come true; it's a gorgeous love letter to all Uchikoshi fans who love Zero Escape's puzzles, Infinity's mysteries, and AI's characters and humor.\n- I thought I liked this game....  but after completing about half, I am super bored.  I quit the game after every battle.\n\nDeck building is super basic and kinda pointless.   No reason to adjust deck after you complete a few maps.  The maps are super easy.\n\nYou can basically just run around with 1 unit and kill everything...   Since movement costs a card, you either move one unit many times, or many units 1 time.   Easier to just move 1 strong unit around.\n\nI think I am the wrong demographic.  The storyline is for kids.   So maybe the target audience is 10 year olds with no strategy gaming experience.\n- This innocent-looking golf game really is not a golf game. Except it is a golf game. Except it isn't. Essentially, WTG? uses \"golf game\" as its medium, through which it tells a staggering number of jokes and punchlines. Expect the unexpected. But always expect there to be puns.\n- Are you looking for a medival game with great design and clever AI? Well then! ...keep looking. Just stop and turn around. I am serious. I know my \"game time\" says what? 10min? But its at least 2-3hours. \n\nI just sat there, trying to figure out what the heck I was supposed to do. Such as resources... why arent my people doing what I tell them to? My people just stand there and does nothing when i tell them to do something. \n\n\nIts like the developers decided \"meh, lets release and hope stupid people buy it so we can break even on this project\" becouse that attitude reflects how the game is. \n\n\nSave your money, walk away and spend them on something else. Litterly anything else...\n- Honestly I've put over 400 hours into 20XX and this game is even better! Even though it's unfinished as of current it's still a fantastic time and truly stands out on it's own.\n- [h2] Visual Novel Reviews [/h2]\n\n[b] TLDR [/b] Two scenes, no customization, no choices, character development needs work, but the Extremely short story delivered (If you know what I mean) a whopping 38 minutes of game play for me. \n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [th]Question[/th]\n        [th]Answer[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Buy Again[/td]\n        [td]No, I wouldn't.

[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[h3] Story: [/h3]\nThis game revolves around a neighbor that is sleeping with the mom and the daughter (Separately) and trying not to get caught. Someone is the neighborhood knows the whole story, but who \ncould that be? \n\n[h3] Overall Score: [/h3]\n\nScore: 3.8 - Length, Character Development, and Storytelling leaves a lot to be desired with this game. This is the second game that this developer has released, so I am not disappointed that I spent 5$ dollars on a game that they created, but I will say that I will think Long and Hard (No Pun Intended) before purchasing another game from this studio.\n- Getting 100% was... very fun in this cute metroid-vania where you basically act as your own level designer.\n\napproximate amount of time to 100%: 20-30 Hours\nEstimated achievement difficulty: 5/10\nMinimum number of playthroughs needed: One (Most likely 2 if you go in blind)\nMultiplayer achievements: No.\nMissable achievements: Yes. Sequence Break, \nPoint of no return: No. After the game's ending you can return and explore.\nGrinding Achievements:  No.\nDLC-Only achievements: No.\nTime-gated achievements: No.\nSpeed-run achievements: Yes. 4 hour Speed run (and another 4 hour Speedrun but with 100% Secrets/gold etc...)\nRNG-achievements: No.\nIs there a good guide available: I recommend Demajen's Guide on steam with the super usefull map.\nDoes difficulty affect achievements: Yes, Medium recommended. (There's also a 0 death achievement)\nFirst achievement unlock: Defeat the first boss in the tutorial temple.\n\n* I can't remember how this game ended up in my account (might have been some promotional giveaway...) but I'm so glad it did.\n\nThis game has some of the best Quality of life I've seen. It's extremely enjoyable and the 100% journey is challenging but not too problematic. Wholeheartedly recommend this one.\n- My gambling addict friend said if I post a review on this game and it gets 150 likes and 25 Awards that he will buy me a case of beer. So I'm just gonna leave this here\n- This game is set to release in early October, but I definitely wouldn't buy it anytime soon. It's not ready. It's full of weird little errors, the mechanics and UI are clunky as hell, there's a lot of information you really need but don't get, the \"events\" are incredibly repetitive, half the time the wording is so bad you're left confused what's actually happening, even the basics aren't there- random capitalization, no consistency from panel to panel or objective to objective... This game needs another 6 months in EA.\n- Been playing now for 56 hours and love it apart from one thing.... too many press conferences! Seems like every other minute I'm told I'm due to go into a press meeting... so, apart from that, I'm enjoying the game. Have to confess as a 60 year old woman, I do cheat... have much fun creating a team, buying loads of top players and winning every match... so satisfying! Anyway, can't cope with the action games and find the pace of this right up my street. Have been playing since the original Championship Manager games back in the 90s so would call myself a fairly seasoned player!\n- HOW?? WHY?? WHY IS THIS GAME SO GOOD?? IT HAS NO REASON TO BE THIS GOOD WTF?\nThe trailers or advertisements will not even give anything close to a sense on how good this story, build up, characters and mechanics (did I mention the story?) really is.\n\nShu Takumi and Yasumasa Kitagawa, you've done it again, from Ace Attorney to this. I can 100% say if you haven't played this game, you are definitely missing out.\n\n10/10!!!\n- An instant classic.\n---\n\nThe original [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/kunovega/recommended/264200]One Finger Death Punch[/url] was an unexpected treat for me. The refined simplicity of just two buttons that require masterful timing to create a legitimate fighting experience laid out to a selection of music that reminds you of the classic Kung-fu movies of the 1970's but packaged with a carefree stickman aesthetic.\n\nOne Finger Death Punch 2 is a respectable sequel in most ways. The core gameplay is fundamentally the same while the visual indicators and special attack animations have been upgraded and made more fanciful. Other things are changed simply to give you a new experience.\n\nEvery aspect of the game is polished from the interesting tutorial to the many additional modes (survival, gauntlet, etc.) that exist beyond the (very long) main campaign. Once you get into the groove there's potentially dozens if not hundreds of hours of fun to squeeze from this.\n\nThis is a game that just has to be played to truly appreciate it as the feel of your interaction along with the music is what really defines the experience. Simply watching it or looking at the screenshots doesn't do it justice.\n\nThere are a couple of (minor) controversial changes that may not appeal to some fans:\n1. The music in 2 includes a more modernized remix compared to the more traditional music from 1. Personally I love the soundtracks from both, but there are people who have a preference.\n2. The upgrades to special attacks in 2 can be a bit of visual clutter at times. I like both styles, but there are people who prefer 1 over 2.\n3. There are some sequences (like the lightsword rounds) which did not return in 2, replaced instead by other weapons. While I think it would have been cute to include all of that along with the new stuff, it's not a deal breaker. It does however mean that both games retain a bit of unique flair and a reason for you to play and experience them both. 2 is overall an upgrade, but it's also not a 100% replacement.\n\nI would strongly suggest that if you've never played either game, you should begin with the first one. I think it's a better entry point to the series and might have a slightly broader appeal. (it's also slightly cheaper).\n\nThen if you find yourself enjoying it, come back and pick up 2 and you'll find yourself with some remixed music, fancy new special attack animations and a whole new adventure to work through.\n\nJust to be very clear: Both of these games are fantastic and deserve more praise than I can properly express and I'll very likely be putting 100's of hours into this just like I did the first one.\n---\n\nBottom line: Simple to learn, hard to master, and super satisfying fighting along with a great soundtrack.\n---\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38232109/]While you are here, would you consider following my curator page?[/url]\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/kunovega/recommended/]Want to read all of my reviews and not just the curated ones?[/url]\n- It's about time i wrote a proper review for one of my favourite games ever.\n\nRivals of Aether is a platform fighter that tries to follow Super Smash Bros. Melee and P+'s footsteps by making a competitive focused game, but also while trying to keep it more accessible than the former. The game also has a very active workshop that allows players to create their own characters and play ones made by other creators, alongside custom made stages and buddies.\n\nI will focus on the purist aspect of the game first.\n\nAs for many \"smash clones\", the game will feel very familiar to people who already played a smash game, with the controls being nearly identical but with some key differences:\n\n1. THERE'S NO SHIELD. Rivals of Aether is probably the first game in its genre to forgo the iconic \"bubble\" shield, choosing it to replace it with a parry instead. Parries are riskier, staying out for a few frames, and will reward you immensely by either stunning the opponent or reflecting their projectiles. Since parrying is so risky, the game's neutral and defense (but also its offense) will be focused on movement, especially thanks to wavedashing, wavelanding alongside some more niche or character specific movement techs. \n\n2. THE STAGES HAVE NO LEDGES. This means your way to safety when you get knocked off the stage will be actually landing onto the main platform, rather than aiming for the ledges. Rightfully so, the game offers much more options when offstage compared to smash games, with every character having access to wall jumping, an airdodge that doesn't send in freefall and the ability to walljump and cancel special falls, allowing you to use your up special two times. This means the offstage game is a lot deeper than in other game, as there will always be a way back onto the stage since almost every character is allowed a lot of freedom while in disadvantage.\n\n3. THERE'S NO GRABS. There's not much to add here; the absence of a shield makes grabs unnecessary, and thus they're not present in the game. Some characters have command grabs, though.\n\nThere's a total of 14 characters in Rivals of Aether (free from the beginning), with 4 more to come in future patches. Although the cast might seem very slim for people who are used to smash games, it's incredibly diverse. Enough to probably warrant you to try every character. Each character has a lot of depth and can shape the stage in some way. Some fighters take inspiration from smash characters, such as Clairen having a tipper mechanic like Marth, or Absa having Ness and Mewtwo's movement turned up to 200 and Zelda's lightning kicks; this means you'll probably find a character you're familiar with in case you're not confident to play with a brand new character yet. It's also worth mentioning that the game is very balanced, with tiers being very subjective. Regardless, RoA's current top player plays the character that is considered the worst in the game by most, so that should prove that the balance state is very good.\n\nNetplay is not perfect, but it's very good and playable. As i'm writing this review, there's currently a beta build that includes rollback netcode, which presents a couple of bugs and desyncs but does its job quite well. Default build uses delay netcode, which also works just fine in case you're dissatisfied with the rollback beta. Rollback is expected to become the default build once the dev team fixes all its kinks.\n\nEvery stage has both an \"aether\" (casual, with hazards) mode and a \"basic\" (competitive, no hazards) mode. Every single stage in \"basic\" mode is tournament legal (with the exception of tempest peak in some regions), adding a lot of stage variety. Aether stages are aimed for a casual audience, with some spicy traps and whacky platform arrangements for a more casual and laidback experience.\n\nOn that topic, there's no items in this game, so the chaotic free-for-all  factor goes down by a notch, to the discomfort of players who like the party game side of platform fighters.\n\nThe community may be small, but it's very active and constantly organizes weekly and monthly tournaments, with the active (financial and whatnot) support of the game devs themselves, so you will quickly find a community in which to play. Sadly, though, having a small community means you'll be bound to experience some \"dead lobbies\" from time to time.\n\nSolo play, i'll have to be honest, is incredibly lackluster. This game was mainly thought to be played with other players and as a result, single player content is very scarce. There's an arcade-styled story mode which only features a handful of characters (the original 4+2 more), that will have you fight some random fighters until you reach your character's \"rival\" at the end of the story. The cutscenes go from average to bad, depending on the character's story. Each story is very simple and resolves itself in the course of 5 encounters, with a super boss+ a final cutscene once you complete every character's story mode\n\nThere's also \"endless abyss\" mode. It's similar to smash's multi-man mode, where you'll fight a never ending horde of weak cpus, with some minigames slapped inbetween, like a platforming section or explosive enemies. You will have to fight a weaker version of the story mode's boss after a set number of waves each time. The most interesting part of this gamemode is probably the rune system. The rune system will allow to buy runes with the in-game currency that will make your character stronger, be it by making them faster/more powerful or improving their moves. These runes can also be used in abyss versus, which is basically pvp but with runes.\nSadly, endless abyss can become repetitive very quickly, with its never changing waves and gimmicks and grind you have to go through to be able to buy (and use) your runes.\n\nThere's one more mode called Tetherball. It's actually a PvP mode, but i'm putting it in the solo play paragraph because it's a very casual mode. Simply put, the goal of this mode is to hit a beach ball that is attached to a pole by a string and make it spin around it. You score one point when the ball-on-a-string completely wraps the pole. You will have to fight your opponent to keep the control of the ball, as they can hit it as well and make the ball \"theirs\". It's a very fun but often shunned aside mode so i felt like putting it in this review. Please, play Tetherball with me. \n\n\nAs for workshop...\n\nIf you're not big on the competitive scene of platform fighters, this is probably why you came to this store page and. as you may have gathered, casual play is not very fleshed out, with only aether mode and some solo modes as your only options. That's where workshop shines! You'll be able to download hundreds of play made characters, some with the intent of being serious, competitive fighters, while others (most) are aimed to a more casual audience. Characters can go from original characters to the reckless wii mote guy, so you'll have plenty of fun by browsing the worshop page and finding the perfect character, be it an original character or a direct transposition of greninja from Smash Ultimate. Needless to say, you'll also have a huge choice of stages and music packs, alongside some hidden gems like new gamemodes that often pass under the radar. I bet you didn't know you could play Uno in Rivals of Aether!\n\n\n\nTo wrap things up, i'd like to comment on the great pixel art graphics which does its job very well and will appeal to retro gamers specifically, and give my shoutouts on the incredible OST made by flashygoodness. Every track fits the stage perfectly and gives the right atmosphere to this fast paced fighting game.\n\nIn other words this game is a very good purchase for both casual players, thanks to the workshop, and competitive players because of its deep yet accessible design. I hope this review made whoever is reading it consider buying Rivals of Aether and join the community.\n- Fun Tower-Defense style indie game. Definitely one where your skill improves every time you die. And you will die, repeatedly. :P Expect to try out many monster combinations per floor before you find something that can delay the hordes of adventurers long enough to set up the floor beneath! I would probably enjoy some more horizontal progression + permanent upgrades for long term re-playability, but it seems like a solo dev/small scoped project. Definitely worth the price for the current amount of content!\n- If you like management type games and RPGs, this is the perfect mix. It's just enough management to allow you to thrive with mostly strategy without feeling bogged down, and just enough RPG elements to get you invested in not just your squad, but each individual character in it. \n\nHere's a tale from my experience with the game;\n\nThis is the kind of game to change your entire perspective on life itself. Failure is not the end, nor the beginning, but a constant in this world that you can either let destroy you or make you stronger. Allow me to tell you a story. The story of New Battlehill. \nNear the Shek city of Squin, not far east, was a small town. It went through many names. The first that stuck was Firstyeet, totally not a placeholder. It wasn't an notable settlement, merely consisting of a shack, an iron processor, and some walls to mildly inconvenience the roving gangs of Dust Bandits that liked to bully the residents. After being evicted from their own city once again, the residents, Denver, Soto, Ruka, and Meow, vowed to take back their home. After training and buying the best weapons and armor they could, they made their way back to Firstyeet. To their surprise, however, they would not have to fight. One of the bandits had picked a fight with a herd of goats. The bandits' defense failed against the caprine assault. From this, the town would get its second name - Densorumego. Den for Denver. So for Soto. Ru for Ruka. Me for Meow. And Go for the true heroes, the goats.\nPeace would not last long but soon the residents of Densorumego would become strengthened by their constant fighting. On the elevated, somewhat round land on which Densorumego sat, there were many large fights involving a lot of people. If only there was some sort of name to reflect this... \nAnd from that, the town was renamed for the last time, to Battlehill.\nThings were looking up. The town built its first farms and expanded to be almost four times its original size. But this peace would not last. Battlehill's new ambitions of self sufficiency would attract the attention of a new foe - The Shek Kingdom.\nThe Shek claimed ownership of the land Battlehill was on, and as such, demanded all food grown there be given to them. Confident from their many victories against the Dust Bandits, the Battlehillites refused the Shek demands. Their risk was calculated... but man were they bad at math.\nAll but one were nearly killed in the ensuing battle, and the one person that wasn't knocked into a coma was stuck on the wall because part of the wall was destroyed and he could no longer reach the stairs because of that. The people knew they couldn't fight the Shek, but they would not allow themselves to be subservient either. And so began their malicious compliance. The Shek would get all the food in Battlehill, as it would be none - The Battlehillites were moving.\nI could write entire books about their journey around the west. The Fogmen, the ruins, the Screeching Bandits, there's many a tale. But, eventually, the people would find a new home. In the harsh and Beak Thing infested land of Vain, homeland of the Western Hive, they would found their new home - New Battlehill.\nJump to now, the city is thriving, they have more bread than they know what to do with, they've grown strong from defending their home from the Beak Things, and their population has grown. They are currently planning a reconquest of Battlehill, which was occupied by Dust Bandits shortly after they left.\n\nThere is a part I left out, between Firstyeet and Densorumego - I had repeatedly failed to retake Firstyeet, and I was about to quit the game. I was frustrated that I'd gone and bought the best arms and armor and still failed. And when I tried to set up a training ground on a mountain near Squin, bandits again came and defeated me. I went as far as to try and get a refund, which was denied. That refund being denied was the best thing that could've happened. I decided to give the game another try, and to try accepting my failures and growing from them. And if I hadn't done that, I would never have founded New Battlehill. None of the legend worthy tales my squad has been through would have happened. And I'd never have had the fun of going through all of them.\n\nIn short, get this game. It is just great.\n- DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU ALREADY OWN SHOVEL KNIGHT!!!!\n\nIt's a free update to the Original Shovel Knight if you purchased it.  Not a bad game by any means, has the same charm as the original S.K., but why pay for it here if you can get it free with the original (now called Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove).\n\n- I have a serious love/hate relationship with Sea of Thieves. It is both one of the best games I have ever played and one of the most frustrating games I have ever played, all wrapped into one. The gameplay of Sea of Thieves is INCREDIBLE. The sailing is the best in any game I have ever played. The feeling of exploration and discovery as you blast through treasure hunts and puzzles and mysteries is unlike any feeling you can get from any other game. The cooking mechanic, the healing from food, the not-terrible fishing mechanic... all subsystems that prop up the rest of the gameplay are unique and interesting in their own right. The land-based combat is relatively uninspired, yet still satisfying when part of the greater picture that the game presents. Some of my favorite memories in gaming, full stop, come from completing long nights on the high seas or doing long-form content available in the game. The game is gorgeous, some of the best ocean/water graphics in any game. The rest of the game is equally beautiful while perfectly conveying the environment of the map you are in. I swear to Gaben that I can freaking smell the wet sand or sulfurous lava on some of these islands. The music and sound design are some of the best in the industry. Outright, the game is incredible. \n\nBUT... Sea of Thieves sweaties ruin the game for me. There is absolutely nothing worse than having a night full of fun absolutely destroyed by some player who's enjoyment of the game is derived from eliminating anyone else's fun. I understand that PvP is part of the \"pirate life\", but it is by far the worst part of the game by far. I would be willing to pay money, hell a freaking monthly subscription, for the opportunity to play SoT as a strictly PvE game with just my friends and the rest of the server populated by bots. I actively avoid playing the game now because of how many of my last play sessions started with me spawning at an outpost and subsequently being sunk less than 15 feet off the dock by some sweaty that hasn't seen sunlight since the Obama administration. I know that this is an incredibly unpopular opinion in the greater SoT-sphere, but part of the enjoyment of games is letting players enjoy them how they wish, and I really freaking wish that I could enjoy the aspects of SoT that are fun to me without being the plaything of those pirates who live only to ruin the fun of others.\n- Plays and looks just like the Park Ranger and Cruise Director HOG series, if you enjoyed those then you will likely enjoy this series. Game is composed of hidden object scenes and simple puzzle transitions that have a loose story to bridge the movement between them. The hidden object scenes follow an older couple as they take their grandchildren to a variety of European counties on their vacation, they sprinkle in a few interesting facts between each location. There are collectibles in each scene along with a raccoon. I overall enjoyed it for a laid back experience and the weirdly fun photostock based scenes. It took me about 2.5 hours to play through the game along with the bonus scenes/puzzles.\n- Remember when Doom 2016 released the multiplayer beta test first, and we rightfully worried the game would be a flop? Thankfully, the campaign instead blew us away.\n\nI enjoyed my first run through 2016, but only moderately so. In the original Dooms, if you never stop moving, enemies truly can never hit you. With 2016, however, enemies lead their shots if you move predictably. Also, if you leave line of sight, the demons will fire several more predict shots, in case you re-engage from the same vantage point.\n\nI failed to adapt initially. Instead, I blamed the game, claiming it felt unfair compared to the originals.\n\nThen, I stumbled upon Clockner's playthrough of Doom. He showed me a skill ceiling I never dreamed possible. Next came ByteMe's speedrun performance at QuakeCon 2019. I noticed when the demons charged their shots, he would at times hold still and bait for them to aim before dodging at the last second.\n\nThe excuses were off. Doom has transformed after 25 years. The enemies are now more intelligent (yet not overly so). I too needed to evolve.\n\nAs I took on my Ultra Nightmare run (over 3-4 months), I developed a deep knowledge of every level, and in the process, became fond of every inch, as if the entire UAC and Hell were my homes. UN felt like such an accomplishment. After that, I tried to take on an all runes/weapons/challenges mastered run (no grinding). I failed the first two times. With Eternal around a day or two away, I just completed this challenge on my third try. Personally, I leave satisfied with nothing left.\n\nI initially had gripes with 2016, only to learn the developers were one step ahead. When a team/game proves me wrong, I am loyal forever.\n\nDoom 2016 will now be uninstalled from my machine, never again to be reinstalled. May your thirst for blood never quench. And may we never need you again.\n\nTo me, Doom 2016 is also Eternal 🙏.\n- Where's the atmosphere the first two games had?\nWhy can I only have 2 weapons at any time?\nWhy is this game a generic shooter?\nIf the game they had shown in so many videos previous to the release had come out, it'd have been a masterpiece, instead we got a severely watered down version of it.\nIt's a corridor shooter for the most part, with some parts where you're in a bigger room instead, really what I played the first two games for.\n- This is the best Civilization up to this point, and the DLC just made it even better. I will grant that the with all the add ons it would feel a tad crowded to anyone who hadn't played it before, but you have a crazy amount of options. The game series tagline of \"one more turn\" could not be more applicable.\n\nYou can strive for one of several victories: diplomatic, cultural, technological or domination. Each has its unique challengers to overcome and create a lot of the fun of the game. They are also not necessarily mutually exclusive and after completing one victory, you can go for the others. Each AI opponent has their own personality, and are pretty predictable in how they behave. Any one who has started the game next to Neopoleon or Ghengis Kahn knows they immediately have to have a decent military to repel invasion, while Ghandi will to muscle you out with religion and culture.\n\nThere are some important changes between Civilization IV and V. One of the most notable is that wars are plausible again as you dont constantly lose health in enemy territory and cities are easier to conquer. Additionally, culture doesn't automatically take over neighbor's cities anymore. \n\nThis game is easily worth the money. I'm not entirely sure how it stacks up to Civilization VI, but any game that I log 200+ hours on over a period of years and still haven't come close to doing everything is doing something right. A great game from a great series.\n- (If you're past a certain age, I can just say that this is Take Two Interactive's \"Bureau 13\" game, except actually done WELL. If not, keep reading.)\n\nTechnobabylon was one of the best games I played in 2017 (yeah I know it came out in 2015, shh). Wadjet Eye has done it again with Unavowed, one of the best games I played in 2018 and an amazing capstone to all of their work so far. You can play this game without having played the Blackwell series, but you'll get a little more out of it if you have.\n\nIt's also a rather dark piece of work, with a tone somewhere between Sleepy Hollow (the TV show) and something like Buffy. Your character (whose gender and former profession are chosen by you) gets possessed and goes on a year-long murderfestival rampage across New York City. Eventually the Unavowed, a brave supernatural-evil-fighting duo show up, and with the body back in your own control you sign up to fight evil with them. \n\nAs the game goes on, you recruit more characters in Bioware style, solve mysteries (all of which center around that year of hell your character went through), make Tough Choices and work to make the city a better place. All in absolutely gorgeous 640x480 resolution pixel art. \n\nThere were a couple of puzzles that slowed me down (the word \"LEGS\" is going to cause me to make faces for weeks) but this mostly flowed very smoothly. If you're at all a fan of past Wadjet Eye creations, this game needs to be in your life. If you're not, it's a good starting place, maybe the best starting place except that its quality might spoil you for the rough patches of past games.\n\nThis game contains some gore, some body/existential horror that might be jarring to some, and a lot of swearing.\n- Cthulhu Saves Christmas is another solid, fast-paced comedy jrpg from the folks at Zephoyd games. If you're looking for something bite sized, with some funny dialogue (most of it lands) and great combat this is a worthy purchase. I'd estimate an average playtime of 5-8 hours which is a perfect investment for a weekend jrpg.\n\nTLDR: If you enjoyed Cthulhu Saves the World and Cosmic Star Heroine, you're probably going to enjoy this game.\n- I don't understand why everyone is saying to stay out of the house? I went inside, they were super nice loving and caring people. The dude that owns the place is a butcher and has all kinds of quality meat. We had BBQ and showed me around the wheat farm. And his grandma, she can't see or hear very well, but she's incredibly sweet. They're both looking after a baby that's ABSOLUTELY ADORABLE!\n\nI don't get what all the fuss is about, I enjoyed my visit.\n- I had to purchase Scarlet Hollow after witnessing the excitement of Episode 4 through my friends. I immediately binged the first three episodes the following day and found myself and in rather different spot compared to their playthrough. The choices you make in SH are actually impactful - which is (unfortunately) quite refreshing for the genre! I've since run through several different routes to explore more of the story (and collect those achievements!). While you have the ability to skip through previously seen text, lines within replayed conversations are shaped by your selected traits, choices, and previously selected dialogue; you won't be skipping that many lines before seeing new content. Similarly, characters may be painted in an entirely different light based on choices you've made. The cast and writing truly nails the small town feel of SH (gossip and all). \n\nMake sure you eat the takeaway container in the fridge. Thank me later.\n- This game has such a HUGE potential like Stardew Valley in its early days!!\nCollecting stuff, helping people by crafting potions its so rewarding and lovely pls dear developers keep working on it. I BEG YOU! :D\nSure it has some bug right now but even on day one they managed to get some fast fixes and tried their best to make it work for everyone. \nThe controls were a bit tricky in the beginning (used Playstation 5 Controller) but its just a matter of time, its just not the normal controls like in other games.\nThe music was pretty nice and chill and also the animations were super cute, i love watching little Rubrum built his sandcastles over and over again. >3< \n\nOverall a good game, but could become even more better in the future, keep going guys!!\n- the game itself is pretty ok and fun for what it is, and runs great on deck. but man, F**K THE ALWAYS-ONLINE-DRM WHICH AT TIMES TAKES AGES TO CONNECT, GETTING THE GAME STUCK IN THE MENU WITH NOTHING TO DO!!\n\n>> Update after 20h played:\nI really enjoy playing the game. It is good, it is fun and runs great on the Steam Deck, which is especially important to me, as I tend to travel a lot as part of my job.\n\nThat being said, however, is core of the issue: The Always-On-DRM actually prevents me from playing this game on the go. Having this sort of DRM is, in my opinion, only predatory and inexcusable in any way. I get that the online-components of the game will not work when I am on the move, but I am mainly interested in the single player experience, from which I am also locked out. I am even locked out of the main menu without a stable internet collection, which is just ridiculous.\n- I reviewed the original Mark of the Ninja more than 4 years ago. I liked its stealth-based gameplay approach and praised the learning curve experienced throughout the story. I bought the [i]Special Edition[/i] which practically meant an add-on with some more levels, a custom and the option to replay the entire game in commentary mode. \n\nYou know some games get re-released due to the availability of a new console generation. This [i]Remastered[/i] edition is what was made available for PS4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch users not long ago. We, PC gamers (who already own the original Mark of the Ninja), can get this version free-of-charge in our library.\n\nThere's not much to say, really. I do not have a 4K display so this higher resolution I cannot enjoy. Compressed in-game art or not the original already looked very good. But the creators confirmed this will give us an enhanced experience even under 1080p resolution. \n\nWell, I did complete the game once again as this is how much I love MoN. I recommend that you do the same.\n\nPS: It may be possible that you are required to have the special edition of the original version to get the remastered version.\n- -This game is like the combination of old PC sidescroller like Duke Nukem (pre-3d), NES Contra, and arcade Metal Slug with 80s /90s cyberpunk and action movie tropes.\n-The cheesy humor, plot, and music is top notch. Might look like a shallow nostalgia at a glance but once you played it, they even spiritually nailed the silliness of similar games/story in that era. The guns, the character acting and lines, the costume design, etc.\n-It's not as fast paced as I thought it would be. But actually that makes it relaxing to play. Easy to get into and the challenge is just right for me without being frustrating. \n-I like how the enemies and characters are pretty diverse. \n-I haven't finished the game but I feel like this game will have similar replay value like Streets of Rage 4. Not because of there are many things to do or getting better at the game but because it's somehow just simply tight, fun, and arcadey to replay.\n- RPG Maker strikes again!\n\n\"Intergalactic traveler: The Omega Sector\" is one of hundreds of low effort retro-pixel RPG Maker asset/construction kit flips spamming the Steam catalog, made with the RPG Maker video game construction kit... in their own words, \"Our easy to use tools are simple enough for a child.\"  Like all RPG Maker \"games\", this is essentially a bunch of low quality/canned assets from RPG Maker coupled with a cringeworthy high school anime club fan fiction.\n\nAs with all RPG Maker games, the poor quality engine displays badly in fullscreen and doesn't have full HD support or any graphics tweaking options, making this unacceptable for any dedicated modern PC gamer.  The point can be made that the intention of RPG Maker is to make demos and small games to pass around friends, and shouldn't be used for \"professional\" game development.\n\nLike most RPG Maker shovelware and asset flips, the game features extremely low quality copy + pasted 2D retro pixel art, looks awful, and has even worse gameplay.  RPG Maker is an absolutely terrible construction kit, and never results in games of any reasonable quality or value to gamers.\n\nNotably the developer here couldn't work out how to use RPG Maker to make an RPG... and that's the only thing RPG Maker can do properly... except it's not even very good for making RPGs.  Instead, we have a simple 2D top down action/puzzle game where you blip around badly designed and godawfully bad looking mazes.  It's incredible the developer found a way to make RPG Maker even more crap than it is, this is truly a sensational achievement.  \n\nThe poor quality of this game is reflected by how many people spent time with it.  At the time of this review, SteamDB shows the game all-time peak player count was only ONE player.  That's right, only one person ever played this at a time.  When I played this for the purposes of reviewing it, I equalled the peak player count for the game.  OUCH.  The only player activity occurs once or twice a month, presumably someone loading it up to see what it is then quickly uninstalling it.  Considering there's over 120 million gamers on Steam and well over 50,000 games for gamers to choose from (over 9,000 completely free titles), the overwhelming lack of interest in this low quality game is to be expected.\n\n\"Intergalactic traveler: The Omega Sector\" is relatively cheap at $2, but it's not worth it. Given the defects and quality issues with the game, coupled with the unrealistic price, this is impossible to recommend.  Gamers who want a good retro JRPG experience would be better off playing the originals, like Final Fantasy, Star Ocean or Chrono Trigger.\n\n- So, I hated this game at first...\n\n I've never been into a MMO before, and I went into it with a mindset of \"FUCK YEAH! MULTIPLAYER SKYRIM LETS GO\" - In short don't do that. This isn't going to be like playing Skyrim, Oblivion, Morrowind. \n\nIt is when it all comes down to the core an MMO, it's set in Tamriel, it sounds like Tamriel and the storylines feel like an Elder Scrolls game. However being an MMO, it has a lot of grindy MMO style quests. And don't get me wrong, it's bewildering at first, all these mechanics, all these places to go....and before the 'One Tamriel' update if you chose the wrong faction, you were screwed, in a place all on your own surrounded by all these people who are WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY higher level than you. But thankfully they changed all of that. The game scales now, so you can rock up to a dungeon with your level V300 mate, and still have some fun slicing up enemies.\n\nSo I saw a friend playing the other day, and spent a few hours installing this to join him (By the way its like 70 Gig...If you have slow internet prepare for a few days of download), I got back on it after not playing for 14 months, but this time I was playing with a friend who was already Veteran Level 250, So I was in luck, he introduced me to everything and I got used to all the deconstructing of equipment to get my blacksmithing up, showed me about dungeons and bascially got me to enjoy the grind. I think my previous time was a bit lackluster because I got dropped in the middle of the Aldmeri Dominion on my own, without any of my friends. So I left.\n\nNow I know what I'm doing, and keep in mind I usually hate MMO's never played WoW or anything like that, this is the first one. I'm enjoying myself, I'm triple digits into this game time-wise and I don't see it stopping now. We've made a guild for noobies. To help them out, and get them to enjoy the game also. Because the community is nice...but you still get the elitist fucks from any competitive game kicking you out of dungeons because you're only level 14. But you won't get that when you're in a guild, having people to play with and explain all the mechanics did help, a lot. I've even gone as far as to buy this AGAIN on steam just to collect my hours and so on.\n\nAdd-ons are awesome being able to mod basic features of the game to help with information and quality of life improvements is a must. I'll provide an essential mods pack if any of you wish to know.\n\nFor those of you who actually got this far into this, well done. I didn't think I'd keep you captivated long enough to get to the end.\n\nIf any of you are new to the game, on EU server and would like to join a guild to show you the way, add me or visit our [url=www.godsofsalt.com]website[/url] and join us on teamspeak, or just message us in game @diseasedcrow.\n\nBut all in all if you like Elder Scrolls and you think you want to try this, just do, I'm glad I gave it a second chance.\n- [h1]An old classic that's fresher than lots of today's titles.[/h1]\n\n[i]Day of the Tentacle[/i] first launched in 1993. I remember, because I was a teenager then and couldn't play it as my PC didn't meet the minimum requirements! This was actually the sequel to an earlier game, [i]Maniac Mansion[/i], which was released in 1987. I played [i]Maniac Mansion[/i] a few years after it came out, but did not complete it as the game's movement and controls were just too dated and clunky for me (even back then) to be bothered with. \n\nPlaying [i]Maniac Mansion[/i] is not at all necessary in order to enjoy [i]Day of the Tentacle[/i], though those who have will definitely find greater connection to the game's characters, especially the Edison family.\n\n23 years later, [i]Day of the Tentacle Remastered[/i] is essentially the same as it was before, but with sleeker graphics and a more modernised interface. While the story hasn't changed, it surprisingly (or not) hasn't aged one bit either - tentacle mutates and seeks to conquer the world, and only you (and your friends) can stop him! Though straightforward, the game's charm is in its various amusing time travel locations and the weird and wonderful characters you meet along the way. This is a prime example of where [i]\"it's all about the journey, not the destination.\"[/i]\n\n\n[h1]Yays![/h1]\n\n+ Vibrant, colourful, hi-res cartoon-style graphics.\n+ Well-designed rooms, locations and scenery.\n+ Fully voiced, with good voice acting for the most part. (The guy who plays Dr Fred is awesome.)\n+ Interesting, memorable characters.\n+ Fun, amusing story.\n+ Wacky humour.\n+ Clear goals.\n+ Cool easter eggs. (Under \"achievements\".)\n+ Contains a free game ([i]Maniac Mansion[/i])!\n+ Puzzles are mostly enjoyable and require some creative thinking.\n+ Many gameplay hours.\n+ Trading cards.\n\n[h1]Nays.[/h1]\n\n- [url=steamcommunity.com/app/388210/discussions/0/392184522713202518/]Audio starts stuttering[/url] after a while, due to memory problems.\n- Achievements remain hidden, even after the game is completed, so you can't see what you're missing.\n- Some puzzles have illogical or nonsensical solutions.\n- Bugs: e.g. When looking at one of the items, Laverne's voice sounds when Bernard speaks.\n- No mouse command to fast-forward dialogue; instead, you have to press \".\" which is really inconvenient, especially when the whole point of a point-n-click game is to [i]not[/i] have to use your keyboard!\n- Some counter-intuitive puzzle set-ups: E.g. For the videotape puzzle, a button which looks like the \"STOP\" button, is actually the \"RECORD\" button. Anyone who's ever used a VCR or tape recorder would know that the square symbol denotes \"STOP\", while the round button denotes \"RECORD\". \n- Hoagie's periodic belches sound absolutely disgusting!\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nThis was a hugely enjoyable experience from start to finish. Though the nostalgia factor played a part in my case, even if you've never heard of the [i]Maniac Mansion[/i] series, as long as you count yourself a point-n-click adventure game fan, this is a must-play because it just gets so many things right. Add to that the timeless plot and wacky characters, and you have yourself a game that will play just as fresh & new decades down the road.\n\n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [td][u]Disclaimer:[/u] [i]Game played for free, with many thanks to my dear friend [url=steamcommunity.com/id/kflorence]KFlo[/url]. :)[/i][/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n- Normally, I am hard-set on if a game is good, or bad. This game? its in the middle. I mean, a lot of the game is actually really cool, it looks great, it doesn't explain why basically almost every single person is a walking hunk of muscle, but there are some serious flaws. Not just the weird ones like \"kitchen knives break after you stab someone 3 times\" or \"I just ran over an entire sidewalk of people, and the police are nowhere to be found\", but some seriously terrible glitches that make the game unplayable. Such as the whole space-car thing. \"lalala... driving along the road...\" all of the sudden KABAM your car goes flying, hits the ground, explodes, you die, and you get charged money. You use a car to try and get back to where you were going, and BANG same thing happens again. Also, the cops, even though they are extremely spread out and don't appear to have any form of 911 or anything, are nuts with guns. You, who are supposed to be some sort of superultracop, don't even carry a knife. A FREAKING KNIFE. So if you want a gun, you have to kill a police officer, BUT WAIT HE DIDN'T DRAW HIS GUN AND YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE A HOLSTER so you have to wait until another police officer shows up, hope that he tries to shoot you instead of tackling you, and then run up to him while he shoots at you, press f when you are right in front of him, and grab his gun. Meanwhile the entire police force is going to where you are. Thats just how to get a pistol. Whats that? You want a real gun? One that doesn't take 7 shots(literally) to kill a unarmored policeman? Well, you have to hole up in some building, which its hard to find one with an interior, and just keep shooting the police officers when they charge in. Eventually, after maybe 30 officers are dead, they send in their \"elite team\" of guys... with no helmets... no armor other than a vest... and either a shotgun or a submachine gun. The farthest I have gotten to is with these guys dressed in all grey with helmets and assault rifles, they are meant to be the wall, because it can take up to an entire clip of your submachine gun to take one down. Oh, and back to the cars, WHAT THE HECK IS WITH THE CAR ATTACKING. It made me almost fall out of my chair laughing when I realized that I could use my car to \"lunge\" left and right, and take out other cars. I guess the devs didn't know that cars can't drive straight sideways. Your character has no weapons as well, so it looks kinda stupid when you are blocking and punching a bunch of guys with tire irons, knives, and whatnot. Oh yeah, the weapons break after you swing a few times. The game also has weird weapons. You can pick up an umbrella, a purse, heck even a grocery bag, or a take-out box, to use as a weapon, but these things are one use, and deal less damage then a punch. Overall, this game is a little too unrealistic, to the point where it really removes you from the game. Not to mention the glitches, you would think that the \"new and improved\" sleeping dogs would be \"new and improved\" not the horrible, glitchy mess it is now. I really tried to play it, but I just got tired of being gunned down while I am trying to break into a car and start it up, which takes like a good 20 seconds, which is a lot of time when you have 10 cops unloading their bottomless clips at you. I got tired of randomly being flung into space. I got tired of a cop arresting me, and instead of allowing me to break free and whatnot, me and the cop take a \"small adventure\" gliding across the road through cars and buildings. I got tired of a game thats supposed to be fixed and nearly glitchless, when in reality most early access games play better. I am sorry.\n- I love this game. In fact, I've loved it since I was in highschool about 8 years ago. My friend and I used to play this game together all the time on my flashdrive. We were always discussing & trying to understand the ins-&-outs of the game and how to get a specific ending depending on what you did. Playing this brought me back to those good times in that library.\n\nThe OSTs are nostalgic, the gameplay is about the same and the artwork is amazing as ever(actually the graphics are much better with this remake).\nThe only complaint I have is that it lags at random times(though usually in the menu). The original IB on RPGMaker never did that.\nOverall I'm glad I bought this so I could support the Dev and thank them for all those years of entertainment-\nI just wish there wasn't so much lag over an RPGMaker game.\n- This game is for sure not perfect, but worth buying for a specific type of gamer.\n\n[b]What is good in this game?[/b]\n- It has a pretty solid gun gameplay. The movement is quick and polished as well.\n- One level is on average 20 seconds. It's fun to improve your gameplay to get better times in the small levels. \n- It's really a blast getting a perfect run, killing enemies in bullet time or exploiting the enemies weakspots.\n- There is content for around 10-15 hours. Maybe more if you consider going for 100%.\n\n[b]Anyway there are also some flaws: [/b]\n- In Neon White or Ghostrunner the movement and pace through the levels often feels like a perfect choreographic \"dance\"\n- The levels and the areas in Warstride are verry tight. I often lost pace through \"stupid\" placed rocks or small doors.\n- There is not much to explore. The levels are verry linear. While in Neon White it was so much fun to explore shortcuts or other hidden possibilities to improve ur time there are no such mechanics in Warstride at all. I'd love to have some exploration at least in the \"long levels\".\n- It could get repetitive for some players as it's a core element to complete the levels on 5 different difficulties. \n\n[b]Conclusion: [/b]\nIf you like fast paced games like Ghostrunner, Neon White or Doom and you have no problem in repeating short levels several times and u don't except an extraordinary game u will have fun for several hours on a low price.\n\n- Delete the intro.\n\nHonest Edit:\n\n Actually pretty sweet game.  Lots of things I don't like in terms of menu navigation and difficulty curve, but conceptually one of the better games I've played in awhile.  I just wish the controls weren't so poor. Very tedious with doubletap movement to dodge/counter (keyboard)\n\nAlso not very optimized for steam link or the steam controller. In general the worst parts of this game are directly attributed to the fact that this is a port. One of the worst port jobs i've seen to be honest.  Definitely play with a good controller. \n\nThe game also does a poor job of introducing the \"extended\" story, I nearly missed what i would consider the best part of the game just because I stopped after the first round of credits. There is actually a ton more content afterwards. Very worth investing the time into watching everything play out.\n- WHERE ARE MY OG DS FANS OF THIS GAME? REJOICE BRUDDAS!\n\nNo but seriously, I loved this game to DEATH when it first came out on the DS and to now see an HD version of this game on steam. It's quite a whiplash but a good one! To anyone who loves mystery/ detective games, YOU NEED TO GET THIS!!! Good story, soundtrack and gameplay <3 AHHHHHH!!!\n- Cassette Beasts: it's high time we dispel the notion that it's merely a Pokémon clone. Developed by Bytten Studio, this game offers a fresh and exhilarating take on the monster taming genre that stands tall on its own merits. Here, we'll dive into what makes Cassette Beasts so unique and why it's a complete masterpiece.\n\nA Unique Twist on Monster Taming:\nAt first glance, some may draw parallels between Cassette Beasts and the Pokémon franchise. After all, both involve capturing and battling creatures, but Cassette Beasts distinguishes itself with its innovative \"cassette\" mechanic. Unlike Pokémon, where you simply capture creatures, in Cassette Beasts, you capture abilities and splice them together to create your own unique monster hybrids. This adds a layer of strategy and creativity that sets it apart from the traditional monster taming formula.\n\nA Riveting and Fast-Paced Story:\nOne of Cassette Beasts' most outstanding features is its gripping storyline. From the moment you step into this pixel-art world, you'll find yourself engrossed in a narrative that unfolds at a breakneck pace. The plot is full of unexpected twists, complex characters, and thought-provoking themes that keep you invested from start to finish. It's not just about capturing monsters; it's about uncovering the mysteries of the world and your character's place in it.\n\nChallenge for the Experienced Gamer:\nCassette Beasts doesn't hold your hand. It offers a refreshing challenge for those seeking a more demanding gaming experience. Battles are strategic and require careful planning. The variety of cassette combinations and the dynamic AI make each encounter a thrilling puzzle to solve. It's a game that rewards skill and strategy, keeping even seasoned gamers on their toes.\n\nVisually Stunning Graphics:\nThe game's pixel-art style is a work of art in itself. The attention to detail in every environment, creature design, and character is astounding. Cassette Beasts manages to evoke a sense of nostalgia while still pushing the boundaries of what pixel art can achieve. It's a visual treat that enhances the overall immersion in the game.\n\nA Masterpiece in the Monster Taming Genre:\nIn summary, Cassette Beasts is nothing short of a masterpiece in the monster taming genre. It successfully distances itself from the Pokémon comparisons with its innovative mechanics, and it offers a captivating story, challenging gameplay, and stunning visuals that set a new standard for the genre.\n\nWhile Pokémon may have laid the foundation for monster taming games, Cassette Beasts takes bold steps in its own direction. Bytten Studio's creation deserves recognition for its dedication to delivering an unforgettable gaming experience that stands tall on its own. Cassette Beasts is more than a clone; it's a genre-defining title that has undoubtedly earned its place among gaming greats.\n\n10/10\n- Basically Wizard of Legend, but from a different viewpoint. Same composer, both pixel art, similarly fast paced boss fights with good telegraphs, combos are a little less deliberate, though. Very satisfying build making, with solid build variety. Has couch co-op which is very nice. It has some beautiful pixel art, truly. This game is a feast for the eyes and ears with cutscenes, voice acting, and more. Ok, I just love this game. It's so damn good.\n- This is mostly a worse version of the much better \"Slay the Spire\". Slightly different gameplay (Inscryption has a 'field' and some very limited mechanics from Gwent-like games), but both are deck builders with card alteration and deck probability as a core mechanic. Really expected better from the reviews and a demo that promised more gameplay aspects than seem forthcoming. Not an awful game, and has potential, but it feels like they took a basic card game and never bothered to balance it or build better guidelines for the randomized encounters. \n\nPros\n-Atmosphere is decent\n-Gameplay core is fine and could have promise but is highly random. \n-The 'scale' system works well in concept - winner must be X damage points above the opponent, not a set amount of life. X is too small.\n\nCons\n-'Roguelike' aspects are minimal so far. Even as I get more familiar with gameplay my runs are as likely to end on the first or second map. Grinding the same level doesn't get you anywhere in terms of improvements, since the end game 'summary' is determined by random cards you obtained during your run... which can be very poor. Even then, these seldom show up on future runs in my experience.\n-Few ways to guarantee what cards/powerups you get if you want to focus on any specific type of build. Additionally certain paths are OP, while others are next to worthless. With STS there are far more viable builds, and while some are better than others, most times you could construct one to get you far.\n-Powerups sometimes do nothing (e.g., Instant kill on a card with zero attack is... worthless, but if you add 1 attack it suddenly works), and sometimes create amazing combos.\n-Highly variable battles, often hinging on 1 turn or card draw. Get your top card first? Battle is won. Keep drawing the wrong 'fuel' (card summoning) source? You've lost. Sometimes you'll get 1-2 cards that are a permanent squirrel card, other times you'll need to spend a 1-2 draw actions to even summon a card.\n-Overall atmosphere is interesting, but highly limited and very repetitive. Narrative only changes when you advance and isn't skipable so spending 1 minute each death doing the same death sequence 5 times in a row ruins it. \n-You can't just quit a run. Also the stupid UI that has you click + drag to use the menu system. \n-The room, which functions as your 'rogue-like' element is limited, and once explored is dull. Late 90's graphics, low light. Puzzles are mostly bound by gameplay and even completing a puzzle and adding a card to the pool of possible draws isn't that useful. \n\nThe game needs more features to allow for 'controlled randomness' (e.g., lock certain starting cards for each run, set a preferred powerups/creature type, start encounters with +1-2 cards in hand, expand # of result possibilities, better 'rarity' parity), better permanent powerups (expand past # of \"helper items\" that can be held), scale needs to be larger (once you get the right set-up the game is over the next turn, conversely some scenarios the computer can 'rush' you and a match is over by turn 3-4). Possibly expand # of slots for cards and allow player to have 2 rows, like AI does - would also allow certain powers to be more interesting.\n- tldr:\nits sniper elite 3,5.\nnot all that bad but then i look at good vs bad, bad wins.\nsince valve/steam still cant be bothered to implement a neutral thumb, its thumbs down from me.\nbuy it on sale if you must, not worth an AAA price tag for sure.\n\n--------\n\nsniper elite 4 is what sniper elite 3 should have been.\nthe maps are much bigger, the melee is far better/fluid, the xray cam is how you wanted it to be and it looks and feels overall pretty nice.\n\nso why didnt i like it, no thumbs up?\nbecause it also feels like its an update to sniper elite 3, nothing more and nothing new. at all.\nand there a re few things that really stuck out and which are just a big NONO:\n\n- the campaign is shockingly short. i read in someones review that they finished it in 6 hours. and i needed 10 or 11. disappointing\n\n- multiplayer is medicore.still.\nit feels half done; copied over from sniper elite 3; and i can never play more than 3 rounds before getting bored. \nand i dont think im alone because most of the time you find as average 3 lobbys for team deathmatch game types.\nbut multiplayer being multiplayer, everyone feels different about it so you may disregard this point if you wish.\n\n- the voice acting is one of the worst you will ever hear. the italian mobster you talk to sounds so bad that i literally started laughing.\nthe lady who gives you intructions via radio before each level sounds like someone working at a XXX hotline.\n\n- i have yet to encounter the high praised AI.\nthey are decent, yes, slightly better than sniper elite 3, on close and mid range... but if you actually manage to get to a high vantage point and snipe across the map, say 400,500m+? , (which is extremely rare btw), then the AI fails horribly.\nyou kill 2 people far away, the AI goes into alert and then calls the search off 5 seconds later because the game realizes you are far, far away and the alerted soldiers would need 5 minutes to get to you, kinda.\nso you can snipe at your hearts content, just wait every so often between shots.\ni have actually cleared an entire level that way. i didnt even move, never got spotted and no one ever knew where the shots came from. \nonce everything was dead, i just visited the objective checkpoints.\n\n- a sniping game that considers shots 100m+ \"Long Shots\" .\n... wut?\n\n- one of the things that bugs me most. dont let the big maps fool you. you only can ever go two ways, on one map 3.\nand finally it doesnt matter which way you go because you have to do all checkpoints anyway, which are both ways.\nthe majority of the map is covered with obstacles and terrain that can not be passed/traversed, forcing you on pre-determined paths.\nits a real themepark where you are forced to go where the developers want you to go. \nit becomes painfully obvious when there are high grass patches strategically placed along your way where the devs think that you should hide there because there you have an opportunity to stealth something for a bit.\nthere really is no freedom of choice when it comes to the map,how you approach things etc.\nall you can do is...left or right? and all guns blazing or try to stay semi-hidden.\nmeeh...\n\n- i remember watching a dev stream that introduced the game ,way before release. i already noticed a DLC button in their alpha client. i knew that was a bad sign...\nright after game release i found half of the items locked for DLCs that havent even been released yet.\ntake that plus very short campaign and below medicore multiplayer and you have zero reason to ever buy any DLC. \njust doesnt make any sense. \nwhy would you, what for?\n\n- releasing a game together with seperate dlcs the same day?\ni didnt expect that from rebellion.\nvery.shabby \n\nnow, having ranted like this....it is not a terrible game all together.\ni had fun while it lasted but it does not justify the price tag,ever.\nit could have been so much more but i guess greed and publisher pressure won at the end.\ni was looking forward to it and left disappointed.\n\nthe ending of the campaign already suggests there will be a sniper elite 5 but this time i shall wait until its on an 85% sale.\n- On the Steam Store page for [i]Candle[/i] I saw:\n\n1. The game's description: \"Candle is an adventure with challenging puzzles.\"\n2. The 5 most popular tags for the game: Indie, Adventure, Hand-Drawn, Puzzle & Fantasy\n3. The beautiful screenshots\n4. The 'very positive' reviews\n\nSo I bought it. I should have actually read some of the reviews, though. It turns out [i]Candle[/i] is just another platformer game. Granted, it's a \"puzzle-platformer\" but still a platformer where agility, dexterity and a lot of trial & error are key to finishing the game, although there is some light puzzling involved, as well. I don't like platformers. I also don't like pixel hunting for items, which is what you need to do in [i]Candle[/i] to find all the items you need to advance. You see, some items are almost absorbed in the background and frustratingly hard to spot. So there will be a lot of backtracking, unless you follow a guide, which then kills part of the fun anyway.\n\n[b]In summary, just a friendly warning: if you think [i]Candle[/i] is a beautiful point & click adventure game, like I did, don't be fooled. It's actually a beautiful, frustrating platformer game with some light puzzling.[/b]\n- its in a forest\n- And that's it, after 278 hours of play, the adventure is over... \nThis type of game that you wish you could forget so you could rediscover it like the 1st time, where you discover everything, a bit like a child\nIt's a game made with passion for video games, to tell a story, to make the player laugh too, and to make him a little melancholic or horrified or even sickened sometimes\n\n[u]Divinity OS 2 will have marked my young adult life[/u], like Sonic and megadrive games, Pokémon, FFTactics, Zelda and gameboy / gamecube games, Warcraft3 (TT), or Mass Effect and other PC games did in my childhood and adolescence (I surely forget so much excellent games)\n\nIt's a 20/20 for me. The work is titanic. The game is really made with passion. The studio is very talented.\n\nSo when Steam asks me [i]\"Do you recommend this game\"[/i], I say:\nYes! Because this is where you feel that video games are an experience, an adventure to live! \nI went through Rivellion with my buddy, like I went through Kanto (Pokémon), or Ivalice in FF Tactics as a kid!\n\n\n[u][b]Atmosphere:[/b][/u]\nMany of us probably remember our adventures in Pokémon or other games in our childhood. We roamed, discovered and lived in these worlds!\n\nHere, it's the same thing, and not alone this time: I was with a very good friend! \nWe met frequently to venture into the world of Divinity as a lightning lizard warrior or a skeletal assassin with a mysterious past...\n\nWith our companions Lohse and Ifan, and Maladie, and Gareth, and Jahan and Han the survivor kid and Sir Lora and so many others. Impossible to forget... \n[i]They exist! Stop lying, I know they exist ![/i]\n\nOur choices were important: We decided to do justice to this or that person, provoking reactions (or death) in certain characters, slapping a few Magisters around when necessary\nAnd of course, we STRONGLY decided to stea... Borrow a lot of spells and equipments from the merchants, while the other one was distracting by chatting...\n... What? We didn't have the money and we had to save the world ! Well, we had the money, but you never know, maybe one day we will need it... !\nAnd then stealing, it's fun. And exhilarating hehehe\n\n\n[u][b]Gameplay:[/b][/u]\nA 3D tactical turn-based game, to play with friends. Really ! Don't play this game alone, I'm sure that with at least 1 buddy (or 3!), you will exploit the game to its full potential!\n\nAlso, [u]you can change your skills and class at any moment in the game[/u], it's very flexible ! I played rogue all my game, and in the last chapiter, I decided to play with spear and War skills ! I really enjoyed being able to switch like this, as I want ! The game want you to take FUN, not \"suffering\" your \"bad\" class choices !\n\nToo bad, I don't know anyone who is ready to take on the role of a GM (Game Master), to live a personalized campaign! Because it is a mode apart from the main campaign!\n\n\n[u][b]Music:[/b][/u]\nExtremely good and fits perfectly with the atmosphere of the game. This kind of OST that we listen to when we work and that makes us live our adventures again when the song becomes EPIC!\n\n\n[u][b]In summary:[/b][/u]\nTitanic content, assured re-playability for those who wish to know what would have happened if they had answered something else than \"FIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT\", and I repeat, the fact of being able to play with friends makes the game so much more pleasant to do!\n\n\n[b]*Sob*[/b]\nBut no, I'm not crying... I'm just allergic to emotions!\n\nI would like so much to forget this game to be able to rediscover it\n\nPlease play it, at least give it a try, and let yourself be immersed in Div's world!\n\nIn our case, we will do it again in HARDCORE mode !\n\nPeace guys !\n- They shadow dropped an update that literally breaks the game and DLC, and for what? Ads.... ads for RS+\n\nNo wonder piracy is the answer in this day and age when stupid business decisions like this are implemented. If I were to write a review a week ago I'd of said yes and recommended this, but this is just another shovel of dirt in the company's deep DEEEEEEEP hole of failures. I'm officially done with Ubisoft because of this. This was a great gateway to learning guitar and even the CDLC made it possible to learn songs that aren't even apart of the + library.\n\nSomeone please get to making a pirated copy of this game with all DLC as that will sell better than anything ubi throws out and it'll be free at that.\n- This is less of a review and more of me gushing about how much im enjoying myself, but you can still get a idea of what the game is from it. I am not usually a puzzle game player, or even a \"chill\" game player. im usually all about quick shooters, fighters, and platformers, but i decided to give this game a shot and i am very glad i did. with a mechanic as simple as pushing trees i thought that it would be simple enough for me to have a good time, the last time i played a puzzle game was BaBa is You and i put 14 hours into it and never got past word 3, it was just too much for me. but this game manages to still be challenging even with it laying all the pieces out in front of me, it introduces new features not by putting one in a level and saying good luck, it makes you do something you have done before but gives a new outcome, because you never got to do that thing in that exact way before, and when puzzles start requiring you to do those things you wonder how you ever got that far without doing one of those things before. all of the mechanics and solutions also are based in logic, all your doing is pushing things, so you dont have to suspend your current understanding of things to learn a new mechanic. The world of the game is also very relaxing and sucks me right in, its a museum of the \"past\" of humans that takes place in the far future from the perspective of monsters who dont really understand human culture, and it is hilarious! the music is very chill and moves with your actions, when you push something in a specific way the music also does a specific things, and its part of the reason this game is so relaxing. most other puzzle games i have played frustrate me when i get stuck on a puzzle for a long time, but seeing the monster relax helps me relax and keep a level head to get to the next museum exhibit. i dont know how to end this review but if you read it i hope you dont feel like i wasted your time!\n- *LOOK INTO SAFETY/SECURITY RISKS BEFORE BUYING THIS GAME*\n\n     Playing this game online can be risky as hackers are able find your IP address, mess with your in-game / weapons / health / money, find out your personal information, install rats on your PC & even get into your computer. Although this isn't super common it's still a legitimate thing that people need to know about & should look into before spending their money on this game. It doesn't happen as much to random players but Streamers have to play this game in offline mode whenever they stream themselves playing otherwise the hackers will mess with whatever they're doing by trying to get them banned. \nPlease google \"Black ops 3 PC security risks 2022\". It really is a shame that Treyarch isn't coming back to fix this very serious problem in their game, but let's be real Activision  more than likely isn't letting them. \n\nTL;DR: Be cautious of potential security issues, but I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes Call of Duty Zombies / zombies in general or who wants to get into the Call of Duty Zombies franchise.\n\nNow for my review:\n     Best call of duty game ever for Zombies. Definitely can be a challenge to find multiplayer matches nowadays but zombie matches aren't hard to find as long as you're playing the \"popular\" maps. The \"less popular\" maps are more difficult to find a match on but it's still possible, especially if you search for a match at the right time of day. This goes for multiplayer as well, if you search for a match during specific times you will be more likely to find matches (I'm not entirely sure when these times are so I wont even leave my guess here). This is likely because of people in different time-zones getting up / getting off work or school and getting on the game.\n     This game is the best thing to ever happen to the Zombies series in terms of gameplay, storyline, progression & more. There are endless tasks, items & surprises in each map that keep you coming back for more and having a different experience each time! It truly is a wonderful & fun game that has offered me more re-play ability than any other game I've ever experienced, especially with custom zombies/mod tools. With community made maps there's literally endless maps/levels to play on, & because of mod tools we not only have the remakes that come with Zombies Chronicles but we also have the visually stunning remakes of Mob of the Dead, Call of the Dead & Town, with Buried as well as Die Rise on the way for 2023/2024! I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes Call of Duty Zombies / zombies in general or who wants to get into the Call of Duty Zombies franchise.\n- I am a 43 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he helped me. Loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.\nThank you <3\n- The fact that this VN used to be the highest rated game that hasn't been released outside Japan until, well, it was released outside Japan says it all. A must-buy position for every VN enthusiast and an insteresting position for any other player. Criminally underplayed (~55% of purchased copies haven't been started yet), true hidden gem. Consider buying it when on sale.\n- I would describe this game as a 'befriending sim' with a very shallow veneer of farming/resource gathering/'witchy' activities. The farming/mining/fishing is nowhere near as fun or sophisticated as other games e.g. Stardew Valley. And there are no customisation options - even very shallow ones - to make the game experience your own, e.g. the layout of your farm and buildings can't be changed or decorated, there's no home decoration, no character customisation or clothing options. So the game feels very linear and daily tasks are repetitive and grind-y. There's also a dearth of special/seasonal occasions which adds to the repetition.\n\nAnd even though this game majors on the social/befriending angle, which is largely ok, it still doesn't feel quite right. You can get to be 'good friends' with a character and they still repeat dialogue asking if you've met their family members (of course you have) and/or your character asks them really basic getting-to-know-you type questions that previous cutscenes have already answered. The voice acting is great though.\n\nI think this game would have been a lot better had it been done as an all-out graphic novel/choices matter game, and dropped the farming etc. As it is, it's a jack of all trades and master of none.\n- Do yourself a favor if you get eye-strain or nauseated from the forced motion blur and/or the chromatic aberration and go to %appdata%/Local/FinchGame/Saved/Config/WindowsNoEditor and open the \"Engine.ini\" file and copy in the following:\n\n[/Script/Engine.RendererSettings]\nr.SceneColorFringe.Max=0\nr.DefaultFeature.MotionBlur=0\n\nThis will disable both effects which in my case completely removed any strain I was having.\n- First, there was Guitar Hero. Now you've got Guitar Nero. \n\nIt's wild that this came out of nowhere, because this is easily one of the best games I've ever played. This is what I've been waiting for rhythm games to be like since Space Channel 5 on Dreamcast.\n- So um, I don't usually write reviews like this or much at all really. I mostly make unfunny jokes and call it a review or something super generic. I guess I'll just write whats on my mind.\n\nI really liked this game.\nI felt like I was a kid again playing Super Mario 64.\nSometimes I get tired of shooting guns. Or slashing fantasy monsters with some shiny sword. Or saving the magic land from evil. Or using hyper combos I never remember. Or collecting resources to build a quirky town. Or time managing some distant farm. Or driving some tricked out vehicles. Or investing in status points to make super strong characters. Or following a long and convoluted plot with crazy lore.\n\nSometimes I just wanna run and jump around while I pick up some cool looking stuff.\nI, uh, had a lot fun playing this game. \nThanks.\n- Not what the developers promised.\nFeels like a graphics mod for Chivalry.\n\nI'm not a fan of Chivalry either. I had some fun with it, but couldn't bear the clunkiness and wished for intuitive controls and realistic fights. Mordhau promised exactly that. \nAlthough it's equally clunky und even more buggy.\n\nAlso it doesn't offer the option to play in private rooms with your friends (duel mode) or only on paid servers. Inviting a friend to a local match should be a standard feature.\n\nAll the new content and features don't really matter - it's a PvP fighting game. I need only a couple of weapons that work, not 100+ that don't.\n- Launch controversy aside, what this game should have been called for the longest time is 'Early Access'. Around the time of the Beyond update is when I'd say would have been the true 'launch'. \n\nI didn't get this when it first came out, but even when I did it was a fragmented mess of a game. Now, finally, with the Beyond and Synthesis updates there's a solid game here that's almost (but not quite) like what Sean Murray promised way back at the beginning.\n\nPerformance on PC has dramatically improved with the switch over to the Vulkan API, and it finally supports Ultrawide and various other PC-specific options. The game itself provides a significant amount of variety, offering a combination of Elite-lite and 'Minecraft in Space' mechanics. There's plenty to see and do, and the exploration aspect is enjoyable - if a little bland. The planetary biomes and overall game could still do with further diversity, but there's plenty here to get to your teeth into.\n\nHello Games show no sign of slowing down their support for the game either, having just recently released a bizarre in-game music synthesizer of all things, and going by the evidence of their progress to date I can only see the game improving further as time moves on.\n\nEDIT - 24/09/2020 \"Origins\" Patch: well, you can ignore the previous comments about diversity being a bit on the low side. They already added things like living ships, derelicts, space creatures and robots since I made this review, and with the Origins patch the variety of experience on offer is on such a scale now that I don't think I'm going to be lacking for things to do for some time. Also, impressively, the game runs even better than it did when I originally posted this - and the rejigged UI looks fantastic on Ultrawide. \n\nBrilliant work by the team at Hello Games. I can't think of any game I've played (and I've been indulging since the late 80's) where I've ever gone from \"I can't stand this\" to \"this is one of my favourite games\". It's taken a while to get here, but No Man's Sky is definitely one of the greats.\n- I even set a calendar reminder so that I could get this on release. I wish I hadn't bothered. Going great guns until I got to the passage. Game over as I can't progress. Tried allsorts to drop the jammer but unable to do so. I guess it is a case of waiting for all the bugs to get resolved.\n- It is a total eyegasm with a captivating story/lore. If you're even a tiny bit interested in anything f*cked-up and mysterious (SCP-like), buy this.\n\nFrom the gameplay perspective, it is simply good. Nothing mind-blowing, but good nonetheless.\n\nI've completed the game with a couple of sidequests (there are more for me) in about 13 hours, and there are two story DLC + the Expeditions mode, so I anticipate at least another 10+ hours of gameplay. Which is great for the price.\n\nUpdate: I've put in ~10 more hours to complete the Foundation DLC. It is a good DLC, and brings a few more hours of joy living in this world. It also has some sick areas (like that dark cave with the TV). The overall design is a bit more dull, but I enjoyed the story.\n- Okay this is a weird situation. I personally don't like this game all that much, but I do still recommend it nonetheless. That's because despite me not being personally huge on it, I can't deny that it is a very well-crafted game that definitely will give people the experience they want if this is the type of game they're looking for. I, turns out, am not part of the crowd that is targeted for said experience. I just found the whole trial and error stealth RTS style of this game to just not be my cup of tea, but again I can't deny its very well-crafted. I also think the art style and voice acting and story are all very well done as well. So yeah, if you're fond of games of this type, then go for it. I'm sure you won't be disappointed. I, for one, don't think I'm entirely sold on it though.\n- 1 week before release i played the demo, it was a 20 minutes demo that was very underwhelming, but i still thought i should give the game a chance to see if it gets better later on.\n\nIt doesn't.\n\nSo the first thing i read about this game in the embed of the steam link was \"a fresh take on the jrpg genre\", and its probably the biggest problem of the game. It is really the most basic, mediocre turn base combat you can find.\n\nTurn base combat, rock paper scissor elemental types plus physical, materia base skills with few spots (i had only 4 skills activated),  no gear, no party. Does that sound like a fresh take to you?\n\nSo if the gameplay is so barebones it means is at least hard right? Well no, it is basic and easy. The start is easy, in the mid part they blow up the HP of enemies so you understand you should buy new skills, and once you do it the game is easy again. Mob enemies are generally harder than bosses because you are 1vs3 most of the time, while in bosses you can just debuff it and make it slow, while you have 2 turns to spam healings and hitting. There also some questionable decisions on the minor mechanics of the combat system but i don't think they matter (see some paragraphs below)\n\nNow here is what is really the \"fresh take\": the setting being cyberpunk. Everything is written with tech terminology. The mana is called data, block and delay turn is called cache, melee combat is called hack? some of the terms don't even make sense of what they actually do. Also because we obviously live in a technological society we have people called \"V-sync\" or \"Nullpointer\", expresions like \"Digits!\" or \"Oh my grind!\", you know, normal behaviour if you ask me.\n\nThe story is pretty standard for a futuristic setting, it wasn't bad but also it wasn't good, pretty normal.\n\nThe artstyle is cool, the music is generally cool, which i think its why most people would don't mind the boring gameplay and will just play for the story, which is also present in the game itself because you have options to either skip every random encounter (yeah we have those here) or to insta win every battle when you want it.\n\nSo if you want to try this game because of the \"fresh take in the jrpg genre\" you will be disappointed, if you have played jrpgs before there is nothing new in this game, you have already played it before.\n- The game is a masterpiece, just like the first one. After finishing PoE 1, I immediately started with the second one and I was treated to another marvel of a game. Here are some of my thoughts:\n\nThe Good:\n-Very good main story but the side content is what made this game great\n-Interesting and deep characters, both new ones and some returning from the first game, including companions\n-The story picks up after the events of the first game and is a direct continuation of the first game (just like with Baldur’s Gate 1 and 2)\n-If you still have the savegame-files from the first game, your decisions and consequences from the first game will carry over\n-There is so much lore, if you are into reading and listening to stories\n-A lot of voice-acting\n-A lot of pets you can collect and the equipped one has a small benefit to your party\n-Interesting races and sub-races, each with its own boons and downsides\n-Interesting classes and sub-classes, including the possibility of multi-classes\n-You can retrain your characters\n-You can make a new character to join your party at any time at tavern\n-Item and weapon diversity (including pistols)\n-You have the option to play the game as either turn-based (like divinity original sin) or real time (with game pause, just like Baldur’s Gate)\n-You can sail the seas as a pirate and attack any ship you meet without consequence. The ships on the map will respawn endlessly so you will never run out, which makes them a real great source of income.\n-Besides the ship you are given at the beginning, there are a few others you can buy. Each has its own benefits\n-Ship, crew and sailing require some management, but if you like this sort of stuff you can get real invested in it \n-Exploring the map by ship, if you are into that kind of stuff\n-When engaging other ships, you have a choice between boarding or naval combat\n-Endurance is no longer a thing so you only need to manage your Health during fights. You will like this if you were not a big fan of the Endurance vs Health system from the first game\n-The resting system has improved. Besides taverns, now you can rest anywhere you want as long as you have food\n-No inventory management is necessary. Your inventory is infinite so just pick everything up because sooner or later you might need things like explosives, potions, tools etc.\n-Choice matters, and boy are there a lot of different paths you can choose from\n-Romance options\n-Bounties are fun and offer good experience and money\n-DLCs are a bit shorter than the one from the first game, but they are just as good (will not describe them to avoid spoilers)\n\nThe Bad:\n-Loading screens are too long and too many\n-Just like in the first game, I reached max level at about 2/3 of the game(max level 20) so any experience gathered beyond that was pointless. By the end of the game could have easily reached level 30 if that was a thing\n-Naval combat is scripted, so it might not be as spectacular as you might imagine\n-Exploring islands on foot isn’t so much fun\n-The idea of factions might not be to everyone’s liking\n-After playing for a few hours, the game performance seems to decrease and my pc struggled with running it. Maybe the game has an optimization problem but it’s possibly that this one is on me and the game is fine. This might not be the case for other users.\n\nAdvice:\n-In the beginning of the game, try to reach Neketaka asap and do as many quests there as you can before heading out on your ship exploring the seas\n-Pick everything up. Your inventory space is infinite and you will end up needing diverse items like explosives, traps, tools etc.\n-Always have tools with you: hammer and chisel, prybar, lockpicks, grappling hook. You will really need them from time to time\n-Plundering other ships is a great source of experience, resources and money but be careful not to burn yourself out if you do it for too long\n-If you get stuck on a quest, just do some online research\n-Invest money in your ship and crew as soon as you can\n-Always have a tank and healer in the party\n-Make sure to diversify the skills of your party. It’s always good to have someone with Mechanics, Religion, Athletics or Diplomacy most of all\n-Enchant your items\n-When you get the white/grey colored legendary items, make sure to bind them to the character you equip them on and do the mini-quests inscribed on them to unlock new powers and features\n-Use summons, as they are great for distracting enemies. They can take a lot of hits and also dish it out\n\nMy game experience:\nI played on the classic (normal) difficulty, just like I do with every new game I start, and found the game not very hard but fun. I played the game in real time, because turn-based takes too long. As soon as I got my first ship working, I sailed to Neketaka, found the last companions I knew I wanted on my permanent team (Maia and Pallegina) and just quested away in the city until I had enough money and levels under my belt to start exploring the seas and attack other ships. I never did the scripted naval combat because I was having too much fun boarding the ships and watch my characters fight. My party consisted of my Watcher (Moon Godlike, Chanter, specced in summoning), Eder (because he’s a beast of a tank and has some fun interactions with others), Xoti (gotta have a healer, she’s also fun to have around), Maia Rua (very good ranged DPS and she comes with a pet cause she’s a ranger) and Pallegina, who is an excellent off-tank and support character. Once I took to the seas, I made my fortune by plundering ships, equipped my ship and characters with the best money could buy and then just catered to the different existing factions in the Deadfire, while not loosing sight of my main mission.\n\nI had a great time playing Pillars of Eternity 1 and 2. I consider they offer some great replay value and are great fun if you are into this style of RPG games. If you are a fan of games like the Baldur’s Gate, Icewind Dale, Diablo, Dragon Age, Neverwinter Nights and Divinity Original Sin series, you must try PoE 1 and 2.\nI really hope they make Pillars of Eternity 3.\n\n- Before I continue writing my review on this game, I got to say that the PC port of Valkyria Chronicles is one of the best, if not, [u]the[/u] best port. The game was originally exclusive for the PlayStation 3 back in 2008. The game was well received, but garnered low sales that would put the sequels Valkyria Chronicles 2 and 3 on the PSP. I actually never heard of this game before until a few week prior to the PC release on November 2014. That said, I will have to give a standing ovation to Sega for putting an effort to make the PC port well optimized in 1080p (or more) at 60 FPS (or more). Sega has my attention and I will present this review.\n \nValkyria Chronicles focuses on Welkin Gunther, a son of a legendary general who fought in the First Europan War, leads a platoon of some adults and teenage volunteers to defend their country against the invading forces of the Imperial Alliance. The game presents a mix of tactical strategy and third-person action that is very unique in the strategy game genre. Does this game deserve your attention? \n\nThe story takes place in a “fictional” European continent where the Second Europan War was fought primarily between the Atlantic Federation (think of all of the European countries, in a geographical sense) versus the Imperial Alliance (Russia, in a geographic sense). Gallia is a “neutral” country where it contains a unique resource known as Ragnite. Thus, the Imperial Alliance invade Gallia to get Ragnite to fuel up their war resources. One of the greatest parts about the game is how well the developers use analogies from World War II into the game and its execution is well-received. The analogies ranged from weapon designs (like the Gallian Scout weapons that look like the Soviet SVT-40 to the Imperial weaponry comparison to the real-life MP40 and STG44, and plenty others). The analogy extends to vehicles and geopolitical conflicts. \n\nThe character developments in the game are highly impressive, particularly with the relationship between Welkin (protagonist) and Alicia Melchiott (deuteragonist). The themes in Valkyria Chronicles consist a good mix of “light” moments (like hope as an example) and “semi-grotesque” themes of war (such as discrimination/racism, personal ambition over soldiers’ lives, and others themes that will unravel later on). Some reviewers criticized the game as being not serious on the themes about war. Honestly, I don’t think that the game is supposed to be depressing and a good mix between “light” and “dark” is best suited for the game. The story starts really slow in the beginning and actually begin to progress as you reach a certain point in the story. The plot is pretty good in most area while few scenes are a bit “awkward” in terms of sudden shifts between a sad event to a “positive motivation”. \n\nThe gameplay in Valkyria Chronicles is turn-based, but it is very unique because once you click on a character to choose, you can actually control the character to move to any location in third-person you like as long you have enough Action Points (basically, the movement bar). Experience points and money are earned by Ranks (like A, B, C, and D) by completing an objective within a certain number of turns (Example: Getting a ‘A’ rank within 3 turns or less to get the maximum amount of exp and money). However, it is possible that you can actually kill all of the enemies on the map, complete the objective, and still get an ‘A’ rank in the majority of missions (except for a few of them). \n\nWith the exp and money, you train your soldiers based on classes Scout, Shocktrooper, Lancer (Anti-Tank/Explosives), Engineers, and Sniper rather than individuals. The money are used up to upgrade weapons, buy tank parts, and purchasing “reports” from a reporter in certain chapters in the story. The game would last you a good 30-50 hours if you play the game in a smart, tactical manner or have an “OCD” on getting an “A” rank on every single mission in the story or a mix of both (like I did). \n\nThe game does have some faults, particularly when it comes to classes. Reviewers argued that Scouts are too overpowered, but in my view, it is best to say that scouts are too reliable since they have the most movement bar and top-tier weapons like the ZM Kar 8 (the game's version of Soviet PTRS-41 that can obliterate any enemy, even medium and heavy tanks if you shoot it in the back). Engineers are useless in the game since you won’t repair your tank very often (depending on your play style) and Scouts are the better alternative. There are some bugs in the game that is related to the monitor refresh rate (if you play it on a 144 Hz monitor like I did) in certain missions in the story. PC controls are a bit awkward when you control the tank. There are a few moments in the story that has some poor “transitions” (an example would be that an upsetting moment happened in the story and all of a sudden, some of the major characters wanted a medal for their part on a major battle in the next cutscene as if that upsetting moment never happen or affected them). \n\nThe game is often compared to XCOM when it comes to gameplay. This may be true, but Valkyria Chronicles is very unique since you can actually control the character in third person instead of the computer doing it for you when you command the character to move from Point A to B, in bird’s eye view. The game engine is very aesthetic and presents the story very well. I’m glad the Sega released Valkyria Chronicles to the PC and I am very pleased to hear that a (possible) new Valkyria Chronicles game is being trademarked (and hopefully in development) thanks to the PC sales. The default price of $20 is a good deal, -50% off is a great deal, -75% is a perfect steal. Valkyria Chronicles is one of my top games for 2014 due to its unique strategy gameplay and superb PC port optimization. I am looking forward for the new game that is being trademarked (or possible PC ports or revamp for VC2 and 3). This game has my highest recommendation for any strategy gamer who want to find something original, unique, and beautiful.\n- unprofessional review:\n\nits a really deep lore kind of game, very cool!\nit has some horror and grinding elements which i always love\ni havent finished the game just yet tho \nthe visuals are very cute\nas soon as i bought it was hooked!\noke theres many more but im to lazy to type :joy:\n\nover all ill give it a 10/10\nvery interesting lore wise\n- Originally a Skyrim mod known for its story and interesting main driving mechanic is made 100 times better here by having its own fleshed out art style and textures, deeper story and characters\n- Quite possibly the worst game ever.  The menus and navigation appear to have been designed to deliberately confuse the player.  At no point is there any guidance as to what the player should be doing.  Free roam is fun, but the driving physics are nonexistent.  \n\nInstruction comes in the form of a tiny text readout for a complicated step, and is never repeated or accessible.\n\nMost frustrating of all?  Its impossible to just simply quit the game without messing with the entire interface in a while goose chase for a way to exit the application.  I finally settled on ctrl-alt-del, but the game even withstood an end task and simply kept playing.  Had to hard boot my computer.\n\nTotal garbage.\n- This is a story about relationships.\nThis is a story about opposites.\nThis is a story about reflections.\nThis is a story about redemption.\nThis is a story about damnation.\nThis is a story about reconciliation.\nThis is a story about gods.\nThis is a story about paradoxes.\nThis is a story about love.\nThis is a story about hate.\nThis is a story about life.\nThis is a story about death.\nThis is a story about forgiveness.\nThis is a story about condemnation.\nThis is a story about time and time loops.\nThis is a story about multiverse theory.\nThis is a story about murder.\nThis is a story about betrayal.\nThis is a story about trust.\nThis is a story about freedom.\nThis is a story about happiness.\nThis is a story about sadness.\nThis is a story about boredom.\nThis is a story about a Princess.\nThis is a story about what looks like a Frog at one point.\n\nThis is a story about everything and nothing.  A poem and a screed.\n\nIt begins with a simple instruction: Go kill the Princess, and a simple choice: will you kill her, will you free her, or simply walk away?  Oh, you can also decide to let her remain a prisoner; choosing to do essentially nothing is still a choice.\n\nIt ends with a question: who is she?  Also, who are you?  More importantly, what are you to one another?\n\nThis review also ends with a question: \"Should you buy this game?\" and an answer: \"Hell yes, you should!\"\n- It was a nice little trip, about 8 hours of gameplay (A bit more if you feel like grinding)\nStory went along nicely from start to end, in no place felt rushed.All sidequest can be done as you progress on the story.\nCombat is nice, and gotta apply every mechanic you had learnt about to fight the final boss.\nThe music, both in fights and background is really nice, has some nice Cyber-future feel\nRecommended? Yes. \nRating 9/10. Hoping for DLC or sequel soon enough\n- Pretty fun and polished for a fast paced shooter.\nOn the technical side, the game ran well and I encountered very few bugs: in a few cases I got stuck in the level geometry, but then a failsafe teleported me back to a safe spot after a few seconds, and in another case I got softlocked by a broken level trigger but reloading the last checkpoint fixed it.\nAll the weapons are fairly useful and interesting, and they can be combined in creative ways instead of the extremely boring \"use A on B\" seen in Doom Eternal.\nEnemy variety is pretty good, even the lowest tiers are different enough to require a bit of attention.\nThe levels also aren't bad, but you have so much mobility that it's easy to sequence break by accident and in some cases skip past large chunks of them.\nSecrets aren't terrible, no wall humping required in this game, but given the sheer size of most levels they can be pretty tedious to find even when no attempt is made to hide them: in some cases, the opposite is true and you'll just walk into a \"secret\" by looking to your side as you follow the intended path.\nDifficulty is odd: I was playing on Street Cleaner (the middle of the 5 difficulty levels), and around the halfway point the game went from \"very easy\" to \"very hard\", with plenty of attacks dealing 300+ damage when the most you can stack is 200 health and 200 armor.\nAt least, the augments you collect in-game and the mutators you unlock by finding secrets offer plenty of ways to fine-tune the difficulty level: for example, you can enable infinite ammo and instagib to breeze through even the hardest difficulty, or disable all weapons but your chainsaw leg and triple enemy spawns to turn even the easiest difficulty into a bit of a challenge.\nFinally, there's a level editor and that's always nice.\n\nWorth playing, even at full price.\n- A dude looked at you funny? Punch him. Some guy is chilling by the river? Kick him in. A girl has a cute outfit on? Divekick her from across the street. Bought pizza at a food truck? Uppercut the staff. Violence is never the answer; It is in fact the question, and the answer is YES.\n- I bought the game and the mechanics are fun! The battle system is super impactful and just FEELS fun. It really gives you a sense of satisfaction. And it has interesting elements that really every game should have... but the UI sucks, the classes are genderlocked, and there are so many systems going on at once it's annoying. Like something as simple as a constant notification in the middle of the screen of some other person or random guild you know nothing about doing quests or getting skill points. It's a fun game, but has WAAAY too many minor (except genderlocked classes. Genderlock is never a minor thing) problems that just add up making it annoying to play\n- Why did i get this game???\n\nWell.. Mainly because i've always liked seeing those big trucks driving by me, So i wondered what it would feel like driving a big tractor trailer, And so i got this!\n\nHonestly, I can't say if it's anything like a real truck, But this game does get very very complicating when it comes to parking with your 53' container, And it makes me wonder, Wow! Those guys must really have some good practice! Because if i can't do it here, I for sure wont be able to do it in real life! xD\n\nMultiplayer is super fun as well, Driving next to other truck drivers and then honking at them, or meeting new friends, SOME actually truck drivers, and then traveling with them, Stopping to weight your freight, getting gas and such, It's a very fun experience.\n\nHonest Rating: 10/10 As of right now, Because I feel like i haven't played enough to experience any problems or bugs, But the game is very fun!! ***ONLY IF YOU LOVE SIMULATOR GAMES, If you don't, Then maybe think twice, But I enjoy simulator games.*** And if you want to give this game a try as your first Simulator game, Then i would recommend it!\n\nRecommendable? Yes, I recommend it to people who want to give Simulator games a try, This is a perfect one. (Or Euro Truck Simulator) Although if you're from the USA i recommend this one, Because Euro Truck Simulator has different driving rules than US, So you might get tickets for some things you don't know lol..\n- When reading reviews for this game you'll generally find two camps. There are people who find DW:U incredibly deep and engaging, and there are those who find it incredibly obtuse and frustrating. The problem is they're both right. The game does feature a wealth of features, and you will almost certainly never experience them.\n\nEven for a player like me who is used to impenetrable strategy games like Europa Universalis this was difficult to play. Income see-saws drunkenly from crippling deficit to fabulous surplus and back again depending on what's happening this exact second. Land combat units are jam packed into impossibly tiny UI bars. AI factions have reams of vague, undefined character traits. The encyclopedia technically gives information on everything but is so poorly organized and unsearchable as to verge on useless.\n\nWith time, practice, and a lot of time spent researching on independent websites you can have fun with this game. But for sixty dollars you shouldn't have to, and quite frankly, don't. Find yourself one of the many excellent 4Xs in the store and pass over this ambitious but ultimately flawed gem.\n- [I received this product for free from a giveaway]. Only played for a short time, but sheesh, it's a bit of a mess both visually and gameplay wise. There's not much I can really say that would differ from what's shown in the trailer (rather crude MS-paint looking drawings with a few short looping backgrounds). You jump when moving right or left, flappy-bird esque, you dodge stuff going across the screen and from the top, which is a bit boring to me, but some may enjoy it more. You also have to go out of the screen to dodge sometimes, but also if you go too far out (who knows how far) you'll die as well. It might be an okay time waster for free (like old flash games), but I wouldn't recommend spending your money on this.\n- 🎃 Tя!cked not Tяeated 🎃 full price $29.99 you can only play a 10 min Light Version. I had hoped that was a joke? I tried Steam \"Offline\" mode still blocked me from Full Monty 18+ XP Room 👎🏻\n\nSteam Refunded 😩 see discussions click 💭 icon\n\n⚪️ $29.99 is greedy money grab for no sex play content.\n⚪️ We can't get anyone to answer back how we buy 18+ Version.\n⚪️ I can see from the Web Site they have a Mobile VR Truck just for Sensual VR and look to now be renting rooms in popular restaurants around Germany. \n\nI honestly believe until the DEV's of this game have fully exhausted it's Euro revenue stream from VR Room Rentals and VR Mobile Truck. They will not sell us the public it's 18+ XP Room from it's Web Site.  \n\nNote to Publisher: Anything less than changing this to a Free Demo from all the above I've stated.  Then you don't belong on steam store.\n- This now classic arcade made history as being one of the first twin-stick shooters that employed 3D arenas in an interesting manner - this was an important addition to the shmup genre, which really blew me away as a developer working in the same genre. But this also brought a problem: the gameplay was made harder by the 3D rotating camera. \n \nIt impacts overall visibility and the clarity of collision between the player and the enemies. Also, the game is often late with its warnings to the player related to the incoming appearance of enemies.\n \nThis makes the player die occasionally not because of their own error but due to visual glitches. \n \nI personally didn't like the upgrades because I found it unclear in what ways are they affecting the gameplay and they didn’t really help me achieve higher scores. \nOther noteworthy features include 12 battle modes including Paciﬁsm, King, Claustrophobia and 4 all-new modes, but also the local co-op.\n \nOverall this is an interesting addition to Geometry Wars franchise, but Geometry Wars 2 still sits on the throne. If you are a GW fan, I would recommend this game because it shines in all other aspects. \n\nIf you are looking for other interesting shooter games, I would like to invite you to check our community group on Steam:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/593680\n\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/593680/Rocking_Pilot/\n- No additional account, no unnecessary launcher, no denuvo, no epic exclusivity, no microtransactions, just a video game as it always should be..\n\n【グループB】\n- Oh boy. This is a beautiful game. There's unlockable items, a hidden boss, lots of enemies, and characters that change your play styles. Numerous ways to make the game accessible for you!\n\nBut is the game fun? I'd say no, the game was just ok. I wasn't really solving puzzles so much dealing with a RNG generator. Ironically the bosses felt slower and more boring than the levels, they are a battle of patience, wait until the potions fall - hit them 3 or 4 times - repeat.\n\nWould I revisit this game after some patches or dlc? No, probably not. Unfortunately I think this game has some base design problems and not content or quality problems.\n- Blows every single PFS game of the last decade out of the water, even those shitty D**M games that people who never played FPS games before seems to worship in order to look cool. Smooth and fast gameplay with a lot of variety. Great visuals even on medium/high settings. Story and writing is shit but pretty much on the same level as rest of the Borderlands series with the exception of the Telltale one. Writing has always been the worst part of the series, dont be delusional retards.\n- Steins;Gate Elite is a great Visual Novel when looked at in isolation. The main problem is that Steins;Gate (the original) exists. I don't mind the difference in art styles, that is a matter of personal preference anyway. Graphics in Elite are a lot more animated, images in the original are more static but also more detailed. What I have an issue with is the missing parts in the story.\n\nThere are a few situations where Elite eliminates choices when compared to the original. I won't spoil details, but in one of the early chapters you can choose to ignore or answer a phone call, leading to alternate branches in the story (they join again soon after, but each branch still contains unique content). Well, you can choose in the original. In Elite, you automatically answer the phone, the other branch is no longer in the game.\n\nAt a later point in the game, I noticed that quite a sizeable chunk of a previously linear story progression (not even an alternate branch) concerning Faris was completely cut out. Again, I won't spoil details in case you just want to decide which version of the game to get and don't know the story yet. It has been some time since I played the original, so I might have missed more instances of missing story parts, but at least this one part was really obvious.\n\nThe missing branches and parts are not really relevant to the overall story, but you probably want them if you want to know more about the characters. Elite is more streamlined, but at least all of the alternate endings are still here. So while there is missing stuff compared to the original, there is quite a bit more when compared to the anime. Then again, the anime added more story after the true ending of the original game. I was hoping that Elite added (and maybe fleshed out) this extra content as well, but no luck here, Elite ends at the same point as the original.\n\nIf you don't mind the art style of the original, play that one instead. The second game (Steins;Gate 0) only exists in it's original form anyway. Elite might still be worth it if heavily discounted since it is the only way to get the \"free\" Linear Bounded Phenogram. You can justify it as buying LBP and getting Elite as a free extra.\n- So, I've been playing games for 36 year now. All the genres, like them all. Most of all RPG, turn based strategies, WW2 shooters (BF) etc. And just achieved victory in Slay the spire, after 206 hours of hugely enjoyable play. I would say this is in top 5 games of all times for me. Maybe even top 2, together with Card Hunter. Those two games are so far the two games I would take to a deserted island. I am actually seriously considering making my own card based game in the future. So just try this. Even my 10 year old son loves it. I just recorded The Slaying for him xD\n- Absolutely amazing. PLEASE don't judge this game based on how it looks. You must try it yourself! I thought it would be terrible but a friend convinced me to try it, and I'm glad he did. I haven't had so much fun in a game in a long time.\n- When I first heard of Undertale, I had no interest in playing it. I thought the fanbase was massively cringeworthy and the game was probably uninteresting. \nI was correct about the fanbase, but boy was I wrong about the game. \n\nI normally play action/adventure RPG games with the occasional sprinkling of singleplayer FPS. I am not the kind of person to normally go in for conceptual hipster nonsense, and I say that because that's what I thought this game was. \n\nIn reality, it has some of the best atmosphere and writing I've seen in a game in a very long time. And above all else, it manages to be heart-rendingly (no pun indended) sad at times and actually funny at other times. Plus, the music is fantastic and the whole package has a level of care I don't often see anymore. \n\nYou are doing yourself a disservice if you don't try this game out. And I don't say that lightly. \n\nStory/writing: 10\nMusic: 8\nReplay value: 7\nGameplay: 6 for the actual fun of it, but I'll give it a 7 just because of how inventive the mercy system is. This is an RPG you can play without killing anything. \n\n- Mori's 3-Part Review:\n1. Bare minimum information and recommendations to improve your playthrough\n2. Background information on me and my playthrough\n3. More extensive non-spoiler reactions\n \nPart 1: Recommendations for You\nIf you're like me and you try to get all the extra scene dialogue, then please, if you take nothing else from this, give yourself time to play this game yourself. There is actually so much content here, I really want you all to take your time to experience it as you go. The game is just too long to binge in a reasonably short amount of time, and if you do binge, you're going to lose a lot.\n \nMy recommendations:\n1. Give yourself time to play the game. Let it sink in, and take notes- it'll be rewarded. The game is literally too dense and too long to binge reasonably if you like 100%ing.\n \n2. Get invested in the characters and pay attention to them, not just the (admittedly stellar) mysteries.\n \n3. Explore the game, its mechanics, and its dialogue yourself. Don't be afraid to restart a Somnium several times; the more options you pick, the more meaningful information you get.\n \n4. If you're a puzzle lover then try to solve the game yourself. You're going to have a blast if you manage it, and the game has tons of built-in hint systems to make it even easier, fairer, and more fun.\n \n5. Try to go in knowing at little as you can. The marketing has already done a great job. Focus on finishing the game and bringing it all together.\n \n6. On PC, force anti-aliasing on using your graphics card to make the game prettier. Game ran and controlled smoothly with few bugs.\n \n7. You don't need AI1 to play AI2, but I think AI2 does spoil AI1, though you could still enjoy them in reverse order.\n \n7. If you're sensitive to horny then just read less background dialogue in Ryuki side. Gore is pretty toned down, and there isn't any single huge CW.\n \nYou can stop reading now if you don't want your playthrough tainted by my reactions/expectations effected.\n \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nPart 2: Who am I, and how do I play?\nI'm an Uchikoshi fanatic. I've played all his English-translated games, and visual novels are my favorite genre of game. I've played a lot of visuals novels, but Uchizawa's are my favorites. I usually try to 100% complete all the scenes and see all the bonus dialogue. I've also played a lot of other genres of game, and I do like fun gameplay, but the most important things to me tend to be:\n \nA. An interesting story is absolutely what gets me invested\nB. Bunches of novel ideas like unique plot points I haven't seen before, philosophical ideas, or puzzles\nC. Characters that I at least don't actively hate; I can like a game for the above two, but characters still matter\nD. Deep personal connection, usually formed by connections to real people or how a game shaped my life\n \nThose are the ways I rate my top games. For the last 8 years, my top 2 favorite games have been the same:\n \nMy top favorite game of all time is Remember11. I love the plot, the ideas, the twists, the characters, and it's what got me truly invested in Uchikoshi. It's very much a mystery game first with an unravelling mystery and themes I love to explore.\n \nMy second favorite game is Virtue's Last Reward. I love the interactive moral dilemmas. VLR's use of the Prisoner's Dilemma jumpstarted my interested in Philosophy which led me to major in Philosophy. I don't like the characters as much save for a few, but it's still very important to me.\n \nNow, let me tell you how I've played AINI: I've basically been playing non-stop since June 13th.\n \nTake this with a grain of salt because I've been documenting as I play (the average main story playtime seems to be 20-35 hours, with 100% likely taking 50+), but right now, I have 97 hours of playtime. I have not gotten all the dialogue, achievements, or fully explored the abundance of extra mechanics. Instead, I have a 616-page reaction document full of constant laughs, cries, screams, passing out, and most of all love.\n \nPart 3: My Review\nThe R11 #1 and VLR #2 holy duology held true for 8 years. Also, AI1 isn't one of my favorite standalone games; it has huge personal connection for me because of the community and the AI1 ARG, but it wasn't my favorite as a game.\n \nI gave all that background because I want you to take me seriously when I say this:\nAI2 is my new favorite game. The #1 spot has been Easily dethroned.\n \nThe themes, twists, characters, ideas, gameplay, visuals, voice acting, fair mystery, presentation, mechanics, and comedy all of it resonates together perfectly. I don't even tend to value gameplay or visuals, but at many times, this game is fun to play while looking genuinely beautiful and cinematic.\n \nThe story reads like a proper Uchikoshi + Nakazawa return to form. The mystery is fair, interesting, meaningful, and complex told satisfyingly. There are many deep ideas, concepts, and themes utilized in thought-provoking ways.\n \nGameplay-wise, there are tons of mechanics that are utilized to make each Somnium unique; they all feel designed by love, fair, and reflective of the character through gorgeous symbolism. They blow the first game completely out of the water. Each one is its own experience to explore and a visual delight. There are also tons of mechanics for you to discover that make AI2 a fun game to play.\n \nThe animations, voices, and directing are cinematic; this game is actually breathtaking a lot of the time. It's backed up by great and charming character writing- despite the fact Mizuki is my favorite AI1 character with 0 contest, I grew to like much of the AI2 cast the same amount.\n \nAI2 is a story about halves and splitting, but also love and coming together- please, see it through until it's whole. I hope and believe you will all fall in love with AI2 like me; AI2 is all I've ever wanted. AI2 is my dream game come true; it's a gorgeous love letter to all Uchikoshi fans who love Zero Escape's puzzles, Infinity's mysteries, and AI's characters and humor.\n- Holy crap.\n\nPowerful.\n\nThis game explores some serious life issues: Abuse. The pain of childhood, and of parenthood. Manhood and womanhood. Strength. Loss.\n\nThis game had me near crying at several points. The story is freaking powerful. It's also remarkably well written, and downright hilarious at times. \n\nAnd the gameplay? \n\nIt's fun enough that I want to play through it again right after beating it. This turn-based RPG is sometimes brutally difficult, in part because it slaps many old-school conventions in the face (e.g., sleeping can be dangerous). Battles are challenging. Tactical thinking is essential since many enemies are VERY dangerous and you're frequently outnumbered. I really applaud the AI as it keeps you on your toes. \n\nThe game doesn't hold your hand. There is no map, compass, or any attempt to make navigation easier. You just have to remember your way around, though there are plenty of memorable environments. \n\nCharacters will force you to make decisions with lasting consequences. There are dozens of hard choices to make along the journey, which brings me to another topic the game explores: decision. Will you save your friends, or your stuff? I got very attached to the buddies I picked up, only to have them devoured by a mutant, or bail on me when I least expected it. You just never know what you'll face, nor what to choose. Thinking back to many of those times, I don't know what I should have done. All the options sucked. \n\nBut I can't help asking myself, \"Did I make the right choice?\" \n\nHighly recommended.\n- 1 week before release i played the demo, it was a 20 minutes demo that was very underwhelming, but i still thought i should give the game a chance to see if it gets better later on.\n\nIt doesn't.\n\nSo the first thing i read about this game in the embed of the steam link was \"a fresh take on the jrpg genre\", and its probably the biggest problem of the game. It is really the most basic, mediocre turn base combat you can find.\n\nTurn base combat, rock paper scissor elemental types plus physical, materia base skills with few spots (i had only 4 skills activated),  no gear, no party. Does that sound like a fresh take to you?\n\nSo if the gameplay is so barebones it means is at least hard right? Well no, it is basic and easy. The start is easy, in the mid part they blow up the HP of enemies so you understand you should buy new skills, and once you do it the game is easy again. Mob enemies are generally harder than bosses because you are 1vs3 most of the time, while in bosses you can just debuff it and make it slow, while you have 2 turns to spam healings and hitting. There also some questionable decisions on the minor mechanics of the combat system but i don't think they matter (see some paragraphs below)\n\nNow here is what is really the \"fresh take\": the setting being cyberpunk. Everything is written with tech terminology. The mana is called data, block and delay turn is called cache, melee combat is called hack? some of the terms don't even make sense of what they actually do. Also because we obviously live in a technological society we have people called \"V-sync\" or \"Nullpointer\", expresions like \"Digits!\" or \"Oh my grind!\", you know, normal behaviour if you ask me.\n\nThe story is pretty standard for a futuristic setting, it wasn't bad but also it wasn't good, pretty normal.\n\nThe artstyle is cool, the music is generally cool, which i think its why most people would don't mind the boring gameplay and will just play for the story, which is also present in the game itself because you have options to either skip every random encounter (yeah we have those here) or to insta win every battle when you want it.\n\nSo if you want to try this game because of the \"fresh take in the jrpg genre\" you will be disappointed, if you have played jrpgs before there is nothing new in this game, you have already played it before.\n- I am over 50. \nI have played a lot of games.\nThe Return of the Obra Dinn is one of the best games I have ever played.\n\nIt is one of those rare cases (though certainly by design) where everything comes together.  Story, game play, graphics, challenge level, feeling of accomplishment on advancement. Simply an outstanding piece of work that I enjoyed every moment (even when frustrated) and will remember fondly.\n- I've read some of the negative reviews and name calling is petty so instead I'll just say a lot of those opinions are dumb.\n\nLook. This isn't Firewatch. This is a seven year old game that pissed off a lot of bros and continues (apparently, christ) to do so because it embraced not only being a walking simulator but a gay one at that. And yeah bro, 15 bucks seems steep for a game that you can finish in under an hour, but hell, maybe don't speed run? It's a walking simulator after all. Or maybe support indie game devs. *Or maybe* read the Steam tags that say \"short\" and \"walking simulator\" and then don't count that against the game. You don't review CS;GO and say \"not bad, but too much shooting\" right? RIGHT? \n\nLook. I've had some wine. And I've had some feelings. And Gone Home is a piece of video game history whether people want it to be or not. It's a game I wish I would have known about when it was first released. Hell I needed it five years earlier than that. \n\nIf you're pissed that Gone Home wasn't dramatic enough or that it's \"homosexual\" then maybe realize that this game wasn't made for you and that does not qualify it as bad. \n\nAnyway, that cat journal achievement was neat.\n- For a company as big as Amazon, this game is extremely sub par. It feels as though it's in Early Access and some of the recent patch notes are very worrying for the game's future\n\nPros:\n- Stunning gfx. Especially for an MMO, the lighting in particular is amazing\n- Sound track is great and ambience adds personality to the zones\n- Some really cool zones to explore, feels as though you can get lost when you start\n- Controls/Keybinds are already really good imo, I only changed a few\n- Tutorial/Starter Quest chains do a great job of introducing you to the game without being too slow\n- Combat (when it works) Is really fun. Lots of action based fights\n- Wars are a really cool mechanic, they are ultimately flawed but are still a lot of fun\n\nCons:\n- Game is extremely shallow. It is borderline addicting for the first few levels, this soon dies off. When (If) You reach lvl 60, you ask yourself what do you do now?\n- As beautiful as the game is, a lot of it is copy and pasted. Literally. There are zones, towns, dungeons that are almost identical. Ruins immersion\n- Quests are extremely repetitive and boring. They consist of kill mobs, loot mobs, loot chests and that’s about it. No diversity\n- Combat can be laggy, you weapon swap and it doesn’t register sometimes. Wars can be a PowerPoint Presentation at times\n- Guild UI is awful. There is no guild bank, treasury ledger so you cannot monitor who donates money for wars etc. Makes running a guild a nightmare\n- There are countless exploits and duplications that have been abused upsetting economies, player numbers and the general integrity of the game\n- Server population has been decimated since launch leading to many dead servers. They’re merging already\n- There are some very worrying patch notes/future releases that are changing fundamental mechanics of the game. In some cases nerfs which punish players who didn’t rush to level cap\n- Watermark is a stupid progression system for gear. It forces you to run daily elite zone farm chains which get extremely repetitive\n\nIf this was a small indie dev company, I could give them the benefit of the doubt. However this is frickin’ Amazon. This product is totally unacceptable and needs to go back in the oven.\n\n- I bought this game because it was supposed to be like Harvest Moon. I'm now close to finishing an ingame year.\n\n+ The town and art style is very much like Harvest Moon\n+ There are a lot of interesting characters with lovely art to socialize with\n+ The dog is helpful, barking on spots where you could dig out some items\n+ Some events, scenes and dialogues in this game made me smile to no end. This is a happy game.\n\n- You have a farmland of 40 tiles and farm by seeding tile by tile and watering tile by tile. The watering can is your only tool and upgradable to water 3x3 tiles.\n- Friendship is a grind, as is tradition in the genre. I once gifted a whole harvest to a girl without visable change in the 1 to 10 affection meter. After finishing the friendship grind on 3 villagers, the game seemed to reward me with... some random dialogue lines.\n- You can only bind the shovel and watering can. You cannot bind anything else like the brush or milking device or animal fodder. This makes the daily barn work quite nasty.\n\n\nIf you need a Harvest Moon on PC, this isn't what you want. Games like \"Friends of Mineral Town\" had a significantly larger focus on farming simulation. World's Dawn is a small town simulator with a little gardening on the side.\n- You are an astronaut, you wake up in a rescue rocket, and against your wills you are shot from Theseus space station on Chori V planet. After landing on the planet you find a strange device that helps you get back on board and survive until help arrives.\n\nGreat game, get it on sale, because it is a bit short. I like games like Portal 2, The Talos Principle, and there is no point to compare this games, because they are completly different, even if they have few common things like solving riddles and story with fresh look at some philosophical questions. Point is that every one of them including The Swapper is good at what it do, and every one of them is unique. For me it is pleasure to play this game beacause of it atmospheric well done design, riddles and questioning the meaning of existence.\n- Game is super realistic, got ahead of Hamilton and he pitted me into a wall going 180mph, just like real life!\n- Edited\n\nI Didn’t have high expectations for this game. I read the reviews and expected a mediocre game from ubisoft. I was let down big time. I was given a watered down version of Syndicate that had terrible game mechanics.\n\tAs I navigated the first enemy compound I came across it felt difficult to navigate through the grass and between the buildings. Clearly not developed as a stealth game. Once I had given up on the whole stealth aspect of the mission I was very easily able to slaughter all of the guards in the compound. I trying using the bow but it’s hard to use compared to Tomb Raider and Far Cry Primal’s easy to use bow. Sword combat could have been improved but it wasn’t the worst I’ve seen. No skill required, just click the mouse button rapidly to kill all of the guards in your path. The devs clearly didn’t try that hard because they knew that people would by their game anyways because of Ubisoft and Assassin’s Creed fanboys.\n\tAssassin’s Creed: Origins could’ve been an amazing game that would revolutionize the series but no. The devs had to ruin that possibility by being lazy and making a watered down version of Syndicate. I’ve played Syndicate quite a bit and I thought it was a good game. Don’t get this game for the full price or even for $35. Let’s hope Ubisoft gets their shit together and doesn't fuck up Far Cry 5.\n\nThank you for your time.\n- This game vs. HOI3:\n---------------------\n\nAdvantages:\n\n1.) The production system is more interesting and engaging, and far more balanced than the old IC system of HOI3. \n2.) The unit creation system is far more in depth and interesting, featuring many different brigade types and support companies, allowing you to change your divisions however you would like. \n3.) This game is far more stable than HOI3.\n4.) This game is updated regularly and has bugfixes regularly too, with content being added free along with every DLC. \n5.) The modding community of HOI4 is far larger with excellent mods such as Kaiserreich, Millenium Dawn, Red World, and Endseig.\n6.) HOI4 muliplayer is actually playable without making you want to shoot yourself.\n7.) China is no longer something Japan can take within 2 months.\n8.) An actual peace conference system and ideologies that actually impact the game.\n9.) Far easier to get into than HOI3.\n10.) Less railroading and the AI wont spaz if you do something ahistorical.\n11.) Planes are no longer as cancer as they used to be.\n12.) Far less micromanagement if you choose not to want to micro.\n13.) A better tutorial (still not a great one though.)\n\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n1.) The research system is bare bones in comparison to HOI3.\n2.) The War in the Pacific is basically nonexistant and naval warfare is awful (to be improved with next patch, being released eventually:tm:)\n3.) People dont really join the war in HOI4 unless theyre directly attacked, making continents like South America completely useless due to the fact that none of the countries there ever do anything but still build up their military, contributing lag.\n4.) Due to the game's engine, it can only use a single one of your processing cores, meaning regardless of your computer quality the game will run kinda slowly.\n5.) Speaking of slowly, the game is poorly optimized and frame loss is extremely common, especially 1942 onwards, when majors can have upwards of 300+ divisions. \n6.) The AI is often braindead, doing hilariously incompetent things such as charging endlessly into your lines, removing all its troops from your front, leaving major areas completely undefended, and completely ignoring the aerial aspect of the war.\n7.) Specific AI are even more braindead than the rest, specifically island nations, or nations that otherwise need to use navies and airforces more. Yes, the Japanese, American, and British AI are some of the worst in the game. In a WW2 game. \n8.) Your allies are completely useless and often you will find yourself doing all the fighting yourself, or even being hindered by your own allies. Playing as Germany the Italians likely wont place a single division in North Africa. In D-Day, you will either be the only one contributing anything or your allies will contribute so much that the supply is ruined and your troops all die of attrition. As the USSR you will recieve 0 lend lease, and as China you will get absolutely no support from the west. \n9.) HOI3 is a lot cheaper than HOI4\n\n\nOther things which I feel are worth mentioning but arent really advantages or disadvantages:\n\n1.) HOI4 contains a lot more alt-history options, which while not for everyone, are fun to try out. \n2.) The focus-tree system is something completely different from anything in HOI3.\n3.) The game has a less in-depth OOB(Order of Battle), which while to some people is nice because theyre bad with OOB, others dislike. Specifically this game lacks corps. \n4.) The battle-planning system of HOI4, while easier to use than the one in HOI3, is still flawwed. In HOI3 it did absolutely nothing, but in this game it is a core part of playing. Unless you want to mircomanage every single division, like you did in HOI3, you will use this system. \n5.) While simpler, the game still possesses a learning curve.\n\n------------------------\n\nOverall: \n\nHOI4 is a far less grounded and historical experience than HOI3. Is this a good or bad thing? That depends on your perspective. HOI4 obviously has significant advantages over HOI3 in certain areas but many consider HOI3 to be an overall better game. Personally I recommend HOI3 if you want a more micro-intensive, historical experience, and HOI4 if you want to just sit back and relax for a couple hours murdering millions of people. \n\nPersonally I would suggest either game, but thats just me.\n- When reading reviews for this game you'll generally find two camps. There are people who find DW:U incredibly deep and engaging, and there are those who find it incredibly obtuse and frustrating. The problem is they're both right. The game does feature a wealth of features, and you will almost certainly never experience them.\n\nEven for a player like me who is used to impenetrable strategy games like Europa Universalis this was difficult to play. Income see-saws drunkenly from crippling deficit to fabulous surplus and back again depending on what's happening this exact second. Land combat units are jam packed into impossibly tiny UI bars. AI factions have reams of vague, undefined character traits. The encyclopedia technically gives information on everything but is so poorly organized and unsearchable as to verge on useless.\n\nWith time, practice, and a lot of time spent researching on independent websites you can have fun with this game. But for sixty dollars you shouldn't have to, and quite frankly, don't. Find yourself one of the many excellent 4Xs in the store and pass over this ambitious but ultimately flawed gem.\n- Playing this game instantly brought back memories of me playing TMNT, Battletoads, Double Dragon, and Streets of Rage, with my little brother on the NES and Sega Genesis in the early 90s. Luckily this game doesn’t feature TMNT’s ridiculous water level or Battletoads' sadistic peed bike level. The graphics are perfect, the controls are great, the soundtrack is awesome (especially the Wu-Tang stage, and the Shredder stage), and the levels and overworld map are fun to navigate. I’ve played through the story mode with all 7 characters and have played through the arcade mode multiple times solo and many times in multiplayer and I’ve enjoyed every bit of it. This game is so much fun.\n\nThere are a few things I wish existed though. I wish there were more playable characters. I wish that you did not lose your 7 character’s progress in story mode when you start a new game. I wish you could see the difficulty level of the online arcade game you are joining. I wish there were cumulative stats you could see for arcade and story mode that showed the number of times you completed a stage, how many enemies you knocked out, objects you’ve destroyed, stage times, combo streaks, times taunted, etc. I wish you could create your own turtle and assigned moves, specials, jumps, taunts, and colors.\n- I purposefully went into this game looking for bugs, seeing that it was in early access, and I have yet to find any. The only reason I stopped playing was because there was a fence that wasn't fully secured to the ground that I was able to get underneath, allowing me to get out of bounds. This lead to me falling into an area where I couldn't get out, and it wouldn't let me respawn at my most recent checkpoint. This would mean I'd have to start from the beginning, which I very much didn't want to do. Anyway, the biggest tips I can give to the developers is to make sure the map is 100% how they want it, and to make the audio design better. That's it. I may come back and change my review in the future.\n\nFINAL RATING: 4 / 10\n- In my personal opinion,Total War Warhammer 3 is better than its predecessor in every way.\n\nFactions:\nThey did an excellent job t fine tuning the older factions to the point where every faction now feels fully fleshed out and playable. The starting units are fun and the starting areas are usually in a better position. Sure, some factions start off in a really awkward ass places with really strong armies surrounding them, but overall, everything feels much more thought out.\n\nThe new factions they added to this game are fun altho for someone who might be just getting into the game, id recommend going with someone like Grand Cathay and move on from there.\n\nMap:\nThe world map is huge and i love it. The battle fields you fight in are detailed and look absolutely stunning. Fights look like movies sometimes so grab some popcorn and watch your armies die since you were munching on popcorn and not moving your units.\n\nRTS:\nthe RTS side of this game is what got the biggest improvement in my opinion. Everything is so much more clear and the battles just look insanely good. The game feels a bit more fast phase which i don't mind at all since WH2 felt like a battle of attrition sometimes and missile infantry seemed really bad.\n\nOverall i can safely say this i my favorite game currently. The multiplayer is super fun but judging by the reviews some of you leave on this game, its safe to say you have no friends to play with. \n\nDLC might cost bit more than it used to but people will complain about anything if its not free.\n- If I could get my money back, I would. AI as usual is hot garbage, cant even take turns without getting LITERALLY BODIED by the AI drivers. The new progression system really sucks. Cool that they wanted to try something different, but I really dont feel like leveling every god damn car in the game just to modify it. If you wanted multiple of same car you would have to level those duplicate cars you purchase. My experience with the physics is just... eh. I mean I sure do love loosing grip just from barely tapping the gas. Constantly fighting my wheel just to stay stable. Driving its probably fine for controller players, I wouldnt on wheel. Credits are only used to buy cars now. Also kinda runs like crap. All i wanted was a Gran Turismo on PC and this... this is not it. Game is mid, move on me thinks.\n\nEdit: I put in a request for a refund and Valve did indeed approve it. I thought I was over the time limit for sure. Don't be me and spend 100 USD for early access. Thanks Valve, you're the best!\n- While still a work very much in progress, Nuclear Throne is currently one of my favorite games. It's a roguelike dungeon crawler with heavy \"bullet-hell\" elements and a little RPG sprinkled on top. When you begin a session of Nuclear Throne, you choose from one of several well-designed & freakish \"mutants\", each with their own special attributes which, in itself, does much to add variety (there's also a random-select option which is a fun idea in this particular case). The goal of each stage is to exterminate all of the enemies. After doing so, a portal opens which takes your mutant freak to the next level. There are a great many weapons with which to inflict meyhem on your adversaries. As you gain experience points, in the form of green goo earned by killing enemies & also found in cache jars, you'll be able to choose new persistent perks for your character (such as more HP or certain weapons doing more damage). Every so-often, you'll encounter a boss. The bosses tend to pop in during the height of an already-in-progress battle which makes beating them all-the-more difficult & hectic.\n\nOriginally, this game did not have controller support which was a great disappointment (though I had been ejoying it anyway, using the keyboard and mouse). However, a recent update rectified this and the gameplay using a dual-analog controller (such as that of the Xbox 360) is just fantastic. Like Ultratron before it (another very similar game which is also worth a look; I also wrote a review for it, if you're interested in checking it out), Nuclear Throne throws you straight back to the arcades of yore and plops you in front of a Smash TV cabinet.\n\nAs a roguelike dungeon-crawler, the replay value is extremely high (due to the fact that the level and enemy layout is totally different from one session to the next). The rather extreme difficulty doesn't hurt either, as playing entails dying and thus restarting... a lot. Fortunately, said difficulty isn't of the variety that compels you to smash your controller/keyboard in frustration. Every death feels like the fault lay squarely on *your* shoulders (if only you had moved to dodge a little faster or conserved ammo a little better!), as opposed to the game feeling like it's cheating. Another stand-out feature which I think I need to bring up is the soundtrack. ...Just wow! Nuclear Throne's score is totally original and extremely surreal. It goes *miles* in lending its own atmosphere to the game. \n\nSome might consider the current price of $12.99 to be just a *little* steep for a game in this class, but considering how well it's made overall and the fun I've gotten from it (especially being in its currently pre-release/beta state), I consider it to be well worth the price. As of the time of this writing, the developer(s) is very active and updates are coming quite frequently.\n\nUPDATE 01/12/16: I hadn't played this game in quite a while (at least 6+ months) and I wanted to check out the progress that the devs have made, etc. Well... The game starts but as soon as I select a character, it totally locks up. I can't play it at all. To make matters worse, I've heard that the devs have since \"abandoned\" development of this game (so it's not likely that whatever is causing the crashes for me is going to be fixed any time soon - or ever). Bummer man. I loved this game...\n- Yes, the Origin client is somewhere between annoying and broken, depending on your hardware. And yes, Dragon Age Keep is still a big jumble of poorly explained choices that affect your game in a thousand little ways if you choose to use it. And yeah, none of the old technical issues really got fixed before coming to steam - this isn't a remaster - so shiny hair and lips for everyone.\n\nBut it's nice to be able to take a walk in Thedas again, and sink into the story, and admire what is probably the last real Bioware game before EA completely turned them into another ouroboros of live service bullshit. \n\nGet it on sale, for the nostalgia if nothing else.\n- ---{ Graphics }---\n☐ You forget what reality is\n☐ Beautiful\n☐ Good\n☐ Decent\n☐ Bad\n☑ Don‘t look too long at it\n☐ MS-DOS\n\n---{ Gameplay }---\n☐ Very good\n☐ Good\n☐ It's just gameplay\n☑ Mehh\n☐ Watch paint dry instead\n☐ Just don't\n\n---{ Audio }---\n☑ Eargasm\n☐ Very good\n☐ Good\n☐ Not too bad\n☐ Bad\n☐ I'm now deaf\n\n---{ Audience }---\n☑ Kids\n☑ Teens\n☑ Adults\n☑ Grandma\n\n---{ PC Requirements }---\n☑ Check if you can run paint\n☐ Potato\n☐ Decent\n☐ Fast\n☐ Rich boi\n☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{ Difficulty }---\n☐ Just press 'W'\n☐ Easy\n☐ Easy to learn / Hard to master\n☐ Significant brain usage\n☑ Difficult\n☐ Dark Souls\n\n---{ Grind }---\n☐ Nothing to grind\n☑ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n☐ Isn't necessary to progress\n☐ Average grind level\n☐ Too much grind\n☐ You'll need a second life for grinding\n\n---{ Story }---\n☑ No Story\n☐ Some lore\n☐ Average\n☐ Good\n☐ Lovely\n☐ It'll replace your life\n\n---{ Game Time }---\n☑ Long enough for a cup of coffee\n☐ Short\n☐ Average\n☐ Long\n☐ To infinity and beyond\n\n---{ Price }---\n☐ It's free!\n☐ Worth the price\n☐ If it's on sale\n☐ If u have some spare money left\n☐ Not recommended\n☑ You could also just burn your money\n\n---{ Bugs }---\n☐ Never heard of\n☐ Minor bugs\n☐ Can get annoying\n☐ ARK: Survival Evolved\n☑ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n---{ ? / 10 }---\n☐ 1\n☑ 2\n☐ 3\n☐ 4\n☐ 5\n☐ 6\n☐ 7\n☐ 8\n☐ 9\n☐ 10\n\n\n\n\n- Playing this game for the first time six years after its initial release proved to be a delight in disguise. With all the memes and jokes established, I was finally able to understand what the fuss was all about back in 2011. Despite not having the best gameplay, story or graphics out there, something about this title just made me want to finish every quest I deemed worth completing. \n\n9/10 - mods recommended\n- People in the reviews don't understand this game.\n\n1. This is not Final Fantasy Tactics and it has a good reason for it.\n2. They barely removed any skills compared to the previous version and you will find most of those \"lost\" skills integrated into new skills or mechanics while certain broken mechanics were removed for a good reason. They also made things more challenging which i see as a welcome change. Things are also generally more viable and that is never a bad thing.\n3. You don't need to grind in this game, so why do i see people bring up grinding? Sure there's 40 weapon levels but in the endgame you get max level after like a couple battles if you really feel like you need to grind it out. In the previous version you had to level up a ton of different skills and some of them went up very slowly so there's actually a lot less grinding in this one.\n4. The reason you're struggling with doing damage is not because the game is bad, it's because you're not looking at what your equipment does or you don't understand it. The attack value in weapons is a base value which is used to penetrate your targets armor. It makes sense to do 1 damage against a person wearing heavy armor if you're firing an arrow at them. All the various boosts that you get in this game are applied to the damage you do AFTER you penetrate your targets armor. In order to do real damage to heavily armored targets you need to either use the right kind of weapon to attack them or make use of the new elemental system since now every character has an element that can be used to deal more damage OR you can simply apply a debuff to them since debuffs affect their defensive value directly. So yes this is not a game where you always win by rushing at your enemy and pressing attack. You have to understand how the game works and going through that process has been incredibly fun for me.\n5. You don't need to worry about those permanent stat gain cards or leveling your unit in a certain class to get the best possible stats. What you get from doing that isn't really going to make a difference if you're not playing well enough BUT if you really want to have a super powerful godlike unit, this game still allows it through those mechanics.\n6. The buff cards on the field are also not something you're required to make use of to beat the game, they're just there to make the battlefields more interesting and a way to make boss-characters stronger without directly cheating their stats.\n7. They removed random battles but you don't need random battles for anything because you can recruit units in the various long dungeons or simply go back in time to recruit a specific unit from any level in the postgame.\n\nIn summary it's a game that requires you to think a little bit but as you understand more you can also make things that seemed underwhelming at first viable because you found a way to make use of them. The story is also integrated into the gameplay so it's easy to keep interested in it especially since you get to make choices that affect both the story and gameplay. As a remake it definitely feels like they remade the game completely as it's so different from all the original versions. It's not for everyone and it doesn't have to be but hopefully the enjoyers of games like FFT or fire emblem will not dismiss this because of the reviews since this might become one of your favorite rpgs if you just bother to look into it without wanting it to be a cheap remake. It's too easy to jump into conclusions when we live in a world filled with terrible \"remakes\" popping up each year. This is all so ironic too as the spirit of this game when it comes to the story and gameplay alike is that you will never truly win by jumping into conclusions and there will always be something you didn't consider.\n\nUpdate: Replying to comments and addressing things for people who are familiar with the originals: \n\nI don't think they took away anything so vital that it would ruin the game. I can't really think of anything important other than the rogue class myself. You can call it removal but I'd rather say that they moved a lot of stuff to a different place from the list of skills and changed a lot of them to better fit the new card system and the new skill/spell limits. \n\nYes in my original review I didn't mention anything about the skill limit being reduced from 8 to 4. I think this change mostly just made the game easier to understand and when it comes to strategy I don't think anything was lost. You were going to use those extra 4 skill slots for things like strengthen or spellcraft either way and with the new scouting system moving around 8 skills before each encounter would probably be a little tedious (as it already feels tedious to setup units with the current system). \n\nAnd when it comes to spells, I simply can't understand why I would want to have access to more or all equipable spells as it would result in casters being a lot stronger than what they are supposed to be. This also makes each caster class more defined instead of them just being some kind of upgrades of each other so that a lategame class like the shaman can be a lot less useful in certain situations than your starting mage class because they don't have access to debuff spells but in return they hit super hard with their damaging spells.\n\nWhat else did they remove? They reworked the weird elemental system  into something that's always in play and I find this change very welcome as it adds another layer of strategy to the game especially through finishers and equipment bonuses even for non-spellcasters (but is still a little weird to get the hang of at first). They removed spell scrolls... yeah i probably dont have to mention why I see that as a good thing as well.\n\nAnd sure you can dislike these changes but we have to remember that steam reviews are black and white. Posting a negative review based on a subjective change is indistinguishable from saying \"this game is trash don't even look at it\" when it comes to statistics which is what everyone first sees when they open the store page of a game. \n\nI'm completely on the same page with you about playing your own favorite version, whatever you prefer and I myself would like to mess around more with things like One Vision in the future. But imo giving this game a negative review is also bad for the reputation of other versions of tactics ogre.\n\nAnd ofc the game is definitely not perfect there's still imbalances and some skills are pretty underwhelming compared to what they used to be (RIP Rampart shadows...). But imo this is better than what I've seen from literally any other game remake ever so I simply can't agree with calling it a bad remake.\n- This review only relates to the single player campaign. At 50 years old I have zero interest in multiplayer.\n\nAfter playing Gears of War 4, I was looking forward to this title. I wasn't disappointed. I found the new upgrade system with Jack enjoyable. The campaign was fun to play with minor exceptions. Graphics, sound, and voice acting were amazing. Campaign took me about 11 hours to beat. I consider that well worth the $60 I paid for the game.\n\nMy only real gripe about the single player campaign:  As a father of 3 girls, I'm all for strong female leading characters. Kait just isn't it, though. I didn't care for her in 4 and that didn't change in 5. For me she seems out of her league and just isn't believable as a team member. She's like Elizabeth Swan, the governor's daughter in Pirates of the Caribbean. She's a kidnapped damsel in distress in one movie, and the Pirate King in the next. It just doesn't work, for me anyway.\n- A Short Hike is a relaxing, casual game about exploring an expansive, mountainous island park and eventually making your way to its summit so you can get cell phone reception.\n\nYou play as Claire, a bird who can climb, glide, and flap to great heights using a stamina system based upon how many golden and silver feathers you’ve collected. Along the path to the mountaintop you’ll encounter Animal Crossing-style characters who are friendly, punny, and usually have some minor task for you to solve, ranging from finding lost items to making deliveries.\n\nHelping residents of the island is completely optional, as is just about every activity in the game other than locating a few feathers and reaching the summit; as a result, length can range from an hour if you don’t stop to smell the roses to a few hours if you decide to make friends with everyone and see all the park has to offer.\n\nActivities include filling out a fishing journal by trading in your catches, digging in suspicious spots, solving treasure map clues, parkour racing, and opening up shortcuts by breaking blocked entrances and watering bouncy flowers. \n\nA Short Hike has a charming aesthetic and a lovely, peaceful soundtrack. I felt driven to see everything the game had to offer despite not being forced into any of it and never lost interest until I did so. It’s a beautiful little world that will make fans of Animal Crossing feel right at home.\n- Two words: Modding Heaven. This is probably one of the most modular games I've ever played. \n\nYou wanna play Mount and Blade in a historical time period instead of Calradia? OK, which one? Don't answer, it doesn't matter, there's probably a mod for it. \n\nWanna add in some magic and play in a fantasy universe? There's mods for that. \n\nHow about a game set in the modern day? Or in a sci-fi universe? Or a post-apocalypse wasteland? Or the Wild West? Or maybe something specific like throwing your hat into the Game of Thrones, or defending the World of Men in Lord of the Rings, or taking over the Empire from Star Wars?\n\nPerhaps you'd like to set sail on the seven seas as a pirate in a nautical adventu-! Oh, wait, OK, there aren't any of -those-. \n\n...but there's mods for all of the others, with even more being made every day! \n\n\nI guarantee, if you buy this and are open to modding your game, you will never go another year without playing Warband. Maybe a week, maybe a few months-- but just when you think you're done with it, you'll find another mod based on your favorite movie series popping up to pull you back in. \n\nIt is worth well above whatever you'll pay for it.\n\n\n- Really fun for the first few rounds... Then the game changes your control scheme without telling you, and with no way to turn it back. This has lead to several hours of frustration, trying to revert it. From what I've read, this is 'intended' to make the game more difficult, but really, is just incredible stupid. If I wanted the game to be more difficult because of a more annoying control scheme, I'd play with a god damn dance pad.\n\nThe game is really fun, but this has frustrated me to the point that I can't enjoy it any more unless it's fixed, and therefore I can't recommend it either\n- My wife left and took the kids\n- unprofessional review:\n\nits a really deep lore kind of game, very cool!\nit has some horror and grinding elements which i always love\ni havent finished the game just yet tho \nthe visuals are very cute\nas soon as i bought it was hooked!\noke theres many more but im to lazy to type :joy:\n\nover all ill give it a 10/10\nvery interesting lore wise\n- Excellent game, but has an awful-abrupt ending that comes out of nowhere and doesnt make sense and leaves way too many plot elements unexplained.\n\nIn the last game they introduce a secret society of energy sucking vampires that are hunting Rosa and Joey yet they are never mentioned again and instead the end of series villian is some random messed up ghost that randomly has end of the world magic powers.\n\nAwful.\n- Great Game, but 70 dollars for a game that was console exclusive for years, then released exclusive to Epic, and finally released to Steam. Don't be greedy Enix.\n- Sticking with the usual air of cool and weird and the usual musical flair, the latest Cosmo D entry changes up the FPS gameplay for a dice rolling RPG with quirky characters and little surprises to be found (and making pizza, of course). Can be beaten in a couple of hours but rewards multiple playthroughs for different gameplay paths and endings that can be mixed up with difficulty modifiers and challenges.\n- Steins;Gate Elite is a great Visual Novel when looked at in isolation. The main problem is that Steins;Gate (the original) exists. I don't mind the difference in art styles, that is a matter of personal preference anyway. Graphics in Elite are a lot more animated, images in the original are more static but also more detailed. What I have an issue with is the missing parts in the story.\n\nThere are a few situations where Elite eliminates choices when compared to the original. I won't spoil details, but in one of the early chapters you can choose to ignore or answer a phone call, leading to alternate branches in the story (they join again soon after, but each branch still contains unique content). Well, you can choose in the original. In Elite, you automatically answer the phone, the other branch is no longer in the game.\n\nAt a later point in the game, I noticed that quite a sizeable chunk of a previously linear story progression (not even an alternate branch) concerning Faris was completely cut out. Again, I won't spoil details in case you just want to decide which version of the game to get and don't know the story yet. It has been some time since I played the original, so I might have missed more instances of missing story parts, but at least this one part was really obvious.\n\nThe missing branches and parts are not really relevant to the overall story, but you probably want them if you want to know more about the characters. Elite is more streamlined, but at least all of the alternate endings are still here. So while there is missing stuff compared to the original, there is quite a bit more when compared to the anime. Then again, the anime added more story after the true ending of the original game. I was hoping that Elite added (and maybe fleshed out) this extra content as well, but no luck here, Elite ends at the same point as the original.\n\nIf you don't mind the art style of the original, play that one instead. The second game (Steins;Gate 0) only exists in it's original form anyway. Elite might still be worth it if heavily discounted since it is the only way to get the \"free\" Linear Bounded Phenogram. You can justify it as buying LBP and getting Elite as a free extra.\n- I like furry art, but first and foremost im a RPG gamer, and as such I will rend judgment impartially. \n\nThe story is not bad, but still falls in the average category and it is predictable, gameplay is the same as the first Fuga (I have no problems there) but there are few new enemies,  so the strategy to beat the regular battles is very repetitive. My biggest complain remains the same since Tail Concerto and it is the dificulty... which is way too easy, there is no hard / nightmare mode for veteran players, Im not asking to die repeatedly like in dark souls but Cyberconnect2 needs to understand some players like a challenge in their games.\n\nMusic is ok and Hack is the best character of the lot (Tah tah tah tah  taaah!!!!!) I would play Fuga 3 just for him.\n\nIt pains me to give the thumbs down, but Cyberconnect2 needs to work a little harder.\n- [h1]SMOOTH RIDING WITH A FEW BUMPY ROADS[/h1]\n\nFirst off, I am going to get this out of the way. If you are planning to buy this game and wondering which version to get, ask yourself this. If you are a minimalist, standard is fine. If you want the expansions, get ultimate. Deluxe on the other hand I think is worth skipping entirely. If $99.99 is too much for you for Ultimate, just wait for a sale. Ultimate is definitely my choice for recommendation. The amount of content you get is impressive and worth the price of admission. \n\nForza Horizon 4 is a car collector's dream, with a roster of over 700 cars (with Ultimate). And also a racing enthusiasts dream playground with a decently sized map with tons of racing variety and events to play around with. I have tons of racing games on Steam personally, and none have held my interest as much as Forza Horizon 4. It's a shame though that this came so late to Steam. But even still, I got my money's worth with over 120 hours of playtime at the time of writing this. \n\nIs Forza Horizon 4 perfect though? Sadly, it is not. The Steam version is hampered with some unfortunate bugs. People may experience random crashes, which while not happening often after the last few updates, still do happen, as this game is a few versions behind the Microsoft store's own version. Something I don't know if will ever be fully fixed. Also online racing can be hit or miss with issues. Those issues usually lie in the wait times sadly, so it might be offputting for those looking to race with others. Luckily there is more than enough content without having to do online races to keep most people happy. \n\n I'm still giving this a recommend regardless of that issue, just because more often than not, the game does run smoothly. \n\nIf you happen to just get the standard version of the game you get access to the main map which is a caricatured version of Great Britain, which includes many race events ranging from your standard street races, dirt tracks and even full blown off road events. There are also other events which include speed traps, drifting, massive jumps, promotional events (like racing the Halo Warthog, racing against trains, and more), and some cool little story events like racing for Top Gear, or even opening your own businesses. There's plenty of content for sure. If you decide to get the expansions, you get other maps, including Fortune Island, which is, well, an Island, complete with both low and high altitude locations, lots of off roading, some impressive night time visuals (Aurora Borealis anyone?), and more. You also get the Lego Speed Champions map which is a fun and impressively designed map based on the Lego toys which features it's own variety of fun and unique settings, including a beach riddled with pirate ships, a haunted lighthouse, a stunt arena, and more. Also it gets it's own radio station that plays just 1 song on loop. If you guessed that song is \"Everything is Awesome\", you'd be right, Both expansions also come with a unique way of progression and their own vehicles to collect. Fortune Island will have you progress to unlock a variety of treasure hunts, that each unlock 1 million credits, and the Lego expansion has you doing different tasks to collect studs which can be used to build your house and also collect new cars. Both expansions will also include a majority of the types of events you will be used to in the base game, with their own unique flair. \n\nWith 700 cars luckily there is enough variety for anyone. But for those looking for more, you can custom tune each vehicle to your own liking, with a variety of parts and overhauls, including full blown engine swaps. For those who are not gear heads, the community has you covered and you can even download custom tunes from others. Forza Horizon 4 is one of the most generous racing games I have ever played with the sheer amount of cars they dump on you. You can win cars from events. You can win cars from wheelspins. you can win cars from leveling up. You can win cars from performing certain tasks. You can win cars from barn finds, which are like little treasure hunts. You can also buy cars from both an auto show, or take your chances at an in game auction house, which is also a great way to make money, to well, buy more cars. Basically, Horizon does not let you down with the cars. It's like Pokemon for car lovers. And once you have that dream car, don't forget to give it that unique look. Most cars can have some visual parts swapped out, ranging from spoilers to bumpers and more, and you can add custom designs to the paint jobs too. Want to race around in Jurassic Park Jeep? Want to race around in the Bandit 1 from Smokey and the Bandit? Forza has you covered. And if you just want to look at the cars in all their glory, Forza also has a nice little feature called Forzavista which allows to do things with your car like opening and closing doors, and for some vehicles you can open up trunks and hoods and look inside at the engines. If you get the James Bond pack, you can even look at those nifty little gadgets like the machine guns mounted to some of the Bond vehicles. Pretty neat stuff. \n\nAt the end of the day, is Forza Horizon 4 worth it? I'd say yes.\n- If you are looking for a game that you can never master, here is the game for you.\n- This game is pure art, I enjoyed every second of it. The mechanics are great and the puzzles can get quite challenging. Sadly its only a little over 3 hours of playtime.\n\nOne of the best games I've played in a long time!\n- [b]My playtime:[/b] 14.5h (based on Steam, 100% achievement)\n[b]Grindy Achievement(s):[/b] Yes (1+ achievement).\n[b]Optional Achievement(s):[/b] Yes (33 achievements).\n[b]Difficult Achievement(s):[/b] No.\n\n[h1]Intro[/h1]\nYou wake up in a place you don't recognize. Greeted by a traffic light, you tried to remember what was happening. It turns out that you have a unique ability: reading an object's memory. As unreal as it sounds, [b]UNREAL LIFE[/b] tries to help you make sense of everything through a series of adventures and events.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n- Multiple endings, with variations of bad endings and one true ending\n- Cleverly-executed puzzles\n- Subtle hints in case you're stuck\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n- Unable to skip cutscenes\n- People who have trouble with flashing lights can't fully experience the game\n\n[h1]Should you buy this game?[/h1]\n[b]Yes.[/b]\n[i]If you like to play atmospheric games, buy this at a sale. People who have problems with flashing lights should avoid this game since the game isn't as good as it is with some options turned off.[/i]\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1]In-Depth Review[/h1]\n\n[h3]Visuals[/h3]\nThe developer spends a lot of effort crafting beautiful, quality cutscenes. Some scenes show the beauty of the night sky while others show what the main character is feeling from close range. Food images look so carefully made that I couldn't believe that it was a pixelated image at first. Every scene does a good job in supporting the story, combined with the relaxing music that is running in the background.\n\nBlurry effects are applied on the screen, whether it's just to make a certain area stand out or create a cool-looking effect for the cutscenes. The game relies on a lot of transitions in its cutscenes, some can leave you shocked with the inverted images and flashes of red colors at intense moments. People that have problems with these can soften the red color in the option with the downside of making the scene to be less effective. Moreover, since the option affects all red colors in the game, some scenes will look weird with the faded color.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441881358 \n\n[h3]Story[/h3]\nThe story is a relaxing one, set in a place where people are helpful and empathetic to your actions. Every character gives a positive vibe through their attitude and kindness, supporting you whenever you are down or helping you to enjoy the moment. Reading the interaction between characters warm my heart, especially when accompanied by the relaxing music that is playing in the background.\n\nThe storytelling is wonderfully done with the combination of visuals and music to let you drown in the story. Sometimes, an intense moment kicks in, changing the scenery into one full of effects and transitions. The fast-paced music also helps to set the mood with its upbeat tone, increasing the intensity. The ending is told in a similar manner, although instead of an intense moment, it crafts a touching scene instead that is fit for an ending. Some people will find a small part of the ending not to make any sense, although luckily, it won't affect the overall experience.\n\n[h3]The Game[/h3]\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nThe game is focused on reading memories of an object to progress. Your hidden ability to read an object's memory by touching it will help you to solve various tasks, ranging from looking a lost object to finding a hidden area. There are some limitations though - some objects have no memories that you can read while other objects can't be interacted with until they are discovered. Fortunately, they are quite easy to discover as long as you spam the space button and/or pay attention to the dialogues.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441881785 \n\n[b]Puzzles and Minigames[/b]\nThe rest of the gameplay is focused on the usual adventure games where you have to pick up items and use them to pass through the area. Most problems that you will have to solve has the same theme as the building you are in. It's nice to see how puzzles are related to the corresponding area while still being unique at the same time.\n\nMost puzzles and minigames are easy to solve except for a select few. I found the last one to be the trickiest because not only does it cover a huge area, but it also requires you to use the mechanic from a previous area, something which never happened in other puzzles. It's still easy to solve as long as you are attentive enough, but if you happen to get stuck, the game offers subtle hints in the form of memories that you can read.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441883206 \n\n[b]Length and Replayability[/b]\nI finished the game in 9.7h after experiencing all the bad endings. Although the game only offers one manual save slot, it has an extra checkpoint slot that you can load before the story branches off. A hidden secret can also be found after you finished the game, which might take a long time to find due to its randomness. I found it to be a waste of time though, especially since there isn't much that you can learn from the secret. You'll also be left with more questions than answers, giving more reason not to look for them unless if you are an achievement hunter or the curious type.\n\n[b]Problems[/b]\nDespite the game requires you to restart the game several times, you can't skip the cutscenes. Some parts of the game will lead you to a bad ending and the unskippable cutscenes can take a significant amount of time if you don't know how to bypass it. Moreover, checkpoints tend to be placed minutes before the story branches off, wasting more of your time. Lastly, the game isn't very clear whenever it autosaves your game. I had to save manually whenever I took a break from the game because of this.\n\n[h1]Specs[/h1]\nIntel Core i5-9300H 2.40GHz, 8GB RAM, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nThe game has a lot of elements that complement each other. The nice-looking visuals, the calm and relaxing music that can heat up in intense moments, the superb effect - everything blends well to make the story stands out. The detailed cutscenes are done well to capture the emotion that can't be portrayed with a simple portrait and character animation, while portraits are expressive enough to handle simple expressions. The game is designed with quality in mind and although it can be slow sometimes, the relaxing music helps you to savor the moment.\n\n[quote]This game was reviewed with a key provided by the developer for free through [url=https://discord.gg/xc22zZP]Reviewers' Paradise[/url], a group that connects both developers and reviewers in one place[/quote]\n\n[quote]Visit SaveOrQuit.com for detailed game reviews, posted daily![/quote]\n- While it seems grindy at times, you will probably feel greatly rewarded when you can get enough resolve to spec out a specific build exactly how you want it. I think the progression of the tower abilities and gold gain is great, but even the burdens available don’t seem to switch it up quite enough. I’m on ng+4 and i feel like it’s getting a tad stale. I still like playing it of course. Some classes like the chef make the idea of playing anything else not quite worth it. I’m sure there’s some great niche builds but keep that in mind. Overall, this game keeps you on your toes. If you get hit, it’s almost always because you did something wrong. I LOVE the movement abilities in this game. You can feel like a speed runner with a few hours of practice gliding and jumping. This is a completely different game compared to rogue legacy 1 in all the best ways. 9/10\n- Before you buy: What you enjoy about Her Story (and maybe Telling lies) will very much affect your enjoyment of this game. \n\nIf you enjoyed the acting, the non-linear story telling, and the *movie* part of those games, this will probably be the best in the trilogy. HOWEVER, if you enjoy the detective aspect, the puzzles, the mental challenge, this game is probably not for you.\n\nThe gameplay is a big departure compared to Her Story and Telling Lies, and in my opinion, doesn't make for much of a challenge at all. In the 10 hours I spent on the game, 9 were just me watching clips and clicking random objects in the background. I found the actual movie stuff to be really fun (and especially seeing the process of how movies are made), but that kind of fun is very different to the kind I had with the previous two games.\n\nI don't dislike the game but I don't recommend it either, at least to a decent chunk of the fanbase (those being fans of detective puzzle games).\n- The British Forces give the Allies a bit of the German defensive capacities. It has the problem of adding too many buildings to a game that is, in its core, dynamic and based on movement and aggressiveness instead of turtling. The British units are diverse and interesting, bringing much to the table. \n\nThe DLC lacks a proper campaign for the Brits, unfortunately, even though Caen, Goodwood, Arnhem and Walcheren could have been done in some interesting missions. But, for a game focused on multiplayer, the Tommies are obligatory in everybody's library.\n- The problem with a lot of Steam reviews is that they don't really help you figure out whether you should buy / try the game. So, let me help. You are one of four people:\n\n(1) You've never played a Sam Barlow game before, and you've never played a point-and-click adventure game before. In which case, what's wrong with you?\n\n(2) You've never played a Sam Barlow game, but you have played a point-and-click adventure game before. In which case, you'll definitely know within two hours whether you like this game. But anyways, you're getting a decent bit of stuff for $20.\n\n(3) You've played a Sam Barlow game, and you didn't like it. In which case, you probably won't like this either. It's basically the same thing as Her Story and Telling Lies, but with a different story.\n\n(4) You've played a Sam Barlow game, and you did like it. In which case, you probably will like this too. It's basically the same thing as Her Story and Telling Lies, but with a different story.\n\nI think Immortality had the best story of the three Barlow games, and definitely the best acting and production value.\n- One of the best games I have ever played\n----------------------------------------------\n- Runs really well on most computers\n- Looks great regardless\n- Gameplay is heroin-tier addictive\n- High replay value\n- Big f-ing guns \n- If you like metal this game is for you\n- There isn't much wrong with this game\n- 10/10\n\nFLAWS\n----------------------------------------\n-You have the option to turn the music down\n- WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO DO THAT\n- Undoubtedly one of the best if not THE BEST modern video game remaster out there. I will summarize the pros and cons of this remaster into the following:\n\n[b]The Good:[/b]\n\n- Totally seamless transition into the new modern 4K visual from the old classic Win95 at a push of a key\n- Extremely faithful to the original titles (some might say that it is perhaps TOO faithful)\n- Game \"installation\" screen when you first boot up for both Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert is filled with God tier nostalgia \n- New UI with a complete revamp of the sidebar complete with higher quality artwork that totally feels in place\n- Plethora of never-before-seen bonus contents including exclusive missions and cinematic cutscenes for Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert that was only available on certain console platforms\n- You can queue multiple units while in production now\n- New multiplayer features and service is great. Finally you can now play 1v1 ranked and spectate any previous matches that was played including spectating ongoing games in the lobby\n- You can add, remove and create your very own custom music tracks in-game for both Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert however you want\n- All of Frank Klepacki's overly iconic classical and remixed tracks are here including various modern remixed that was composed solely for this remastered collection!!!\n\n[b]The Bad:[/b]\n\n- Minor bugs (though not a real dealbreaker)\n- The gameplay meta among factions/units remains as unbalanced as ever. Kinda of a tradeoff for being too faithful to the original titles\n- Multiplayer is still officially limited to a maximum of 4 players total per map in Tiberium Dawn, while in Red Alert the limit is a maximum of 8 players total\n- FMV cutscenes are all still heavily compressed in SD resolution extracted from the Playstation home console version and further artificially enhanced via AI upscaling due to the fact that the original master footage tapes for both Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert are still yet to be found\n\n[b]The Kinda Ugly:[/b]\n\n- Certain mission on hard difficulty are completely unbalanced. This is already another insult to injury as the AI blatantly cheats when it comes to resource procurement and unit build time. The fault of a clear lack of playtesting\n- The British Forces give the Allies a bit of the German defensive capacities. It has the problem of adding too many buildings to a game that is, in its core, dynamic and based on movement and aggressiveness instead of turtling. The British units are diverse and interesting, bringing much to the table. \n\nThe DLC lacks a proper campaign for the Brits, unfortunately, even though Caen, Goodwood, Arnhem and Walcheren could have been done in some interesting missions. But, for a game focused on multiplayer, the Tommies are obligatory in everybody's library.\n- Even with over 500 years difference between us, Andreas is one of the most relatable characters I've played this year because I too would rather try to ineffectively solve random mysteries than directly confront my depression.\n- If you want to play D&D but don't have friends, just get this game.\n- This is a passable if grindy 3D first person family friendly farming \"shooter\" with cartoony artwork.  You have a simple \"vacuum\" gun that you use to capture wild critters, throw them into pens, feed them, collect their stuff, sell it, rinse repeat.  \n\nThe implementation here is of high quality and works well on PC with a range of implementation options.  While the gameplay is somewhat repetitive and grindy, this is decent enough family friendly game that should be considered when on sale.  The retail price is too high, however, this game appears on sale and in bundles often enough.\n- Fun Tower-Defense style indie game. Definitely one where your skill improves every time you die. And you will die, repeatedly. :P Expect to try out many monster combinations per floor before you find something that can delay the hordes of adventurers long enough to set up the floor beneath! I would probably enjoy some more horizontal progression + permanent upgrades for long term re-playability, but it seems like a solo dev/small scoped project. Definitely worth the price for the current amount of content!\n- I appreciate the sincerity of Jusant. You can tell its creators have placed genuine care into their product, which has made the experience of playing it joyful and kind.\nThe visuals are stunning, the mechanics are not overwhelming, the soundtrack is soothing, and the puzzles are not frustrating. A great climbing game all around with an easy-to-follow yet gripping narrative. \nHopefully, Ukrainian localization will also be added soon.\n\n- We need a 60fps patch ASAP. Having 30fps content on PC in [current year] is not acceptable.\n\nOther than that the game is pretty solid! It looks great, it plays great, the story was good imo, the characters are interesting and the amount of solo content is decent.\n\nHowever, the gear system is not as elaborate as in Mk11 and the microtransations are NOT a welcome sight. Denuvo also has to go. If Harada agreed that the addition of Denuvo in Tekken 7 was a mistake, so should NetherRealm.\nI also don't like that 2 characters that are going to be in the Kombat Pass are already in the game (Ermac and Quan Chi). Just give us these characters and come up with other ones for the KP. This is super greedy and lazy.\nIt's even worse than Sektor and Cyrax in MK11, at least you didn't let us play them, period. this time you decide to not make them playable (even thought they work for the AI) AND sell them at a later date? That's awful.\n\nThe game is good but needs improvement and shouldn't ship with performance issues, 30fps content, microtransactions, Denuvo and greedy DLC tactics. I would put a \"meh\" review if I could because of the negatives but for that reason I have to say \"no\".\n- The game itself is great, but Square Enix really dropped the ball by removing the true PC version and leaving us with this Switch port as the only option. It's a huge visual downgrade, but it has more content. Luckily though, a small handful of incredible modders have taken the time to painstakingly transfer the old, high-quality PC assets over to this version which is what saved it for me. Without the mods, I would not have kept playing.\n\nIf you're on the fence, I'd say catch it on sale, then head over to a modding site (Nexus is what I used) and start installing the mods that restore this game to its full PC potential. It's probably the easiest-to-mod game I've ever dealt with too btw. You don't have to be super savvy to get things the way you want them and you don't need any additional software. Just grab the .pak files, slap them into the game's pak folder, enjoy. It really is that simple. (You may want to edit some .ini files to tweak things to your liking, but that's as complex as it gets. If you can open Notepad, you can do this.)\n\nAs for the core gameplay, it's an incredibly solid JRPG with a likable cast and well thought out story. There's plenty of content to enjoy here and it has a good end game. The music is absolutely phenomenal as well. Visually, it's very vibrant and the aesthetic is charming. I think it's a fantastic game overall and is very enjoyable as is, but playing it in 1440p/144Hz with high resolution character and texture assets with better lighting/animation mods and subtle character/NPC/monster upgrades totally elevated it to the next level.\n\np.s. If you do install mods, I HIGHLY recommend grabbing the one that removes the black borders around characters! That gives the game a clean and refreshing new feel that greatly improves it in my opinion!\n- The Graphics of this game don't match the high price tag\n- It's strange how this will be the first review I ever write for a game. I always thought it would be written for a game like Fallout, Elderscrolls or some huge open world survival horror. And yet it's this little piece of art that has me aching to write something, if only for a minute.\nWhen I had finished this, a few minutes ago, I couldn't believe that they only charge a pittence for it. I thought to myself that if people can charge you 70 euro for games that are poorly executed and badly made from start to finish, then this game should have a much higher pricetag. It wasn't before looking up and seeing that I just finished the first episode in a mere three hours that I understood their reasoning. I feel, however, obliged to tell you all that the three hours spent in this game were worth more to me than the hundreads of hours I've spent in most other games combined. Not because the story was awsome, or the graphics made me gape in awe, but rather that every single aspect of the game in combination managed to grip me and pull me in so that time became temporarily meaningless. Imagine if games held this standard. Imagine if your favorite action, your favorite adventure game or even your favorite driver had this kind of execution. \nYou can tell a good story in a bad way, and you can tell a bad story in a good way. The story in this game might not be the most interesting story you've ever heard, but it's good, and in the execution of it you are drawn in, captured by it, moved by it.\n\nMost adventure games will entertain, they'll give you some ups and downs along the way, but ultimately they will feel like games.\nI've never felt so fulfilled after \"playing a game\" as I did today. Original, beautiful and masterfully executed. I can't wait for the next episode.\n- Events that took place:\n\nDid not want to sell player,\nGot an offer for said player,\nRejected the offer,\nPlayer demaned to be allowed to speak to the club,\nGot a second offer from said club,\nEssentially forced to accept the offer,\nPlayer reached an agreement with the club,\nWished player the \"best of luck\" in his future endeavours,\nPlayer is angry that he is leaving,\nPlayer considerers his new club a \"step down\" in his career,\nReminder: Player demanded to go to said club,\nMe finding solice in the fact that FM19 although lacking in the football department, delivers a brilliant experience in dealings with manic and psychotic people.\n\nAllow me to grant you an insight into SI's employee knowledge on the subject their games are about. I once engaged in a conversation with a developer at SI about FM, and football in general. After some talking about premier league, and me slightly confused, I eventually understood that this developer thought that Tottenham Hotspurs were located in Liverpool. So I posed him the following question: \"Then why do they call any matches between Tottenham and Arsenal the 'North London Derby'?\" to which he responded that he did not know, but he assured me that Tottenham F.C was located in Liverpool. I had to resort to showing him the borough of Tottenham in London for him to understand that Tottenham Hotspurs is not lovated in Liverpool, but in fact in London.\n\nThis will be the last edition of this game series I will ever purchase. In a football management simulator such as this, letting SI and their employees (including the one that responded to this review) tell you various aspects of football, is like having a pervert preach to you about the virtues of sexual absitence. They know nothing, and since the core game has not progressed the slightest in 10 years, it would be a fair assumption that they do not care neither.\n\nFuck SI, Fuck their beloved \"devs\" and fuck Charlton Heston while you're at it.\n- As the holder of a degree in Plant Sciences, I wholeheartedly endorse this game.\n\nReal talk: One of the best things about this game is how it totally commits to the old-timey apothecary/greenhouse theme-- it’s extremely atmospheric. It also has a compelling story with recurring characters that you can affect with your choices. If the prospect of discovering and using plants to solve problems (or mayhap even a grim mystery) appeals to you, I recommend trying this game.\n- Valve ignored this game because it doesn't rake in the money like tf2/dota/csgo and thats why its good\n- \"it's a puzzle game dressed up as a wargame\"\n\n1. puzzle games don't have this much randomness\n\n2. it uses authentic hex wargame conventions/mechanics so it's more of a puzzle game built out of a wargame\n\n3. you can take the puzzle element out of it by customizing your game.yml file to allow +5 turns, then play each scenario slow\n- [h1]AT A GLANCE[/h1]\n(Full review follows below)\n\n[list]\n[*] [b]Game Name:[/b] The Swapper\n[*] [b]Original Release:[/b] 2013\n[*] [b]Genre Tags:[/b] Atmospheric; 2D; Puzzle-Platformer; Sci-Fi \n[*] [b]My Overall Grade:[/b] A-\n[*] [b]Estimated Playtime (Campaign):[/b] 3-5 hours\n[*] [b]Multiplayer Aspect:[/b] None\n[*] [b]Recommended To:[/b] Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Aesthetes; Game atmosphere connoisseurs; Strong narrative advocates; Puzzle game aficionados\n[/list]\t\n\n[h1]REVIEW[/h1]\n[b]The Swapper[/b] is an enjoyable 2D puzzle-platformer that lacks gameplay innovation but rises above the crowd on the shoulders of its superbly well-designed atmosphere and provocative narrative.  The actual puzzle-solving aspect of the game is adequate, but with minimal diversity and accretion.  It is definitely a story-driven experience, with the gameplay taking a passenger seat.  If you can appreciate a game in that style, this is a good bet for you. \n\nThe entrancing narrative and the style in which it transpires work in concert with the mystifying ambiance to create a wondrous experience. The story touches on some thought-provoking metaphysical issues, while skillfully avoiding a fall too deep into the rabbit hole to keep the average person’s interest. Much of the rest of the narrative is comfortable, cliché sci-fi tropes that we all know and love.\n\nThe gameplay and the puzzles are far from [i]bad[/i], but they also are nothing special.  As I alluded to: they are sufficient, but fail to develop into anything overly interesting. Very little changes from the first puzzle to the last, so it does get a little bit dry.  That said, some of the later ones are quite tricky and a few require not only puzzle-solving ability but also decent reflexes. \n\nThe graphics are pleasurable and align perfectly with the vibe of the game. But the whole soundscape is what truly brings the atmosphere of [b]The Swapper[/b] to life. The ambient soundtrack, the cryptic chatter, and the selectively placed voice-overs contribute a wonderful blend of emotions and mystery. If you are into it, this is a game you might enjoy with the lights off and your headphones on (or however else you may get into the zone).  \n\n[b]The Swapper[/b] is a brief, interesting, and enjoyable experience. It is not a complex or intricate puzzle-platformer, but I recommend it to any fan of the genre who would appreciate the atmosphere and narrative.\n\n[i][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/murphyslawyercuration#curation]Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations![/url][/i]\n- While i'm not far into it, so far it is great. All negative reviews are due to the stuttering. I have a 3070 and I googled a solution.\n\nWIth Nvidia GPUs go to Nvidia control panel and change the global shader cache size in 3d settings to unlimited. Also limit the fps of Elden Ring, I have it set to 60 fps. So far no problems on my end. Hope this helps somebody choosing to get the game.\nIf u have AMD GPUs I don't know specifics so please ask google sorry for not being able to help, but I know it is a similar process.\n\nNow 30hrs in the game is so good too\n\nNow done with the game it is amazing\n- After the past few years of broken, buggy AAA games I've started to lose the passion I once had for the industry. This masterpiece came out of no where and completely reignited my love for gaming. PLEASE do not sleep on this game, it's such a breath of fresh air from the garbage you'd normally expect from modern day companies. Definitely taking a spot in my top 5 favorites and I haven't even scratched the surface of the game yet, it's just that good. Beautiful art style, crisp animations, a unique concept, FUN gameplay, its everything I've been wanting and more. Kudos to the devs for making this absolute banger <3\n- I realise this is intended to be a darkly humored game, but it is still fucked up nonetheless. I just can't fathom how such degraded humor can be seen as funny.\n- The core game is fun, and scratches an itch for miniatures combat that I often have.\n\nTwo reasons I don't recommend: \n(i) the single player AI is quite easy once you figure it out.  You can face challenging scenarios but it's because at higher difficulty levels the AI adds sheer weight of numbers. It doesn't get appreciably smarter, so the only challenge you face is how to funnel larger, dumb formations of enemies to come at you.  The campaign mode is just a series of battles against randomly generated forces with extremely thin randomly-generated narrative interludes of about a paragraph in length, with no strategic map, or concepts of supply or resources. It does not meaningfully extend the length of time single player is fun.\n\n(ii) Multiplayer relies on too many things that are opaque to people who have just played single player.  There are a lot of rules and features (like how you get sub-commanders - it comes down to arcane placement of cavalry troops in setup), that are not documented in the rules or in any tutorial.  Unless you are willing to read the forums for both this game and the original game and try to glean this information, you will be perpetually at a disadvantage against the majority of the community who have been playing since the first game.  \n\nIf you like miniatures tabletop gaming and have lots of spare time to devote to the game to learning it in spite of the game not fully explaining its mechanics or giving feedback to you on enemy actions, it will be worthwhile.  Otherwise, the single player experience by itself doesn't warrant buying at full price. Worth it at 50% off.\n- Having accumulated over 13400 hours in-game with [i]Arma 3[/i], I would certainly recommend it to others. \n\nIf you enjoy tactical shooters and playing online with friends, it's well worth a look; especially if you appreciate a high dose of military realism!\n- Playing this game instantly brought back memories of me playing TMNT, Battletoads, Double Dragon, and Streets of Rage, with my little brother on the NES and Sega Genesis in the early 90s. Luckily this game doesn’t feature TMNT’s ridiculous water level or Battletoads' sadistic peed bike level. The graphics are perfect, the controls are great, the soundtrack is awesome (especially the Wu-Tang stage, and the Shredder stage), and the levels and overworld map are fun to navigate. I’ve played through the story mode with all 7 characters and have played through the arcade mode multiple times solo and many times in multiplayer and I’ve enjoyed every bit of it. This game is so much fun.\n\nThere are a few things I wish existed though. I wish there were more playable characters. I wish that you did not lose your 7 character’s progress in story mode when you start a new game. I wish you could see the difficulty level of the online arcade game you are joining. I wish there were cumulative stats you could see for arcade and story mode that showed the number of times you completed a stage, how many enemies you knocked out, objects you’ve destroyed, stage times, combo streaks, times taunted, etc. I wish you could create your own turtle and assigned moves, specials, jumps, taunts, and colors.\n- I fucking love this game (and the original Guacamelee as well). It's excellent, challenging platforming with a hilarious sense of humor. I'm an archaeologist who works in Mexico and this game is littered with funny and well-researched nods to Mexican history and pre-history. I imagine that matters less to the non-archaeologists out there, but the fact that they took the time to research all their jokes speaks to the care that went into this game.\n- A very easy game to get into, super popular at the moment so there is always someone to play with, and for only 5 EUR you can invest a lot of hours into the game\n- And that's it, after 278 hours of play, the adventure is over... \nThis type of game that you wish you could forget so you could rediscover it like the 1st time, where you discover everything, a bit like a child\nIt's a game made with passion for video games, to tell a story, to make the player laugh too, and to make him a little melancholic or horrified or even sickened sometimes\n\n[u]Divinity OS 2 will have marked my young adult life[/u], like Sonic and megadrive games, Pokémon, FFTactics, Zelda and gameboy / gamecube games, Warcraft3 (TT), or Mass Effect and other PC games did in my childhood and adolescence (I surely forget so much excellent games)\n\nIt's a 20/20 for me. The work is titanic. The game is really made with passion. The studio is very talented.\n\nSo when Steam asks me [i]\"Do you recommend this game\"[/i], I say:\nYes! Because this is where you feel that video games are an experience, an adventure to live! \nI went through Rivellion with my buddy, like I went through Kanto (Pokémon), or Ivalice in FF Tactics as a kid!\n\n\n[u][b]Atmosphere:[/b][/u]\nMany of us probably remember our adventures in Pokémon or other games in our childhood. We roamed, discovered and lived in these worlds!\n\nHere, it's the same thing, and not alone this time: I was with a very good friend! \nWe met frequently to venture into the world of Divinity as a lightning lizard warrior or a skeletal assassin with a mysterious past...\n\nWith our companions Lohse and Ifan, and Maladie, and Gareth, and Jahan and Han the survivor kid and Sir Lora and so many others. Impossible to forget... \n[i]They exist! Stop lying, I know they exist ![/i]\n\nOur choices were important: We decided to do justice to this or that person, provoking reactions (or death) in certain characters, slapping a few Magisters around when necessary\nAnd of course, we STRONGLY decided to stea... Borrow a lot of spells and equipments from the merchants, while the other one was distracting by chatting...\n... What? We didn't have the money and we had to save the world ! Well, we had the money, but you never know, maybe one day we will need it... !\nAnd then stealing, it's fun. And exhilarating hehehe\n\n\n[u][b]Gameplay:[/b][/u]\nA 3D tactical turn-based game, to play with friends. Really ! Don't play this game alone, I'm sure that with at least 1 buddy (or 3!), you will exploit the game to its full potential!\n\nAlso, [u]you can change your skills and class at any moment in the game[/u], it's very flexible ! I played rogue all my game, and in the last chapiter, I decided to play with spear and War skills ! I really enjoyed being able to switch like this, as I want ! The game want you to take FUN, not \"suffering\" your \"bad\" class choices !\n\nToo bad, I don't know anyone who is ready to take on the role of a GM (Game Master), to live a personalized campaign! Because it is a mode apart from the main campaign!\n\n\n[u][b]Music:[/b][/u]\nExtremely good and fits perfectly with the atmosphere of the game. This kind of OST that we listen to when we work and that makes us live our adventures again when the song becomes EPIC!\n\n\n[u][b]In summary:[/b][/u]\nTitanic content, assured re-playability for those who wish to know what would have happened if they had answered something else than \"FIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT\", and I repeat, the fact of being able to play with friends makes the game so much more pleasant to do!\n\n\n[b]*Sob*[/b]\nBut no, I'm not crying... I'm just allergic to emotions!\n\nI would like so much to forget this game to be able to rediscover it\n\nPlease play it, at least give it a try, and let yourself be immersed in Div's world!\n\nIn our case, we will do it again in HARDCORE mode !\n\nPeace guys !\n- For the past 4 years I couldn't get myself to finish a single game without having to force myself to do it(and even then I failed). I couldn't enjoy SP games no matter how good the gameplay or the story was. I kept buying games hoping to find that one game that would do the trick. This was FF XV for me. Despite of all my friends advising me against buying it because it was just going to be another game that would sit around in my library, I decided to give it a try.\n\nIt actually felt like I went back in time to when I could play SP games for hours without getting bored after an hour or two.\n\nI admit I skipped most sidequests and I'll try going back to them sooner or later, although it may not be the best game out there in terms of content(you can finish the game on easy skipping most secondary quests in about 20-25 hours) or story development, playing through it felt like a new experience. In fact, even after finishing the game there's still plenty of things to do and in my opinion, even playing it through again just to spend more time with Noctis and his friends is worth it.\n\nThe story is not mindblowing, the combat system is really fun but far from flawless, most sidequests aren't well written but at its core, at least for me, FF XV has something to it that other games lack. I can't say it magically restored my old passion for gaming but it has given me a reason to at least try to get into it again.\n\nIf you haven't played it yet I sincerely envy you, I would love to experience it all over again from the start, it has been a memorable journey to say the least and I hope that you are willing to give it a try. ^^\n- WHERE ARE MY OG DS FANS OF THIS GAME? REJOICE BRUDDAS!\n\nNo but seriously, I loved this game to DEATH when it first came out on the DS and to now see an HD version of this game on steam. It's quite a whiplash but a good one! To anyone who loves mystery/ detective games, YOU NEED TO GET THIS!!! Good story, soundtrack and gameplay <3 AHHHHHH!!!\n- If you like management type games and RPGs, this is the perfect mix. It's just enough management to allow you to thrive with mostly strategy without feeling bogged down, and just enough RPG elements to get you invested in not just your squad, but each individual character in it. \n\nHere's a tale from my experience with the game;\n\nThis is the kind of game to change your entire perspective on life itself. Failure is not the end, nor the beginning, but a constant in this world that you can either let destroy you or make you stronger. Allow me to tell you a story. The story of New Battlehill. \nNear the Shek city of Squin, not far east, was a small town. It went through many names. The first that stuck was Firstyeet, totally not a placeholder. It wasn't an notable settlement, merely consisting of a shack, an iron processor, and some walls to mildly inconvenience the roving gangs of Dust Bandits that liked to bully the residents. After being evicted from their own city once again, the residents, Denver, Soto, Ruka, and Meow, vowed to take back their home. After training and buying the best weapons and armor they could, they made their way back to Firstyeet. To their surprise, however, they would not have to fight. One of the bandits had picked a fight with a herd of goats. The bandits' defense failed against the caprine assault. From this, the town would get its second name - Densorumego. Den for Denver. So for Soto. Ru for Ruka. Me for Meow. And Go for the true heroes, the goats.\nPeace would not last long but soon the residents of Densorumego would become strengthened by their constant fighting. On the elevated, somewhat round land on which Densorumego sat, there were many large fights involving a lot of people. If only there was some sort of name to reflect this... \nAnd from that, the town was renamed for the last time, to Battlehill.\nThings were looking up. The town built its first farms and expanded to be almost four times its original size. But this peace would not last. Battlehill's new ambitions of self sufficiency would attract the attention of a new foe - The Shek Kingdom.\nThe Shek claimed ownership of the land Battlehill was on, and as such, demanded all food grown there be given to them. Confident from their many victories against the Dust Bandits, the Battlehillites refused the Shek demands. Their risk was calculated... but man were they bad at math.\nAll but one were nearly killed in the ensuing battle, and the one person that wasn't knocked into a coma was stuck on the wall because part of the wall was destroyed and he could no longer reach the stairs because of that. The people knew they couldn't fight the Shek, but they would not allow themselves to be subservient either. And so began their malicious compliance. The Shek would get all the food in Battlehill, as it would be none - The Battlehillites were moving.\nI could write entire books about their journey around the west. The Fogmen, the ruins, the Screeching Bandits, there's many a tale. But, eventually, the people would find a new home. In the harsh and Beak Thing infested land of Vain, homeland of the Western Hive, they would found their new home - New Battlehill.\nJump to now, the city is thriving, they have more bread than they know what to do with, they've grown strong from defending their home from the Beak Things, and their population has grown. They are currently planning a reconquest of Battlehill, which was occupied by Dust Bandits shortly after they left.\n\nThere is a part I left out, between Firstyeet and Densorumego - I had repeatedly failed to retake Firstyeet, and I was about to quit the game. I was frustrated that I'd gone and bought the best arms and armor and still failed. And when I tried to set up a training ground on a mountain near Squin, bandits again came and defeated me. I went as far as to try and get a refund, which was denied. That refund being denied was the best thing that could've happened. I decided to give the game another try, and to try accepting my failures and growing from them. And if I hadn't done that, I would never have founded New Battlehill. None of the legend worthy tales my squad has been through would have happened. And I'd never have had the fun of going through all of them.\n\nIn short, get this game. It is just great.\n- Very fun game. Best wave shooter on the market that I've ever seen. The roguelike nature of it is very fun. Each run hits you with different challenges in building your weapons.\n\nBiggest critiques - \n1. Achievements locked behind multiplayer in a dead game. God I hate when devs do this. It luckily lets you play through normal mode when queuing, but its still very annoying. The last achievement I needed was \"get to wave 50 of multiplayer gauntlet mode\". I've so far been able to play 2 games of multiplayer. One, my partner had no voice coms. Second, my partner started with extremely staticy voice coms and it cut out at about wave 5. We pushed through to wave 48. Aaaaaaaaaand network error. It took about an hour and a half to get that far just for the game to crash and lose it all. Devs, please stop hiding achievements behind multiplayer when you know full well your game won't have a huge online player base.\n\n2. You get TWO GUN ARMS! This is AMAZING AND AWESOME! Except for the fact that a ton of the attachments for your weapons affect every part on your gun. So by not just making one super mega death arm, you are effectively chopping your total strength into two parts. There are a few pieces that only give you buffs for \"dual wielding\" or having a firing barrel on each arm. But these are not very common, and the stats you get from them pale in comparison to just making a super gun on one arm and keeping the other arm clenched for punching enemies that get up to your face, or putting on a single melee weapon on the other hand for the same purpose. \n\n3. The variety of guns is fun, but in the end it ends up turning into \"hold the fire button, aim for enemies, walk in a circle to trick enemy aim as best as possible, and occasionally punch an enemy that gets to you\". The biggest change to this system is getting either the rocket launcher or the Barrel Barrel which shoots massive barrels at the enemies. They have a very slow fire rate and do best when aiming the shots more precisely. But even then, with some weapons having a spooling time, and others outputting a hale of bullets, the best strategy is to just keep the trigger held 24/7 and strafe your aim from enemy to enemy.\n\nI really enjoyed my time with this game, but don't try to 100% it. The multiplayer achievement isn't worth it. Network is terrible. There's too much going on on screen when you have 2 players in the mix so crashing is likely. If I were the Completionist I would give this game a rating of Finish It. Play through the game with all the unique starting bonuses, all the difficulties. But stay away from multiplayer unless you have a friend to dedicate multiple hours to trying the gauntlet with.\n- Noita is a great indie rogue-lite 2D adventure where every pixel has his own life. The controls with mouse and keyboard are simple and the principle of the game as well easy to learn (and hard to master). Just get as deep, as far as possible. You only have one life. If you die you start all over. \n\nGameplay video: https://youtu.be/6N4Boz1YA2Y\n\nI very much enjoy playing Noita, even if it is sometimes a bit unfair and the procedural generated levels aren't always giving you the same amount of luck. The game still needs some more balance in the gameplay, as well as optimizations since I experienced little stutters here and there.\n\nSince it is early access, I expects improvements in this sense. Overall the game is fun and definitely an added-value to every indie library or rogue-lite gamers collection.\n\nTherefore, I can recommend the game! \n\nPS: Restarting a run shouldn*t restart the application, @developers.\n- My previous review reflected the terrible state of the game as it was on launch day. After years of improvements, the game has had its map design & cover placement tweaked, pretty-boy playermodels have been dirtied up, cringy voicelines were adjusted & a bunch of new content has been added. A lot of my complaints were addressed and I recognize the amount of work the team has done to bring the game back. It finally feels content complete and has reached an acceptable level of quality that should've been there when it came out.\n\nHowever, I am still disappointed to say it falls very short of its predecessors in terms of gameplay, map design and atmosphere. I see no reason to play this instead of BF3/BF4. \n\nPlay the map Grand Bazaar in Battlefield 3. Look at all of the particle effects, post processing and detail that map has. It has such a thick rainy atmosphere. Play it through to the end and you'll see how players tear up the map and make it look destroyed. In BF4's Paracel Storm, the foliage will sway & the waves will rise as the strong winds of a storm approaches the map. Watch as a sandstorm creeps up in Gulf of Oman and eventually engulfs it in a torrent of chaos. These landscapes have so much drama that the ones in 2042 lack. Sure, there are sandstorms and tornadoes, but they still look so sterile compared to the previous games this title stands upon.\n\nConceptually, 2042's world is supposed to be on its knees. The growing reality of extreme climate, natural disasters becoming commonplace and the world powers fighting over the last resources Earth has to offer depicts a dire situation to immerse ourselves in. This makes me imagine maps where earthquakes adjust the layout of flags throughout the round, or tsunamis roll in and what once was a playable area is now flooded. Giant tornado events that tear down skyscrapers. Sandstorms that turn the widest of maps into a close-quarters brawl. \n\nThe maps in the game have some aspects of this concept but nowhere to the amount that it should. The technology is there. The previous games have had a genuinely impressive level of immersion and atmosphere. 2042 did not have this on launch and it still doesn't. This could have been the wild natural disaster Battlefield game where we see SHTF.\n\nI don't care that we have 128 player matches or goofy butt specialists to play as. They missed the mark with 2042 and no update can fix that, conceptually, it never was able to realize its potential.\n- This is such a faithful recreation of Star Ocean 2, I don't think I'll ever even consider playing the PS1 original, or the PSP remake. The beauty of the new HD landscapes and animations, added to the wonderful musical score, the various combat improvements and the classic story, this is one you won't soon forget.\n\n20 hours to beat\n2 main characters to see the story from different perspectives\n13 recruitable party members\na MASSIVE world to explore\nintense crafting system\nStorytelling as only the japanese could tell in the 90's\n\n100% recommend.\n- A fun game for drinking parties, take a shot every time you feel like you just wasted 19 cents.\n- This game is a cozy  winter morning, wrapped in a blanket, in the heat of the fireplace with your favorite cartoon on and cup of hot chocolate, it is x-files, it is the music that you hear while walking on the streat, it is people you know,  good people, bad people, real people. This game has the feeling of nostalgia while being totally contemporary and modern.This game is every young adult fear and existential crisis all at once. This game is pure feeling.\n\n\nthat aside, this game is pretty much a perfect game for me, the story is really interesting, the music is beautiful and the art is gorgeous, and the characters and the atmosphere are so fucking believable i think i know everybody in this game, or atleast i feel so.\n\nAs a small town dude i really relate with a lot of thing in this game.\n\nThis game is special, its special for me.\n-    I just finished playing the 5th episode 😭. It feels incredibly sad to say \"Good Bye\" to this game. While playing I had a chance to get to know every in game character, especially Max and Chloe. They've become like my new friends, we've been through so much together, and realizing that it's over now, it's hella tough. \n   I've seen a lot of great games before, but never did a game make me feel SO connected to its characters. And every time you need to make a choice, you start seeing everything you've been through before and thinking how to make things even better. But I think the most important thing here is not to overthink (I mean not to try to Google what consequences your choice is going to have because it kills all the excitement of not knowing). Just do what feels right and what your heart tells you even if you might be wrong. I guess that's the lesson I learned in here. \n   Other important things that make Life Is Strange my favorite game: The developers paid attention to the smallest details, some of them you don't even notice playing for the first time, but the fact that they're there makes me appreciate it even more. The graphics is hella amazing, you just have to see it for yourself :) The plot and the music complement each other in subtle ways, and I can guarantee you'll have at least several of the soundtracks in your favorites playlist ;) \n   The game's definitely worth its money and even more. I wish I'd be able to forget everything that happened in the game and start playing it from the very beginning, so I'd be able to feel everything with the same intensity I did during my first playthrough. But I'll definitely come back to it after some time just to do it all over again. \n   Dear Developers, THANK YOU so much for Life Is Strange. I wish you all the best and I'm looking forward to seeing more masterpieces from you.\n- This game is difficult and fun! But I wold hold off from purchasing right now. The game is very laggy and has many bugs. Here are some pros and cons.\n\nPros: \nFun\nDifficult\nLong\nGraphics\nOn the edge of your seat gameplay\n\nCons:\nLaggy\nLow FOV\nDoes not look as good as what was advertised.\nRTX low is super laggy and unstable\nbugs and glitches\n[spoiler]Not scary jumpscares[/spoiler]\n\nI'ma be honest, the game is fun and I still need to finish it. But if scott did not quit, the game would be more fun and better. Steel Wool kinda floped the game.\n(spoiler)\n\n\nBy the way does anyone have any tips on how to beat the daycare thing? I'm stuck.\n- This is the purest Megaman experience I've had in years. I don't remember the last time I sat down with a Megaman-style game like this and just had pure Fun, and got fully engrossed in it over everything else. 20XX? No. Fangames? No. Even Megaman 11 didn't grab me this hard. This is it. This is the game people wanted when they saw Mighty Number 9 the first time. This is the Megaman successor we've been waiting for.\n\nIf I had to say anything negative about it, it'd be the music. It's mediocre at best. It's Meh. It does its job and fills dead air, but I'm not rushing to download the OST any time soon. I can't think of a single track that I went \"wow I need that\" for. It doesn't hinder my opinion of the game, but I would have loved it even more if it had gotten this right.\n- Phat beatsies,\nSelf-deprecating humour that gives me self affirmation,\nPanders to my need for nostalgic nods,\nPlays smoothly, and so doesn't leave me stuck for hours helping me to feel like I have higher than average intelligence,\nMesses about with you based on the assumption of previous adventure game experience, which leads to making me go \"heh\" outloud more than three times.\n\nMildly amusing, could use more super space dust.\nPlayed on the \"hard\" difficulty option but activated other options out of curiosity, would recommend it for the extra shenanigans.\n\nIf I had to give it a score 8/10,\nWould pay for the soundtrack, that ear crack is cash money.\n\nA hell of a lot of work was put into this game & I suggest you press \" J \" on as many screens as you can handle to get some insight on the thought process behind this game, the effort and imagination that went into it.\n\nThe missing 2 points:\nfew bugs to work out, ain't no big but in a game where you are going to be thinking \"it's not progressing because I haven't mashed the appropriate non-sensical things together\" it needs to not bug out.\n\nSoundtrack not yet out - nah not actually taking points away from that, it'll be out soon as I understand it, but I need that fix Mr. Shellburger.\n- The cognitive dissonance in the original Space Quest games between the box cover art telling you that \"Roger Wilco is hapless!\" and the player's necessary mental exertion involved to solve the puzzles, is laid bare the moment you can type in the name you will be called by in the game.\n\nIt's one of the hardest lines to walk when narrative is the main driver of an interactive work:  balancing the player's actions with the personality of the character they are directing in a world that is clearly alive, regardless of the players's presence.\n\nThe Excavation of Hob's Barrow's succeeds in this fully with the denizens and everyday life of the town of Bewlay.\n\nFrom the moment Thomasina Bateman starts recounting the events that led to her writing a letter to her mother, any ambiguity is dispelled: the player is helping Thomasina relive her time in starkly bucolic Bewlay. But as players spend more time within the memories and stories Thomasina shares, the more off putting the narration becomes. It's not just that Thomasina is an unreliable narrator—the implications of the traumatic events that occured at Hob's Barrow are still a puzzle to be worked out. \n\nThis is the strength of the narrative design and writing in Hob's Barrow: as entertainingly crafted as linear story or film, but with eartnest player engagement required to work out what's happening in the very deep shadows of this cursed place.\n\nThe fantastic writing is supported by equally fantastic pixel art, music, and some of the best voice work I've heard in games…ever? The codgers, critters, and countryside all sound fantastic, the bleakness of the moors churning from peaceful to menacing with expert orchestration. Visual direction is solid, too, with sparingly, effectively used pixel portraits and closeups to highlight details both grotesque and filled with character. The dark undercurrent of humour throughout the game also adds some replayability for achievement hunters: some encounters are worth revisiting!\n\nI played this entirely on Steam Deck, mostly curled up in bed at night, but enjoyed the grand finale while docked on my TV. Performance and control was flawless, regardless.\n\nOne of my favorite games released in 2022, and definitely one of my favorite adventure games of all time.\n- [i] THIS MATCH WILL BE RED HOT. HERE GOES [/i]\n\nLord knows what attempt number, and you again hear the ring bell. The level boss keeps laughing, taunting your every failure. The brainwashing music is starting to give you a headache, your eyes are moving on their own, the difficulty is boiling your blood to the very cells and the controller screams for mercy as every retry gets more and more intense. The anger flows and the addicted child in you claims it will be the last try. The reactions become pure instinct, flowing in a quick, relentless succession of moving, shooting and dodging a thousand projectiles. But suddenly, it happens. \n\n[i]A KNOCKOUT![/i] \n“Phew, that was intense...time for the next one!”\n\nThis is the very essence of Cuphead. A punishing yet immensly satisfying game of bullet hell, mixed with a beautiful and just so goddamned perfectly recreated animation technique that will have you wondering what crazy stuff they will make up next. This is a game that yells nostalgia and effort in every moment. It’s a wonderful experience that at every turn you can tell they didn't just put blood, tears, effort and sweat at every second of work for the last years, they put so much LOVE. Love for the past and love for an era long gone but never forgotten.\n\nThe most pure fun I had raging in the whole year. Absolutely recommended to anyone up for a challenge that will give as much as it takes.\n- I hold this game in as high esteem as games such as Undertale and Oneshot.\nIt would be a mistake to dismiss this game, as I once did.\n\nThis game made me really care about it. It's one of those games where the writing, music, graphics, and gameplay all work together to give life to the characters within it. Even though the setting takes place in a small area (comprising of 2 buildings, 3 caves, and a bake stand), it still feels like an entire world that had a past from before you started playing and a future that unfolds after you stop playing. Every part of the game serves towards this purpose. The developer took the time and effort to make sure every small, nuanced detail felt right. Whether it's a quirky little animation, the presence (or absence) of circumstance-fitting music, or the sound effects that make every footstep and enemy strike sound just right, this game does a phenomenal job making sure that every contributes an immersive experience. You’re not interacting with a piece of software, you’re interacting with a world.\n\nHowever, this game, as is all games, is not perfect. The combat can be a bit unintuitive owing to the fact that enemies can attack you while you are selecting your move, but you will PROBABLY get used to this and after that, boy, does it become quite an exciting experience. In addition, this game has many mentions of death. While this sounds terrible on paper, the game does manage to pull out some interesting game choices out of it. Unless you have trouble discerning fiction from reality (or are uncomfortable with the mention of death), you should be fine. All other flaws I won't elaborate on because they're subjective nitpicks (ex. didn't like a word choice; thought a certain sprite looked weird; thought that the music overplayed the \"spooky\" instruments that one time in the game).\n\nIf you're looking for a game that will make you invested in a new experience, you might have just found it.\n\n- everyone posting 16 gb ram specs and saying it runs well, lul\n\ni have 8 gigs of ram with a gtx 660 (yep) and a fx-8350 and it runs around 45-60 FPS (i cap it at 60) at High settings. yeah. REALLY well optimized, considering this computer is nearing the end of its life and the visuals are gorgeous.\n\nEDIT: 1080p :)\n\noh, and it's fun too, right.\n\nEdit 2- Actual review\n\nGame is pretty easy. I forget if there was a hard mode, but if there was I picked normal mode, and the game feels like it should be on easy. I've yet to break a sweat on a boss (currently chapter 5), and the only thing stopping me from taking on enemies 10+ higher than me is that the game auto-nerfs your damage if the enemy is too far above you. I've actually found the game very relaxing as a result, because there isn't the frustration of having to redo bosses after getting wiped, so it's not entirely a bad thing. But if you were looking for a challenge in your battles, this isn't your game.\n\nAs for story, it's also fairly basic, and rides off of having a sizeable to-do list as sidequests. Recruiting new citizens, doing major sidequest chains, unlocking new stuff, it's got a good amount to do in-game to keep you occupied, unless you're a \"main quest line only\" player. It helps that the warp system is easy to use (and you will use it often) and the game is gorgeous, so you don't really feel too bored doing the same shet over and over again. \n\nThere are several elements to the gameplay. \n\nOne, the overworld traversing. Overall, I'm ambivalent to it. It can feel slightly sluggish at parts, but collecting the shiny areas is surprisingly addicting (maybe because I'm a sem-completionist), as are finding chests. The unfortunate part is that most of these chests contain utterly useless items, so don't really feel that rewarding. \n\nTwo, dungeon crawling. Have to admit this is one of the weaker parts for me. The dungeons are basic, and don't really have much in the way of puzzling elements. Could change later, highly doubt it will. I do like how the battles are seamless, though.\n\nThree, army battles. Also not much of a fan of this, but only because it seems like a side addition without much depth to it. Fortunately it's not a major part of the game, so meh.\n\nFour, kingdom management. Holy cow I love this part of it. People might complain it feels like a mobile game with the wait times and whatever, but since you can warp straight back to your castle whenever you want, it's not that big of an issue. I do wish your gains accumulated while you're offline (or tabbed out, at least...), but idk something about managing the kingdom and making it grow/level up is stupidly addicting.\n\nOverall, if you're looking for a challenging or engaging JRPG, this might not be the game for you. If you're looking for a game with gorgeous visuals, fantastic voice acting (using JP), laid-back atmosphere, and want to be the president of the United States serving some random kid as his vassal, highly recommended.\n\nHighly recommend to play on controller. I'm using the Switch Pro Con.\n- While I don't necessarily play medieval type games...I thought I should give this game a go...but tbh I was highly disappointed...this game is poorly optimized...full of glitches...poor characterization... terrible voice acting....& terrible facial expressions...only good thing about this game is the detailing of the rats...and some lighting effects...other than that this is just another pathetic excuse of a game.... wouldn't recommend it even on sale...it's a huge let down...tbh...\n- A new game from Zeboyd, you know I'm there! And this was such a fun game\n\nThis game is about as long as Cthulhu Saves Christmas and it's just as Linear. However given their statement on this video, that's meant to be the point these days.\n\nThe Graphics for the main game are basic but it's fitting for the Genre. Also they have dropped the random battles with on screen monsters to avoid if you want to not fight (And you still have the option to start a battle through the main menu). The fighting system is identical to CSC too which I've enjoyed but I can understand those who may not like it. The Animation for the transformations are incredible...except I'm always stuck watching them every single time which can get very tedious.\n\nThe story is clever, and they provide \"Translations\" for the Ole English of Shakespeare...but a lot of the translations are jokes and very silly ones at that.\n\nThere isn't a LOT of replay value but you will enjoy the story enough you'll want to play it again eventually.\n\nThere is no New Game Plus mode...yet but given how they patched it into CSC later on I'm certain they're do that here eventually.\n\nI say the game is incredible for the price range and is entertaining for all ages.\n\n\nVIDEO REVIEW: https://youtu.be/wuw9pJPowqM\n- [h1]Dishonored 2.[/h1]\n[i]If old Samuel could see me now...[/i]\n\n[b][u]Introduction[/u][/b]\nAt its core, Dishonored 2 is little more than a mechanically and narratively contiguous continuation of the Dishonored formula. This isn't a bad thing - the first Dishonored was one of the best stealth-action games of all time - but innovation is too often overlooked in the games industry. DH2 does bring some nuance to the franchise, but new drawbacks are packaged in as well. Put plainly, Dishonored 2 is a game I adore just as much as the original, but there are aspects that certainly left me wishing for better.\n\n[b][u]Plot[/u][/b]\nThe game begins 15 years following Empress Jessamine's assassination, and her daughter, Empress Emily Kaldwin, has ruled the isles since that time. Her father and Lord Protector, Corvo Attano, advises and keeps close watch over her at court. Quickly after Dishonored 2's opening however, the Duke of Serkonos, Luca Abele, comes to Emily's royal tower - bearing a gift. He brings Emily's supposed long lost aunt, Delilah Kaldwin, who then immediately stages a coup in a bid to take the throne. She is successful, and you must escape the city of Dunwall as either Emily or Corvo (more on that later). You then travel to Karnaca, the capital of Serkonos, where you begin a personal crusade to [i]take back what's yours.[/i]\n\n[b][u]Technical Revamp[/u][/b]\nShifting focus for a look at DH2's presentation, the game is gorgeous. There's a hint of the old, comic-book-like aesthetic that was present in the original game, but the graphical fidelity has been greatly improved in this sequel. The textures, lighting, animations, visual effects, and environments are all elegantly rendered. It's easily one of the most beautiful games of 2016. As for the audio; sound effects and voices are realistic, and the OST is as iconic, if not more so than the first game's. Although, when it comes to performance, Dishonored 2 clearly falters. DH2 was a technical mess on launch, and while it runs decently now; some bugs, stutters, and crashes still persist. Overall the presentation is good, but the performance is surely sub-par.\n\n[b][u]Setting & Exploration[/u][/b]\nAs stated earlier, Dishonored 2 is set in Serkonos's city of Karnaca; known as The Jewel of the South. Gone are the dark grays and subdued browns of Dunwall, as Karnaca replaces them with bright, pastel blues and yellows. The metropolis has distinct cultural differences from Dunwall as well, whether it's the widespread use of wind-power over whale oil, or Karnaca's reliance on silver mining to employ its working class. In terms of level design, DH2's stages are much more expansive than anything seen in the first game too. There's lots to explore in every district of Karnaca, especially when verticality and hidden locations are taken into account. There's several routes toward all objectives as well; emphasizing Arkane's \"play your way\" motto. All considered, Dishonored 2's game world is exceedingly well-built.\n\n[b][u]Depth in the Details[/u][/b]\nOne of the most effective ways DH2 differentiates itself from its predecessors is through what I'd call 'structural gimmicks.' To break up the standard pacing, a couple of the game's missions have special set-pieces which can completely turn gameplay convention on its head. An example of this is the 'Clockwork Mansion' on the fourth level. This inventor's home has levers in essentially every chamber that reconfigures a room's layout - such as turning a trophy room into a grand hall. These levers can be used to access new areas or evade enemies, and even reveal traversable spaces behind the walls. It's this degree of imaginative design depth that distinguishes Dishonored 2 from most other games in its genre.\n\n[b][u]Stealth & Combat[/u][/b]\nMoving over to the core gameplay loop, not much has changed from the first game. The stealth and combat are still just as exquisitely implemented as before, with only a couple of refinements. The deviations that come to mind are that drop-assassinations can now be used non-lethally as drop-knockouts, and assassination animations are a much more brutal (but cathartic) spectacle to watch than before. Dishonored 2's central mechanics are near flawless to be sure, but this sequel suffers by adding few new gameplay elements to the mix. Except - well - there is one big feature I've neglected to elaborate on as of yet.\n\n[b][u]Emily [i]or[/i] Corvo[/u][/b]\nIn Dishonored 2, you can play as either Emily Kaldwin, [i]or[/i] Corvo Attano. When Delilah first takes the throne you get a moment to choose one or the other, after which the character you don't pick is turned into a cold, stone statue. Both Emily and Corvo have separate voice actors and personalities, but they share the same goal throughout the game's duration: to save the last of their family, and reclaim the throne for the true Kaldwin heiress. After receiving the mark of The Outsider, Emily and Corvo have different magical abilities too. Where Corvo has blink, Emily has far reach; or where Corvo can stop time, Emily can chain together the lives of her enemies, and kill or incapacitate several people at once. All in all, the decision to allow the player to progress the campaign as either Emily or Corvo was a stroke of brilliance in my estimation.\n\n[b][u]Main Story[/u][/b]\nReturning to the main story - it's another point of criticism for me. There are some magnificent aspects; such as the nostalgic callbacks to events in the first Dishonored or reappearances of some of the original game's best characters, but all considered most of the writing is retreading a beaten path. Just as in Dishonored 1, the game flows from mission to mission where the chief objective is simply to eliminate a key player obstructing your path to the throne. This is perfectly fine from a gameplay perspective, but it can lead to a bit of déjà vu from a narrative outlook. Dishonored 2's writing quality isn't poor, but it doesn't distance itself from the comfortable story-staging of its predecessor, making it feel slightly lazy.\n\n[b][u]A Reactive World[/u][/b]\nOn the other side of the same coin, the narrative reactivity of Dishonored 2's world to your choices is truly admirable. Playing DH2 in high chaos; where you murder many people throughout the game, results in huge environmental storytelling changes compared to low chaos. Here's an example. If you flood the streets of Karnaca red with blood, subsequent levels show you've harmed the city's inhabitants before you even arrive. Citizens’ moods and perceptions will have soured as they become depressed or monstrous in the wake of their crumbling city - causing suicides and murders to spike throughout Karnaca. And corpses bring bloodflies, which further tarnishes The Jewel of the South in a vicious cycle. You can, of course, avoid all this... by showing a whole lot of care in your actions toward others.\n\n[b][u]Conclusion[/u][/b]\nWhen all is said and done, the Dishonored formula is a fantastic one that it's hard to not have fun with. Karnaca is riddled with environmental detail, the stealth mechanics are flawless, combat is devilishly enjoyable, and the game judges you intelligently on your choices. The Dishonored IP is incredibly strong... The tweaks provided are appreciable; I just wish DH2 had made a concerted effort to make it even stronger. But, god-dammit, I enjoyed Dishonored 2 way too much over it's 20+ hour campaign to critique it any longer. Get the game and play it - despite all my pissy complaints, you won't be disappointed.\n\n[h1]Personal Rating: 9/10 - Absolutely Outstanding[/h1]\n- Definitely not addictive.\n- Alright. **Frog Detective 3: Corruption at Cowboy County** is done and dusted.\n\nIn this latest mystery for the *Frog Detective* to solve, somebody has....stolen...all the Cowboy County resident's....HATS!!! \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3067651098\n\nWill you find the missing hats? Will you find the Hat Thief? These questions and more will be answered in this game!\n\nThis was actually the longest game in the series by a wide margin. Too about and hour forty to wrap up, and the game features two parts. The second part accessed after the credits roll.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3067650496\n\nEpiside 3 was an excellent wrap up to the series. It is completely Steam Deck compatible. Also...doing sick scooter tricks around the desert is pretty sweet.\n\nThis one is an easy recommendation, and presumably, you will have played the other two games anyway, so you'll want to finish the series.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3067651219\n\n[code]If you found this review helpful and would be interested in supporting my Curator group, it would be appreciated. Cheers.\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/curator/32549618/[/code]\n- Ever wanted to be a futuristic dual wielding samurai drummer with a penchant for slicing boxes? No? You didn't even know that was a thing? Well you will after playing this. \n\nProbably the most satisfying rhythm game out there, Beat Saber turns sword thrusts into dance. With notes expertly timed to the music and directional swipes that lead smoothly into each other creating an almost choreographed flow, you will find yourself naturally completing songs and feeling boss after every single track.\n\nWith a choice of difficulty settings and a huge array of modifiers, it is accessible to many skill levels and makes it perfect for newcomers, parties or just to simply show off VR, while remaining a huge challenge for those who wish to test themselves on the most hardcore difficulties.\n\nBeat Saber is a game that probably should be on the radar of any VR user, as it's pretty visuals and reliance on your motions makes it a perfect fit for VR. If you don't have this game I highly recommend you pick it up, as when you do, you may just find it hard to put it down.\n\nNow if you will excuse me, I have a few more hardcore songs I have to embarrass myself attempting.\n- Game concept is good, but execution is bad. Add to that the attitude of the dev team, and I recommend you don't encourage this kind of community censorship.\n\nDon't buy this. Devs close topics because their fanboys get flamey when you bring up any kind of criticism. Like how the servers with anti-cheat and server saving (which doesn't save player status/location) functions enabled kick all players from the server every 30-60 minutes. I wouldn't mind reconnecting if my location and hunger/thirst got saved during this \"server save\". But apparently trying to open a discussion on the topic is considered flaming and they close down your topic. Horribly handled.\n\n- As much as I adore this game's visuals, soundtrack, story, and... THE MEMES... I unfortunately can't recommend actually playing it.\n\nI can parry bosses in Dark Souls or Elden Ring with less frustration than in this game. The parry system requires you to execute a light attack towards an enemy right before they go in for a hit against you, which is usually telegraphed with a red glare in their eye. Unfortunately, even while using the lock-on camera (and by the way, you are never directly informed of its existence), half of the time my opponent was partially, or even completely off-screen. This is a problem, not only because it makes seeing an incoming attack difficult, but also because movement is tied directly to the parry system. You must execute an attack TOWARDS the enemy. With the camera having a seizure every five seconds, this makes it even more irritatingly difficult to aim your parries. I died to Blade Wolf repeatedly, not because of my own skill, but because midway through an incoming attack, the camera would decide to turn 90 degrees to the left, causing my movement to also shift to the left, nullifying my parry. \nIt's consistently inconsistent.\n\nIf there is some system in place that actually does help explain a lot of these game mechanics, fantastic. However, I find it inexcusable that whatever I might be missing would be so out of the way that I'd never encounter it unless I went out of my way to do so.\n- >Be me\n>Move to new city for job offer\n>Go straight to bed when I arrive, but still oversleep and miss meeting with business contact\n>Have a message, but no contact information, so at suggestion of greasy hotel guy, I start randomly asking people on the street and café if they’re who I’m looking for\n>No luck, but random stranger points me to a club\n>Meet a cool chick who actually doesn’t treat me like a jerk\n>She has a boyfriend\n>Sad feelings\n>She invites me to a cool party anyway\n>Second person I talk to gives me a drink that really messes me up\n>Black out within first half hour of party\n>Wake up at cool chick’s house, she’s on her way to work\n>For some reason when I try to talk to her, I come across as a total stalker type.\n>Go to sleep\n>Next day, watch a train crash over some sort of secret agent\n>Mysterious hooded figure shows up, looms over g-man, then flees\n>Finally, some content, I think\n>Follow mysterious figure\n>Go into store, chase her into the basement\n>Door locks behind her\n>Weird guy there, gives me some backstory I promptly forget\n>Ask him every question that comes to me, but it won’t advance the plot\n>Wander around, not sure what to do\n>Not having fun\n>Meet a cool guy\n>He gives me a hacking device\n>Tells me he’ll teach me how to use it some other time\n>So much waiting\n>Finally run into guy who hired me and told me to move to this town\n>Tells me I’m fired\n>Go back to club\n>See cool chick\n>(only one of two people who actually treats me like a human being)\n>Talk to her\n>She calls me a stalker, I’m not sure why\n>Unable to defend myself\n>Weird basement guy tells me not to worry, invites me to another party\n>All I do is wander around and go to parties\n>Flashbacks of my real 20’s\n>Kill time until party by opening random doors and hacking a frying pan\n>Maybe I started a fire\n>Pass out in front of weird laser gate\n>Did I get electrocuted, or did I just fall asleep?\n>Go back to party\n>Weird guy tells me to loosen up and talk to girls\n>Girls all give me cold shoulder\n>Against better judgement, I drink several beers\n>Carry empties around with me because I can’t set them on counter\n>Weird guy tells me about a test\n>Won’t tell me how to take test, where to take test, or what I need to know to pass test\n>Worst party ever\n>Cool chick shows up again\n>She’s actually happy to see me\n>Try not to sound like stalker, kinda succeed, but I think I’m missing half the conversation\n>Also, I think cool chick might have a drinking problem\n>Me too, I’m staggering around\n>Drink coffee to try and sober up\n>Doesn’t work\n>Not having fun\n>Leave party\n>Kick lamp\n>Go to bed\n>Not tired enough to fall asleep\n>Wander around town, stumbling drunk, at 5 AM\n>Flashbacks to a dark time in my real life\n>Take drugs so time passes faster, flashbacks intensify\n>Talk to strangers since what else am I supposed to do\n>No one wants to talk to me\n>Cringingly accurate simulator of awkward college party years\n>Not fun game\n\nI hear from other reviews that this game starts to pick up after this point, but I can't do it anymore. I've already invested a lot of time and energy into this game for little to no return. I'm not going to study guides and waste more time on this game just so I can dig the nuggets of fun out of this wasted youth simulator. I will say that it did a really good job of making me role-play an awkward alcoholic with no job prospects and zero understanding of how to talk to women, living out of a ****** hotel room. But I've already played the real life version of that, so I can't recommend it. If you want to play a fun game about programming, go with Human Resource Machine. If you want a good role-playing game about hackers, go with Shadowrun. If you want to pay money and spend your leisure time feeling really depressed about your 20's, then I can recommend Else Heart.Break(), but maybe you'd be better off talking to a friend about it instead.\n- For the past 4 years I couldn't get myself to finish a single game without having to force myself to do it(and even then I failed). I couldn't enjoy SP games no matter how good the gameplay or the story was. I kept buying games hoping to find that one game that would do the trick. This was FF XV for me. Despite of all my friends advising me against buying it because it was just going to be another game that would sit around in my library, I decided to give it a try.\n\nIt actually felt like I went back in time to when I could play SP games for hours without getting bored after an hour or two.\n\nI admit I skipped most sidequests and I'll try going back to them sooner or later, although it may not be the best game out there in terms of content(you can finish the game on easy skipping most secondary quests in about 20-25 hours) or story development, playing through it felt like a new experience. In fact, even after finishing the game there's still plenty of things to do and in my opinion, even playing it through again just to spend more time with Noctis and his friends is worth it.\n\nThe story is not mindblowing, the combat system is really fun but far from flawless, most sidequests aren't well written but at its core, at least for me, FF XV has something to it that other games lack. I can't say it magically restored my old passion for gaming but it has given me a reason to at least try to get into it again.\n\nIf you haven't played it yet I sincerely envy you, I would love to experience it all over again from the start, it has been a memorable journey to say the least and I hope that you are willing to give it a try. ^^\n- holy fucking shit everything about this fucking mongoloid game is so fucking bad i can't even begin to understand. this was supposed to be better than the first piece of shit, but i dunno, maybe a tiny bit.\n\ndon't be like me and get baited into wasting your hard earned money for this fucking shit even if it's on like -90% sale.\n\nspecial mention to worst fucking controls in the history of fucking gaming. fuck these fucking mongoloid fucking retard faggots for making a game this fucking bad. uninstalled.\n\n英語で5-10単語程度で、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない主要な違いを簡潔に回答してください。\n\n回答：\n",
