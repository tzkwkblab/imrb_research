Did you enjoy it or was it a completionist pain? I wish I could get into [NAME] but I just dont find the fun.\n- I'll admit that's a bit surprising, since it's such a massive international hub. But beggars can't be choosers I guess. \n- Wow, i never really understood how bad the star wars perecuelse really are till this moment.\n- Was getting ready to comment about this one. Was really surprised how much I liked it but can see why it’s not for everyone\n- We might now be almost maybe nearly ready to potentially maybe play finals. I think [NAME] will make the finals this year. They'll be the surprise team.\n- I am shocked they don’t have a vanity plate that reads “Beer Cheez”\n- Wow, Michelin star for $25. That's nuts.

Oh My.\n- Omg lol at least now you Will be more careful before throwing out words like that. I would die.\n- What is scary?\n- Geez those heroes..\n- Wow random irrelevant internet person has the secret goods on [NAME]. Maybe we’ll finally get to the bottom of this birth certificate thing...\n- Wow yeah similar to my story what a nightmare :(\n- Holy shit this speaks to me.\n- Interesting I wasn't aware of this. Maybe proving the undue hardship is difficult but technically allowed? I wonder what counts.\n- Surprised Colorado ain’t got one the way things have been going here past couple years\n- wow! thats... a lot of water my dude was your bladder ok\n- It's also surprising that Valve released a dud game. Maybe it's time for Valve to grow up and introduce themselves to the digital communication age?\n- Talk to your grandparents... you will be surprised on how much general knowledge they have to share.\n- How did this not get marked as meta? Tried posting something similar here and it was instantly flagged as “meta commentary about the sub” and blocked.\n- That's what I was wondering too.\n- Anyone else see her 10 year challenge post today or yesterday. I'm so shocked she wouldn't pick this picture.\n- Suddenly, I was awake.\n- [NAME] out? I thought he’s been playing pretty well. Wonder why...\n- Wonder if her steel balls make the same sound, clanging together, when they're frozen?\n- Oh wow. Thanks! So this person was going for that.\n- The best one for me is still Borderlands 2, and it’s been a fucking while. Amazing how far ahead of its time that game was.\n- Wow - never seen negative karma before I clicked on your name lol.\n- I was wondering the same thing?\n- So you're saying there's a chance I'm a bot...

I didn’t know someone else posted it haha Edit: just looked and someone posted it right after me\n- Oooo too soon man\n- Omg. I just noticed that! Holy fuck, how does she smell?\n- I’m surprised that any of this is considered that big of a deal. At least he wasn’t molesting little kids.\n- I hate to say it but....... I quite like this as a format - the burger and fries look shocking though.\n- Most likely shock that had him so comatose.\n- Wow. Yes\n- Wow, well I think that game just aged me 5 years...\n- I’m surprised nyxl hasn’t done that with their overloaded dps roster, but a possible upcoming import limit might be the issue\n- It’s shocking if you’re a bad electrician.\n- Makes us wonder what its going to be like for my children's generation..\n- It is like how I imagine [NAME] and [NAME] people seeing wooden ships across the water the first time.\n- What?

Like I thought they died off around 2014.\n- The cheerfulness of the “hail satan” text overlay was unexpected.\n- Seems fun, wonder how she would have ended up if the ca er was not there\n- Yes but that's largely changed in much of the US (the coasts at least). Surprised a state or two hasn't legalized it\n- Happy cake day!!!\n- According to the filmmakers, it was the same Brachiosaurus that awed the characters in the first movie. ;_;\n- I can’t believe that’s real\n- What the heck?!\n- I didn’t know I could roll my eyes this far into my head\n- That's true, but I was surprised to find absolutely ZERO information about a person who , presumably, has quite a bit of power and influence.\n- I'll be surprised if *Monty Python's Life of Brian* wasn't one of those.\n- I’m amazed how anti-government these people are. They have no understanding of what government does. Perhaps they should move to Somalia. No government there.\n- Oh my gawd. WHAT?\n- I wonder if this will ever appear on BotW. Since it's so straightforward there probably isn't much to talk about.\n- If it’s fan made they deserve an award. Or money. Something. The score is strange though\n- Lol, I’m surprised more people didn’t catch that. Thanks for the med check! \n- wow, you guys have a body language now?\n- I was wondering if that would happen. The story I first read was crazy.\n- Oh wow, this is the first I've heard of her aligning with those people. \n- With those pieces I’d be surprised 😒\n- Wow man, that is DEAD.

The ending is just god damn!\n- I couldn’t believe that. I’ve been mad but never enough to throw my PHONE! GIRL, what is you DOIN’?\n- Nah, girl, you did great.
