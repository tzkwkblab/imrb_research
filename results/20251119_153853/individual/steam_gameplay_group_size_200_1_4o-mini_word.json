      "you're looking for a game review you've come to the wrong place. But if youre looking for a fantastic ravioli recipe you've come to the right place.\n\nIngredients\n- To Make the Dough\n375 grams (3 cups) plain flour\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n2 eggs\n1/4 cup (50 ml / 3½ tablespoons) olive oil\n1/2 cup (120 ml / 8 tablespoons) water\nExtra flour for dusting \n\n\n- To Make Cheese Filling\n15 ounces (425 grams) container Ricotta cheese\n5 ounces (142 g/about 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons) \"3 Cheese Italian Blend\" (Parmesan, Romano & Asiago)\nNote: grate these cheeses yourself and create your own custom blend.\n1/2 cup cheddar cheese\n2 eggs, lightly beaten\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/2 teaspoon pepper\n\n\n- Extras\nYour favorite sauce for the ravioli (i.e. marinara/ marijuana)\nParmesan cheese\nBasil\nFried vegetables\nShrimp\nFish slices\nChicken pieces \nMake the Ravioli filling.\n\n- In a small mixing bowl, add the ricotta and mash with a fork.\n- Add in the 3-cheese blend, Cheddar cheese, eggs, salt, and pepper.\n- Mix all ingredients thoroughly until you have a smooth, paste-like consistency.\n- Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. \n\nMake the Ravioli dough.\n\n- Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.\n- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.\n- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.\n- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.\n- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.\n- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).\n- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. \n\nFill the Ravioli shells.\n\n- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.\n- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.\n- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.\n- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.\n- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. \n\nForm the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.\n\n- Roll the dough into two sheets\n- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.\n- Fill with the ravioli mixture.\n- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.\n- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.\n\nCook the Ravioli.\n\n- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.\n- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.\n- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest \n- Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed plates\n\nServe it up.\nTop with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!",

      "Honestly this game feels like it was made for me.\nQuoting iron pineapple:\"this guy (the dev) just gets it\". And he really does! The level design is great and the areas are cool and unique and a real joy to explore! A really slick zelda-like souls-like-ish game. \nBut that's not all.\nThe gimmick of this game, and the thing that really sets it apart and makes it go above the rest, is the manual. The whole gimmick is that the game is written, mostly, in an unknown runic language, forcing the player to figure out game mechanics, progression and puzzles on their own. You have only one thing to help you: as you progress you collect pages of a manual, in the style of those old console games, which gives you again pseudo-cryptic hints, because it's also mostly in the other language.\nThe way the manual and the knowledge based progression flow into the design of the game is nothing short of genius. It's hard to gosh about just how amazing it is, because that would be spoiling it, but it's completely genius. \nGame's a masterpiece for me, a strange mesh of Hollow Knight  meets  Outer Wilds-based knowledge progression. \nDefinitely a must-buy, don't even worry about it going on a sale, it's an easy indie GOTY for me",
      "[b] Target Audience: [/b] [I] Anyone with a Soul[/i]\n\n[b] Summary: [/b]  \n\nIt's a damn shame that this game isn't topping people's game of the year list this year, because Wandersong is one of the best story based experiences that I've played on Steam. A game that is beautiful woven from start to end, every element works together in harmony to make what will be a cult classic in my mind: and only a cult classic due to the fact that it should be a blockbuster, but won't get the recognition. The 3 man team took an upbeat story of a young bard on a whismical journey and \nmade someone who usually gravitates toward more depressing/out there stories and fall in love with the Bard, Miriam, and the vast cast of characters here. \n\nThe funny thing is, it's hard to quantify what makes Wandersong such a complete package, because everything works in harmony so well with everything else. Take the music for example: I actually struggled to specifically remember any individual track at first, and that's because the games tracks are so tied to the emotions that you feel during scenes. You are the music in how you play through your game, you experience this game how you want, and it's singing mechanic that alters the world aroudn you allows you to be the player you want to be while still staying in a relatively linear story line. The color and presentation is fantastic, the gameplay mechanics stay just long enough before changing up, it's hard to really think of anything that the game did wrong.\n\nLook, even those who may hate games with less “gameplay” will most likely be charmed by Wandersong's spell. It's a siren of sorts: except it'll make you crash into jagged rocks of love and happiness. Story elements feel earned. Everything has very specific detail. It's clear this was a labor of love, and it shows even in the scene select: where the splooshes by the team just make you smile. You will sit and wonder about your own life after playing certain sections, and the club scene is one of the best set pieces I've seen in character development. Honestly, I really struggle to think of negatives for the game: each thing has a purpose and is there for a specific reason, and executes it beautifully. \n\nIf you're reading this review, it's because you're considering buying the game. Do it. Do it now. It's worth it.\n\n[b]Video Review: [/b] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ycIvIVfblk\n\n[u] Lists: [/u]\n[b]Positives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Oozes charm and love.\n[*] A fantastic buddy story that is great from start to finish. Great set pieces, great small stories, and just  great writing overall.\n[*] All characters are people that you want to run into again, having unique stories and good jokes.\n[*] Story elements feel earned despite upbeat nature. Protagonist has reason to be upbeat, but does face hardship.\n[*] Miriam's character is the best and shines as the secondary protagonist.\n[*] The club scene. Just. All of it.\n[*] Colored presentation is sharp and vividly pleasing, while always matching the emotion of what it's depicting.\n[*] Music drives the game forward via emotion: and makes you remember the set pieces and small moments easily.\n[*] Perfect for all ages: and adapts to the way you view it. \n[*] Every game needs a dance button. Every game. This proves it.\n[*] Attention to detail making every action feel like it effects the world makes a game you can get lost in.\n[*] Length of the game is perfect for story being told.\n[*] Each gameplay mechanic cleverly twists the singing base element and uses it in a new way. Only stays long enough before it gets over used, and then moves on to the next.\n[*] Controls work rather well and great indicators for actions.\n[*] Despite music focus, can still be played by deaf/colorblind players.\n[*] No performance issues.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Negatives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] There's one jump in the game that will frustrate you. This is literally the worst thing I can think about this game. \n[*] Once in a while the game gets a strange bug that makes you laugh more then anything.\n[*] People expecting fantastic gameplay aren't going to get it here, but the thing is, it fits the game and the story. \n[*] That it hasn't sold more.\n[/list]\n\n[b] If you want more reviews/information regarding games I've reviewed, visit my curator.

      "An okay game that wastes your time.\n\n\nI played on the hardest difficulty. For me there was a pretty big difficulty spike somewhere in chapter 6 or 7. Apparently I had been skipping on the battles earlier on and was a bit too low level. No problem, I had just unlocked skill trees for the characters, so some XP spending made things manageable. I had to try the map a few times, but once I downed a few mobs and gained some levels, all was going well. The objective was to kill all the enemies by certain time, and that's what I aimed to do. Except, once I'd killed all the enemies, the objective changed and I would've needed to trudge to the other side of the map and kill the boss as well. Yeah, fuck that.\n\n\nThe combat works round-by-round in speed order. If your characters go faster than the enemies, you can simply spam AoE attacks and kill droves of them before they go. If enemies are faster, you're kind of screwed because they hit hard, you're on the defensive, have to spend turns healing and cannot attack that much. And levels seem to make a huge difference here. Combat seems sort of poorly balanced in this respect; maps are hard at the beginning, but by the end just a joke because you gained a few points of speed and are now overall faster and can spam AoE attack and kill enemies in droves.\n\nThe user interface and usability is pretty archaic. For example, to get out of a menu you have to explicitly click on the button that says \"back\" instead of just clicking a right mouse button or Esc or whatever.\n\nThe writing was quite funny at times. It also seemed of a mixed quality. A lot of times it seemed clearly aimed at 13-year olds.  (Especially cringey are the first pair of \"combat helpers\" you get.) I also did play the game for a lot longer at once than I usually do. I think there's some kind of magical simplicity about it, and it's fun to play.\n\nIt's just, in general, the one thing I dislike the most is doing again the exact same thing that I just did. That's the developers' way of saying \"fuck you\" to me, and so I don't want to play this game anymore. If you don't mind that, and the game looks like something you'd like, then I don't doubt you'll like it. Don't get it for 20 moneys though. 15, perhaps... 10 yeah, sure. Because reading the reviews, the one thing many agree on is the later you get the more garbage the combat gets. So, in essence, you only have the visual novel aspect. And if you're not 13 anymore, I don't know. Play something else perhaps.",

      "Yeah sooooo I went 1k words past the max...had to pare this down...it's ok...I'm mentally stable...\n\nCrossCode is a top-notch indie in its genre. I'd mention it in the same breath as Celeste, Hades, and Outer Wilds. (guess I just did.) If you can at least enjoy both puzzles and real-time combat, this game is for you; it's not as much of a JRPG as it might look. The only real flaw I care to levy is that it isn’t incredible out of the gate; it’s merely good, and gets much better. I was going to summarize my reactions and add a \"what is the premise/gameplay loop\" section and have longer sections but I had to cut it all out so have _/5 ratings on the section titles instead. It's fine. I'm fine. Everything is fine.\n\nOk, review time.\n\nSTORY 4/5 NEATO\n\nThe story is great, and not quite what you might expect. It starts pretty light and cozy, with solid (and often meta) humor interspersed with cryptic moments. I like how casually the in-universe MMO is treated by the players. I enjoyed all the characters, including our mostly-mute but personable Lea. Once it ramps up, the story takes some exciting turns, too; the devs really know how to do drama without doing overdrama. I didn't relate too much to the story but I think it was told quite well. I like the portrayal of the antagonists for the most part, though I wish I could have felt their presence more often. The lore is also fascinating, if occasionally hard to grasp because the line between real and virtual is very thin due to the game’s particular premise. (The difference between real people and NPCs is sometimes unclear, for instance.) The ending was good, but I think the DLC epilogue wraps the game up far better.\n\nCOMBAT 5/5 WOWIE\n\nWhen you start out, combat feels almost hack-n-slashy. You can spam melee attacks and bullets for days, but you also have a charged projectile, a dodge-dash, and a shield. The elemental modes are absolutely the highlight due to the way enemies work, and the sort of limiter gauge they have forces strategy. Special moves are stylish and borderline absurd at higher levels. A huge skill tree controls them and much more; unlike some skill trees, this one requires choices, which is always a good sign. Oh and consumables are your main source of healing and buffs, and they aren't overpowered! Balancing win.\n\nThe enemies are really what make the combat fantastic. Almost every enemy has at least one gimmick and one visible weakness. The stun gauge mechanic is vital to all battles, forcing you to exploit those weaknesses to stun enemies and give you time to use your extra-long special moves. Bosses love to give you iterative micro-puzzles to fill their stun gauges, while minibosses are comfortably in-between. Bosses commonly have armor or invulnerability when not stunned, forcing even overleveled players to figure out the micro-puzzles to hit hard. (More great balancing.) Most weaknesses involve the element system, eventually encouraging you to swap elements multiple times mid-fight. The micro-puzzles will build on what you’ve been learning in a dungeon if it’s a dungeon fight. I'll mention that some normal enemies do feel like damage sponges at first, but you'll get used to this; the simple enemy design in the early game makes it seem worse than it is imo.\n\nPUZZLES 5/5 FUN COOL\n\nFor puzzles you've got your common environmental \"platforming\" puzzles, your specialized quest puzzles, your dynamic mini-puzzles in battles, and your iterative puzzling gauntlets in dungeons. Also almost everything is secretly part puzzle? Like, everything. They're an invasive species. They draw most of their complexity from the element system too. Each element has its own effects on certain objects and structures, and mainly you use charge shots to interact, though each attack has its own uses. Not much to say here; they're great puzzles. A couple may stump you for a while, but that's impossible to avoid, and I think CrossCode strikes a perfect challenge balance.\n\nQUESTS 5/5 WHEEEEEE\n\nWhile some quests conform to the typical hunting/gathering quests of MMOs, most boast some entirely unique content. Challenges range from unique bosses to puzzles to platforming to other familiar gimmicks that are secretly also puzzles. I won't spoil them. Quests generally use mechanics you have seen already in new, often very different, scenarios. NPCs are mostly there to be amusing or set up the gameplay, and that didn't bother me tbh.\n\nITEM MANAGEMENT 5/5 AAAAA\n\nItem and equipment acquisition? Engaging? WTF? Technically you get them like you do in any RPG. But, rare plants have high rare item drop rates, so if you know the platforming puzzle to reach em you don't have to waste much time. Enemies' drop rates rise with a high Combat Rank, which you get by killing many enemies in a row before the post-fight cooldown period ends and you get to heal to full and level up. This is tough until you're very comfortable with the area. Once you are, it's a whole new way of battling, using area knowledge to string together sequential fights. And what does the game do but give you a piece of upgradable equipment that grants the Combat Rating bonus to plants too?\n\nI actually cared about the equipment in the game too! *kisses Life Fiber Uniform* (yes they really make this reference) Equipment also matters more than level so the devs can control your power level better. Most times you can buy some basic equipment to explore, then return with items to trade to NPCs for stronger gear. Stronger gear has unique traits and you might prefer one over another, so it's nice that with trading you get to focus your resources on what you want. Sometimes you can trade some enemy drops for other ones, as I recall, which is a nice...uh, trade-off to get to make.\n\nQUALITY OF LIFE 5/5 HELP\n\nCONVENIENCE REIGNS in CrossCode. Text log like in visual novels? Check. Encyclopedia of story recaps, character summaries, CrossWorlds lore & terminology, etc.? Check. Enemy index? Check. Item drop rates? Check. Available trades? You beck. This is EXTREMELY helpful for an RPG, which otherwise would require a guide or plain luck to find rare item drops. Oh yeah also there's UI? I forgot about it cuz it's really good. Also the keyboard controls for swapping elements are a bit janky but I managed.\n\nAesthetics 3/5-5/5 SUBJECTIVITY WOOOOOO\n\nYeah if ya like what you see in the trailers and screenshots, that oughta be enough. I thought the art was average-good in the beginning, but like everything else the art improves as you go. They must’ve gone back and worked on old stuff, but not too much. The music is great. No complaints there. My one objective critique is, Lea has no depth perception -- the art makes similar-height platforms look identical. I ran into so many walls and stared at so many small flat gaps I thought I couldn't cross. I'm not a fool! It's the game's fault! But actually this time!\n\nA NEW HOME DLC 6/5 WTF OMG\n\nThe paid DLC is The Culmination of CrossCode. The epilogue is complex and fascinating and rewarding. The dungeon is an incredible all-elements send-off. I adore the new quests. And the art?? The environments, the enemies, the NPC portraits are all so pretty. Don't be fooled by the letters \"DLC\": this is not Discretionary Leisure Content. If you liked the base game, this is...Deluxe...eLite...C-content??? look these are not great letters to work with ok\n\nCONCDLUDSIONO\n\nWhat else to say? CrossCode good. Buy it. Do the thing. Also, look out for Project Terra, Radical Fish's next project. It translates their current style into a 3D environment with dynamic lighting. It’s pretty & it reduces that height perspective issue. There isn’t much info about it out yet, but keep your eyes out! (figuratively pls) I'm excited for what they'll come up with.\n\nHOLY **** I MADE IT AND WITH CHARACTERS TO SPARE YESSSS — ohnowai",
      "Did you like the first two chapters?\nWell, here we have everything and tons of new and improved things, like the 2nd chapter did with regards to the first one (which was awesome, but quite simple gameplay-wise).\nA classical turn-based strategy game, now more polished than ever with wave-like combats and tons of units to start with, to upgrade and well, we don't even have real classes here - more correctly, each hero is a class on its own and has different abilities and such.\nThe story follows always the same one-way saga and you'll have to make lots of choices determining your fate, your battles and so on; the graphics are the most beautiful I've ever seen here and the soundtrack is quite amazing and atmospheric too.\nYou'll have also many features like arena combat, and a great history re-telling if you don't remember the first two chapters, plus a great tutorial to start with even if you're not new to the series and the genre.\nIt's quite fundamental if you're a little bit interested in this awesome story to play the other chapters - here in fact we'll start with all the old heroes, all the story right back from the caravan that reached Arberrang.\nWe're basically reviewing one of the best strategy tactical turn-based role-playing games of the last 5-10 years and I won't add more than this, it has already thousands of reviews and mine is quite useless I think. \nLots of endings, lots of characters to explore and promote, lots of weapons, accessories, modes.. we have everything. Recommended to anyone (maybe with a little discount).",
      "They added \"Precision\" mode for the mouse under controls, which is pretty much raw mouse movement. YAY!\n\nAnyway, one of my favorite games of all time easily at this point. Incredible story, fun combat, and awesome world. A must play for sure, especially if you've never played it before on Play-Station (like me). It also has a New Game Plus mode that unlocks different NG+ only armor that are insane.\n\nI played at normal, and aside from the Valkyries the other bosses are a cakewalk. Maybe play on hard or hardest.",

      "Probaly the best game ive ever told people to hold back on\n\nIts fun, its rude, it's the best Southpark Game ever made, but its only a 10 to 14 hour game. Its a satisfying 10 hours mind you, i dont think i have played a game in recent memory good enough to hold me the way this game has, the atmosphere and envoriment just puts you right in a long southpark episode, and youll love every minute of it.\n\nSadly, there are not enough minutes of it for $59.99, and thats why i sadly don't recomend this excelent game.\n\nAnd to clarify, its 10 hours if you just take your time enjoying the story, its plausible to 100% this game in under 20 hours, and thats if you are in no hurry, with no game guide.",
      "Ib manages to do for me what so few horror games manage to accomplish, and that is to actually give a sense of unease and dread. Without going into spoilers, it's only a few minutes into the game that things start to tread the path of uncomfortable surrealism, with the art growing considerably more disturbing in how Ib interacts with it, and how the art interacts with her.\n\nWith all due respect to more conventional horror titles, say, Dead Space or The Evil Within, Ib maintains a feeling of dread and discomfort. Enemies can be evaded, yes, but there's a feeling of being stalked while trapped in a world you can't possibly fully understand. \n\nContrast Dead Space remake, where soon enough the horror gives way to cutting off an abomination's arm, then using telekinesis to impale it or another horror with said arm, then simply setting fire to the more mobile enemies.\n\nThis is not, I repeat, not to disrespect games in which reducing enemies to a smoldering heap of charred body parts is an acceptable tactic- there is a time and a place for the cathartic destruction of the nightmares that haunted our closets and lurked under our beds. Ib, however, leans firmly towards the horror and self-preservation of being in a hostile and unknown environment, where the only feasible option is to run, hide, and hope whatever nameless horror eventually loses track of you.\n\nAnd let's face it- some modern art galleries are creepy enough already, even in the daylight.\n",
      "Been playing now for 56 hours and love it apart from one thing.... too many press conferences! Seems like every other minute I'm told I'm due to go into a press meeting... so, apart from that, I'm enjoying the game. Have to confess as a 60 year old woman, I do cheat... have much fun creating a team, buying loads of top players and winning every match... so satisfying! Anyway, can't cope with the action games and find the pace of this right up my street. Have been playing since the original Championship Manager games back in the 90s so would call myself a fairly seasoned player!",
      "I had never played a Monster Hunter game before this, but World has definitely turned me into a fan. The fights are exhilarating, and I always feel like I'm making progress towards something- a new gear set, a cosmetic, an upgrade for the base, or even just filling out the monster guide. The environments are sprawling, beautiful, and full of opportunites to use the terrain against your foes. \n\nI have been playing the game entirely in co-op, with no issues after the first couple weeks. Playing story missions together is unintuitive, but only a minor inconvenience once you've figured it out. And story missions account for a very small amount of the content- this game is huge.",
      "Most of the negative reviews cover my complaints already. So I won't rehash the ones I've already read. \n\nHere's my biggest complaints: \n\n- Jumpscares have never been compelling to me. Doubly so on VR. Are you trying to injure me in my computer room? Stop. \n\n- Guns are fun. Not having ammo for them is not fun. (The game is pretty generous with ammo but it also encourages tediously conservative behavior, if you just unload clips at shit you'll run out pretty fast) \n\n- \"Continuous Turning\" feels so bad. Like, how can I turn my headset and everything looks smooth as butter, but as soon as I use the look stick for turning suddenly it's all choppy and looks wrong? I'm familiar with some of the motion sickness issues people get with turning in VR games, but this isn't that... \n\n\nThough honestly it seems like they just leaned really into the whole horror thing, which is fine, but also just super not my thing. \n\nIf the mechanics and some design choices had been better I might have slogged through it anyway. \n\n\nGame's beautiful, though, so they got that going for them.",

As others have said, it is an excellent cooperative multiplayer game with very satisfying controls, varied levels, and superb production values in art and audio.\n\nAside from these things, what stood out to me was the game's decency.  It is *anti*-exploitative, quite deliberately excluding features like collectibles (let alone microtransactions) or character advancement that are predicated on Skinner box treatment of the player.  Rather than finding ways to [i]take[/i] more from the player (money, time, etc.), the developers have found ways to [i]give[/i] more to the player, with many small delights to be found.  In addition to not exploiting the player, the game doesn't exploit its characters -- only very occasionally playing the cheap tropes that the game's set-up would tend to invite.  The game's narrative may lack subtlety and surprise, but its straightforward positive message never feels preachy, perhaps because the scenario is so ridiculous.\n\nIt is rare to play a big-budget game (the credits go on FOREVER!) that seems to have as its goal that players will find a fun, full, satisfying experience and go away better than they came.",
      "It's hard to review a game like this.\n\nAs a game in it's own right, if you've never played it before, it's a good game. Typical crazy Final Fantasy story (although it takes a bit to get into it), interesting characters, and simple but fun real-time turn-based combat. Final Fantasy games are known for their stories and characters, which are great in this member of the series.\n\nIf you've played the game before on PS1, then it's good for nostalgia. However, many people complain about it being a bad port. It has built-in cheats, in case you just want to be able to enjoy the story, characters, and side-quests. I played this years ago on PS1, and I really enjoyed my trip down memory lane with this game.\n\nIf you're an achievement hunter, this game is horrible. There are achievements that, unless you're literally following an online scripted step-by-step walkthrough, you will miss some random little thing, not know it, and then have to play the entire game over. Another achievement requires you to speed through the game in under 12 hours, which means you will grind through the game you already played, watching the same story you just watched, all over again, wasting six hours (that's how long it took me), just for the sake of one achievement... There's also another achievement to kill 10k enemies. when you can play the whole game and not even kill 1k enemies... You might think, \"oh they just want you to play the game through 10 times then\". No. It's 10k enemies in one playthrough. You run out of content, and have nothing to do, except grind battles, for literally dozens of hours. It's terrible.\n\nDespite my bitterness about the achievements, it's a really enjoyable game. Considering the FF series are mainly known for their stories, it lives up to its reputation. If you're an RPG fan, this is definitely on the list of \"must plays\".",
      "I've read some of the negative reviews and name calling is petty so instead I'll just say a lot of those opinions are dumb.\n\nLook. This isn't Firewatch. This is a seven year old game that pissed off a lot of bros and continues (apparently, christ) to do so because it embraced not only being a walking simulator but a gay one at that. And yeah bro, 15 bucks seems steep for a game that you can finish in under an hour, but hell, maybe don't speed run? It's a walking simulator after all. Or maybe support indie game devs. *Or maybe* read the Steam tags that say \"short\" and \"walking simulator\" and then don't count that against the game. You don't review CS;GO and say \"not bad, but too much shooting\" right? RIGHT? \n\nLook. I've had some wine. And I've had some feelings. And Gone Home is a piece of video game history whether people want it to be or not. It's a game I wish I would have known about when it was first released. Hell I needed it five years earlier than that. \n\nIf you're pissed that Gone Home wasn't dramatic enough or that it's \"homosexual\" then maybe realize that this game wasn't made for you and that does not qualify it as bad. \n\nAnyway, that cat journal achievement was neat.",

I can't describe it, I feel like I found my heart again, and I didn't even know it was lost.  Life was comfortable before 2:00pm today . . . now it's magical.  It's these small things that I forget, and remember, and then forget again . . . the birth of my son, the feeling of nervous sweetness on my first date with my wife, an unexpected comment from a random stranger about my eyes, finding an old photo of my dad that no one ever remembered taking --\n\n-- This game is like that sweet, fleeting memory.\n\nTL;DR:  45-year old man cries after finding his heart lost in a game, and writes a review while his wife asks him if he's okay.\n\n11/10, would purchase these feels again.",

      "[h1]Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Save scumming is a game-play mechanic and the game is balanced around the player being able to quick-save and reload whenever they want.\n[*] The game seems highly objective oriented, and I wish there was more optional treasures to collect, as I am a pirate.\n[*] While many guard situations appear to have a clear solution,  you can always just brute-force your way through or take another less contrived route, so the game doesn't devolve into a stealth puzzle game.\n[*] Post-game summary shows your route and enemy eliminations at hyper speed, and is always a fun watch at the end of a level.\n[/list]\nI really enjoy finally having a top-down style stealth game. Games such as Hard West and Divinity: Original Sin 2 also featured stealth elements but they were sorely lacking in favor of the turn based combat of the game.

      "I'm gonna be talking about the game in very broad strokes so don't worry about spoilers. \n\nI'm bananas about the Dead Space series. The experience of playing the original in 2009 or so left a massive impression on me and I think this is overall a pretty fantastic update. I've played the original [strike] trilogy [/strike] duology to death on every system, listened to stuff, looked at stuff, everything. So as someone who has Nicole's monologue burnt into the back of my eyelids, I was pretty sceptical Motive would be able to win me over with Dead Space 23. I was very pleasantly surprised, though. It's clear a lot of love and care went into refining Dead Space for the remake and in many ways I find these refinements make the setting, characters, and mysteries all a lot more compelling. \n\nOn the lead up to release there was an IGN series of short interviews with developers, artists, writers, etc working on the remake. It was really fascinating hearing about how they were approaching different aspects of the project, there's a lot of interesting insights about the aesthetic and thematic goals of the game in there that get me really craving a Dead Space 23 art book. If you're sceptical about Dead Space 23, I think they're worth a watch. It's really striking how thoughtful they've been in creating their take on Dead Space and I don't think their efforts deserve to go so easily overlooked. If you're really interested in the artistry of the series I'd also highly recommend The Art of Dead Space, it's a great book and an amazing collection of art that really lays bare the core identity of the series. It's been a great companion piece to Dead Space 23.  I think a lot of people have been comparing the choices and artistic aims of the original team and the new devs in bad faith, I really can't see anything but reverence for the source material here. I'd also say that the differences that are there are interesting and well worth exploring!\n\nI'm also glad Dead Space has room to breathe again, EA really pushed the extended universe the first time around and I'm glad to see that mistake hasn't been repeated. I'm not someone who's super into lore, I like finding extra information that re-contextualises things in cool ways but this extended universe stuff can get pretty silly. There were animated movies, books, tie-in games, a Wii rail shooter (which I enjoyed) and most of it just served to undermine the setting and the horror for me. That isn't to say the remake shies away from its roots because it absolutely doesn't, there's an entire New Game+ path that I think incorporates a direct reference to one of the extended universe novels. If you're a lorehead you'll definitely recognise familiar names in text logs, even very forgettable characters get some mentions in. I really love this about the remake, it reincorporates a lot of this disparate stuff into more of a coherent whole. \n\nI think my favourite addition is the AI director that manages encounters and atmospheric effects. Dead Space is a game that invokes hypervigilance, I think that's part of what makes the series so compelling. You're always alert, always listening and watching, always looking over your shoulder. It has an intensity that I feel is absolutely unmatched. With the AI director in the mix that feeling is sharper than ever. You can't rely on memory alone to get you through now. Yeah, you can still memorise spawns and there are still an abundance of scripted encounters but you can never safely bet you know what's coming and when. Sometimes the lights will flicker and steam will hiss from the pipes- nothing. But sometimes a pregnant and most of a divider will be waiting for you right by the shop. You can truly never assume you're safe, that feeling is no longer illusory as it was in Dead Space 2008. I think that's great. I also found that the director would spawn interesting combinations of enemy types which is cool, it went a long way to making the threat more unpredictable. \n\nI never really experienced any of the performance issues everyone else is talking about so I think my main issue with the game is very petty. I flat out do not like the redesign of the Soldier rig. They look like those guys who're really into Mandalorian themed tactical gear and Punisher stuff. So, yeah, not sure if that's an intentional update to reflect reality but, aesthetically speaking, I found it very jarring. \n\nI think this is a very solid foundation to build on to bring back the Dead Space series. I hope in the future there might be more challenge modes, higher difficulties, more unlockable suits. Most of all though I hope Motive, like their predecessors, take some pointers from the Resident Evil games. I'm a big fan of the records system in the recent Resident Evil titles. It contributes enormously to replayability and it's neat getting to examine all the models, animations, concept art, all the good stuff. As someone who likes crafts and fan projects, something like that would be indispensable. it's all work that very much deserves to be admired, too. Some of the detail on the necromorphs is ludicrous. A records system would also be a great excuse to do wild runs like beating the game without healing or opening the shop. Just give me a reason, Motive.\n\nThere are thousands of things about this remake that I could just keep gushing about. Maybe I'll update this review over time and do just that (I have). But I hope for now this review has gone some way to convincing you to try out Dead Space. \n\nTanya Clarke killed it as Nicole, too.",
      "the game itself is pretty ok and fun for what it is, and runs great on deck. but man, F**K THE ALWAYS-ONLINE-DRM WHICH AT TIMES TAKES AGES TO CONNECT, GETTING THE GAME STUCK IN THE MENU WITH NOTHING TO DO!!\n\n>> Update after 20h played:\nI really enjoy playing the game. It is good, it is fun and runs great on the Steam Deck, which is especially important to me, as I tend to travel a lot as part of my job.\n\nThat being said, however, is core of the issue: The Always-On-DRM actually prevents me from playing this game on the go. Having this sort of DRM is, in my opinion, only predatory and inexcusable in any way. I get that the online-components of the game will not work when I am on the move, but I am mainly interested in the single player experience, from which I am also locked out. I am even locked out of the main menu without a stable internet collection, which is just ridiculous.",
      "Okay so,\n\nFirst off, the Streaming of the game play yesterday did this title zero favours. Whoever made the decision to allow a copy of the game which was 400 builds behind to be live streamed made a mistake.\n\nThe character creation is a nice touch, makes you think and get involved with it characteristics of the nation you pick to play as. I like this and rarely see stuff like this in game.\n\nThe Steam page states 'SuperPower 3 is tailor-made for all the megalomaniacs out there who are convinced they can do a much better job at running the world than real politicians and military leaders across the globe'. That's a rather bold statement for a game that has 5 or 6 laws you can change for a whole country...., \n\nOverall the game in its current state is incredibly basic and lacks any depth in regards to the actual management and running of a country. No parliaments behind a leader etc, why? Even the excuse of the focus is around you and your characters decisions doesn't make much sense. It takes away the feeling of running a country, that which you are describing in the games description. Where are the ministers, the scandals that come with the running of a country?\n\nThe game isn't a write off, I personally feel it will be good in time but looks to be missing alot. Overall 5/10.

Shame I didn't have a PS4.\n\nThe game had a multiplayer release on Xbox, and when I first heard about it, I bought a copy instantly, finally ready to experience the game on PC.\n\nI'm not exaggerating when I say that buying this game actually changed my life.\nWhen I bought this game I not only got to play one of my favorite games in a completely unique experience, but I managed to find an amazing community to boot. Since then, I've accomplished so much in the game, befriended lots of people, and managed to change several aspects of myself.\n\nThis game has been a perfect mixture of visual, auditory, and emotional presentation, and it's given me tons of inspiration for multiple projects.\n\nIf you're shrugging this game off as \"just Tetris\", please take a look at a playthrough. Calling this game \"just Tetris\" is a massive injustice to the creativity, effort, love, and time that the development team have put into this.\n\nI have been following this game for nearly a year now.

It's absolutely inexcusable that the Marvel Snap servers cannot link to a unique Steam account without needing to link a gmail.\n\nAside from these massive issues, the gameplay is quite fun. However, the UI is a straight mobile port and needs a total overhaul. It also demonstrates a lot of the annoyances of mobile games, such as constant rewards and notifications littered all over the UI pointing you to those rewards.\n\nIf you can look past some very serious issues, as stated above, the game is very enjoyable.",
      "I wish there were a \"mixed\" option for recommending this game, as I think for a lot of people out there, this is a fantastic game, and it's definitely well made with a lot of love and attention to detail in many respects. I really like puzzles and problem solving, so part of my disappointment with The Witness is that I really thought I would enjoy the game. Myst was one of my favorite games growing up, and I was extremely excited to see a well-reviewed game in the Myst genre surface after far too long. \n\nThe problem for me was that The Witness is very much a game about the journey, and not the destination. It turns its head on the genre as it's less a game about solving puzzles within a set of rules, and more about discovering what those rules are. And for the most part, it does that well. Instead of the usual game conventions, rewards for solving hard puzzles weren't any kind of story unlock, more just to give you a harder puzzle. That approach was fun for awhile, but some story unlock would've been appreciated, especially because there is so much mystery and it's such an immersive world that was clearly built for a reason and has a fascinating backstory. \n\nSome of the mechanics also just seem arbitrary, or at the very least, not quite obvious enough. Sometimes perspective puzzles require you to either take a screenshot or jot down on pencil and paper the answer, then transfer it on screen. That seems like lazy game design and worst of all, takes you out of the immersive experience. It's possible I'm mostly tone deaf, as some of the sound puzzles seemed almost impossible to me, despite numerous listens. There's also just the repetitiveness of the \"pathfinding\" puzzles, which range from challenging (and satisfying) to punitive in their difficulty spikes. It's in these difficulty spikes where I think the core game mechanic of pathfinding lets you down, as it requires you to be much more of a planner than a \"hands on\" problem solver. In a game like this, I would think it would accommodate multiple approaches, but really there's a right way to approach this game, and a wrong way. Unfortunately for me, I think the way I approach puzzles (trial and error) is strongly discouraged, at times in punitive ways. \n\nThe philosophy from the audio/video portions will likely be appreciated by some, and for some come off as the worst kind of douchey-hipster nonsense. Had they been delivered in shorter pieces, I might've fallen into the former. But as rambling as some of them are, I found them more annoying than enjoyable unfortunately. \n\nI don't know, I'm really torn on this. It's a well made game, and while it seems so open and non-confined, I found the game to be far too linear in mechanics and how to approach problem solving. At times it actually made me feel like a lesser thinker because I have a different approach to puzzles than what the game designer prefers. What I'm sure is a really fun journey for some, left me disappointed with the destination. \n\nAm realizing this reads a lot like an apology for not liking this game, which I think it is. I really, really wanted to love The Witness, but in the end, not only was this game not for me, but I genuinely feel lesser for that fact because I feel like I should have loved it, and just didn't.",

      "At a first glance I thought I would hate [b]Human Fall Flat[/b]. \n“Oh, this is another one of those wonky psychics ragdoll games that are obnoxiously hard to control,” I thought. \n...\nAfter playing it, I can now confidently say that my first impression was spot on. The only surprise was how much I enjoyed playing it. \n \n[h1][u]Positive:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]I can’t fully explain why but I found Human Fall Flat charming. The “human” is adorably simplistic and can complete daunting tasks despite only being able to jump and grab onto things. It reminds me of a very energetic toddler, especially when you raise your arms and jump - [b]it’s so cute[/b]. Something about an awkward “human” taking on challenges makes me feel warm inside [i](is it weird that I feel like I’m watching a baby grow up?)[/i]. \n[*]The levels gradually get larger and the puzzles more complex. I find that this works well with the awkward movements of your character, as you progressively learn how to better control him/her. It’s almost as if you start off as a clumsy baby, learning how to move and perform simple tasks, and end up as an awkward adult, still clumsy but expected to complete harder tasks. \n[*]I’m impressed at how many interactable objects are included in this game. Paired with a pretty good physics engine and you can really have a blast. Swing on a vine like Tarzan? Why not. Row a boat? Sure. Shoot yourself out of a catapult? No one’s stopping you.\n[/list]\n\n[h1][u]Neutral:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]It’s not always clear what you are expected to do, but I guess that’s kind of the point of Human Fall Flat? From what I could tell, you can get past the obstacles in whatever way you like. Sure, there’s the intended way, but if you want you can just climb over things and rush to the end of the level. Or you can just fool around to your heart’s content. It’s essentially one big playground with a goal at the end. \n[/list]\n\n[h1][u]Negative:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]It can be frustrating when things don’t go as you expect. Since your character has the structural rigidity of jelly, you’re constantly battling the floppiness of your character. My advice is: don’t expect to move with precision and you’ll have a good time. I also encountered a few bugs, like my arms or legs getting stuck in an object. Luckily there are many checkpoints and it’s relatively quick to reload.\n[/list]\n \n[h1][u]Conclusion:[/u][/h1]\n[h1]★★★✬☆ Surprisingly fun[/h1]\nI was honestly surprised at how much fun I had playing Human Fall Flat. I tend to avoid ragdoll/physics-y games - Getting Over It, for example, looks like an absolute nightmare to me - but I don’t regret playing Human Fall Flat at all. \nHuman Fall Flat is an absolute blast if you don’t take it too seriously or just like goofing around. I wouldn’t recommend it if you prefer serious games, as it’s very likely that you will just end up getting frustrated.

      "A criminally underrated game, I have seldom seen a developer take their original hit which was already almost perfect, and actually manage to improve on it in every way shape and form. You do not need to have played the original to play or enjoy this game. Their stories are completely seperate.\n\nThe game itself is much less linear than its predecessor. The best way I can explain the feeling of going through the environments without referencing Grimrock itself is by saying it felt an awful lot like Myst to me, just with combat. Required puzzles for progression were challenging but not impossible, some of the secret challenges were much more difficult. I admit I used an online guide more than a few times, but it did nothing to diminish my enjoyment of the game. It is immersive, challenging, and satisfying. \n\nThe only drawback I can think of is the difficulty. It feels like you cannot win with any group composition, I suggest no more than 2 of any class or weapon/armor type user. I went with a warrior, two rogues(one range), and a mage, this way you as well makes you unlikely to complete a difficult fight or puzzle and be rewarded with something you cannot use. Combat itself can be challenging as I said, but you will rarely feel like you are simply incapable of winning. There are obvious ways to optimize the way you approach an encounter the second time if you die the first.\n\nBe prepared to immerse yourself, you must pay attention to your surroundings, read and remember notes you find, explore every nook and cranny you can find, and you will be rewarded. Good luck!\n",

      "I'll make this quick.\n\nThis game has been amazing fun so far.\n\nLiving in a clan is definitely a unique thing for farming sims, and it even helps with the gameplay. You're not working for yourself in Roots of Pacha - you're working for the betterment of your tribe. The better you do, the better everyone does and visa versa. \n\nI love exploring to find new seeds, herbs, animals and materials... I actually find myself staying up until nearly 2am in game almost every day because of that. \n\nThe npcs seem to be an interesting bunch too, but I have to say that I've yet to see many events with them. This is something that I'm looking forward to though because the writing has been enjoyable so far too. \n\nIts my opinion that if you're an enjoyer of \"cozy\" games like Animal Crossing, Stardew Valley, Coral Island and  others like them, you'll likely enjoy Roots of Pacha as well. I've been telling my friends they should check it out.",

      "To be completely honest, throughout my entire playthrough, I was thinking on giving this game a \"Not Recommended\" but it really wouldn't have deserved it. This game is at the same time both very difficult to recommend as to not recommend. It is really a beatiful and extremely original game, with a pretty well told interesting story. However, the problem it has is that it doesn't really work as a puzzle game. Puzzle solutions don't make logical sense most of the time and you end up brute forcing your way through most of the game. This means trying every posibility until something works and moves the story foward, and this is just not good puzzle design. This also distracts you from the story being told, which is in itself not so easy to understand, it requirers you to be paying attention to details, so your brain has to be constantly switching between \"puzzle mode\" and \"story mode\". Anyway, you can tell a lot of love was put into this game, and that is why I ultimately recommend it.\n7.5/10-",
      "probably the first game on steam with tags 'gore' and 'puzzle' :) \nand if gore and puzzles are your thing, you will enjoy this game..a lot :)",
      "Was a bit turn off when I saw it was a stationary shooter, but the game is so fun I look past that and even began to enjoy the room scaling dodging mechanics (game can make you work up a sweat!).\n\nA must for anyone looking for a more intense arcade shooting experience. I cannot overstate how fun it is to build your weapons in VR, the crafting system works flawlessly and seemely without the need of menus or UIs getting in the way, props for the devs for how well the game integrates with VR controls.\n\nWhat I liked:\n- Varied enemies\n - Great VR controls\n- Gun crafting is addicting and allows for a lot of experimentation\n- Great Bosses\n\nWhat I had trouble with:\n- Makes you wish you could run around the rooms like the original game!\n- The reduced FOV of most VR headsets makes it quite difficult to keep track of enemies that come from multiple directions. Some rooms require so much head movement that I tend to get sick.\n- When a room spawns with multiple shield pylons and a healer bot, it gets extremely frustrating if you have slow moving projectile weapons.\n\nWishes:\n- More gun parts! (Maybe future DLC?)",
      "majority of the negative reviews are from people who dont have controller and are to lazy to remap the controls\nit takes 5 minutes to remap and theres one too many buttons for the mouse\noveral gameplay 10/10 reminds me of when i was 7 playing dynasty warriors 4, i havent experienced any bugs unlike one piece, also you get to set the characters weapons to whatever you want thats awesome\nPORT WARRIORS OROCHI 2 AND 3",
      "Overrated. \n\n\nFirst half of the game is amazing. You start out with nothing, enter a mine and slowly progress, get new tools, upgrade existing ones and collect resources for one of the progression types. Platforming and digging smart (so you don't lock yourself out of resources) is a huge part of the opening experience. \n\nLater in game you get a grappling hook and rocket shoes and that's when the game loses its identity. The the game shifts its focus towards puzzles and platforming while making you deal with hordes of annoying enemies. Mining no longer requires any attention and becomes more of a chore. Most tiles become impossible to break. Most enemies have gimmicks that make them a nuisance. Areas where you'll spend most time have mostly unbreakable tiles. Even if you find destructible ares, hook and rocket shoes ensure you don't have to think too much (unlike in first half of the game).",
      "please don't give an ironic positive review for this \"game\". It truly deserves the tag of \"overwhelmingly negative\" reviews.",
      "[h1] A BETTER MINECRAFT, AND I WILL TELL YOU WHY[/h1]\nwith terrain deformation and creation, crafting etc its only normal that the first comparison that comes to mind is with minecraft.

      "I really, really wanted to like this game.\n\nI preface this review by saying that Guacamelee 1 is in my top 10 games of all time. I've been a gamer for 33 years. Sotn, Chrono Trigger, and FFVII are my go-tos. G-Melee 1 is a charming and original romp through a metroidvania style genre.\n\nGuacamelee 2 fails so ridiculously hard, it actually makes me sad when I think about it. The puzzles are uninspired, the abilities don't really feel enjoyable, and the platforming elements are just unforgivingly tight for the sake of it. I had all the \"schools\" maxed out before the end, it didnt make me feel any more powerful. I didn't have that super saiyan mode like in GM 1.\n\nThe final bossfight is a 3/10 compared to the first game where it is at BARE MINIMUM 9/10.\n\nI wish I could rank this game higher because I adore the original. However, this became a slog several hours before I could finish it. I would not recommend this to anyone, ever. It's light on the humor and story, it requires you to be invested in the previous game. The mechanics aren't new and they threw in some unnecessary tight, like razor thin, platforming into the game.",
      "imagine a AAA-RPG game in 2021 w/o game breaking bugs.\n\nonly problem i have with this game is the monetization aka MTX, you can buy Gald, boost items, straight up level ups etc, i personally do not care if a game has those buyable options or not HOWEVER when you constantly get it shoved in your face it's suuuuper annoying, start up the game, ! symbol on the main menu, leading to... yes the steam store, if this would be the only encounter i'd still be fine with it but it isn't, rest on bonfires and you have yet another icon with the ! symbol trying to get you to buy any of the boosters or outfits or whatnot.\n\ngenerally speaking this game is fantastic, soundtrack, graphics, VAs, cutscenes etc. however the MTX ads in the game that remind me more of the \"hey click this\" approach of mobile games is horrible, should have kept it in the main menu but keep it out of my actual gameplay.",

      "When I show new games to one of my friends she always asks if it is possible to pee in the game and sadly I usually must tell her that it isnt possible because there is so few games where this special detail is being paid attention to. But this here my dude! I tried to show her the game yesterday so I got her setup on the valve index and start the game all good, but we couldn’t move at all... We tried everything! We tried physically move in our vr room to see the boards that had text written on them because we spawned behind them which I found a little weird as well. On the board it said eat the hamburger to start the game or eat the poo to guit. I saw a box on the street and I remembered by seeing the trailer there was a box where inside there was a burger so immediately we worked hard to try and reach the burger so we could start the game. It was too far away for us to try and actually in real life walk to it so we had to just accept defeat. She didn’t get to see her first vr game where it would be possible to urinate. I saw a update post a few minutes ago where you were saying something about movemnet in the game that you have to grip and throw arms around or something? This I guess we didn’t try since usually moving is one of the triggers to teleport or just the stick like in any controller. Today we will try again and hopefully succeed in our task to urinate in a vr game! You could be making history today my friend. And for all the bad reviews for this game I want to just say a couple things: cmon dude. Its one guy whos making this game! It is cheap and early access... those already tell you a lot about the game and you should not expect a triple a title and the experience of the century. I went through a video game making school or whatever which took 3 years so it was not 2 weeks online course I just quit after the first week so I actually know a lot what it takes to make games and with this I can tell there has been some hours used to it, but again it’s only one dude. My game didn’t work either, but it might have been because we didn’t know how to play. I’m not complaining for 4 dollars, I’m not a hobo ;)\n\nEDIT: And there it is! A day after my review and a 170mb update with new features and a fix for not been able to play at all :) I wasn't able to walk earlier either, but I suppose yo may not be able to in the \"mainmenu\". Gotta go try the update once my friend visits again!",
      "WTF, this isn’t gaming! Where are my lootboxes and micro transactions?!\n\nMy main thought after I beat GRIS was, \"I don't really understand anything that just happened, but it sure was pretty.\"\n\nI was absolutely amazed how a game with zero actual dialogue could move me to tears, just on strenght of its visuals and music. In general, the whole theme of dealing with grief/depression spoke to me in a way that I didn't expect.  It's one of those games you play to \"feel\" more than for the gameplay itself.\n\nI have PTSD from dealing with my wife getting a boyfriend, and this game made me cry several times while playing it. Especially during the scene where you're swimming away from the eel. That symbolism to me perfectly captures the feeling of trauma recovery. I'd spent time finding the little lights throughout that section of the game and activating the turtle which ultimately saved me from my own darkness and helplessness.\n\nIt felt like hope. It was such a good representation of how the coping skills I'd learned and the hard work I'd put in were finally seeming to pay off. It's when you're at your weakest that you learn how strong you actually are. I cried like a baby during and after that scene. It made me realize how much I've actually overcome, and how grateful I am to be free.\n\nGris truly is a beautiful game and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a slow paced experience. The only bit of criticism I have for the game is it certainly gives \"not like the other girls\" vibes at times, but I think this is quite easy to get over.\n\nIn conclusion: the visuals are stunning,  the music is beautiful and knows exactly when to kick in, the platforming elements are fantastic, and it’s story and themes are spectacular without a single word. Truly a must-play.\n\n10/10",
      "Full disclosure: I'm not a racing guy. I'm not a car guy, even. My extent of car knowledge begins and ends at \"vroom-vroom go that way.\"\n\nBut that's all you need to know for this game. I can tune the holy bejeezus out of a million sliders that mean absolutely nothing to me, or I can just equip a premade setting by someone who does and suddenly the vroom-vrooms are *better*. Not sure when to brake or start a turn? Easy, there's a friendly line. Follow the line, make less vroom-vrooms when it's red, everything's gravy. Don't have the reaction time to follow the line? You can slow the game down until it's at a pace where you can. Incredible.\n\nYou can be as serious as you want with it. Me, I'm taking my van that's dolled up to look like the Mystery Machine and ramping it off a volcano.",
      "1 week before release i played the demo, it was a 20 minutes demo that was very underwhelming, but i still thought i should give the game a chance to see if it gets better later on.\n\nIt doesn't.\n\nSo the first thing i read about this game in the embed of the steam link was \"a fresh take on the jrpg genre\", and its probably the biggest problem of the game. It is really the most basic, mediocre turn base combat you can find.\n\nTurn base combat, rock paper scissor elemental types plus physical, materia base skills with few spots (i had only 4 skills activated),  no gear, no party. Does that sound like a fresh take to you?\n\nSo if the gameplay is so barebones it means is at least hard right? Well no, it is basic and easy. The start is easy, in the mid part they blow up the HP of enemies so you understand you should buy new skills, and once you do it the game is easy again. Mob enemies are generally harder than bosses because you are 1vs3 most of the time, while in bosses you can just debuff it and make it slow, while you have 2 turns to spam healings and hitting. There also some questionable decisions on the minor mechanics of the combat system but i don't think they matter (see some paragraphs below)\n\nNow here is what is really the \"fresh take\": the setting being cyberpunk. Everything is written with tech terminology. The mana is called data, block and delay turn is called cache, melee combat is called hack? some of the terms don't even make sense of what they actually do. Also because we obviously live in a technological society we have people called \"V-sync\" or \"Nullpointer\", expresions like \"Digits!\" or \"Oh my grind!\", you know, normal behaviour if you ask me.\n\nThe story is pretty standard for a futuristic setting, it wasn't bad but also it wasn't good, pretty normal.\n\nThe artstyle is cool, the music is generally cool, which i think its why most people would don't mind the boring gameplay and will just play for the story, which is also present in the game itself because you have options to either skip every random encounter (yeah we have those here) or to insta win every battle when you want it.\n\nSo if you want to try this game because of the \"fresh take in the jrpg genre\" you will be disappointed, if you have played jrpgs before there is nothing new in this game, you have already played it before.",
      "Remember when Doom 2016 released the multiplayer beta test first, and we rightfully worried the game would be a flop? Thankfully, the campaign instead blew us away.\n\nI enjoyed my first run through 2016, but only moderately so. In the original Dooms, if you never stop moving, enemies truly can never hit you. With 2016, however, enemies lead their shots if you move predictably. Also, if you leave line of sight, the demons will fire several more predict shots, in case you re-engage from the same vantage point.\n\nI failed to adapt initially. Instead, I blamed the game, claiming it felt unfair compared to the originals.\n\nThen, I stumbled upon Clockner's playthrough of Doom. He showed me a skill ceiling I never dreamed possible. Next came ByteMe's speedrun performance at QuakeCon 2019. I noticed when the demons charged their shots, he would at times hold still and bait for them to aim before dodging at the last second.\n\nThe excuses were off. Doom has transformed after 25 years. The enemies are now more intelligent (yet not overly so). I too needed to evolve.\n\nAs I took on my Ultra Nightmare run (over 3-4 months), I developed a deep knowledge of every level, and in the process, became fond of every inch, as if the entire UAC and Hell were my homes. UN felt like such an accomplishment. After that, I tried to take on an all runes/weapons/challenges mastered run (no grinding). I failed the first two times. With Eternal around a day or two away, I just completed this challenge on my third try. Personally, I leave satisfied with nothing left.\n\nI initially had gripes with 2016, only to learn the developers were one step ahead. When a team/game proves me wrong, I am loyal forever.\n\nDoom 2016 will now be uninstalled from my machine, never again to be reinstalled. May your thirst for blood never quench. And may we never need you again.\n\nTo me, Doom 2016 is also Eternal 🙏.",
      "I had to purchase Scarlet Hollow after witnessing the excitement of Episode 4 through my friends. I immediately binged the first three episodes the following day and found myself and in rather different spot compared to their playthrough. The choices you make in SH are actually impactful - which is (unfortunately) quite refreshing for the genre! I've since run through several different routes to explore more of the story (and collect those achievements!). While you have the ability to skip through previously seen text, lines within replayed conversations are shaped by your selected traits, choices, and previously selected dialogue; you won't be skipping that many lines before seeing new content. Similarly, characters may be painted in an entirely different light based on choices you've made. The cast and writing truly nails the small town feel of SH (gossip and all). \n\nMake sure you eat the takeaway container in the fridge. Thank me later.",

      "An interesting experience for RPGMaker vidya enthusiasts.\n\nBefore you pick up this title, be sure to download and play the demo, as the demo is the (free) first episode of the series, this game being the second episode.\n\nA Psychological Thriller, as stated in the description, is probably the best way to describe this series, an adventure through bizzare yet oddly pretty settings.\n\nThe first episode is quite a fun, humorous adventure, but still manages to be gripping and gut-wrenching in some areas. Difficult for me to describe in words, but it's free, so there's no reason not to play it.\n\nThe second episode strays from the fun, humorous side of things and focuses more on story, an unexpected yet completely welcome change of tone. If you enjoyed the first and got to like the characters, the second episode is well worth the price.\n\nFeel free to pick it up if it seems interesting to you.",
      "First off, just want to say this isn't a Metroidvania. This is a Zelda clone. And a good one!\n\nI bought this game because I heard it really put stress on you. You have limited time to complete the game and NPCs will begin dying if you aren't fast enough. Pretty crazy, right? Well, I do have a few gripes with that, but let me point out the good stuff first:\n+ Amazing combat. You have access to both guns and swords, but most of your damage will likely come from melee weapons since they have the ability to do an extremely-easy-to-pull-off PARRY! Parrying an enemy stuns it and gives your next attack against it a massive damage multiplier. All enemies, all bosses, and most projectiles are parryable, so this is what combat ends up revolving around. Even though I call it easy, you still get that cool feeling when you walk into an ambush and clear it without taking a hit, so it never gets dull as you go through the game.\n\n+ Good dungeon design. Since this game takes after Zelda, it's not shy about inserting a few puzzles into its dungeons. The overworld as well has quite a few surprising secrets and side quests that you won't be expecting when you play for the first time.\n\n+ Sequence breaks. This is mostly for New Game+ (or New Game Extra, a separate mode where you have access to major exploration items from the start, but not your whole endgame inventory), but it was interesting to find out how many secret paths and shortcuts there were, and how tightly they were managed. The devs thought of everything!\n\nSo now for the bad stuff.\n- Underwhelming story. Guess how much is really explained over the course of this story. If you guessed \"all of it\", you would be completely wrong and here's your dunce hat. Unsighted ends up spending so much of its time on the protagonist's relationships that it fails to answer several of the more important questions concerning the game's backstory. Why was there was a war? Who started it? Where are the humans now? Why are they so disorganized? Why do they seem to have no chain of command whatsoever? How did the automatons ever win anything at all at any point when they seem so extremely outclassed? I guess it doesn't matter. Look, there's two robot-girls kissing.\n\n- Fake pressure. I heard there was going to be pressure before I started the game, so I decided to go DEFCON 1 from the get-go and rush everything. I ended up completing the game in 10 in-game days and I felt pretty good about it. Zero NPC deaths! Zero! I'm a super awesome amazing hero, right? Well, credits roll and... the only achievement I get is the one for beating the game. No one really cares and apparently you're meant to play through multiple times anyway. So... why did I ever care? Why is this mechanic even in the game? All it did was make me shy away from general exploration and side quests since all of those things are less important than, ya know, saving the world. You can call that interesting, but when it has no payoff, it ends up being frustrating.\n\n- No post-game. Did I mention, if you bumrush the game and finish with just hours left on everyone's timers, you don't get to do any extra no-timer exploring afterwards? No, the game's over. Load the save and you get set back to where you were before fighting the final boss. If you want to do any actual exploring, that's what \"Explorer\" mode is for. You know, that mode that makes you feel like you're cheating?\n\nBasically, Unsighted is another game filled with missed opportunities. I recommend this game because the core gameplay and level design is very well done and very well executed, but you should probably know this before you start:\n\nThe only pressure here is the one you imagine. Since the game does nothing to acknowledge your successes, just play it at your own pace and don't be shy about using Explorer. Shame on the devs for hailing the agony of defeat, but not the thrill of victory.",
      "The only marginally interesting or entertaining part of this game is it's history.\n\nJanuary 15, 2015: It's sold under the name of H1Z1. It was marketed as an open world zombie survival game, akin to DayZ. I bought it for 20$. The game does not run.\n\nAfter a time, they release a new gamemode; King of the Kill. It's a battle royale mode, made specifically because PLAYERUNKNOWN made a hugely successful battle royale mod for the game but then split off to make his own game (PUBG).\n\nFebruary 5, 2016: KOTK is doing well, so they split it off from the game, both of them costing 20$. They silently abandon the original game, only doing small feature updates and adding nothing but bugs. H1Z1 (The survival game.) is renamed to H1Z1 Just Survive.  KOTK is renamed H1Z1: King of the Kill. Not long after they rename H1Z1 Just Survive to simply Just Survive (Which sounds like a terrible 3$ app game.) and rename H1Z1 King of the Kill to just H1Z1. (H1Z1 Battle Royale on consoles.) Development of the original survival game, \"Just Survive\", is still mostly halted.\n\nOctober 24, 2018: Just Survive, the survival game i paid for, is shut down. The game is removed from my, and everyone else's steam library, with no refund. KOTK, or H1Z1, or H1Z1 Battle Royale...or...whatever the crap they named it, is shut down as well, and re-published and renamed as a different game, Z1 Battle Royale, obviously done to alienate the game from it's wretched history.\n\nThe kicker? It's free. Also, it's still called H1Z1 Battle Royale on consoles, and when Z1 BR is run, the window is named H1Z1. \n\nThey made a game said it was like DayZ. It didn't even work. Then they simply deleted it from my library with no refund. Z1 BR is dead, it garners about 3 active players. They actually, legitimately built a fake game and then deleted it for money.\n\nUtterly disgusting development team. When everyone said the original game was going down in flames due to terrible updates, horrible balancing fix attempts that only worsened the balance, and endless amounts of bugs spilling into the game, i sat there, with hope. This is what i got.\n\nThey said the original H1Z1 was originally going to be made free. I was fine, 20$ for instant beta access to a DayZ game was fine. What they didn't say is that it was a blatant lie and they would toss the game in the trash in favor of another random game they made using the original games assets (I told you. They're terrible. Too lazy to even make new assets.) simply because Fortnite was getting popular.\n\nAnd after all that?\n\nThe game sucks balls.\n\nDon't [strike]buy[/strike] download this game.",

      "For a company as big as Amazon, this game is extremely sub par. It feels as though it's in Early Access and some of the recent patch notes are very worrying for the game's future\n\nPros:\n- Stunning gfx. Especially for an MMO, the lighting in particular is amazing\n- Sound track is great and ambience adds personality to the zones\n- Some really cool zones to explore, feels as though you can get lost when you start\n- Controls/Keybinds are already really good imo, I only changed a few\n- Tutorial/Starter Quest chains do a great job of introducing you to the game without being too slow\n- Combat (when it works) Is really fun. Lots of action based fights\n- Wars are a really cool mechanic, they are ultimately flawed but are still a lot of fun\n\nCons:\n- Game is extremely shallow. It is borderline addicting for the first few levels, this soon dies off. When (If) You reach lvl 60, you ask yourself what do you do now?\n- As beautiful as the game is, a lot of it is copy and pasted. Literally. There are zones, towns, dungeons that are almost identical. Ruins immersion\n- Quests are extremely repetitive and boring. They consist of kill mobs, loot mobs, loot chests and that’s about it. No diversity\n- Combat can be laggy, you weapon swap and it doesn’t register sometimes. Wars can be a PowerPoint Presentation at times\n- Guild UI is awful. There is no guild bank, treasury ledger so you cannot monitor who donates money for wars etc. Makes running a guild a nightmare\n- There are countless exploits and duplications that have been abused upsetting economies, player numbers and the general integrity of the game\n- Server population has been decimated since launch leading to many dead servers. They’re merging already\n- There are some very worrying patch notes/future releases that are changing fundamental mechanics of the game. In some cases nerfs which punish players who didn’t rush to level cap\n- Watermark is a stupid progression system for gear. It forces you to run daily elite zone farm chains which get extremely repetitive\n\nIf this was a small indie dev company, I could give them the benefit of the doubt. However this is frickin’ Amazon. This product is totally unacceptable and needs to go back in the oven.\n",
      "it's a shame but i honestly cannot recommend this game if you are a disabled person, i wasn't that far into the game when my character started panicking apon seeing a disabled person [person with leg braces] and then gets a \"no good answer\" bit of dialog and all the options are saying something wrong or saying nothing, trying to go with the least bad option aside from saying nothing since i know as a disabled person myself [i'm a wheelchair user] it can be pretty upsetting getting people just randomly stare at me and at least when they say something slightly wrong they are engaging with me as a person, my character then proceeds to talk abt what an \"inspiration\" it is 2 c a disabled person living their life,,, not exaggerating when i say i let my head hit the desk, closed the game and uninstalled, i understand that this is probably put in the game to be a teachable moment for the able bodied audience but ironically in trying to educate about us disabled people they then made the assumption that no disabled people would be playing their game as there is no option to make your character disabled or even to make them remotely aware of disability and ended up just making the experience awful for the disabled gamers they seem to be trying to help",

Rowling, at a time far before Harry & friends were even born. You’ll play as a fifth year student in the titular magics academy, admitted this late because of unspecified ‘special circumstances’. The virtual rendition of Rowling’s works is nothing short of exceptional, with not only Hogwarts itself, but also its environs (like the town of Hogsmeade or the dangerous Forbidden Forest), all recreated faithfully and down to the most minute details. Of course, some things will differ from movies and books, with the game being set in the 1800s. \n\nThe main story follows the classic ‘manifest destiny’ archetype, where your custom-made character will discover hidden potential that ties them to a greater purpose. Despite some genuinely memorable characters and some interesting side- and main-quests, the overall narrative can’t help but fall a little flat and stale, especially towards the ending phases. Nonetheless, many enjoyable adventures await you. Notably, there are no romance or love/hate dichotomies in the relationships you have with side-characters, as your choices will always end up in pretty much the same results during questlines.\n\n[h3]Exploration, Collectibles & Secrets[/h3]\nThe world is vast and visually magnificent, peppered to no-end with points of interest that often hold collectibles, currency or other utilities. Initially on foot, and later on with the iconic enchanted brooms and even flying magical creatures, you’ll be able to explore at leisure and clear the enormous amount of side-activities. A good portion of these, however, will prove inaccessible until you gain the right spells or abilities, in a sort-of ‘metroidvania’ fashion that promotes meaningful backtracking. Fast travel and an item-highlighting spell prove invaluable in saving time while exploring. Collectibles are mostly cosmetic, enabling the customization of both your wizard and your own private room once you unlock it, to suit various styles. \n\nMost dungeons and locations have additional puzzles or hidden paths that often lead to collectibles or extra resources; exploration feels rewarding, with a genuine sense of mystery surrounding each new point of interest you’ll find. Despite that, most dungeons and locations play out in the same way, and become repetitive in the long haul.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2933385898\n\n[h3]Combat System & Bosses[/h3]\nMagical battles use spells as sole means of offense and defense. Usually against multiple enemies at once, sometimes supported by allied NPCs, you’ll have to time your protection spell right in order to deflect incoming attacks, or dodge-roll away in case of unblockable ones. Enemies are varied and range from magical creatures to dark wizards and goblin soldiers, to name a few. Some of them may be weak to specific charms, others have shields you can break by using specific spell categories (damage, utility, movement) or other special abilities, like immunity to certain effects. \n\nCombat feels engaging, well-paced and is more than a little gory for this universe’s standards, death will be far more common than in the movies or books. The way you can combine spell effects to your advantage and use the environment further adds to the base system, while the amount of passive upgrades with item traits and spell-related talents you can gain progressively add another layer of depth. In late-game however you’ll become overpowered between potions, passive traits, talents and endgame spells - so much that supposedly fearsome dark wizards will prove little more than a nuisance due to power creep.\n\n[h3]Quests, Minigames & Challenges[/h3]\nQuests usually involve retrieving something, talking to a specific NPC, solving a treasure hunt based on visual clues, getting the solution to logic-based puzzles and more, depending on the case. While some side-quests are unique and memorable, most will be fetch chores or dry open-world shenanigans that you’ll have to repeat over and over in the same fashion. Less, but more meaningful and unique quests would have been better than this bloat, for sure. \n\nChallenges are paramount in unlocking unique bonuses like increased inventory capacity, many cosmetics, and even unique passive upgrades to equip in gear pieces. They often require you to slay X of a specific enemy, finish X of the same activity, and such “long-term” goals. Some of them are a massive grind and will only give you the 25th pair of gloves you don’t need, or other cosmetics that aren’t worth the effort.",
      "\"Welp we've been working on this game for a few years now and it doesn't look like we are actually going to be able to fix anything so we're just going to release it so we can say we made a game.\"",
      "Great game! \nLooking foward for the next chapters of the game!\nI love the spritework, its amazing!\nEven the music is very catchy and memorable \nFor an Early Access game, this game is very charsimatic and has tons of personality!\n\nIts just a shame that it was short in my opinion, i know you are going to add more stuff obviously, but i was hoping to get much more out of it because i loved it alot xD.\n\nPirate Software, I can't stress enough how much my excitement for this game is,  the demo back in 2017 already left me intrigued, but now im excited to see how this all plays out!",
      "Please, bare with me here...I NEVER write reviews for anything (this is probably the third review I have ever written), but I feel like I need to write this one for so many reasons!!!  I grew up playing the Telltale/Lucas Arts Series: Monkey Island. After discovering and playing those, I figured out that I have an infinite amount of love for Point and Click adventure games. After finishing that series, I really only played the other games made by either Lucas Arts or Telltale (Mostly because I thought they were the only creators of Point and Click games...until about a year ago, when I discovered there's an entire genre/world of Point and Click).  Of course, I must also note: The Curse of Monkey Island will always be my fav, as it was the first Point and Click I ever played. Ok...NOW...with all of that being said, I recently discovered WADJET EYE GAMES and I am SO happy I did. I would recommend EVERY.SINGLE,GAME they sell. I have played all of their MAC/iOS compatible Point and Clicks, and I have yet to be (even slightly) disappointed. I had very high expectations going in as the Monkey Island games, Day of the Tentacle, Full Throttle, Grim Fandago, etc. are some of the best games in the history of Point and Click; however, all of the games I have played from Wadjet Eye have been amazing. They have actually been so amazing that I can 100% say Wadjet Eye is at the top of my list, right there with the Telltale/Lucas Arts games. I 100% recommend purchasing and playing every game made by Wadjet Eye to anyone who likes (even those who kinda sorta like) Point and Click games.",
      "[h1]One of the few multiplayer games that reminds me that people can be amazing[/h1]\n\nI've been playing games for a long time, I've seen some sh*t. I've seen people crumble, I've lost friends, I've watched people eat each other even when they are winning. When people are supposed to be working together and yet they would rather treat their ally like trash because they refuse to take the blame for their own wrongdoing.\n\nSquad is a game in which I have seen true potential. A group of 40 individuals work together to plan, execute, and accomplish masterful plans to outsmart their enemy. I've seen teams rally from the depths of defeat and flip unwinable games into incredible victories. Heros emerging from the storm of mortars landing upon their bunker, to squad leaders risking their own lives to save those of their squad.\n\nSquad is not a game for the light hearted. To enjoy squad to the fulllest, you must communicate, work together, and form a bond with the soldiers at your side. You are a team, you are a unit, and you will never win alone. Be it a medic patching the wounds of your comrades, a logistics driver supplying your team with the supplies they need at the front line, or a squad leader putting the responsibility of 8 individuals on your shoulders, each person is a vital component of the team.\n\nFor this reason, Squad has now become my most played game on steam. The depth, the people, the comraderie, it's an amazing experience that no other game captures. I encourage you all to try it out on a free weekend as I originally did, I have been playing it ever since.\n\nI'll see you on the front line.",
      "Deathloop is definitely not your average video game.\n\nYou'll either love it or hate it.\n\nThe first few hours are the weakest. You, as a new player, don't know what to do, what's important and you never keep what you find. Only after completing several mission objectives you get the ability to collect residuum and actually infuse your found items for later use in later loops or after you die. That's why it's always better to just go straight to the objectives and not explore the map at all, otherwise it's just gonna be a big time waste.\n\nAfter you acquire the ability to make permanent items (character and weapon trinkets) which you'll be able to use in future runs and collect some crucial weapons (like silent gun) and abilities ([in-game slabs] like Shift that allows you to teleport short distances) - then the game fully opens up. \n\nReal fun begins after you learn all maps and shortcuts and how to toy with your enemies (but it takes quite a lot of time to get there).\n\nStealth is very easy, the enemy AI is dumb at best. The more trinkets and slabs you get - the more variety in gameplay opens up. \n\nAction is very smooth, Abilities are strong and versatile, that's where this game shines to be honest. \n\nThere are 4 different areas and all of them change depending of the time of the day (morning, noon, afternoon and evening). Depending of the time of the day - some areas become accessible, some become closed, The enemies and items also change their locations and sometimes you'll be able to encounter bosses (in-game they are called visionaries). They are not hard to kill, but it's quite hard to get to them. That's the fun part of this whole game. The more you replay all areas, the more information you'll acquire about visionaries and their behaviour. It's possible to deal with them all without killing a single other enemy.\n\nBut with all that comes the not so fun part - exploration and doing the same thing over and over and over again. It's gonna be hard at first, every area is very detailed and it's really easy to miss a code written on a desk or a wall, A lot of sniffing around is required for clues and multiple times per map. It definitely makes repetition your new best friend.\n\nThere are a lot of puzzles and challenges. If you are not shooting dumb NPCs - you're definitely trying to crack a solution to a puzzle. Sometimes you'll need to visit several maps on the exact time of day at which events occur and find the exact required item or piece of information in order to solve a puzzle. Yeah. It's a big hassle, but that's how this game is and how it functions. If you like puzzles, you'll enjoy Deathloop. But be prepared to use a guide or two for some of them and a lot of patience.\n\nDuring some objectives it's very easy to make mistakes and fail. Several challenges require you to be pixel perfect in execution. Didn't notice that mine placed on a generator? Too bad, you'll gonna have to restart or try in another loop.\n\nI disliked that once you find a new weapon, you have to take it with you and drop one of your 3 weapons. You will never be able to use the dropped one for the rest of the loop. Considering that you'll always find a new toy to play with - your loadout will always be half-baked. It's actually extremely annoying, the same can be said about your slab abilities too (only after you find them all, then the ability upgrades will go straight into your inventory after finishing a level).\n\nAnd of course, there is Julianna. She is your \"buddy\" the whole game and she talks to you at the start of every level and well... she is always trying to kill you. It's fun when she invades and disrupts your chill Groundhogday experience. You can even let other real players invade you as Julianna. Fun, if you like to fill yourself with some adrenaline. Either you kill her, or she kills you and you'll have to start over the whole loop ^^\n\nFunny, but Colt reminded me of Draymond Green from Golden State Warriors. In some instances he looks exactly like him haha.\n\nThere are some AI bugs and the game starts to stutter the longer you play. Kinda strage, but it was for me. Occasionally framerates can go from smooth to choppy quite fast.\n\nDeathloop is a decent game overall. Idea is good, but works much better in movies, because there you don't have to sit through the same routines every single time and you get to the next big reveal a lot quicker. \n\nI think Julianna was a bit underused. Imagine how awesome this game could be if Deahtloop worked similar to The Lost Vikings where you control 3 characters at the same time. She could have had different abilities, different strengths. A duo trying to break the loop! Pretty cool, eh? Anyway, That's just my 2 cents.",
      "The story of this game is interesting and well written, but it doesn't fully make up for the game's flaws. Here are the problems I saw with the game.\n\n1. There are a wide variety of guns available, but very few combinations of those guns are viable. The shotguns are rarely viable for combat with gun wielding enemies, since advancing far enough forward to make shotgun damage effective inevitably puts you in the line of fire of enough of your enemies to prove lethal. Other weapons like sniper rifles and pistols have critically low DPS and a low maximum ammo cap, making them almost universally not viable. Additionally this game likes to spring ambushes on the player in a way that takes away any advantage gained from long range optics. The special pneumatic weapons in the game also suffer from a low ammo cap. This leaves you with assault rifles, which the game seems to have been made for.\n\n2. In encounters with bestial enemies it is frequently impossible to avoid taking damage. The enemies sprint at you in packs which even sustained automatic shotgun fire cannot fully stop. Some of the boss enemies are even worse in this department. In normal mode with the larger health pool and regeneration over time this wouldn't be such a problem. But in ranger mode this makes certain obstacles unbeatable. You might have a boss which takes your entire ammo pool from both guns to kill, and which gets a guaranteed hit on you once every thirty seconds. If you go into that boss fight hurt and with no healing items, then you'll be met with mathematically guaranteed failure. The simple fix for this is to give the player a dodge function to avoid taking an instance of damage.\n\n3. This story has a few decisions to make, but mostly it is on rails. This isn't always a problem in a game, but it is when your character gets repeatedly taken unawares by things you as the player have already figured out. You as the player may sense that Artyom is being tricked, is about to be ambushed, or is going to let the bad guy get away through poor decision making. You just have to frustratedly walk into the cut scene and let it happen anyways. Its fine for this to happen at least once. But by the fourth or fifth instance it becomes infuriating to play as the character who just gets tricked and captured all the time.",
      "From my og demo feedback, not much changed sadly:\n\nOh boy....\n\nI will start with the most glaring issue:\n-It's friggin IMPOSSIBLE to find an online match\n\nNow some other stuff that I found odd or bad:\n-The camera.... oh god.... I get it, it's supposed to \"limit\" the playing area (specially for local gameplay) but it punishes people in first place... that's friggin dumb in a RACING game, also also if you go under other track sometimes you can't see sh*t (the going under other track piece seems to be fixed in the final release)\n\n-The car randomly drives itself ???? (maybe it's the antenna thingy I chose at car selection.... would be good a tooltip or SOMETHING so I know wtf is that about)\n\n-NO CONTROL REBINDING OPTIONS..... in 2023 \n\n-If you \"die\" near a checkpoint, though luck pal you WILL miss the next section too cause you won't respawn in time... that's.... just unfun and dumb.\n\n-The \"shortcut\" option definetly does not work, I intentionally crafted a track with cuts and the game will kill you if you try to do those..... good job devs. (This seems to be fixed or working properly in final release)\n\n-Since I couldn't find an online match EVER, I played only in local lobby or vs AI, now here comes the issue, the \"placing\" round locks everyone to the same \"screen\", there is no zoom, you can get trolled by another player preventing you to move to a place to connect track or hazards, rendering your placement turn void and useless, I don't know if this is intentional or just a downside of playing on local mode, you may have free cam in multi, but alas I couldn't try that. BTW.... WHY THERE IS NO ZOOM OPTION\n\nThe good:\n-The games runs smooth as butter, with everything maxed on my midend rig, good one devs\n\n-The cars seem to be varied and with some gimmicks, alas you have NO TOOLTIPS or info what that possible gimmick may be..... why ?\n\n-The track pieces, hazards and weapons are quite varied and some weird shennanigans are ensured to happen, feels like a Trackmania troll track being build in real time 10/10\n\nThe \"mehhh\":\n\n-The weapons/items some of them are mindbogglingly hard to understand wtf they do, there is a grey metallic ball even that seems to do nothing or I haven't figured out how to use it... again... a tool tip maybe ? a section about weapons/items in the main menu mayhaps ?\n\nAnd that's that, sorry if my writing seems a bit aggresive, I just was kinda hyped about the game and it feels a bit of a let down so far. But, IT HAS POTENTIAL.\n\nSadly, another case of developer with TONS of feedback delivering an undercooked mess. Stay away from it.",
      "I am a day one player who quit the game within a few days. After coming back after almost 2 years, I am shocked and surprised. The overall improvement is great, quests are not bothering you. Story and atmosphere is hooking you up and the overall experience is good. Leveling up is easy and also you are not struggling as in most MMOs.\n\nDespite the past of the game, I think it is worth trying.",
      "For the past 4 years I couldn't get myself to finish a single game without having to force myself to do it(and even then I failed). I couldn't enjoy SP games no matter how good the gameplay or the story was. I kept buying games hoping to find that one game that would do the trick. This was FF XV for me. Despite of all my friends advising me against buying it because it was just going to be another game that would sit around in my library, I decided to give it a try.\n\nIt actually felt like I went back in time to when I could play SP games for hours without getting bored after an hour or two.\n\nI admit I skipped most sidequests and I'll try going back to them sooner or later, although it may not be the best game out there in terms of content(you can finish the game on easy skipping most secondary quests in about 20-25 hours) or story development, playing through it felt like a new experience. In fact, even after finishing the game there's still plenty of things to do and in my opinion, even playing it through again just to spend more time with Noctis and his friends is worth it.\n\nThe story is not mindblowing, the combat system is really fun but far from flawless, most sidequests aren't well written but at its core, at least for me, FF XV has something to it that other games lack. I can't say it magically restored my old passion for gaming but it has given me a reason to at least try to get into it again.\n\nIf you haven't played it yet I sincerely envy you, I would love to experience it all over again from the start, it has been a memorable journey to say the least and I hope that you are willing to give it a try. ^^",
      "Mori's 3-Part Review:\n1. Bare minimum information and recommendations to improve your playthrough\n2. Background information on me and my playthrough\n3. More extensive non-spoiler reactions\n \nPart 1: Recommendations for You\nIf you're like me and you try to get all the extra scene dialogue, then please, if you take nothing else from this, give yourself time to play this game yourself. There is actually so much content here, I really want you all to take your time to experience it as you go. The game is just too long to binge in a reasonably short amount of time, and if you do binge, you're going to lose a lot.\n \nMy recommendations:\n1. Give yourself time to play the game. Let it sink in, and take notes- it'll be rewarded. The game is literally too dense and too long to binge reasonably if you like 100%ing.\n \n2. Get invested in the characters and pay attention to them, not just the (admittedly stellar) mysteries.\n \n3. Explore the game, its mechanics, and its dialogue yourself. Don't be afraid to restart a Somnium several times; the more options you pick, the more meaningful information you get.\n \n4. If you're a puzzle lover then try to solve the game yourself. You're going to have a blast if you manage it, and the game has tons of built-in hint systems to make it even easier, fairer, and more fun.\n \n5. Try to go in knowing at little as you can. The marketing has already done a great job. Focus on finishing the game and bringing it all together.\n \n6. On PC, force anti-aliasing on using your graphics card to make the game prettier. Game ran and controlled smoothly with few bugs.\n \n7. You don't need AI1 to play AI2, but I think AI2 does spoil AI1, though you could still enjoy them in reverse order.\n \n7. If you're sensitive to horny then just read less background dialogue in Ryuki side. Gore is pretty toned down, and there isn't any single huge CW.\n \nYou can stop reading now if you don't want your playthrough tainted by my reactions/expectations effected.\n \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nPart 2: Who am I, and how do I play?\nI'm an Uchikoshi fanatic. I've played all his English-translated games, and visual novels are my favorite genre of game. I've played a lot of visuals novels, but Uchizawa's are my favorites. I usually try to 100% complete all the scenes and see all the bonus dialogue. I've also played a lot of other genres of game, and I do like fun gameplay, but the most important things to me tend to be:\n \nA. An interesting story is absolutely what gets me invested\nB. Bunches of novel ideas like unique plot points I haven't seen before, philosophical ideas, or puzzles\nC. Characters that I at least don't actively hate; I can like a game for the above two, but characters still matter\nD. Deep personal connection, usually formed by connections to real people or how a game shaped my life\n \nThose are the ways I rate my top games. For the last 8 years, my top 2 favorite games have been the same:\n \nMy top favorite game of all time is Remember11. I love the plot, the ideas, the twists, the characters, and it's what got me truly invested in Uchikoshi. It's very much a mystery game first with an unravelling mystery and themes I love to explore.\n \nMy second favorite game is Virtue's Last Reward. I love the interactive moral dilemmas. VLR's use of the Prisoner's Dilemma jumpstarted my interested in Philosophy which led me to major in Philosophy. I don't like the characters as much save for a few, but it's still very important to me.\n \nNow, let me tell you how I've played AINI: I've basically been playing non-stop since June 13th.\n \nTake this with a grain of salt because I've been documenting as I play (the average main story playtime seems to be 20-35 hours, with 100% likely taking 50+), but right now, I have 97 hours of playtime. I have not gotten all the dialogue, achievements, or fully explored the abundance of extra mechanics. Instead, I have a 616-page reaction document full of constant laughs, cries, screams, passing out, and most of all love.\n \nPart 3: My Review\nThe R11 #1 and VLR #2 holy duology held true for 8 years. Also, AI1 isn't one of my favorite standalone games; it has huge personal connection for me because of the community and the AI1 ARG, but it wasn't my favorite as a game.\n \nI gave all that background because I want you to take me seriously when I say this:\nAI2 is my new favorite game. The #1 spot has been Easily dethroned.\n \nThe themes, twists, characters, ideas, gameplay, visuals, voice acting, fair mystery, presentation, mechanics, and comedy all of it resonates together perfectly. I don't even tend to value gameplay or visuals, but at many times, this game is fun to play while looking genuinely beautiful and cinematic.\n \nThe story reads like a proper Uchikoshi + Nakazawa return to form. The mystery is fair, interesting, meaningful, and complex told satisfyingly. There are many deep ideas, concepts, and themes utilized in thought-provoking ways.\n \nGameplay-wise, there are tons of mechanics that are utilized to make each Somnium unique; they all feel designed by love, fair, and reflective of the character through gorgeous symbolism. They blow the first game completely out of the water. Each one is its own experience to explore and a visual delight. There are also tons of mechanics for you to discover that make AI2 a fun game to play.\n \nThe animations, voices, and directing are cinematic; this game is actually breathtaking a lot of the time. It's backed up by great and charming character writing- despite the fact Mizuki is my favorite AI1 character with 0 contest, I grew to like much of the AI2 cast the same amount.\n \nAI2 is a story about halves and splitting, but also love and coming together- please, see it through until it's whole. I hope and believe you will all fall in love with AI2 like me; AI2 is all I've ever wanted. AI2 is my dream game come true; it's a gorgeous love letter to all Uchikoshi fans who love Zero Escape's puzzles, Infinity's mysteries, and AI's characters and humor.",
      "Looks like a game for children, but underneath the friendliness there is a great challenge! Move on the rhythm of good songs on a note bar! \n\n[h2]Swim! Swim little tredpole! [/h2]\nYou are a newborn tredpole. The first thing you do is break free of your egg! Through various rivers and waters you journey, and eventually save your pond from a disaster that will occur. \nEverything in the river translates to an instrument tone and respects the height on the note bar. The primary goal is to reach the finish. The melody is depicted as little mines which hurt your health if you swim across one. Along the way you can collect points by collecting bubbles (with a bonus if you collect them all), little bubbles, health packs, and you can slap your tail on bamboo or cymbals that launch you in the air! Many predators would like to make a snack out of you! \nAll this on the rhythm of unique songs! \n\n[h2]Thoughts [/h2]\nThis looks like a friendly game, a bit for kids perhaps, right? Well, I started with letting a non-gamer play this, without success. You need to have musical rhythm in you to perform well. None of my friends possess that really, so a simple playthrough wasn't all that easy. \nThe music is very original, and makes this game fun. It's a tough game, and poses quite a challenge for lovers of rhythm games. I am totally unfamiliar with that breed of gamers. For the simple gamer like me, I'd say: nice for a playthrough. \n\n70/100\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[td]\n[i]More reviews at [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/39546715/]Omnivore Gamer[/url], games that are easy to control (for handicapped gamers).

      "I normally hate \"retro\" platformers, I never liked Mega Man, only Mega Man X, didn't care much for Shovel Knight but loved Hollow Knight, things like that. The Messenger IS a platformer, even though the second part of the game makes it less linear, and I loved it.\n\nDevs could take a lot of notes here - checkpoints are frequent, boss fights are short and creative and you don't have to go through 2 easy phases to retry a hard 3rd phase, most rooms and even most trick rooms have multiple ways to approach them given your fairly simple moveset. You never have to do anything pixel-perfect to get through but doing things well is massively rewarding. It constantly surprised you with new things but doesn't overstay anything, and completely foreign mechanics introduced are not punishing (Skylands, for example).\n\nA lot of people comment on how great the writing is, and well... it is great. It's sparse but fantastic throughout, with more personality in what amounts to a few pages than most games can give with 10 times as many words (and lore pickups).\n\nFor reference, I completed it with all the challenge collectibles in 14.5 hours, but did not get all achievements nor go through NG+. It is well paced and hard to put down, but easy enough to play in chunks, and I felt like I was learning new tricks up through the end of the game.\n\nDo the thing!",
      "This is such a great game. It's a well put together survival game with many things to do. Whether you want to just build a sandbox wilderness empire or try to escape, it's entirely fun no matter what. I've tried to actually complete the game, but I always end up building a massive epic fortress complete with my very own beefalo farm. The only thing that I personally don't like about this game is the stumble-upon style of actually completing the quests (they're not really quests, but I can't think of anything else to call them). Other than that, this game is a beautiful masterpiece. Very artistic, creative and fun. I definitely recommend it to anyone who loves survival games of any sort.",
      "I've been waiting since the likes of Planescape Torment and Baldurs Gate 2 for a game to match their sheer perfection, many games came quite close, but Divinity Original Sin just manages to hit so many nails on the head its not funny. It looks great and still plays fine on my aging PC, it has a great storyline, it's two protagonists have some great interactions and dialogue. The voice acting is spot on and it has the most sublime OST.\n\nThe combat is turn-based but do not let this put you off, there are so many choices in combat with the interaction of spells with each other and the environment, that the game just begs you to experiment with different tactics.\n\nThis game just oozes pure class, it was a labour of love for Larian and it shows in every tiny detail of the game.\nIf you like RPG games (or even just pure quality games), you need to play this game, it is the benchmark I will use in comparing other games in future.\n\nWell done Larian.",
      "A solid \"Get Va11HallA instead, unless this is on sale. Otherwise, maybe.\".\n\nCoffee Talk: Fantasy Coffee-brewing Action, is a day-by-day visual novel with slight coffee-brewing mechanics on the side. Its storyline is broken up into several days, of which customers visit your coffee shop and talk. The first few days are rather short: no longer than a few minutes, but as the story advances the days become more packed with story. The game as a whole is rather short, less than 3 hours to complete the main storyline. Overall, generally a well rounded game, but not $15. On the other hand, it compares rather poorly to Va11halla, a game with a nigh identical format, but has more characters, story, and charm. If you liked Va11halla, and really can't wait for N1RVAnnA, then get it on sale. Otherwise, just get Va11halla. But I'm still recommending it because steam doesn't allow maybes, and there's very little competition for this niche of VN.",
      "Do I really have to write this review? I am just one in thousands of people who wrote a positive reveiw for Garry's Mod. Chances are, this review will never convince someone to buy Garry's Mod. It'll just be lost in the 100,000 positive reviews out there. Well, here I go anyway.\n\n\"Where do I start?\" This is the question asked by anyone playing Gmod for their first time. It's also my question that I ask about this review I am writing. Hmm...\n\n_The gameplay...the gameplay...hmm... Well, there's singleplayer sandbox. You can do...uh, whatever you want really. Just addon a few addons, and you can be entertained for hours. Battle NPCs, make cool scenes for cool screenshots, explore maps, be a superhero (spiderman addon!), and much, much, much, much- you get my point, right? Almost all content is user-generated. Make your own content! Multiplayer. In Multiplayer Gmod you can roleplay. I'm talking normal RP (DarkRP), Military RP, Star Wars RP, etc, etc. In multiplayer Gmod, you can battle, prophunt (yay), hide 'n seek, and much, much, more.\n\n_Graphics? I'll rate the graphics...drumroll please... 7/10. This game is and older game. Came out in 2006. I guess the graphics are good for 2006, and people enjoy the game and don't complain much about the graphics, but I'm not gonna lie, they are outdated and look old. It's not 2006 anymore.\n\n_Hear the bullets flying. The zombies growling. The people chatting. The boxes jumping... The sound in this game is great! Every sound is loud and clear, and there are a varitey of sounds.\n\n_Play this game. Play it again. Play it some more. Play some now, and play some later. Play it over and over. Play it as long as you want.\n\n_My Personal opinion. Get this game. Now. Get Gmod on sale or not. I'm not gonna stop playing it for a while and I'm already at 50+ hours of playtime. I love this game! WAIT! Before you go and buy this, then you wonder why there are all the missing maps and errors in most games, get Counter Strike: Source, so ALL the textures are supported. You need it to play MOST multiplayer games.\n\n\nGameplay: 9/10\nGraphics: 7/10\nStory: N/A\nSound: 8/10\nReplayability: 10/10\n\nOverall 8.5\n\nEven though, this is one positive review on Garry's Mod, out of the thousands of positive reviews that have been submitted Garry's Mod, I hope this one convinces you to buy...

      "The British Forces give the Allies a bit of the German defensive capacities. It has the problem of adding too many buildings to a game that is, in its core, dynamic and based on movement and aggressiveness instead of turtling. The British units are diverse and interesting, bringing much to the table. \n\nThe DLC lacks a proper campaign for the Brits, unfortunately, even though Caen, Goodwood, Arnhem and Walcheren could have been done in some interesting missions. But, for a game focused on multiplayer, the Tommies are obligatory in everybody's library.",
      "In a world where \"enhanced edition\" has started to be synonymous with \"will run on modern hardware if you shell out $20\" it's absolutely refreshing to see Larian deliver this masterpiece free of charge to owners of the original. You start out with an already fantastic game that's received numerous game of the year and editor's choice awards. Then you spend a year polishing that game, and adding new features. The result is brilliant Enhanced Edtion of an already fantastic game.\n\nNew features for EE:\n[list]\n[*] Fully voice acted - Every line of dialog now has voice acting. The voice acting is really good too\n[*] Dual wield - Rogues now look more iconic with the ability to dual wield\n[*] Grenades - You can craft and throw various sorts of grenades. \n[*] Tactician Mode - A new  challenging mode where encounters are redesigned to be harder by adding new spells and enemies into the mix. Classic mode still available obviously.\n[*] Split screen co-op \n[*] Controller support\n[*] Updated graphics - The UI is totally reworked, the graphics are updated, and spells have new effects\n[*] Updates to the story  - The story, esepcially the ending, was rewritten a bit to clear up some confusing aspects\n[/list]\n\nI'm sure there's more, but really these ought to be reason enough to play this game.",
      "I'm severely disappointed whenever a game points at the stands and intends to hit a home run, and then instead smashes the pitcher out after the bat flies out of their hands.\n\nIt looks wonderful, it's relentlessly and uncompromisingly unique, and it plays like complete hell.\n\nUnreasonable difficulty, bordering on sadism, a unique idea let down by just-so-imprecise hitboxes and the feeling of being far too weak to take on anything.\n\nI haven't enjoyed this game, I can't recommend it to anyone else, if you buy it and find favour with it then bully for you, but I'll never understand how.",
      "I have been playing BF games since back in 2003, when you had to go and buy them from the game shop down the town center. They came on a CD/DVD. BF2 & Special Forces were fantastic games.\n\nI bought this game about 1 month or so ago now, was really looking forward to it, until I played in a match with more hackers than there were normal players!!!!\n\nEvery single game on a DICE server has a hacker or 2 or more on it!! You go to the EA forums and post about it and they advise to use the in-game reporting method - so you do that, and yet, after 1 month, the same hackers are STILL PLAYING the game. So you go back to the forum, post about it again, and EA shut down your post and mark their spam post as the solution to your post, even though they haven't answered anything properly - They then tell you they do not allow posts about anti-cheats or cheating on teh AHQ FOrum - Really? Is that because you know you are useless at stopping it EA??\n\nIt's for this reason alone I give this game a thumbs down, if it wasn't for all the hackers and EA's lack of care about getting ird of them it would be a good game!",
      "I hold this game in as high esteem as games such as Undertale and Oneshot.\nIt would be a mistake to dismiss this game, as I once did.\n\nThis game made me really care about it. It's one of those games where the writing, music, graphics, and gameplay all work together to give life to the characters within it. Even though the setting takes place in a small area (comprising of 2 buildings, 3 caves, and a bake stand), it still feels like an entire world that had a past from before you started playing and a future that unfolds after you stop playing. Every part of the game serves towards this purpose. The developer took the time and effort to make sure every small, nuanced detail felt right. Whether it's a quirky little animation, the presence (or absence) of circumstance-fitting music, or the sound effects that make every footstep and enemy strike sound just right, this game does a phenomenal job making sure that every contributes an immersive experience. You’re not interacting with a piece of software, you’re interacting with a world.\n\nHowever, this game, as is all games, is not perfect. The combat can be a bit unintuitive owing to the fact that enemies can attack you while you are selecting your move, but you will PROBABLY get used to this and after that, boy, does it become quite an exciting experience. In addition, this game has many mentions of death. While this sounds terrible on paper, the game does manage to pull out some interesting game choices out of it. Unless you have trouble discerning fiction from reality (or are uncomfortable with the mention of death), you should be fine. All other flaws I won't elaborate on because they're subjective nitpicks (ex. didn't like a word choice; thought a certain sprite looked weird; thought that the music overplayed the \"spooky\" instruments that one time in the game).\n\nIf you're looking for a game that will make you invested in a new experience, you might have just found it.\n",
      "Lemme give it to y'all straight, who are on the fence;\n\n- Yes, the game is very much worth it at full price.\n\n- One of the first games in a long while, that has kept me up until 5 A.M. in the morning, because of how lost I get myself into it.\n\n- Doesn't do dumb jump scares, save for a VERY FEW TIMES, and each one counted.\n\n- The game is maybe one of the best zombie based games out there, so long as you do enjoy it with action.\n\n- Parkour in the game is AMAZING. Sometimes I like just playing the game, so I can run\naround, across roof tops, and attacking zombies while talking to friends.\n\n- Co-op in story mode. Freaking amazing. No dumb lobby. Just click 'Join game' and bam,\nyou'll be thrown a few feet away from a friend without them sometimes even noticing you joined!\n\n- Single play and Co-op have a huge impact; co-op feels fun, slightly safer, and adds a lot in the form of friendly rivals! Single player feels way more tense and everything you do counts, making you second guess some choices, for fear or death. Night time in either mode is fun as heck, though four co-op makes it pretty easy.\n\n- Night and Day feel almost like two different modes. In the day, zombies shuffle around, falling off rooftops, being dumb, easy to avoid and kill. Night time? Get those UV Flares ready, and be ready to flee if they catch sight of you.\n\n- Even after beating the story, I keep coming back for more, as it's super fun.\n\n- Took me around 30 hours to do the story, which also included only HALF of the side missions. Still got a little over 50% left to go, and looking forward to it!\n\nTL;DR - Get the game, find friends to play with, enjoy the hell out of one of the few games worth it at full price.",
      "Two main things first up: -\n\n1)  The advertising is wrong.  This is isometric 3D for nearly the whole game, not 2D.\n2)  Do have an X-Box controller if you buy this game.  The game is far more difficult and less enjoyable if you don't.\n\n   The game shows you don't need a complex plot to make a great game.  Evil Wizard has attacked castle and kidnapped four princesses.  Your job (and that of up to three of your mates) is to go out there, beat up the bad guys, and rescue the princesses.  The game is effectively \"Double Dragon Medieval\".  You don't get to use the scenery as weapons but you do have archery, magic, fast or heavy melee options, jumping, attacks combos, different weapons, and pets that give you bonuses.  The game is reasonably fast paced - two to three massed minion attacks, mini boss, two to three more massed minion attacks, big boss.\n\n    The key game mechanic is experience points with which you can build strength (melee attacks do more damage), power (magic does more damage and recharges quicker), defence (enemy attacks do less damage), and speed (move quicker and srchery does more damage).  This means the more you play, the tougher your character gets, and the easier the enemies become.  It's quite fun playing from the start with high level characters who easily demolish the starting opposition.\n\n   The game's graphics are bright and colourful, the different soundtracks for each stage are bouncy and fun.  The enemies change regularly so the games doesn't become too monotonous but there are few foes that cannot be beaten with melee combos and dodge (that said there are a small number of mini bosses and big bosses from whom you need to keep your distance and a decent magic attack becomes essential).\n\n    Any negatives ?\n\n    1) The dev's humour is basic and scatological.  If you have a strong aversion to poo jokes this will be a negative.\n    2)  Minor spoiler - Some of the bad guys look like angry golliwogs.  Coupled with the knights' outfits that aren't too dissimilar  from the KKK this has caused accusations of racism.  Of course the KKK costumes are reminiscent of medieval knights which is the more likely inspiration for the game.  One of the princesses is definitely black.  Personally I'm not sure.  Compared with \"Birth of a Nation\" the game is \"Sesame Street\" but only an idiot wouldn't have recognised that someone would have been upset by the imagery.  Personally I can live with it and still enjoy it as a medieval Double Dragon but I give you warning in case you won't.\n\nS.x.\n\n",
      "Gone are the days of mindless building and fun. Power grids? Taxes? Intense accounting and counter-intuitive path building. A pre-built zoo for tutorials. I actually felt MORE stressed after playing this game. If you're looking for something to flex that brain, perfect. If you're looking to release the cougars and create chaos, you can do that in sandbox I guess. You could also just not connect power grids correctly. Works like a charm. Honestly who thinks of these things",
      "Don't believe the hype.\n\nAbsolutely limited appeal and not Rouge-Lite/Like, shouldn't even be remotely labelled as such. Cult management and the building of your cult is very rudimentary and a massive missed opportunity. No strategy or tactics in combat (little to no variation in creatures) and ultra repetitive. Little to no option and interaction with followers of any substance besides the simple 101's. \n\nSo many better options out there (cheaper as well) that can offer you more and robust challenge (rim world, for eg).\n\nIf you must purchase, only do so at a extremely discounted rate. You'll regret it otherwise.\n\nCute graphics will only get you so far.\n\nDon't believe the hype.",
      "I'm gonna give this a thumbs up but with like, idk, a cautionary sideways thumb for maybe. \n\nif I read credits right, it looks like this game had all its programming, art, music, and writing done by one guy, so I have to give respect to that. For a real indie game like this, it's very very good. \n\nBut it's still really flawed. If you're looking for a 2D Metroid game, and you've played EVERY other 2D metroid game, I suppose yeah, go for this one, and I think you'll enjoy it. If you're not a fan of metroid, I would not bother, sadly. This game suffers from a lot of problems from metroid games, and does not fix any, and at times exagerates those problems. \n\nThe art style is very interesting and cool, but the way the levels and map design are, leaves most areas feeling like a mess of unmemorable places. \n\nThe combat is INCREDIBLY simplistic, yet somehow bogged down by WAY too many useless weapons and just kind of badly designed controls. I found there were about 5 weapons that were actually useful in the game out of what seems like more than 10. Most enemies you either cheese, or be cheesed. There's no charge up shots, there's not really much nuance to the enemies or bosses. They have about two attacks and repeat while you dodge the same one bullet pattern and just kind of shoot in their general direction. (I played it on hard by the way. Not a particularly difficult game, but even the slightly challenging stuff felt kind of dull and uninteresting.) \n\nThe music was cool again. nothing quite mind blowing, but it was nice. The world itself seems like a mess, but there are cool ideas. The giant robot people were really cool to see. \n\nOne little idea i really liked is that the LOW HEALTH beep sound is actually in sync with every song in the game. I thought that was really cute, and it's not something I've seen any game do. Sounds dumb, but I give a lotta props to that, it was cool. \n\nWriting is okay. I feel it left more to be desired. There seemed to be an interesting world here that wasn't explored enough. It wasn't bad, I suppose, but not really that great. \n\nThat is kind of this game. It's not bad by any means, but not the best game on the planet. Play it if you're in need of a Metroid game, and I'm certain you will be pleased enough despite the flaws. Even if you're just having a hankering for a platformer and have already played Hollow Knight and some other great ones first, I think you should enjoy this, but don't expect a 10/10 game. \n\nGive it a try if you feel it looks interesting.",
      "   I just finished playing the 5th episode 😭. It feels incredibly sad to say \"Good Bye\" to this game. While playing I had a chance to get to know every in game character, especially Max and Chloe. They've become like my new friends, we've been through so much together, and realizing that it's over now, it's hella tough. \n   I've seen a lot of great games before, but never did a game make me feel SO connected to its characters. And every time you need to make a choice, you start seeing everything you've been through before and thinking how to make things even better. But I think the most important thing here is not to overthink (I mean not to try to Google what consequences your choice is going to have because it kills all the excitement of not knowing). Just do what feels right and what your heart tells you even if you might be wrong. I guess that's the lesson I learned in here. \n   Other important things that make Life Is Strange my favorite game: The developers paid attention to the smallest details, some of them you don't even notice playing for the first time, but the fact that they're there makes me appreciate it even more. The graphics is hella amazing, you just have to see it for yourself :) The plot and the music complement each other in subtle ways, and I can guarantee you'll have at least several of the soundtracks in your favorites playlist ;) \n   The game's definitely worth its money and even more. I wish I'd be able to forget everything that happened in the game and start playing it from the very beginning, so I'd be able to feel everything with the same intensity I did during my first playthrough. But I'll definitely come back to it after some time just to do it all over again. \n   Dear Developers, THANK YOU so much for Life Is Strange. I wish you all the best and I'm looking forward to seeing more masterpieces from you.",
      "One of my favorite Final Fantasy games, the story, characters, and setting are just too perfect. The music is amazing and I love the ARPG style combat. I think they did an amazing job of deviating from the standard JRPG with this game.\n\nWhy on earth do I not recommend it then?\n\nBecause the Steam version is BROKEN. The last update Square Enix did gave the game a horrible stutter and memory leak so that the game's extremely painful to play. There's no mod that fixes it like Nier: Automata either. The only way to fix it is to roll back your game version, which means no Ardyn DLC, no Comrades DLC, a bunch of other DLC items get removed, and you're stuck playing an inferior version of the game.\n\nMost developers would fix that ASAP. But Square Enix doesn't understand the PC platform or value their PC gamer customers enough to be bothered with fixing their broken games. I say this as one of the biggest fans of the Final Fantasy franchise there is. I love Final Fantasy from the bottom of my heart. But Square Enix's business practices are unacceptable.\n\nImagine if a car company put out a car and it turned out the brakes didn't work and the car company just said \"Well, we moved our factory staff onto the next product, so you'll just have to drive around without brakes.\"\n\nThat's basically what Square Enix is doing with this game.\n\nFIX YOUR MISTAKE, SQUARE ENIX.\n\nFrom a loyal fan and customer who's bought nearly every Final Fantasy game on multiple platforms.",
      "I listened to the reviews, and went into this game 'blind', careful not to watch or read anything before purchasing, in order to get the full 'experience'.\n\nAfter 8 hours, I'm left feeling that this game is like one of those 'critically acclaimed' movies that wins every award going. Then you go see it, and leave the cinema  wondering what all the hype was about. I know I'm in the minority, but I guess I must like my games to be a lot easier, or less punishing than most people.\n\n\n** Minor non-story spoilers ahead **\n\n\n\n\nThe game employs a 'groundhog day' mechanic, that basically means you can only experience the game in 22 minute chunks, then you're thrown back to the starting location for another 'loop'. There's no manual save because the game saves automatically every loop. So, you might be nearing the end of exploring a cave system, with just one more objective to scout, and... whoosh... back to the start.  This forces you to retrace your steps and cover old ground again and again and again because you won't be fully exploring anywhere in 22 mins.\n\nThe controls (Keyboard/Mouse) are awful. You can't use the mouse to point and click UI elements, or the mouse wheel to zoom and/or navigate menus. You can only use the mouse for looking around, and everything else is done using an unintuitive bunch of keys that an ambidextrous octopus would struggle with. Guess I should have listened when the game warned me that it's better to use a controller! The game was clearly made for console, and doesn't translate well to PC.\n\nWhen you do get your head around the clunky controls, the 'realistic' physics adds nothing to the game except to create a keyboard-smashing level of frustration. Navigating space and/or the landscapes in this game is a mix of falling, crashing, ricocheting, overshooting, and generally wasting time to get where you want to go.\n\nIronically, despite promising to be a space exploration game, the navigation difficulty, the constant race against the loop reset, and race against other timed game elements, actually discourages exploration, and often punishes you for doing so.\n\nI thought I was buying a relaxing, cerebral story-driven journey with puzzles to solve. Instead I got a spelunking jumping, crashing simulator, the point of which seems to be gathering a jumble of fragmented story elements, jigsaw fashion, discovering a little bit more each loop. The 'puzzles' are all about navigating the locations, often time-dependant, to unlock more story elements.\n\n\nPerhaps there is a wonderful endgame that I will never get to experience... but I can't force myself through any more tedious, frustrating loops to get there.",
      "I read the negative reviews and backlash against DoubleFine, but I thought that I would be OK even if the game had some bugs and wasn't quite finished, so I picked it up anyway. That was a mistake.\n\nThe game is not just unfinished, its in an Alpha state. Which is sad, because I definetly would enjoy the game if it was done. As it is, the game is entertaining for a couple hours, then quickly grows tiresome and frustrating. The bugs are not crippling, but taken as a whole they represent a game that is very unbalanced and grates on you over time. \n\nIf DF-9 ever hits the $5 pile, pick it up. otherwise pass.",
      "I even set a calendar reminder so that I could get this on release. I wish I hadn't bothered. Going great guns until I got to the passage. Game over as I can't progress. Tried allsorts to drop the jammer but unable to do so. I guess it is a case of waiting for all the bugs to get resolved.",
      "I've loved this game, put in WAY more hours making maps and modded content for it than I have playing it which is a terrifying statistic to think about, and have made some of the closest friendships from playing with people in the community- but, I'm just really disheartened. This is gonna be a long post, I've nolifed the shit out of this game for the better part of half a decade so there's a bit.\n\nHaving people come into my streams & DMs to ask me if I'm going to be porting my map and mods over to ARK1.5 with ASA and then to ARK2 before all of this immense drama and fleecing happened, before we knew anything about prices and release dates- it was a firm yes! I'd love to bring my creations over to UE5, porting content over was so easy, even myself and people in the modding community were putting our maps and creations into stock UE5 just to see what the possibilities were and get off on the new physics, lumen and nanite.\n\nNow I really don't want to bring that content over. Not only because of the bad business practice, with many other games who have ported over to UE5 or have done engine upgrades been offered for free- but because I've seen this one too many times with this company and the business is just horrifically mismanaged and it's heartbreaking for some of us, it's heartbreaking for me.\n\nWhen someone in a position of power and authority over an IP and business has stated that ARK1.5 would be free, as a gesture of good faith, you take that as a promise, and we were all stoked about that. That was the right thing to do. ARK is not a small indie, unknown survival game in a (mostly) unfinished state anymore like it was- it is a powerhouse in the industry, top survival game charts across the internet for -years- will have ARK in the top 5- it is not a game that has done poorly for revenue, publicity or players. It is one of the giants. The best IP that Snail/WC have to date and continues to be. There is no reason to renege on a promise that was publicly made. And before some moron says \"JuSt DoNt BuY It ThEn\" it's deeper than that, I would have had, at my hours invested, zero issues purchasing ARK1.5 for like $20-$30 bucks with all DLC's included- but to make an offer, after it was promised as free, then to take it back and serve up an even bigger steaming pile of shit that is more expensive on a plate, and for Wildcard to hand you the spoon and be like yum yum dig in! Is so strange.\n\nHonestly, I'm not surprised. I was a public moderator in the ATLAS discord with Jat and other off branched former/current- Wildcard/Grapeshot employees at the release of that absolute dumpsterfire and was there with the rest trying to put out fires that could be witnessed from fu**g Jupiter- because I had faith and volunteered my time to assist with a company I believed in, created for and wanted to succeed so badly for the community. \n\nDark and Light was next. Another abandoned IP. Then Last Oasis- yep- Abandoned. All of the offbranches of ARK have failed so horribly, and haven't managed to capture that excitement that ARK did for the industry but they will absolutely keep trying to push out what they think consumers will like, all without listening to any feedback- and feedback isn't always good, do not get it twisted some suggestions I've seen truly are horrendous- but there are gems in amongst the boulders and landslides. Having the initiative to sift and find them, and then really look at them seems to be the problem. It concerns me deeply when Wildcard state themselves on their newsletters that ARK2 will be such a different experience from ARK1 that it now makes sense why they tried to package it in a non-refundable-at-time-of-play bundle with ARK1.5.\n\nSpeaking from experience here- the best thing Wildcard/Snail have done for ARK, and I will never discredit them for it, is their Sponsored Mods program and hiring modders from the community for ARK and ATLAS. That alone has kept ARK where it is, as popular as it is, as fresh as it is and as revolutionary as it is. There is never a drought of \"content\" with ARK, as the modding community carries it on their backs each and every day. Official servers have their place, and I disagree with how they're being handled, but have no solution for that as I never was an official player for more than an hour at a time to remind me why I prefer modded servers. This is no discredit to the ARK art department, by the way, having looked through the maps in the Devkit- Aberration is still to this day is a visual and technical marvel, and many other maps made since then.\n\nThere is a massive air of uncertainty for modders with ARK1.5 and 2. Logistically, the average number of mods on big unofficial servers is about 18- if each modder listing them on Overwolf decides to list their single mod for say $3 bucks, something very reasonable- times that by 18 and are players really going to be expected to play on a single server they MIGHT not even like, for $54 bucks? Maybe they discovered that server was good but had no players during their playtime- and then they find one in their region but, oh- there's 5 more mods on this server, there's another $15 to play on this one. Is a $69(nice) investment really worth it? I don't think so. Even at what has been discussed quietly behind closed doors with other modders at a $1 a mod price, so 50c to the modder, 50c to Overwolf/Wildcard- that's still, on average, $18 bucks to play on a server- this price is not including ARK1.5, or the DLCs for it- so what was the discussed \"Content creators/Modders can make a living!\" price...? Because when you take a step back from the buzzwords, there's a colossal black hole of a problem in the logistics.\n\nI digress, without any more information to go on regarding priced mods, we can only speculate. Back to what we know. \n\nSelling all DLCs and base game for ARK 1 that will functionally become a single player story mode and mod carried game without any warnings, notices or heads up to new prospective players is scummy as hell. There will absolutely be more delays before ARK 1.5, which will extend the lifecycle of the current game and DLCs, sure, but it's shady. The idea that ARK1 will become, in a sense, a showcase of my above statement about modders carrying the entire ARK community on their backs, and a solo story is fine- but adjust your listings so that people will know they will never experience ARK1 as \"Wilcard intended\" with the removal of official servers, that they will be playing with archived mods no longer receiving updates as many modders move over to 1.5, that they will have a limited playerbase to play with as most have gone to 1.5, that there is limited updates going to be provided due to 1.5- that there is no more official DLC... due to 1.5.\n\nThis isn't even taking into their account their roadmap of the supposed finished content releases for ARK1.5 and ARK2 finishing up and starting at almost the exact same time. So we will have this problem ALL over again when the release of ARK2 is imminent, after it's delays. Players who bought ARK1.5 and all the DLC's will play on that for a month or two before ARK2 is released, then ARK1 is even more abandoned, and ARK1.5 will dwindle.\n\nI know many people will say- damn, this chick gives way too much of a shit about this game, you right lol. I don't like seeing a community be lied to, deceived, fleeced and taken advantage of. ARK is one of those \"coping\" games. If you spend any time with the community, it's a comfort. People come home from work or school and they will turn their brain off and just play. For hours. Not giving any thoughts to how shit their workday was, how badly they were bullied at school, how much anxiety they have or problems they are facing- ARK lets them turn off and have fun, it's an escape game. There's not many other games out there that keep people playing like ARK does, for so many reasons. But, the community is at the core of it.\n\nI wish Wildcard would pay attention to it.",
      "(If you're past a certain age, I can just say that this is Take Two Interactive's \"Bureau 13\" game, except actually done WELL. If not, keep reading.)\n\nTechnobabylon was one of the best games I played in 2017 (yeah I know it came out in 2015, shh). Wadjet Eye has done it again with Unavowed, one of the best games I played in 2018 and an amazing capstone to all of their work so far. You can play this game without having played the Blackwell series, but you'll get a little more out of it if you have.\n\nIt's also a rather dark piece of work, with a tone somewhere between Sleepy Hollow (the TV show) and something like Buffy. Your character (whose gender and former profession are chosen by you) gets possessed and goes on a year-long murderfestival rampage across New York City. Eventually the Unavowed, a brave supernatural-evil-fighting duo show up, and with the body back in your own control you sign up to fight evil with them. \n\nAs the game goes on, you recruit more characters in Bioware style, solve mysteries (all of which center around that year of hell your character went through), make Tough Choices and work to make the city a better place. All in absolutely gorgeous 640x480 resolution pixel art. \n\nThere were a couple of puzzles that slowed me down (the word \"LEGS\" is going to cause me to make faces for weeks) but this mostly flowed very smoothly. If you're at all a fan of past Wadjet Eye creations, this game needs to be in your life. If you're not, it's a good starting place, maybe the best starting place except that its quality might spoil you for the rough patches of past games.\n\nThis game contains some gore, some body/existential horror that might be jarring to some, and a lot of swearing.",
      "Why did i get this game???\n\nWell.. Mainly because i've always liked seeing those big trucks driving by me, So i wondered what it would feel like driving a big tractor trailer, And so i got this!\n\nHonestly, I can't say if it's anything like a real truck, But this game does get very very complicating when it comes to parking with your 53' container, And it makes me wonder, Wow! Those guys must really have some good practice! Because if i can't do it here, I for sure wont be able to do it in real life! xD\n\nMultiplayer is super fun as well, Driving next to other truck drivers and then honking at them, or meeting new friends, SOME actually truck drivers, and then traveling with them, Stopping to weight your freight, getting gas and such, It's a very fun experience.\n\nHonest Rating: 10/10 As of right now, Because I feel like i haven't played enough to experience any problems or bugs, But the game is very fun!! ***ONLY IF YOU LOVE SIMULATOR GAMES, If you don't, Then maybe think twice, But I enjoy simulator games.*** And if you want to give this game a try as your first Simulator game, Then i would recommend it!\n\nRecommendable? Yes, I recommend it to people who want to give Simulator games a try, This is a perfect one. (Or Euro Truck Simulator) Although if you're from the USA i recommend this one, Because Euro Truck Simulator has different driving rules than US, So you might get tickets for some things you don't know lol..",
      "Is Duskers a fun game? Yes. Would I recommend it? No, because of one simple reason:\n\nA lack of content with no mod support.\n\nDuskers is a little like No Man's Sky in the sense that the first few hours are filled with fun and wonder, but everything afterwards becomes a disappointment because the game turns out to be far more shallow than it initially seemed. As a player, I yearned to explore more of the randomly generated galaxy in Duskers because I wanted to see what other horrors, mods, and derelict types I would encounter in the empty universe - but in the end, it turned out that there was really very little else to see besides what you find in the first couple of hours. \n\nHere's a quick rundown of where the content was most lacking:\n\n--Enemy types: there's only 4 different enemies. FOUR. They also behave pretty much identically with the exception of the last one.  This was definitely the biggest interest-killer for me. \n\n--Derelict types end up mattering very little. Government A? Salvage C? Military B? It really doesn't change the layout in a particularly noticeable fashion, with the only differences being 1-2 extra ship defense turrets or something like that. \n\nI really, really wanted to give Duskers a thumbs up - I loved the aesthetic, I loved the atmosphere, and I loved the unique command line interface - but unfortunately, after a few hours, I came to realize that there's really just not enough actual content here, and that's heartbreaking for fans of this niche genre like myself.\n\n",
      "So um, I don't usually write reviews like this or much at all really. I mostly make unfunny jokes and call it a review or something super generic.

Or slashing fantasy monsters with some shiny sword. Or saving the magic land from evil. Or using hyper combos I never remember. Or collecting resources to build a quirky town. Or time managing some distant farm. Or driving some tricked out vehicles. Or investing in status points to make super strong characters.

      "After almost 300 hours in-game, I might be qualified to review this. I'll start by saying that Larian has really got something special here. I'm glad that the work is ongoing, but the progress is palpable. I've broken down my review into a couple sections to hopefully give you a better idea of what you can expect.\n\n1. Graphics\nBG3 has the best graphics in any CRPG I've played up until this point. The animations still need work, as there are a number of cutscenes where things and characters are misplaced. However, environments, spell effects, equipment, characters, etc., are all meticulously designed and you can rest assured that Larian has painstakingly made even the most inconsequential NPC stand out.\n\n2. Sound\nThe sound design is fantastic. Each spell and weapon attack has a unique sound. The ambient sounds are distinct with each area you are located in, as well as the soundtrack. The soundtrack, in general, is well composed. I could sit on the title screen and just listen to the opening song for a long time. The voice acting is fantastic, especially the narrator. The only issue that I've found with the sound is similar to that of graphical bugs: cutscenes need polish. Sometimes characters don't properly voice their lines when cued. If there is a large fight going on with many different effects at once, some new effects may not properly play either.\n\n3. Story\nNot a whole lot of tied up loose ends story-wise as of yet. However, the intro scene is phenomenal. Probably the best intro cutscene in just about any game I've played. From there, the story picks up on a grand scale, then drops you off in the  starting area. You then begin to pick up the pieces to figure out what is going on and how to best solve your little problem. The storyline so far as what's available in EA isn't overly complex, but the particularly enticing part about it is the number of other smaller plots and characters which lend to the main. Over the course of my playthrough, I've picked up several potential paths which could ultimately be taken probably closer to the midpoint of the finished game. \n\n4. Characters\nI'll keep this one brief, but I just want to take a second to say that all of the characters are very well fleshed out and distinct. Even simple NPC's have personalities which, for the most part, don't strike me as cookie cutter in any way. Care has been taken into writing seemingly each and every character, even many animals and corpses. Many actions you take have an effect on your party's opinion of you, but each character has different preferences. Some party members, however, are a tough to nail down as to what makes them happy, even after almost 300 hours. The personality differences between what is expressed through character dialogue and what changes their opinion of your character can feel a bit inconsistent.\n\n5. Combat\nThe combat is fun and rewarding. Each action you take feels as if it has a distinct impact on the battle. This is partially due to the aforementioned animation and sound effects, very punchy and flashy, lots of pretty colors. This is also thanks, in part, to the combat system adopted from 5th ed. D&D. The die rolls, while not visible during combat, add quite a bit of tension and strategy to a fight. You can't just fling cantrips and spells willy-nilly at random enemies and expect to come out on top (for the most part). The balancing is done well enough to allow for a fair fight, but one that doesn't hold your hand throughout and is rewarding when you win. The world design is also done so well that, anywhere a fight could possibly break out (you can attack/kill anyone), the environment lends a lot of variation and strategy to the fight. The enemies are also very smart, to the point where they will flank and take the high ground on you. Stay frosty!\n\n6. Exploration\nExpanding on the final point of the Combat section, the world design makes Faerun feel alive. There is usually something to find around every corner; exploration is very rewarding. Exploration is rewarded in a few different ways. You can get unique loot (while not necessarily as distinct as titles such as Elden Ring, there is a good variety of equipment to find), find interesting social encounters, or battles. Furthermore, battles can be turned to social encounters or vice versa. The versatility in how the player overcomes different situations is very well thought out. My main grip with the exploration is a personal one, but it's the map. It can get sort of tedious trying to navigate the world using the map. But, the exploration area is not particularly sprawling, so you won't be caught wandering around looking for a particular area for too long. A few important items for side quests also come to mind as being particularly hard to find, as they don't really stand out from the background. But, holding Left ALT will bring up titles for items lying around the area if you want to go that route.\n\n7. Races/Classes\nThe current races available are as follows: drow, human, githyanki, dwarf, elf, half elf, halfling, gnome, and tiefling. The classes are fighter, wizard, rogue, ranger, cleric, warlock, druid, sorcerer, warlock, and bard. Larian has done a good job distinguishing each race and class from one another, whether the customization options or progression. The only issue that I have is that the full PHB selection is not yet available. There are subraces available for each race, each with differing characteristics from another. The subclasses are all very self explanatory, if you are familiar with the 5th edition Player's Handbook. A few names had to be changed for certain things within classes, probably due to licensing issues. Also no multiclassing as of just yet. Curious to see if they decide to patch that one in.\n\n8. Character Creation (Visual)\nKind of simplistic at this point. There are no sliders which allow to you to sculpt the face or body, although there are a fair number of preset faces. A good number of hairstyles and facial hair options, as well as colors to apply. And yes, you can apply beards to female dwarves (lookin' at you, Rings of Power).\n\n9. Progression\nSimilar progression to 5e, except that there are several events which grant XP other than just slaying your enemies. Now comes the main problem I have with EA, the level cap. The world is very well designed and very dense, each action you take for the most part feels well rewarded with XP. But, a full playthrough of all the content could see you sitting at 4th level for several hours before completing. This is especially frustrating because 5th level is when you get your second attack and 3rd level spells. But the loot in the game still allows for a little more variety as it does continue to progress in power/utility even up until the end.\n\n10. Optimization\nI run this on a pretty mid-system (Ryzen 5, 1660ti, 16gb RAM) and I can hold between 50-60 fps when exploring on high settings. When in a busier fight, my fps ranges from 35-45 ish. There are a few bugs which impact functionality (dialogue not displaying during conversation, getting stuck on a character's turn during combat, random crashes, etc.). Luckily, these have all vastly reduced in frequency. While the gameplay is by no means flawless, it has reduced frequency enough to where it's not so bothersome as to ruin the game for me. Just depends on your bug tolerance. If you're a Bethesda fan, you'll be just fine.\n\nJust a final thought before I end this thing. If you just want to experience something different and don't mind playing a work in progress, this game is for you. Larian is fantastic at listening to user feedback for optimization to things as small as simple tooltips. If you want a full experience (and I 100% would not blame you if that were the case), just wait until it comes out. Hoping for early-mid '23.",

Nothing wrong with those types of games, I have and will continue to enjoy them. This game explores mature themes on relationships and mortality and doesn't pull any punches, without being cheap or manipulative. In that sense, its the most adult game I've ever played. \n\nI won't ever forget it. If this sounds like something you'd be interested in, stop reading and buy it. Its a slow burn, and you won't be invested until you've spent some time with the characters in the story. In the end, the payoff is tremendous.",
      "[h2]Just like in the Transformers movies, Megan Fox is hot, but horrible at acting.[/h2]\n\nNow let's get to the review.\n\nMortal Kombat 1 is a reinvention of the entire story line, changing a character's entire backstory or even sworn enemies becoming brothers. The story takes a familiar story and turns it on it's head. Earthrealm must take on Outworld at the Mortal Kombat tournament, whilst also dealing with a certain scheming sorcerer. While this is technically a reboot, History is not all forgotten. Players of the old games will recognize similar locations and character motifs. Netherrealm Studios knows their fanbase well and made the game chock full of lore from every bit of Mortal Kombat media.\n\nThe gameplay is faster compared to earlier entries. There is a lot of Kombo variety this time around, even adding Air Kombos which add to the mix. The variety system is now gone, so every character will have their entire respective move sets. No more choosing what will be best in a battle. Also gone are the Krushing Blow mechanic and the Fatal Blow moves are faster with less emphasis on slow-motion X-Rays. Even the Fatalities, while still gruesome and gory, keep it nice and quick. After you clean the blood from your ninja robes, you can unlock rewards at the Shrine which nets you behind-the-scenes concept art or an exclusive skin for the characters.\n\nNow if I had to knock off a point, it would be some of the optimization of the PC port. The loading times can be absolutely abysmal at times. On a SSD, it takes 30 seconds to load a match or even just getting through a sub-menu. Other than that little caveat, the game runs well at 60 fps with every setting to the max.\n\n[h2] I give it a rating of 9/10. [/h2]",

Leave the melted mixture to cool to room temperature.\n\nSTEP 4\nWhile you wait for the chocolate to cool, position a shelf in the middle of your oven and turn the oven on to 180C/160C fan/gas 4.\n\nSTEP 5\nUsing a shallow 20cm square tin, cut out a square of non-stick baking parchment to line the base. Tip 85g plain flour and 40g cocoa powder into a sieve held over a medium bowl. Tap and shake the sieve so they run through together and you get rid of any lumps.\n\nSTEP 6\nChop 50g white chocolate and 50g milk chocolate into chunks on a board.\n\nSTEP 7\nBreak 3 large eggs into a large bowl and tip in 275g golden caster sugar. With an electric mixer on maximum speed, whisk the eggs and sugar. They will look thick and creamy, like a milk shake. This can take 3-8 minutes, depending on how powerful your mixer is. You’ll know it’s ready when the mixture becomes really pale and about double its original volume. Another check is to turn off the mixer, lift out the beaters and wiggle them from side to side. If the mixture that runs off the beaters leaves a trail on the surface of the mixture in the bowl for a second or two, you’re there.\n\nSTEP 8\nPour the cooled chocolate mixture over the eggy mousse, then gently fold together with a rubber spatula. Plunge the spatula in at one side, take it underneath and bring it up the opposite side and in again at the middle. Continue going under and over in a figure of eight, moving the bowl round after each folding so you can get at it from all sides, until the two mixtures are one and the colour is a mottled dark brown. The idea is to marry them without knocking out the air, so be as gentle and slow as you like.\n\nSTEP 9\nHold the sieve over the bowl of eggy chocolate mixture and resift the cocoa and flour mixture, shaking the sieve from side to side, to cover the top evenly.\n\nSTEP 10\nGently fold in this powder using the same figure of eight action as before. The mixture will look dry and dusty at first, and a bit unpromising, but if you keep going very gently and patiently, it will end up looking gungy and fudgy. Stop just before you feel you should, as you don’t want to overdo this mixing.\n\nSTEP 11\nFinally, stir in the white and milk chocolate chunks until they’re dotted throughout.\n\nSTEP 12\nPour the mixture into the prepared tin, scraping every bit out of the bowl with the spatula. Gently ease the mixture into the corners of the tin and paddle the spatula from side to side across the top to level it.\n\nSTEP 13\nPut in the oven and set your timer for 25 mins. When the buzzer goes, open the oven, pull the shelf out a bit and gently shake the tin. If the brownie wobbles in the middle, it’s not quite done, so slide it back in and bake for another 5 minutes until the top has a shiny, papery crust and the sides are just beginning to come away from the tin. Take out of the oven.\n\nSTEP 14\nLeave the whole thing in the tin until completely cold, then, if you’re using the brownie tin, lift up the protruding rim slightly and slide the uncut brownie out on its base. If you’re using a normal tin, lift out the brownie with the foil. Cut into quarters, then cut each quarter into four squares and finally into triangles.\n\nSTEP 15\nThey’ll keep in an airtight container for a good two weeks and in the freezer for up to a month.\n\n:Mic drop:",
      "I love this game so much, but I am very conflicted about it. Since the beta I wondered why mods on the mod page on the Chucklefish website were sometimes incorporated into the base game and now I know why.\n\nThe devs of this game ultimately have amazing talent behind them, but they've exploited those they've called \"volunteer developers\". Promising \"exposure\" as a form of payment, and ultimately delivering neither payment, or giving their \"volunteers\" a spotlight on their own steam page or website. \n\nStill, you and I'd both buy nestle products even if they were made by child laborers, Nike shoes made by sweatshop workers, and beauty cosmetics that harm animals and even harm us when we use them. Even making the most *perfect* product doesn't make you immune to criticism for gross business practices.\n\nStarbound is a fantastic game, with incredible mod support, a fantastic soundtrack, and just all around an amazing game even if it does have shoddy server support. It's essentially Terraria in space with a more engaging visual and music style yet shallower combat. It's much easier to approach than Terraria, without as much content. Still, I absolutely enjoy this game over Terraria.\n\nI love this game, but dislike the people who made this game. It took me a while to write this because I wanted to see if the devs would make up for their disregard for their \"volunteers\". They did not.",

      "The latest S tier Deckbuilder Roguelike, joining the ranks of Slay the Spire and Monster Train for me. I think that's all that really needs to be said.\n\nIt leans heavily into kiss/curse type effects, if you like the ability to manipulate rng and do some busted stuff with your sequencing you will love it. It is more of a thinker on a turn to turn basis than other games of this genre, but if that isn't a turn off then it's a really solid game with some unique characters/mechanics that feel fresh.",
      "most overrated game to ever plague the front page of steam",
      "To whom it may concern,\n\nHere are the pros and cons for Civ 6:\n\nPros:\n1. Easy to learn and very begginer friendly, especially those new to 4X and turn based strategy games\n2. It looks for very good and the artwork (except for some leaders) is wonderful. Seriously, compared to any other 4X game Civ 6 is just stunning. \n3. Its just a very fun game\n\nCons:\n1. The AI is just absolutely horrible. Just completely sucks. At lower difficulty levels it's very stupid, and at the higher difficulty levels, its still just as stupid and makes the same mistakes. It just gets so much more starting resources to try to make it challenging, but any experienced player will tell you, that instead of being challenging and rewarding, it makes it, boring, tedious, grindy and repetitive.\n2. Some UI features that should have been standard (like having a Production Queue) aren't [art of the base game and need a UI mod to significantly improve the game.\n3. Because the Civ series has always had a strong emphasis on the single player part of the game, the different civs are NOT balanced for multiplayer, which really ruins the multiplpayer experience.\n\nOverall, I would give Civ 6 a 6.5 out of 10 and with a UI mod installed it's a 7.5 out of 10. I would reccomend it to players that are new to the 4X and turn based strategy game genres and fans of previous Civ games will enjoy it. If you are an experienced 4X or strategy gamer and looking for a challenge, you probably will not enjoy Civ 6 and I would not reccomend this for you (Seriously the Ai is garbage).\n\nI hope this review was helpful. Thanks for reading.",
      "136 hours, 49/49 achievements - sounds like just enough for the review.\n\nIt is indeed complete package. Brilliant characters, neatly constructed plot and enjoyable gameplay with the classic \"easy to play, hard to master\" aspect to it.\n\nI really can't pick at the graphics or music - they are just in line with the Supergaint roster, crafted at the level we have come to expect.\n\nIs there anything substantial that I would change?

Nope, not at all.\n\nEasy recommendation.",

      "[h1] The First \"Fun\" game, after a long time\t[/h1]\n\nHours upon hours have I tirelessly spent on games I didn't thoroughly enjoy. Needlessly competitive games like MOBAS and PvP games leaves an emotional toll of helpless frustration and unfullfillment that makes it feel mentally unhealthy to be a part of.\n\nOnly after playing The Messenger did I realise how long It's been since I played a game for the genuinely fun and exciting experience it was meant to be.\n\nAnd how much I've missed it.\n\nThe Messenger offers an adventure with controls running as tight and comfortable as the spandex pants worn by Ryu Hayabusa. Accompanied by \"unexpectantly likable\" characters, the shopkeeper in particular. With his selfdepricating/ 4:th wall breaking/ life advising humour about us being the main character and should probably be out saving the world instead of spamming his \"chat\" 30 times just to see if the dialogue changes. Only to punish us with a long, \"boring\" and unskippable dialogue.\n\nI didn't regret a single second I spent bothering him and it still amazes me how self-aware the game is and how It uses the knowledge in a way that makes the game all the more fun to play. Like putting less emphasis on the story and more on entertaining dialogues and scenarios.\n\nThe levels are varied with enemies being used as both obstacles and tools to help manuvering through levels that gradually gets more difficult, as they're pushing the boundaries on how the game can be interacted with.\n\nVisually and auditory, The Messenger presents itself in a pixelated format, all 16-bits included, but It doesn't stop there. The game takes place in two seperate timelines that you'll easily travel to through portals scattered about. Moving though one timeline could present a path unavailable in the other. This mechanic is sometimes included to get through certain areas. But my point is, not only does the game look and sound great. The different timelines are also created with a seperate artstyle. Yes, both the looks and sound instantly switch when going through a timeportal. Creating cool moments were you'll have to go though the flow of the levels, even through time.\n\nSo the game turned out to be about a time traveling Ninja who needs to deliver a message in order to save the world.\n\nI had a great time playing this and there's no doubt you'll feel the same. It's just a shame how easily it is to overlook it as something less than what it truly is, how it can easily go unnoticed among the thousands of titles here on steam.\n\nOne last thing.\nI'd like to thank the passionate people who crafted this game and I appreciate the publisher for signing it which helped them get noticed. You people have made something truly awesome and I'm looking forward to anything you'll do next.",
      "they should pay me to be playing this lmao",
      "As someone who has played the PS2 version roughly 3 years after release, I enjoyed myself. Then I saw that there was an HD remaster. Thought the game was possibly a bit overrated for a remaster, but got it and remembered why I enjoyed it after about halfway through the first level. I even enjoyed it a bit more than the first time around, since I appreciated the way the sound effects synced with the music a bit more the second time. Now Rez Infinite comes out, and the cycle repeats itself...\n\nBut this time, I'm wearing a f**king VR helmet. As someone who played many VR titles before this, and as someone who wanted this game, but put off playing it for full price... it lives up to the hype (it might help that this is the first time actually wearing headphones with it too...) Especially the Area X level. Holy crap especially that level. I only wish it were longer, and I see myself replaying that level alone many times in the future.\n\nThe gameplay may seem a bit dated to some, and it is short. But damn it, it earns it's classic status and it still holds up today. Decent gameplay that grows on you, cool sound track helped immensely by the cool way the sound effects play a part of the song, and great visuals all combine to explain how this game is pretty much the start of any cliche \"games are art\" speech. If you never played it and don't have VR, it's worth $15 (I'm sure. Haven't played this on the flatscreen, but I spent $15 on Rez HD I think, and I didn't regret it). If you have VR and any sort of nostalgia for this game, you probably wouldn't hate yourself buying it at full price, even if you're as cheap as me. If you only kind of liked the game before but didn't really see what the fuss was about, the ten or so minutes of Area X will probably show you why this game has such a cult following. \n\nAnd if you're a Rez fanatic? You'd spend $50 on Area X and still say you got your money's worth, short as it is.",
      "This game looks incredible and I'm really enjoying the story so far. It does have some bugs still, but nothing I've come across has particularly bothered me, much less ruined the game. It's incredibly immersive and detailed, the voice acting is really good, and the gameplay is fun.",
      "Overall, there's just too many things about this game that rub me the wrong way.\n\nFirst of all, I definitely like the art, visuals, music, voice acting, and writing. They don't hold your hand when it comes to explaining the story and it forces you to pay attention and also encourages you to try lots of different function combinations so you can learn more about the characters, if you care to.\n\nOther than that, though, there's not much I like. The most important aspect of games to me is whether the gameplay is fun, and honestly transistor's gameplay isn't that much fun for me. Like others have said, not being able to do anything after you pause time and plan out a sequence of moves just sucks. They don't even give you enough mobility to dodge shots. All you can really do is try to get to cover and hide out until your meter replenishes. And if you opt to instead play without using turn (or using turn to pause and think and then unpausing and simply executing your actions manually), you'll probably disappointed by that experience when comparing it to the action oriented gameplay of bastion. One of the worst things, in my opinion, is that you lose access to functions when you lose all your health. Honestly I'd rather just die and restart from checkpoint. I can see that they're trying to encourage you to try different combinations of things, but it still just frustrates me losing the build that I was in the process of learning. And when your options are limited the gameplay just gets more and more boring because you might have to resort to gimmicky tactics depending on what functions you are left with. Overall, it's certainly a unique idea to blend the turn-based with real-time combat, but, in practice, it ends up just not being all that fun to me. I'd rather play a turn based game or an action game. My brain doesn't like switching between the two so rapidly.\n\nI would say get this heavily discounted and play it for the uniqueness and aesthetics. Don't come here expecting something very heavy or that you're going to really want to sink countless hours into or replay. My first playthrough was done in 6 hours and I was glad to be done with it. I have to complement them for not dragging it out or having some frustratingly long and tedious boss fight at the end. If the story went on even an hour longer I might've just gotten sick of it and given up.\n\nIf you're into experience games more along the lines of how you experience art or other aesthetic experiences (and not necesarilly for the thrill of challenge and victory), you should definitely consider this game. There's a lot there to process. I personally don't care much about that sort of thing when it comes to games, though.",

      "I play 100+ puzzle games every year and this is likely my favourite release of 2020.\n\nDraknek and his team have truly advanced the state of the art in how the game's world is put together and how exploration and puzzle-solving are interconnected. There is no other puzzle game that does quite what this one does in terms of the interaction between mechanics design, navigation, and secret-finding. It's not just a game about pushing and rolling cylinders around, it's a game about really interesting cause-and-effect relationships between the cylinders, the spaces they're placed in, and the places that you wanna get to but can't.\n\nIf you're a serious puzzle gamer, don't be put off by the game's pastel appearance and the choice of marketing and press quotes that emphasize the soothing or cozy nature of the gameplay. The game's content, including the low-difficulty puzzles, are still very interesting even if you're an experienced puzzle-solver. \n\nThe approachability of the game is achieved by having an \"easy path\" through most of the areas. In this case, easy does not mean \"uninteresting\", but instead means \"interesting puzzles that are rigged so that low-skill solvers are highly likely to stumble upon the solution\". If you're a veteran puzzle-solver, you may not even realize this. It's quite clever. The puzzles off the \"easy path\" are quite challenging (some mind-bogglingly so) and many are incredible feats of design that you will not want to miss.\n\nThe art, sound, and writing are competently executed, and the controls, audio, and visuals do not get in the way of the puzzle-solving. The narrative is entirely flavourtext and is completely irrelevant to the puzzle content, so you can ignore it if you don't care for it (but some of it is hilarious).\n\nThere is one \"thing I wish I knew before I started playing\", and this is that if you want to find all the secrets, you should first rush to complete to the game (get to the credits) before spending a lot of time trying to find secrets. Trying to 100% each area individually during your first playthrough will lead to a lot of frustration and wasted time.\n\nThis game is wonderful. I hope Drak makes an expansion/sequel with another 500+ islands. There are enough unused tricks and unexplored design space here that he could easily fill it (but adding 3x1 logs might also be fun).",

      "[h1]He did it again[/h1]\n\nI don't know how this guy does it but he nailed it again. Maybe it's not as good as To the Moon but it's still very good.\n\nFinding Paradise plays very similarly to To the Moon. You basically walk around collecting a person's memories and going through his life. You experience every important step and decision in his life. The purpose of that is to grant dying man a last wish and make him happy. But something unexpected happens as always and you start figuring out what is happening.\n\nThe story again is very good and hits you right in the feels. There's some mystery and new gameplay mechanics. Now we have a small mini-game each time we unlock a memory. It's not hard so it won't distract you from the story.\nThe whole story is funny and sad at the same time. There are lots of well written dialogues.\nI didn't like the ending sequence, i thought it was tedious and almost broke the enjoyment. Please don't do that in the next game, leave it as it should be.\n\nAnother thing i dislike is graphics engine. I don't like this pixelated retro graphics. It's ugly. But what i don't like even more is not being able to adjust the resolution. It's 2019 (ok the game was released in 2017) how a game released in that year doesn't have resolution options? No, just no. I won't accept that and i don't think there's any justification for that. Just stop with this retro crap already. Running the game in 280x200 or whatever the resolution doesn't make it cool.\n\nFortunately this game is all about the story and story is perfect and makes up for all the annoying things. This guy should make a movie or something.\n\nOh almost forgot. Music. Another outstanding aspect of this game. The guy's a genius.\n\nOverall a very good game if you want an amazing story.

      "Wow. Just wow. This is BY FAR the best visual novel i have played. the old school forums and cameras feel very detailed as whenever anything happens in a video chat, no matter how small, the characters react to it. the story was very enthralling and every time i slipped up and made a wrong move, my heart would feel as though it was gonna beat out of my chest. talking to violet felt very real and made the ending that i got so much more satisfying. the only bad things i can even say about this absolute masterpiece is just the fact that most of the really impact full options were locked because \"Emmett isn't cocky enough\" or  \"Emmett isn't compassionate enough\" which felt very vague and confining.\n\noverall the game is absolutely amazing and i wish the devs would come out with a game similar to this because of how good it was.\n9/10",
      "Phat beatsies,\nSelf-deprecating humour that gives me self affirmation,\nPanders to my need for nostalgic nods,\nPlays smoothly, and so doesn't leave me stuck for hours helping me to feel like I have higher than average intelligence,\nMesses about with you based on the assumption of previous adventure game experience, which leads to making me go \"heh\" outloud more than three times.\n\nMildly amusing, could use more super space dust.\nPlayed on the \"hard\" difficulty option but activated other options out of curiosity, would recommend it for the extra shenanigans.\n\nIf I had to give it a score 8/10,\nWould pay for the soundtrack, that ear crack is cash money.\n\nA hell of a lot of work was put into this game & I suggest you press \" J \" on as many screens as you can handle to get some insight on the thought process behind this game, the effort and imagination that went into it.\n\nThe missing 2 points:\nfew bugs to work out, ain't no big but in a game where you are going to be thinking \"it's not progressing because I haven't mashed the appropriate non-sensical things together\" it needs to not bug out.\n\nSoundtrack not yet out - nah not actually taking points away from that, it'll be out soon as I understand it, but I need that fix Mr. Shellburger.",
      "There's a lot to like about Control, and I'm glad I played it. It's unfortunate how often I found myself thinking, \"they shouldn't have bothered\". The environments and level design are quite good, and I liked poking around and finding lore. I can't avoid mentioning the destruction physics and graphics, which were beautiful, impressive, and made me feel like I was actually destroying the world around me. The story and characterization are decent, with par for the course voice acting for a video game. The game is a fine length with plenty of levels and missions. Overall, Control is a solid game that's worth trying.\n\nThe gunplay is another story. While levitating, dashing, launching, seizing, shielding, and the other combat powers you have at your disposal felt effective and even enjoyable at times (especially launch), the guns never felt right in any of their incarnations. The visual effects of the service weapons as they shapeshift are a nice touch, though many of them feel either inaccurate or unable to rise to the task, damage-wise. For magic guns they felt very much like something was missing, and could have used some more work. For a game with so much of its duration devoted to combat, it doesn't feel like gunplay got its fair share.\n\nWith such anemic gunplay, I was surprised to see a skill tree, crafting, and randomized mods complete with a rarity system. This is where \"they shouldn't have bothered\" comes in. The skill tree is utterly boring, being mostly +X% to a stat with the occasional ability upgrade that could have been a quest reward. With an expensive reset cost and the fact that you'll be able to nearly max out everything, the skill tree doesn't exactly play into buildcrafting. Then again, neither do the mods. \n\nWhen I say \"randomized mods\", I mean in the style of an MMO. Each mod has a random stat and then a random buff to that stat within a range, depending on its rarity. These things are everywhere, trip over a box and you'll find three. I feel that this system makes little sense for this game. Especially with the DLC mods, there are so many different effects that you'll find it difficult to create a specific \"build\" and will probably stick to the core stats like damage, hp, energy, etc. It's a thin veneer of progression that wouldn't be out of place in a multiplayer game, RPG, or MMO.\n\nSo say you want to engage with the mod system and flesh out a \"build\". Well, the jukebox has you covered. After you've farmed up or crafted some coins (tickets), you can pay to enter a repeatable mission and earn some random mods. This is the exact same mission every time you play it. It's not even changed procedurally or set in different areas of the game. It's the exact same level, the same objectives, the same enemies, the same boss, etc., every single time you play it. This mission is designed to be farmed. It's not the only farming you're encouraged to do, either. What's worse, as you play, your tiny inventory quickly fills up and you'll find yourself stopping after each mission (or in the middle of a mission) to do inventory management. Compare mods, equip mods, delete mods, farm mods, fill up your inventory... it's not an engaging system. They simply shouldn't have bothered.\n\nControl is at its best when it's being a single player game, with environments and worldbuilding that suck you in, with exploration and lore, and with the missions and duties of being the director. Control is at its worst when it thinks it's a multiplayer game, with boring skill trees, mods, crafting, and inventory management. It's so needless and mars what would otherwise be a perfectly serviceable game (save the service weapons).",
      "Overwhelmingly positive. pfft come on!\nThis game is walking and a puzzle simulator. Everything damn thing in this game is missing. \nThis game is not even a shooter, can almost pass by every damn zombie.\nAll you have to do is run and solve puzzles.\nBeen solving puzzles for 13 hours. Barely got time to shoot anything.",
      "If you are looking for a game that you can never master, here is the game for you.",
      "This game is a cozy  winter morning, wrapped in a blanket, in the heat of the fireplace with your favorite cartoon on and cup of hot chocolate, it is x-files, it is the music that you hear while walking on the streat, it is people you know,  good people, bad people, real people. This game has the feeling of nostalgia while being totally contemporary and modern.This game is every young adult fear and existential crisis all at once. This game is pure feeling.\n\n\nthat aside, this game is pretty much a perfect game for me, the story is really interesting, the music is beautiful and the art is gorgeous, and the characters and the atmosphere are so fucking believable i think i know everybody in this game, or atleast i feel so.\n\nAs a small town dude i really relate with a lot of thing in this game.\n\nThis game is special, its special for me.",
      "[I received this product for free from a giveaway]. Only played for a short time, but sheesh, it's a bit of a mess both visually and gameplay wise. There's not much I can really say that would differ from what's shown in the trailer (rather crude MS-paint looking drawings with a few short looping backgrounds). You jump when moving right or left, flappy-bird esque, you dodge stuff going across the screen and from the top, which is a bit boring to me, but some may enjoy it more. You also have to go out of the screen to dodge sometimes, but also if you go too far out (who knows how far) you'll die as well. It might be an okay time waster for free (like old flash games), but I wouldn't recommend spending your money on this.",
      "Not For Broadcast is in the simplest of terms, a multi-tasking simulator.\n\nYou sit in a news control room and you have to keep track of multiple things: censoring curse words, switching between cameras, playing ads at the right time, ensuring your broadcast frequency isn't disrupted, as well as keeping an eye out for a bunch of other strange things that appear later in the game.\n\nThis isn't the easiest of games as it requires a good deal of attentiveness. The description isn't joking when they call this \"high-pressure\". You have to rely heavily on both audio and visual cues to make sure your broadcast doesn't get screwed up. As this is the news (and live), there is no rewind or undo button. If you mess up and want to get a good performance grade, you'll need to redo the entire news segment. \nIf you're a perfectionist like me, a 10 min segment can end up turning into an hour of trying to perfect that news segment. As such, I do hope an option to quick save, or at the very least, save and quit, can later be put into the game. It felt rather taxing having to keep an eye on so many things for so long. But as with any game, excellence isn't an art, it's a habit. You'll find yourself turning into a multitasking expert eventually.\n\nThankfully, the actors in the game do a great job of making the experience an entertaining one. There is a good amount of humour written into each broadcast, although I must admit I wasn't quite able to pay attention to all the dialogue, as I was too busy trying to switch to the right cameras whilst ensuring my electricity didn't get cut out. Luckily, the game does have an archive which allows you to playback the broadcasts. Without that, I'd probably be missing out on 70% of what was going on.\n\nThere is also a text narrative, choices matter portion in between news segments. As of now, it feels a little out of place and incomplete, but then again, this is an Early Access review.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that at the time of writing this review, there isn't really any \"propaganda\" aspect to the game yet.\n\nPerformance-wise, the game runs pretty smoothly. I did encounter occasional crashes if I looked left or right and back and forth too quickly, but other than that, the game is pretty much bug-free. Also, this game has my RTX 2070 Super running at rather high temps for some reason. Rather surprising for a game that doesn't appear to have particularly high-end graphics.\n\nAnyway, I'll be looking forward to see what comes next for this game. Definitely worth the buy despite being Early Access.",
      "Great game... who need 1 or 2 years of development. tl;dr: mid game turn into a micromanagment hell.\n\nThe game is fantastic until a certain point. You start as a mercenary, one party, 50-150 soldiers doing missions, small battles or bigger fights joining armies. Good graphics, brutal engagments with 200-1000 units at the same time if your computer can handle, playing as a soldier is a blast.\n\nThe problems start when you get a few towns and a bigger family, the micromanagement never stops and gets worse overtime. You have to physically move your party to towns to fix their issues. When your lords get captured & escapes, they'll go into a random town until you pick em again, then you'll have to reform the party. Same with caravanes for trading, if they get captured, you'll have to go in his town and recreate the caravan. You have to partially fill towns with soldiers, manually, from your own soldiers. All the little fun things of the beginning soon become a hassle, as you can't delegate. Messengers are not a thing.\n\nYou can't manage a town at a distance, you can't tell a party member to move to a location or guard a territory, they do whatever they want if they're out of your army / party, so you have to do it yourself. Either you're leading your huge army to fight what is basically an enless war mid game, or you take care of your cities while the rest of your faction fight... with various success. Some commanders are pretty good, other will throw waves of recruits at highly trained arbalists in the open backed with cavalry. Protip: don't be a recruit in an imperial army.\n\nYou can't tell a party you created to guard an area or to kill all bandits attacking your villagers, it's up to you, or the IA if it feel like it. Worst, if you let the parties you created roam around (parties = group of 70-200 soldiers under a lord) they can be (temporarily) drafted in other armies of your kingdom... and you'll have to physically move to the army, talk to the leader and pay some reputation to get them back. Of course, large armies are slow. This leads the the next problem, swarms.\n\nMy worst fear is not a massive army, it's an army disbanded in the middle of my territory. The small parties usually start raiding all villages in the vicinity while being too fast to be catched by a big army. Raided villages impact your town / castle loyalty and gold quite heavily. Sure, you could disband your army and hunt them yourself... but that makes you take a step back, and all your parties would reform under another army you can't control. And man, some army commanders are really, really stupid. Verdun style charge in the open against walls of archers, cavalry in a forest vs pikemens, you name it. I can't count the time i had parties wiped in someone else army. But let's say you managed to capture the lords burning your villages.\n\nThe capture system is broken. Captured lords escape A LOT. I had some escape 20 seconds after being captured. They never stay in a jail for more than a few in game days. Once they escape, they magically teleport to their hometown, rebuild a fast 80 mens army in the blink of an eye and go back to raiding villages. AI \"cheat\" with recruits, they will always find soldiers in town, even if they're empty for you. Executions you say?\n\nIf you execute a lord, no matter how much of an A-hole he/she is, the whole faction will hate you. He raided dozens of villages and killed hundreds of peasants? Still not good enough. You just can't kill a lord without suffering heavy consequences down the line, and you'll need those lords to be friendly later. Worth to mention, capturing the leader of a faction won't stop a war.\n\nLast - peace / war is on/off. I had 600 days of continuous war, followed by 600 days of complete peace in the entire map (due to a bug apparently), and i'm now back at 300 days of war. Not a single day of peace, when one war stop another start immediatly. They will just never, ever stop fighting. Can't catch a breath, can't leave the front of your lose towns.\n\nOh and the main quest randomly failed after 875 days or so.\n\nI would still recommand the game, it's really fun for a while but it need a HUGE QoL update.\n",
      "Ok so let me start off by saying that I absolutely loved the first game in this series. I loved the subtle changes when you compared character interaction throughout the game as you progressed playing non-lethally/lethally. Now I never buy games at launch, I always wait for sales. When I got Dishonored 1 for $2 I was blown away and mad at myself for waiting for such a sale. I would've happily spent more on that game, it was worth it. Now all that said, here we are at Dishonored 2:\n\nPros\n- Mechanics have been vastly improved upon and the gameplay is just so much more fluid. As much as I loved the previous game I can't deny it was somewhat clunky.\n- Customization is so much better! The upgrades are plentiful and the bonecharm crafting system is awesome once you realize what you are doing. It really expands on how many options you really have at your disposal.\n\nCons\n- The difficulty still just isn't there for me. I LOVED that there was a custom difficulty mode, but even making things harder than the 'very hard' difficulty I still completed the game using no powers and never getting detected with relative ease(I did save A LOT obviously). The only things that really present a challenge are the clockwork soldiers, and as the plot of the game makes evident, you really don't encounter those enough to really present a big challenge.\n- The story is weak, plain and simple. It was like you were on a storyboard that used the same format as the previous game. The story, especially the universe and how you were immersed into it, was a big part of the why I loved the first game.\n- How low vs high chaos is handled. It isn't like there are no changes, in fact I was surprised a few times in my 2nd playthrough which I was doing as a hardcore murderer of every man, woman, and child(if there was any) that crossed my path. It just never really changed the dynamic enough like Dishonored 1 did. The way the final mission in the first game played out when comparing no killing playthroughs with bloody ones was VASTLY different right from the start of the mission.\n\nAll in all it wasn't a bad game. I still definitely enjoyed it for being a niche genre game. Just maybe I would have liked the game to stand out more like the first did.",
      "When I say this game changed the way I thought about life, I mean it. And before you say this game isn't worth 44 dollars, you are wrong. I would pay more than double just for this once in a lifetime experience.\n\nWhile this game may look like a stupid bishoujo romance game, it is so much more. Don't let the weird artstyle or obnoxious eyes fool you, this game will make you laugh. cry, depressed, happy, and everything in between. It is so extensive, so great, that there are over 13 character routes and stories to play in this game, all of which are good (some are incredible) and have some of the best, most fleshed our characters I have seen. This game is about life, change, friends, love, and most importantly, family. Every route in this game has a connection to family. (Clannad is a close-enough translation of family in Irish)\n\nIn case it helps, I'm a grown man who had a rather negative outlook on life, and this game me cry buckets. If you ever have thought about getting married and having kids, this game will MAKE you want to have a family. The clever writing and how the protagonist, Okazaki, changes throughout his life is all done so well. It made me realize how much we complain about our lives, but we don't need much to be happy or be motivated. In case it helps again, my mom loves this game, she connects with it quite a bit. Yet again, nothing bad to say here, only to say that Key is incredible and I will be reading some of their other works like Little Busters and Kanon.",
      "Coming up to 5000 hours playing this game, and im still learning new things in multiplayer.  \n\nThe devs are by far the best ive ever seen.  FFF (Friday Fun Facts) is a blog post they write up every Friday.  Every. Single. Friday. For the last ... 4 years?  look at them on their website, its not a 2 min blurb, its a full review of what they've done that week, and where they're headed, what their plans are, current iterations they're going over, complete with pictures and sometimes *chuckle* hand drawn graphs.  \n\nTheir IRC channel (there is a link on their website) has someone on the dev team there pretty much 24/7.  Not just \"community manager\" nitwits (Trangar, te he), but guys like Rseding91 (their C++ guru) that are programming the actual updates.  \n\nOh.  There are updates.\n\nAre there sometimes bugs in the patches?  Sure.  Which is why you sometimes see 2 patches in the same day.  Bugs get quashed immediately whenever possible.  \n\nWhile this review doesnt speak much about the game, the team behind it deserves the recognition - its amazing, thoughtul, and incredibly well done because of them.\n\nIn a nutshell, its similar to RTS games like starcraft, where you build up and gather resources.  But instead of spending 20 minutes to build up a base to have the game end in 2, you keep building.\n\nBuilding Bigger.\n\nMaking things more efficient.\n\nTearing down and rebuidling.\n\nIm almost 5000 hours in and sticking with vanilla until I can personally say Ive mastered it.  Once I stop learning new things almost every time I play, ill start fooling around with mods.  And there are lots of them.  \n\nIs this game worth $20?  It absolutely was for me.  This single $20 purchase brought me thousands of hours of entertaintment, frustration - when things didnt work planned, and absolute delight - when things get fixed, and I can reflect on my orchestra of 500 machines working in harmony.  \n\nWhether or not it is worth it for you is up to you.  But I would be remiss if i didnt impore you to give it a try, get the demo, fool around, commit an hour or two.\n\n",
      "I've always been a little curious what a hero-centric world would look like from the eyes of a bystander. In theory it doesn't sound like a particularly exciting idea but there's a million and a half games where you are that hero, and I've never seen one where you aren't. As of the first chapter, I'm pretty interested in seeing how WP is going to take this story after having seen some adventurers through the eyes of a child that doesn't understand their way of life. \n\nThe story progresses by skipping to noteworthy events in her life as she gets older. She meets new people and is faced with decisions that shape her as a person. I'm not sure how to explain more of the story without getting into spoiling details, so I'll update this if I figure that out.\n\n--\n\nI really enjoyed World's Dawn and I'm very glad to see that he's not getting complacent with that and continuing to improve his skills. Storytelling is an art, and art doesn't improve without practice. I've waited a long time for this game to come out, and so far I'm not disappointed; and I doubt I will be.\n\nAlso, I'm happy to hear that WP's cancer is in remission and that he still wanted to go back to making games once he was feeling better. I hope he continues to produce these relaxing little escape-type games for a long time. Not every game needs a polished combat system and super high budget cg cut scenes to be fun.",
      "Dave the Diver is a charming little 'Indie'* that still surprises you with new mechanics even hours in. The various activity cutscenes are pretty funny as well.\n\nJust a word of warning though. Mintrocket is NOT a indie studio, it's a subsidiary of NEXON, so DtD is entirely a NEXON game, and with how their reputation is it's pretty understandable to not buy this game just because of that.",
      "nice game but pls improve ur anti cheat",
      "I was excited to play this after playing Persona 5 and Persona 5 Royal (my introductions to the series) to death.  This game was raved about and I thought, if it's more of the same then this should be great...\n\nThe major problem I have with this game is that it's so painfully obvious that it's a game made 13 years ago.  It's not a bad game, the look and feel of the Persona series is there and the characters are interesting etc.  But at the same time whenever I played this game, I just wanted to go back and play P5R instead.  Everything is just better in P5R.  The dungeons for example, the difference is night and day.  P5R's dungeons have so much more life to them, and look so much better.  Most of the environments in this game look like dull coloured LEGO sets put together.  It looks like it was originally on a handheld console (despite the remaster).  The other major example is the voice acting.  My god, some of the voice acting in 4G is on par with some of the worst Square Enix efforts.  Audio balancing is terrible as well.  And then there's the subjective stuff.  I personally much prefer P5R's soundtrack over this one, aside from maybe a couple of songs that were cool.  The setting of Tokyo is much more interesting and dynamic than this hokey town in the middle of nowhere.  The characters themselves I found much more engaging in 5R.  This was particularly helped by the quality of voice acting.  I think \n\nI'm glad that people are able to experience this game again on a more available platform.  I think potentially if I had played this back when it was released, I would probably have a different opinion of this game.  If you like Persona games and can look beyond what's dated badly, then the core game is very much the same.  If you were a fan already, this is a quality refresh to the game.  However, if you're like me and experienced the future of this series before playing this, I dont recommend it.  P5R provides the same gameplay but adds so much more.  It's a shame we cannot get that game on Steam instead.",
      "Remember when you first played Thumper, and you were expecting a rhythm game but got so much more?\nOr when you played Thomas Was Alone, and you somehow fell in love with characters who were literally monochromatic rectangles?\nOr when you got to the final level of Journey, and you nearly cried of amazement at the emotional EXPLOSION AND RELEASE?\nAll those feelings? That is Sayonara Wild Hearts.",
      "Ever fire up a game for the first time and within the first twenty or so minutes you know it’s got its hooks sunk into you? Return of the Obra Dinn had that effect on me, and that was only elevated by going into it mostly ignorant as to what the game is. The last thing I was expecting was a game to flex the parts of my brain involving deduction, logic and reasoning; parts I haven’t used since the first Pheonix Wright game. I lost track of how many times I’ve had lightbulb epiphanies or gasped with a sudden realization, a kind of excitement I seldom encounter in gaming. Obra Dinn doesn’t have a time limit, so meandering through the creaky ship at your own pace can be something of a relaxing experience - Though investigating a copious number of murders might shake those relaxed feelings.\n\nI’d classify Return of the Obra Dinn as a nautical investigative story walker. The goal of the game is simple: A ship, the titular Obra Dinn, has returned from a voyage but is completely abandoned with apparent signs of foul play having taken place. Your character’s job is to investigate what happened to the ship, its crew and cargo. This may sound dull, but once you arrive on the ship you’re quick to find out there’s very little to go off of; a skeleton here, signs of a struggle there… The game takes place in a time when commerce and trade by sea was at its peak under monarchy crowns, so there’s no fingerprint dusting or CSI kits to be had here - That’s when the supplied compass comes into play. Using this apparently cursed/enchanted/mystical trinket, you can dip back in time when looking at a deceased person at the moment before/during when they died. Get your gumshoe hat on, because what occurs after is only the audio of the scene (voices, noises) followed by depositing you into the scene, though everything is at a stand still like a freeze frame. Using the previous sound clues and the locked-in-time environment around you, the task becomes finding out two whos’ and a how: Who is this person, who (or what, potentially) killed them, and how did they die?  \n\nThe Obra Dinn is a big ship and an accordingly big crew to go along with it. While some members are easily identified by audible hints and where they work/reside on the ship, others aren’t so clear cut. Keeping track of the dozens of crew members isn’t a daunting pain thanks to the handy log book at your disposal, separating each major development with the Obra Dinn’s voyage as chapters that can be revisited or reviewed. This is beneficial because each scene only lets you explore a very limited portion of the ship, so narrowing down who and what you can investigate keeps one from tripping over every bit of available information. Getting lost on the ship isn’t a problem thanks to frequent backtracking and the supplied deck map, and even with the single toned color scheme of the graphics, everyone and everything can be clearly identified. In some cases where the scene has a lot of action going on, the graphical style can suffer a bit from visual pollution, but it’s not frequent enough to hamper your sleuthing.\n\nEntering one scene tends to open up the fate of another person, and it won’t be long until the Obra Dinn resembles one giant crime scene with how many bodies there are. The log book doesn’t instantly indicate whether an assumption about a victim’s fate and their killer is correct or not, as getting ‘clumps’ of people correct will get them permanently pasted into the book to show that you’re right. Out of the the dozens of people on the ship, I had to resort to a guide to identify at least four of them and I felt frustrated from how the game was stretching regarding their identifiable clues. Still, being able to get through approximately 70% of the game before getting slowed down by the trickier victims shows that the game’s challenge curve is quite generous - If you know for what and where to look. I was genuinely excited whenever my newest guess would result in fanfare and correct confirmation without fail each and every time.\n\nGoing blind into Return of the Obra Dinn, I had little to no idea what I was getting into, especially not a nautical investigation with more than the dangers of mutiny going on. My biggest issue past my slight ire with the late game is with how disappointingly limp of a note the game ends on. One chapter in the log book remains locked until every other possible person is accounted for, and this last chapter only confirms what you might’ve already assumed happened that led to the later climax. As mentioned earlier, it got its hooks into me since during my breaks between playing, I was still thinking about theories and potential guesses for what happened to some of those sailors. Return of the Obra Dinn gets a big recommendation from me if you’re looking for a game that’s slower paced or will stoke the interest of the detective in all of us... Just bear in mind that there’s backtracking out the neck if your patience is rattled by that.",
      "MySims, Scribblenauts, Poly Bridge and just plain old Lego building.\n\nIt's hard to describe this game succinctly without drawing a comparison to one of the above so I'll just do it off the top. Bricktales is a very pleasant blend of these sources, offering light accessible and honestly quite relaxing game play centred around a mix of lego building challenges and overworld puzzle solving. It's an ideal game for kids or even adults looking for something breezy, especially considering just how nicely it's presented.\n\nThere's a few small gameplay gripes, the controls for the building mode are decent once you get to grips with them - but getting to grips with them takes a little time. On the over world it can feel like you spend a lot of time switching between traversal powers and watching the corresponding animation. And in some places the game can let you build something that counts as a valid structure but isn't actually traversable for your character. None of these felt like a big issue though.\n\n I think the most engaging thing personally is that the themes chosen (Medieval, Egypt, City, Caribbean and Jungle) are all very familiar genres for original Lego sets of the past, which combined with the simple blocky nature of the things you build in the game makes it feel much closer to the vibe of just playing with Lego as a child than something licensed. There's a very charming *vibe* around this game that I think gives it value beyond something just for children, and is a large part of why I would reccomend it.",
      "After sailing around for an hour or so, killing some huge crabs and collecting some reports from new islands I had discovered, I was running low on fuel and supplies. The game reminded me of this with a prompt titled \"Desperate Measures,\" so I was left with little choices on the matter.\n\n I tried to use my last two boxes of supplies in a vain attempt to desperately scrape together some fuel so I could reach the port of Fallen London -- I failed. Now I was faced with the problem of starvation, on top of the whole fuel fiasco. \n\n  Fear was setting in, as was hunger, fuel was low, as was hope, so I decided to beseech the gods of the Unter-Zee for help, and help they did. I was, for lack of a better word, teleported to some kind of temple dedicated to the gods, and that was where things went from bad to worse. \n  \n   This temple couldn't be further away from Fallen London, and therefore aid, than I could have gotten on my own. So I decided to beseech the gods again, this time my pleading went unanswered, a cruel cold-shoulder delivered to an ingrateful neophyte. The only purpose my inane begging to a higher power served was to unsettle my crew and drive us all to the brink of sanity.\n\nSo I abandoned ship and we all died, lol. 11/10.",

      "If you want to cut your teeth on the Final Boss of box-pushing puzzle games, then have I got the game for you.\n\nRight out of the gate SSR offers a somewhat uneven mix of real head-scratchers and what I can only describe as pity puzzles, but quickly reveals itself to be the sort of puzzler that mandates particularly extensive sessions of staring at the seemingly inconsequential number of tiles onscreen and poking experimentally at them until something starts to click. This demands a little more patience than I ordinarily have, but I was starting to appreciate the design as I acclimatized to it.\n\nThen I arrived at The Great Tower level (in only the second subsection of the overworld), which all at once foists about 4 times more pieces on you than you've dealt with previously, while simultaneously introducing a Z-axis and the concept of using pieces as platforms mid-puzzle.\n\nSSR does have a well-executed and forgiving Undo function with basically unlimited storage which is a great thing to have up until the time spent rewinding would outweigh the time spent to simply restart the puzzle and do over; the only way it could be made practical on a level that large would be if you had a full-on timeline scrubber like in the rerelease of Duke Nukem 3D.\n\nThere's patience, there's logic, and then there's [b]this.[/b] I play puzzle games to try and [i]relieve[/i] stress, not the other way round.

      "Okay so first and foremost the reason why I'm giving this a thumbs up is simple. The game does what it set out to do perfectly. Because of that I have no complaints about it's style.\n\nHOWEVER.\n\nI personally do not like the game. It is my own personal hangup. But I can understand why other people will enjoy it.\n\nThe game is fast paced, level by level FPS with challenges. Almost every single one of them is timed if not all of them are timed. It's similar to Doom or Killing Floor. Only there are no cusomizations implemented at time of play. \n\nThe game is challenging and offers you many different faucets on those challenges. It has different gun types for different enemies, different strategies and all of them complicated and challenging. But that's the point right?\n\nRegardless, the game was pretty fun and if you're looking for a level by level challenge system set to a similar style of Doom then you might just enjoy this game.\n\nIf this wasn't enough for you then please check out the video on my YouTube Channel for a more precise in depth explanation (link below).\n\nThanks for reading and I hope I helped some of you out there to spend your money wisely.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXiok7bhPdY",

      "This is mostly a worse version of the much better \"Slay the Spire\". Slightly different gameplay (Inscryption has a 'field' and some very limited mechanics from Gwent-like games), but both are deck builders with card alteration and deck probability as a core mechanic. Really expected better from the reviews and a demo that promised more gameplay aspects than seem forthcoming. Not an awful game, and has potential, but it feels like they took a basic card game and never bothered to balance it or build better guidelines for the randomized encounters. \n\nPros\n-Atmosphere is decent\n-Gameplay core is fine and could have promise but is highly random. \n-The 'scale' system works well in concept - winner must be X damage points above the opponent, not a set amount of life. X is too small.\n\nCons\n-'Roguelike' aspects are minimal so far. Even as I get more familiar with gameplay my runs are as likely to end on the first or second map. Grinding the same level doesn't get you anywhere in terms of improvements, since the end game 'summary' is determined by random cards you obtained during your run... which can be very poor. Even then, these seldom show up on future runs in my experience.\n-Few ways to guarantee what cards/powerups you get if you want to focus on any specific type of build. Additionally certain paths are OP, while others are next to worthless. With STS there are far more viable builds, and while some are better than others, most times you could construct one to get you far.\n-Powerups sometimes do nothing (e.g., Instant kill on a card with zero attack is... worthless, but if you add 1 attack it suddenly works), and sometimes create amazing combos.\n-Highly variable battles, often hinging on 1 turn or card draw. Get your top card first? Battle is won. Keep drawing the wrong 'fuel' (card summoning) source? You've lost. Sometimes you'll get 1-2 cards that are a permanent squirrel card, other times you'll need to spend a 1-2 draw actions to even summon a card.\n-Overall atmosphere is interesting, but highly limited and very repetitive. Narrative only changes when you advance and isn't skipable so spending 1 minute each death doing the same death sequence 5 times in a row ruins it. \n-You can't just quit a run. Also the stupid UI that has you click + drag to use the menu system. \n-The room, which functions as your 'rogue-like' element is limited, and once explored is dull. Late 90's graphics, low light. Puzzles are mostly bound by gameplay and even completing a puzzle and adding a card to the pool of possible draws isn't that useful. \n\nThe game needs more features to allow for 'controlled randomness' (e.g., lock certain starting cards for each run, set a preferred powerups/creature type, start encounters with +1-2 cards in hand, expand # of result possibilities, better 'rarity' parity), better permanent powerups (expand past # of \"helper items\" that can be held), scale needs to be larger (once you get the right set-up the game is over the next turn, conversely some scenarios the computer can 'rush' you and a match is over by turn 3-4). Possibly expand # of slots for cards and allow player to have 2 rows, like AI does - would also allow certain powers to be more interesting.",
      "The arguably ugly graphics initially turned me off, as I'm sure it will for many of you, but in the end, they turned out to be unique, making an excellent game more memorable. I never had a gaming experience quite like this one, and it really felt as if I had to deduce and think things through. It made me feel more like a detective than most point-and-click mystery adventures. And don't get me wrong, I wouldn't include this game in that category, which I love.\n\nThe plot was amazing, and it was full of clever bits. The game got challenging in a good way without going overboard, and I think the vast majority of deductions was fair, except perhaps one in case 9, which I doubt I would have ever gotten without an in-game hint. The end was a bit anticlimactic after such a build-up, but overall it was a very satisfying journey. I'd definitely be interested in other games using the same concept. If you're unsure, like I was, I suggest trying out the demo where you can play 4 out of the 12 cases.",

      "EDIT:\n\nWhile I have played Squad quite a bit for a few years, the large update named \"V6.0 Infantry Combat Overhaul\" unfortunately did not sit well with me.\n\nThe goals for the update:\n\n- Increase length of fights.\n- Reduce the impact of lone wolfs (solo players).\n- Increase emphasis on teamwork mechanics, which mainly meant supression.\n- Increase gunplay diversity, to create choices between optics, since the old meta meant that the magnified optics were greatly outperforming iron sights and holo sights.\n\nWhile I do not disagree with some of the goals, the implementation of them left a lot to be desired.\n\nAfter the update most gunfights became a mess of supression, without either side being able to effetively kill each other beyond 200m.\nGunhandling was also drastically nerfed, creating the sense that your character has never held a rifle before, or even used an optic for that matter.\n\nI can unfortunately no longer recommend this game, since I myself no longer feel drawn to play it.\n\nIf enough changes are made, I may revisit the game and this review, but for now there are better options out there.\n\n\n** OLD REVIEW ** \n\nCan the game be amazing and fun - yes! Do I recommend this for everyone? - No.\n\nThe experience of the game largely depends on what servers / communities you play with. If you play the core game with no moderation (no rules or admins), the game will become a race to make the first unit and lock others out and a race to get armor, then proceed to rush the enemy and end up spawnkilling them near their main spawn.\n\nIf you play on moderated servers with established rules and active admins, then you may experience a great sense of teamplay - other times not so much.\n\nBefore you buy it though...\n\n- Microphone and willingness to use it is REQUIRED for a good experience (People will quickly kick or become hostile towards you, if you do not communicate)\n- This is not battlefield or call of duty, running of solo to pull off 360 noscopes will probably get you kicked/ killed.\n- You will die without knowing from where and you will get into situations in which you have no option to survive, especially if you're new to tactical shooters.\n- You will end up running... A lot..\n- Armor is not like battlefield or call of duty, you need a driver, gunner, commander and possibly a loader (has a machinegun). Where you hit the enemy matters as much as what you hit him with (Armor piercing on his front turret will likely bounce, but even a high explosive may hurt if you can hit him up the rear)\n\nStill here... ?\n\nIf I haven't scared you off, here are my personal tips:\n- Play. The. Tutorial.  Like really...\n- Try different graphic settings, shadows especially makes a big difference in enemy visibility (game looks better with them though)\n- Start as infantry and pick rifleman, but remember to join a squad.\n- Find a server that seems to have active admins and have a ruleset you agree with.\n- Try NOT to give up when you die, generally it isn't worth throwing away a ticket to respawn if you have friendlies within 100m. Sometimes it is the right choice, but before you know which is which, it's a good idea to hold on for a medic.\n- Not all squad leaders know what they're doing, do not be afraid to join another squad if it turns out your squad leader is a fool.\n- Defending is often as important (if not more), than attacking... But you may end up waiting 30 minutes without getting shot at or shooting anyone.\n\n\nAs you can probably tell... Squad is a community based game, with in-depth enough mechanics, while also being easily accessable.\nIf you want a good sense of what the game is, check out some lesser known streamer playing it (bigger streamers will often give you the wrong sense of what a game is like)\n\nHope this helped you make an informed decision.\n\nbut for now there are better options out there.",
      "[b][i]AMID EVIL[/i] is very much [i]Quake[/i] 1 level design in a [i]Hexen[/i]/[i]Heretic[/i] universe.[/b] It's well done. We're a bit spoiled this year with outstanding '90s FPS shooters. Personally, I prefer both [i]Ion Maiden[/i] and [i]DUSK[/i] over this title for the following reasons:\n\n1) I find [i]AMID EVIL[/i] to be a bit generic in terms of theme; the fantasy setting could use a bit more to set it apart.\n\n2) I prefer real or low fantasy weapons/guns over wands and totally high fantasy weapons. Now, don't get it twisted - I appreciate that these high fantasy weapons exist, but yeah, they leave something to be desired. I miss reloading and all of that. \n\n3) The level design in [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is much more 'sprawling' (for lack of a better term) just like the original [i]Quake[/i]. Most levels are indoors in what feels like an underground compound (at the time of writing this review). I personally like the backwoods feel of [i]DUSK[/i], or the dystopian cityscape of [i]Ion Maiden[/i] far more. I want to look up at the sky in most levels.\n\n4) The enemy design is different than the other two games I mention, which is good - but they all mostly have a 'same' kind of feel. The enemies are all super fast, so most of your efforts are focused on running backwards while fending them off. It's fun, but gunplay isn't quite as fun as the other two games for this particular reason.\n\n5) The font and overall menu system definitely feels 'Early Access'. I know the font is being worked on, which is desperately needed. \n\n6) My favorite way to play the game is Endless mode - and I feel like that's a flaw in itself. It's the opposite for me with [i]DUSK[/i]. I want to fall in love with the campaign, but eh, there isn't really any story or anything all that interesting to suck me in. The secrets are super easy to find compared to the other two games, too.\n\n7) No multiplayer. Now, I really don't care about this - but who designs a game in this genre without building this in from the ground up? You know the community is going to whine about this. Questionable design decision to say the least.\n\n[b]Well, it sounds like I just dumped all over the game.[/b] Please don't get me wrong. [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is a welcome addition to the genre. The *great news* is that this is not just some reskin of [i]DUSK[/i] - it certainly is it's own thing. And that's really important. \n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+Fairly polished game for Early Access\n+It's the most modern version of the original [i]Quake[/i] we've seen this year\n+Well optimized\n+Lots of content right now\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-The universe is generic\n-No multiplayer\n-The font is too hard to read\n-Music is nothing to write home about\n-The secrets are easy, and there really aren't all that many of them\n-Weapons could use more 'oomph' to them; also we should be able to use the special ability when we want to as opposed to it autotriggering\n\n[b]I was psyched out of my mind for [i]AMID EVIL[/i] - and while it is certainly good - I think I'll be focused more on [i]DUSK[/i] and [i]Ion Maiden[/i].[/b] Because, let's face it, gaming time is valuable and we can't play everything.",
      "Saw a few youtube videos on this and decided to check it out.  Only played 30 min but here's my review from that. \n\nCustomization options are disappointing and boring. All of the character skins were white guys (and a possible vanilla Mexican). The option not to add other races at least to the Allied side is weird. As a gamer, when given the option for customization I expect to be able to create a character I at least somewhat feel represents me so I can get immersed (and don't even talk about 'historical accuracy'). They're also level locked for some reason. The uniforms are basic as they should be and you have a very limited weapon selection depending on the class you choose which is standard for these kinds of games. The character customization is very lacking and the only real reason I see it being there is to create DLC uniforms to buy. \n\nThe game itself seems like it's going in slow motion and maybe it's something people get used to after a while but I couldn't deal with it. The run is more like a speed walk and it feels like the soldier is considering being a conscientious objector with the amount of hesitation in aiming. Also everyone was kind just playing the game like Battlefield anyway.\n\nThis is probably a game that's more fun to play in a serious MilSim community.",

      "This game is extremely addictive for one simple reason: it's a sandbox survival game with zero grind, because everything can be automated.\n\nIn a normal survival game, to craft 100 items, you need to first harvest 100 of some resource.

Meanwhile, the increasing pollution makes the bugs native to the planet increasingly agitated.\n\nAutomation is extended into every single part of the gameplay - you can mass produce buildings, then use robots to place them according to blueprints, transport items with automatic trains, and create complex control networks to let production adapt to demand.

      "Melatonin is a simple rhythm game, with a focus on ease of gameplay and calmer sounds.\nIf you're expecting something on the tougher or more upbeat side, this ain't it.  Ironically, I had more fun as I stopped focusing on scoring well, and more fun when I was just feeling the music and half-asleep.  The sounds and songs are quite relaxing lol.\n\nOn the shorter side of games, it still delivers an enjoyable experience in what it offers. The timing is a *little* on the forgiving side, and there are even accessibility options if you need a little more help, such as timing circles, metronome, and a bigger Perfect window.  If you'd rather go for a challenge, a Perfect only option is also available.\n\nControls are quite simple, using [strike]4[/strike] 3 directional keys and an action key (Space by default). In each tutorial, you're told whether you'll need to hit directional keys or the action key, and whether they're held or not, as well as general timing.  For some stages, the instructions don't give you as good an idea as the tutorial itself/timing circles do (Work and Time levels for me).  All good, but in some levels you get tempo changes in the middle of the song that can throw you a bit off, especially if you're just grooving to the audio cues... when you can hear and distinguish them.  Unfortunately, there are a few levels where the audio cues are either far too similar to each other, or happen too quickly to react to.  This can be a bit of a bummer, as I prefer working off audio for rhythm games, as their focus should be lol.  \n\nWhile Melatonin doesn't bring a whole lot to the table, it doesn't need to.

      "The cognitive dissonance in the original Space Quest games between the box cover art telling you that \"Roger Wilco is hapless!\" and the player's necessary mental exertion involved to solve the puzzles, is laid bare the moment you can type in the name you will be called by in the game.\n\nIt's one of the hardest lines to walk when narrative is the main driver of an interactive work:  balancing the player's actions with the personality of the character they are directing in a world that is clearly alive, regardless of the players's presence.\n\nThe Excavation of Hob's Barrow's succeeds in this fully with the denizens and everyday life of the town of Bewlay.\n\nFrom the moment Thomasina Bateman starts recounting the events that led to her writing a letter to her mother, any ambiguity is dispelled: the player is helping Thomasina relive her time in starkly bucolic Bewlay. But as players spend more time within the memories and stories Thomasina shares, the more off putting the narration becomes. It's not just that Thomasina is an unreliable narrator—the implications of the traumatic events that occured at Hob's Barrow are still a puzzle to be worked out. \n\nThis is the strength of the narrative design and writing in Hob's Barrow: as entertainingly crafted as linear story or film, but with eartnest player engagement required to work out what's happening in the very deep shadows of this cursed place.\n\nThe fantastic writing is supported by equally fantastic pixel art, music, and some of the best voice work I've heard in games…ever? The codgers, critters, and countryside all sound fantastic, the bleakness of the moors churning from peaceful to menacing with expert orchestration. Visual direction is solid, too, with sparingly, effectively used pixel portraits and closeups to highlight details both grotesque and filled with character. The dark undercurrent of humour throughout the game also adds some replayability for achievement hunters: some encounters are worth revisiting!\n\nI played this entirely on Steam Deck, mostly curled up in bed at night, but enjoyed the grand finale while docked on my TV.

The first playthrough reveals only a small slice of all this, leaving a collection of unsolved mysteries and unfollowed leads to pursue on the second. The second playthrough prepares you for the third, and so on, until finally you beat the game... but there's much more to it than that. Vague, but I don't want to spoil anything.\n\nThis game was released today without any kind of announcement beforehand from inkle. As usual, their writing and design are superb. If you're captivated by the premise, even by a little, you won't regret the purchase.",
      "It's one of my favorite games of all time, yet I cannot recommend it. And it pains me.\n\nLike many others, I think that the latest update, alpha 17, was a huge step in the wrong direction. Instead of being a zombie-survival game with awesome building mechanics where you could build huge and massive bases, it simply became a zombie-killing grindfest, where bases don’t matter, because zombies chew through concrete like it was nothing.\n\nAlso, don't get me started on the zombie AI. It was fine in alpha 16 and the zombies acted as you would expect; dumb. In alpha 17, the pathing of the AI is just ridiculous, where the zombies are able to estimate the path of least resistance, as if they were not only sapient, but extremely intelligent. This has led to the current base building-meta; mazes and ramps. /facepalm\n\nThe skill system was utterly destroyed as well. In Alpha 16, you could improve cardio by running, you could improve mining-efficiency by, well mining - so on so forth. Now, you just kill zombies to gain exp, get perk points and then spend said perk points. To be fair, they have buffed exp gains from other activities recently, but you still simply gain and spend perk points - yet another horrible downgrade.\n\nAlso, let’s talk about loot. In Alpha 16 you could loot items ranging from quality 1 to 600. Weapons and certain tools had components of individual quality that you could then combine to form said weapon/tool, that would have the average quality level of said parts. The quality would determine the damage/durability of the weapon etc. This system was great and gave an incitement to go out in the world and continue to loot, even if you had, say the AK47, because you could improve it vastly by finding better parts. This has been replaced by a system where all weapons/tools are looted whole in a quality system ranging from 1 to 6. Yes, 1 to 6. Minimal difference in damage/durability, but hey, at least you can attach mods to the weapons now. The amount of mods you can attach are determined by the level of the item. You can now improve the damage of your rifle by painting it in another color. Great…\n\nThe performance of the game… hehehehe. All the new textures and lighting of A17 has brought so many performance issues, and yet again, it used to be just fine in Alpha 16. Don’t bother mentioning it to the devs, they’ll just give you a douchy response about your rig being a potato, even though you’re running with high-end parts. \n\nIn conclusion, no I would not recommend the game. However, you can opt in for playing Alpha 16, which I would recommend – if you can accept that the game might never evolve any further.",
      "This is such a faithful recreation of Star Ocean 2, I don't think I'll ever even consider playing the PS1 original, or the PSP remake.

      "No matter what the reviews say, this game is pretty excellent.\nGameplay wise its pretty good, the match 3 systems are fun and almost exciting to play at times.\nTheres no sex, which isn't a bad thing as if thats what you're looking for just search for it online lol\nThe stories are good and the designs are pretty, sure it's short but it fits the pricepoint.\n\nThe developers have announced that they've gone bankrupt which is a shame but what can you do.\n\nOverall 8/10",
      "Besides the rocky and terrible launch of this game, then the atrocious \"balance\" changes, now your making a DLC that costs as much as the game? Is it a whole new game? The answer is no, and even if it was, the way you handled this games issues makes me wish I could refund this game and remove your games from showing in my store. I hope no one buys the DLC honestly, I know at least I won't.\n\nIf you want a review of the game, yes, they did seem to iron out most of the issues, however since I haven't played in quite awhile due to me spending too much time apparently gearing my techromancer just to come back and am unable to handle what I could before the \"balancing\", has turned me away from this game. Reducing a classes viability or power in a PVE/CO-OP game boggles my mind. It's like saying, \"Oh you don't like the other classes since they do less damage and are harder to accomplish the same goals? Well let me crush your class into the ground so they all feel the same. Have fun!\"",
      "Stellaris is the contemporary 4X sci fi galactic empire grand strategy to play.  The spiritual successor to ancient space exploration games like Master of Orion and Star Wars: Rebellion.  Start out with just your homeworld and send out scout ships and colonies until you've got your own star empire. \n\nManage your population, tell them what to build, design your own spaceships and fleet structures, and then get pounded into the dirt by the far too cheaty AI... yeah, it's another one of those games where because it's hard to make the AI smart, Paradox decided instead to just make the AI units cheat and become ridiculously overpowered.\n\nI have to say the game is probably far too difficult even if you set all the difficulty to the easiest levels, it's unclear what the developers were thinking, but you can mod the game easily in Steam Workshop to make it viable to play single player. \n\nAs with all Paradox games the DLC pricing is murder, and it adds very little to the core game experience, so my advice is to grab this on sale if you were a fan of MOO, go straight to Steam Workshop and mod it until it's playable, and then you'll have a perfect time sink well worth your money.",
      "Absolutely Don't understand all the negative reviews for this game. \n\nFirst off: this game is a RogueLite in that death is permanent, be prepared for this. Death is a part of the game and you are NOT losing progress by dying.. it's death mechanic is very much like Rogue Legacy in that you keep progress that carries on to your next character when you begin again. Dying also isn't like you lost more than 45 minutes of your time. Every single game in this genre will have plenty of deaths involved before you FINALLY get that first win (in most cases). Some people are going to need to spend some time grinding levels, dying and repeat until they have enough sticker slots open to overpower things. Keep that in mind going into it. You retain your level and any big upgrades you acquire when you die so you are NOT starting from scratch every single time like you would in most rogue likes. \n\nI normally wouldn't review a game so early but I saw the negative reviews pouring in and felt I needed to add some counters to it. \n\nThe second thing: the art/music/atmosphere is absolutely brilliant for a game in this genre where most games of this nature tend to be relatively grim. As with most roguelike/lites its procedurally generated so the map, enemies and what have you will be different each time. \n\nThird: the forced timer before you have to fight the boss is a bit jarring at first as i've never played a game of this type where I have limited time to actually get there.. but it's kind of brilliant really because it adds a completely different layer to the game in that you have to manage your time very well. What do you think you have time to do before the inevitable? Do you want to run around and grind exp killing trash mobs? Or do you think that time could be better spent knocking some dungeons out (time halts when in dungeons so take your time in these) and getting some gear and arguably more exp than you would just wandering the map. Also, you absolutely have plenty of time to explore the map as there are shrines (you have to find them but the map isn't huge), that you can pay a special currency to add another day of time to the clock. If you see a review complaining about the timer and they have less than an hour in the game... take that with a grain of salt. \n\nFour: The combat is pretty simple but well done. There is a surprising amount of depth to it as well when you start buying and finding more powerful weapons (toys) that can do a variety of things and synergize pretty well together. Enemy variety is pretty good so far, each time you level up it adds more enemy variety to encounter around the map. \n\nFive: dungeons are fairly simple and a good mix of mini puzzles and fun combat encounters. \n\nIf you enjoy roguelike/lite games DEFINITELY give this a spot in your library to see what it has to offer. So far I'd put it 8-9/10 but I don't quite have the amount of time necessary to feel comfortable ranking it against other rogue games. I may edit this once I get to a point to see how much replayability it has but until then I'm eager to keep sending swords into a meat grinder and just adding to my power each time. Please look at how much time people have in a game before rating their reviews and taking their word. .5 hours is not enough time to really warrant a helpful review... nor is 6 in my case but I really don't want this game to be DoA\n\nEdit: Just beat Mormo for the second time.. trust me when i say you can make the timer go on infinitely. I Don't want to spoil anything BUT head to dungeons and kill as many enemies as you can to save up gold and another currency, and make a good loop around each area of the map and you'll find all sorts of neat things. As for bugs, I've had none and I'm at 13 hours of steady play. Don't waste time killing EVERY enemy that's in the open areas cause that will eat too much of your time, but focus on finding dungeons and the hidden npc encounters. I had my timer extended to approx. 8 days in game time and I also found a way to permanently increase the amount of time I have on subsequent runs. Give it a chance, learn how the game works before being upset about the timer.",
      "As a historical novelist and former high school English teacher with over 700 books in my home devoted to ancient Greek literature, history and culture I had to try this game.\n\nI should mention that I am pushing 60 years old and although I like strategy games like Creative Assembly’s Rome II, I’m not a fan of ‘gopher’ games that make you run around collecting items, rescuing damsels in distress, delivering messages, and murdering politicians to level your character.  The whole premises seems rather tedious and unimaginative.  \n\nSo right from the start I expected to hate Assassin’s Creed Odyssey.  Combine that with the fact that I’d never played an Assassin’s Creed game before, and I am not the most nimble finger clicker, I was prepared to spend a good portion of my playing time getting my head lopped off.  \n\nNone of that happened.  Well, yeah, there is a pretty steep learning curve here.  I did spend a lot of my initial hours zigging when I should have been zagging, and with my opponent’s spear in my head, but I stuck with it and eventually even an old poop like me was able to figure out the mechanics.\n\nWhat kept me going was the sheer majesty of the game and the beauty of the surroundings.  \n\nI’ve been to Athens, Sparta, Argos, Mycenae, Delos, Aegina, Hydra, Crete, Melos (now Santorini), and dozens of other locales on the campaign map multiple times.  I’ve walked around the ruins at Delphi, strolled the docks of Piraeus and walked through valley of Laconia for research for my books.  I wanted to see these places at they might have looked 2,500 years ago and that for me is the true joy of Assassin’s Creed Odyssey.\n\nThe team at Ubisoft deserves a lot of credit.  They did their homework.  Sure, you’d expect to see historical figures like Pericles, Socrates, Alcibiades and Archidamas in a game about the Peloponnesian War.  But that anyone outside of academia even knows who Brasidas, Aspasia, Herodotus and Pausanias were, is impressive.  Kudos to you.\n\nI’m probably an oddball gamer because I was not motivated by stabbing people in the back to gain levels and steal loot.  The entire idea of stabbing people in the back goes against the grain of the Greek ethos of ‘kleos’ or honor.  What kept me going was the desire to see more of the world that Ubisoft created.  \n\nI wanted to visit the Athenian Acropolis and see the Propylaea, Erechtheion and Parthenon as they were shiny and new, instead of in piles of rubble.  I wanted to gaze up at Phidias' statue of Zeus in Olympus (one of the wonders of the ancient Greek world that no longer exists), speak to the Pythia at the temple of Delphi, and see the five villages of Sparta as they might have looked.  Getting to walk the streets of Athens, Argos and Elis was like taking a trip back in time.  Magical.\n\nOkay, the game isn’t perfect.  The pronunciation of common names like Pericles and Socrates and the character’s accents were maddening.  I can only guess that Ubisoft believes we’ve Americanized the real pronunciations, or at least I hope that’s what they were thinking.  Ultimately it’s a minor annoyance.\n\nThe hoplite battles were a major disappointment.  The Greeks fought in a phalanx formation.  Shoulder to shoulder.  Shield to shield.  The battles here are a 300 movie style free for all.  Oh well, guess you can’t have everything.  \n\nAlso I could not fathom how Alexios and Kassandra could be descended from Leonidas, but have no connection to the Agiad royal family.  By rights they should have been Pausanias’ cousins, but they’re not.  I don’t know who they are. The whole Pythagoras-is-my-father thing is rather bizarre and makes no sense at all.  \n\nI won’t go off the charts here listing the historical inaccuracies that drove me batsh!t crazy, as it serves no purpose.  Suffice it to say that I enjoyed the game.  \n\nIf you ever wanted to unravel the labyrinth of the minotaur beneath King Minos palace at Knossos, get drunk and sing songs with Socrates at an Athenian symposium, feel the Aegean Sea roll beneath your feet on the deck of a  trireme, or stare out in wonder at the lights twinkling over Attica at twilight, try this game.  You won’t be disappointed.",
      "Stress: The videogame.\n\nBut in all seriousness, Isaac is an awesome roguelike game with infinite replayability. It's tough at first but as you get better at the game you will appreciate it more and more for the unique experience it provides. Every run feels different and even after getting close to 2k hours of playtime I still discover new things.\n\nAll DLC, and especially the latest of them - Repentance - introduce a ton of new content on top of the already existing one.\nThere are 34 characters in total, over 600 steam achievements and 3 save files to choose from.\n\nOn top of that, the game features a community workshop with countless great mods that add Quality of Life improvements and new features for every taste.\n\nIf you enjoy roguelikes or are looking for a game with great replay value then I can wholeheartedly recommend Isaac to you.",

I'll be playing it until the day I die.\n\nBut if you're new to the game, and not established on Arena, don't pick it up. It's horrendously difficult to build a collection in this game, doubly so if you're not a fan of playing draft. While they have made incredibly minor adjustments that have been generally positive, the economy on this platform is impossible to do well in. The sheer number of games you have to play to amass any kind of respectable, and more importantly, functional collection of cards is not worth it for just a casual player.\n\nOf course, you can circumvent the grind with money, but that of course is the literal definition of Pay 2 Win.

The storylines, filled with genuine human drama.\nI also must commend the game's sound design.",
      "TL;DR: This game didn't receive a similar love and praise than Undertale because potato. Play it.\n\n------\n\nIf you're reading this, I already like you and I already think you have a good taste in videogames.\n\nOneShot is one of those little surprises you might have heard of but always keep pushing onto your backlog, assuming other games should have more priority. Eventually I decided to try it out and it took just a few minutes to regret all those delays.\n\nIt is extremely hard to give you some useful information about OneShot without spoiling the heck out of it. You start the game in a dark, small bedroom where the main character (Niko) simply wakes up. That's it. By simply walking around and interacting with elements you soon get some clue of the mechanics that will be present through the whole game and how to progress. \n\nAnd you will also see why this game is special. \n\nWhat the game attempts is probably not new to you. It has constant elements of surprise but many other titles (Undertale as the easiest example) have done so too. When the idea is saturated, it gets harder to eventually fulfill its purpose and, well, surprise the player. \n\nOneShot is the game that will surprise you no matter what. \n\nThrough a simplistic but engaging plot, amazing and memorable soundtrack, and interesting dialogues you'll get yourself into a journey you won't regret. I wish I could give you more details but like many other reviews here, I feel like I would ruin the experience for you. The best I can do is to assure you that you will easily feel like us: that this title is an incredible gem and that you will feel bad for giving it a chance so late.",
      "Where to start.... in short entire game is boring and very slow paced for no aparent reason.\n\nAI: AI performs only very basic functions and does not upgrade buildings and does the opposite of whats beneficial for your empire. AI does not do very well when engaging in displomacy.\n\nUI: You will spend most of your time trying to manage/hover around very CLUMSY and absolutely disgusting UI. Other 4x games offer far superior UI and make is easier to manage your asset on the field e.g. Sword of the stars II, Star Ruler 2, Distant world, Endless Legends, Endless Space etc.\n\nGFX: Graphics are not the top notch what you would expect from a modern 4x game but they are on far with Endless Legends. GFX leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nAlien Races: I dont need to say much but like Planets most of the races are COPY / PASTE. Nothing unique or special about each. \n\nMP: Multiplayer has a mind of its own and in most cases wont let you join public games unless its a private game.\n\nStellaris bring nothing new to 4x Genre in 2016!.\n Right now everyone is almost beta testing for the developers so we can find bugs, report them  and help them fix their game.

      "First of all - Subnautica is a good game. Very atmospheric, very scary and overall a really overwhelming experience. At first. \nThis might be the only negative review in this month, but I think some of you might appreciate a different view than \"omg this game is just awesome\". Which it kinda is, but in some points it maybe isnt.\n\nThis first section of the review doesnt contain any major spoilers for the story, just a comment on the overall progress through the game stages.\nAt the time of writing this review, I played the game for ~ 35 hours, I have advanced quite a bit. The first few hours were fantastic, I was looking for new things to explore, the blueprints for all the stuff that I need and every new thing felt like I made a progress. But then at a certain point nothing new happend. It seemed to me like I had all resources I could ever need (even the blue crystals), I had all the vehicles you could build, all the upgrades I needed.\nAnd then there was no challenge anymore. You build your submarines, your bases and the game gets too easy, its not a challenge anymore. Don't continue reading after this point, if you havent played the game yet.\n\n[spoiler] The big strength of this game is the immersion in the seemingly endless underwater worlds. But at a certain point this immersion breaks (at least it did for me).\nNone of the monsters can really harm you, not even the biggest ones are a real threat. Just hop into you seamoth and out-speed everything. If there is a leviathan, just hug the walls or strave, they cant catch you. And if they do, just step out, repair your ship and continue. None of the threats is really dangerous. You really need to have bad luck to die. And if you do ... nothing happens. You just respawn.\nAt first the map seems endless, since you cant move fast. But once you get the seamoth, the map is very finite. Sure, there are deeper levels you cant access with the moth, but everything on the surface is within reach. Its the same with the deeper levels and the prawnsuit.\nSurvival is hard at first, since you constantly need to get water and food. Once you can plant you own food, you have unlimited supply and the survival aspect becomes just an annoyence.\n\nAnother thing that bothers me is the amount of resources you need to build stuff. In the later part of the game you need to build a giant structure. But the necessary resources are just like \"get 3 wooden planks, 2 nails and a hammer\". And with these resources you build the statue of liberty.\n\nMy last point is about the storyline. After something like 15 hours into the game there was a major stall for me - I had no clue where to go, to me it seemed like I searched everything I had access to at that time. I searched for 10 hours and found nothing. I went to the Islands twice to check if I missed anything, but no. I dont know, maybe I just had bad luck and something didnt trigger right, I missed a hint somewhere or something. It eventually went on, but on that point I already had the big submarine, the prawnsuit and everything. The story felt like I just need to run from A to B and back, there was no challenge anymore. \n [/spoiler]\n\nSo anyways. If you made it this far in the review, thanks for reading. If you disagree with me, thats totally fine for me. I don't want to ruin the game for anyone, maybe the points that bother me dont mean much to you.\nI know that my critique is pretty harsh. There are many positive aspects in this game. If you can really dive into this game and fully roleplay it, submerge in its story and ignore some flaws, this is a fantastic game.\nBut maybe some of you are like me, so some of my mentioned points could bother you too.\nThanks for reading, I hope I didnt butcher the English language too badly, feel free to comment, if you like.",

      "I hated Undertale.\n\nIt was, pretty clearly, a game about sexy skeletons. I did not care about sexy skeletons. I refused to play a game about sexy skeletons.\n\nThen my friend made me listen to the soundtrack, and I decided I could deal with a few hours of sexy skeletons if I got to listen to the best video game music I had ever heard while doing it. \n\nI played Undertale. It's not a game about sexy skeletons. It's a game about choices, maybe, or morality, or curiosity. It's a game about pushing the limits. It's a game about experiences, about \"what would happen if I did this?\", about storytelling so intricate and complex and raw that it shouldn't be able to fit into seven hours of bullet hell and pixel graphics. But, somehow, it does. Every choice you make has an impact. Every object you check has a story. The soundtrack, the witty yet profound writing, the simple pixel graphics, and even the menu screens and bullet patterns themselves all intertwine in order to tell a story that only you decide the ending of.\n\nAlso, the skeletons aren't even sexy.\n\nMy advice to you: Go in as blind as you can. Don't read walkthroughs. Don't watch playthroughs. Don't prepare yourself. Don't even look at overviews. Hell, don't even read the Steam page description. Just buy the game (and give some well-earned money to a little white dog), and, as it were, climb the mountain yourself. Don't let anyone backseat. Don't listen to people who tell you there's a right way to play.\n\nAnd when you think you've reached the end, just think--what other choices could you have made?\n\nSo, yes. I hated Undertale.\n\nAnd then I played it.",
      "There's a lot to like about Control, and I'm glad I played it. It's unfortunate how often I found myself thinking, \"they shouldn't have bothered\". The environments and level design are quite good, and I liked poking around and finding lore. I can't avoid mentioning the destruction physics and graphics, which were beautiful, impressive, and made me feel like I was actually destroying the world around me. The story and characterization are decent, with par for the course voice acting for a video game. The game is a fine length with plenty of levels and missions. Overall, Control is a solid game that's worth trying.\n\nThe gunplay is another story. While levitating, dashing, launching, seizing, shielding, and the other combat powers you have at your disposal felt effective and even enjoyable at times (especially launch), the guns never felt right in any of their incarnations. The visual effects of the service weapons as they shapeshift are a nice touch, though many of them feel either inaccurate or unable to rise to the task, damage-wise. For magic guns they felt very much like something was missing, and could have used some more work. For a game with so much of its duration devoted to combat, it doesn't feel like gunplay got its fair share.\n\nWith such anemic gunplay, I was surprised to see a skill tree, crafting, and randomized mods complete with a rarity system. This is where \"they shouldn't have bothered\" comes in. The skill tree is utterly boring, being mostly +X% to a stat with the occasional ability upgrade that could have been a quest reward. With an expensive reset cost and the fact that you'll be able to nearly max out everything, the skill tree doesn't exactly play into buildcrafting. Then again, neither do the mods. \n\nWhen I say \"randomized mods\", I mean in the style of an MMO. Each mod has a random stat and then a random buff to that stat within a range, depending on its rarity. These things are everywhere, trip over a box and you'll find three. I feel that this system makes little sense for this game. Especially with the DLC mods, there are so many different effects that you'll find it difficult to create a specific \"build\" and will probably stick to the core stats like damage, hp, energy, etc. It's a thin veneer of progression that wouldn't be out of place in a multiplayer game, RPG, or MMO.\n\nSo say you want to engage with the mod system and flesh out a \"build\". Well, the jukebox has you covered. After you've farmed up or crafted some coins (tickets), you can pay to enter a repeatable mission and earn some random mods. This is the exact same mission every time you play it. It's not even changed procedurally or set in different areas of the game. It's the exact same level, the same objectives, the same enemies, the same boss, etc., every single time you play it. This mission is designed to be farmed. It's not the only farming you're encouraged to do, either. What's worse, as you play, your tiny inventory quickly fills up and you'll find yourself stopping after each mission (or in the middle of a mission) to do inventory management. Compare mods, equip mods, delete mods, farm mods, fill up your inventory... it's not an engaging system. They simply shouldn't have bothered.\n\nControl is at its best when it's being a single player game, with environments and worldbuilding that suck you in, with exploration and lore, and with the missions and duties of being the director. Control is at its worst when it thinks it's a multiplayer game, with boring skill trees, mods, crafting, and inventory management. It's so needless and mars what would otherwise be a perfectly serviceable game (save the service weapons).",

      "Overall its a great hunting game. The base game is good enough on its own to give you an enjoyable experience hunting several varieties of animals. \n\nI feel that some of the best content is in the DLC's. I dont mind the price tag for maps are they are just a large and some of them have a truly diverse animal population. \n\nThe Weapon Packs have some items that really should have been available in the base game (.22 rifle).\nTripod stands, Tents and ATV's are also DLC items that i feel should have been included in the base game. \n\nThe cost for these packs are not huge, and I have bought them, but they really do impact your play in a meaningful way so it is hard not feel like they were left out on purpose. \n\nBeing a former hunter in real life I would say that the realism of it is pretty good. Lung shots and heart shots drop animals quickly and using the right ammo along with good aim greatly influences this. A poor shot will leave you tracking this wounded animal across the map till you sneak up on it again or just give up. \n\nThey have a system called Tru Racks (sumthn like that) that simulates different qualities of animals. So you end up with little bucks, average bucks, and monster bucks. Weight and coloration plays a part in this too. In short every animal has a trophy of some kind and they are varied by what must be some sort of RNG. \n\nAll that having been said, this game can devolve into a shooting gallery were you kill everything on sight as there in no real incentive not to. You get money and experience for every kill you claim and wiping out a heard of deer with your DLC M1 Garand on your DLC Tripod Stand becomes the quickest way to bypass the grind.\n\n It feels like the game starts as a \"hunting sim\" and becomes a \"poaching sim\" once you realize the progression system is going to take a long time to do...\"ethically?\".\n\n\nAgain, this is a game i would recommend, but it is just that, a game. \n\n",
      "2023...\n\n2 years...\n\n2 Languages...\n\nEDIT:\n\nTLDR: Game is too simple, better get Factorio or Riftbreaker\n\n\nPlayed again after ~1 year, nothing has changed in the basic QoL or coding system.\n\n\n- It still uses an older builder system than Factorio did 10 years ago: you actually have to craft the base material manually every time before you can build the building, instead of it being done automatically by a simple click on the building in the build menu.\n\n- If you have crafting orders set, new items added to your inventory will not be read by the current crafting orders and keeps on produce stuff your already own...\n\n- Items don't have their own output for transport lines, but instead require this stupid additional output... (I think the developer couldn't create a better output than this simple one)\n\n\n20 minutes and that's enough for me for now, I'm not putting in any more effort for EA project",

      "We need a 60fps patch ASAP. Having 30fps content on PC in [current year] is not acceptable.\n\nOther than that the game is pretty solid! It looks great, it plays great, the story was good imo, the characters are interesting and the amount of solo content is decent.\n\nHowever, the gear system is not as elaborate as in Mk11 and the microtransations are NOT a welcome sight. Denuvo also has to go. If Harada agreed that the addition of Denuvo in Tekken 7 was a mistake, so should NetherRealm.\nI also don't like that 2 characters that are going to be in the Kombat Pass are already in the game (Ermac and Quan Chi). Just give us these characters and come up with other ones for the KP. This is super greedy and lazy.\nIt's even worse than Sektor and Cyrax in MK11, at least you didn't let us play them, period. this time you decide to not make them playable (even thought they work for the AI) AND sell them at a later date? That's awful.\n\nThe game is good but needs improvement and shouldn't ship with performance issues, 30fps content, microtransactions, Denuvo and greedy DLC tactics.

      "Yeah sooooo I went 1k words past the max...had to pare this down...it's ok...I'm mentally stable...\n\nCrossCode is a top-notch indie in its genre. I'd mention it in the same breath as Celeste, Hades, and Outer Wilds. (guess I just did.) If you can at least enjoy both puzzles and real-time combat, this game is for you; it's not as much of a JRPG as it might look. The only real flaw I care to levy is that it isn’t incredible out of the gate; it’s merely good, and gets much better. I was going to summarize my reactions and add a \"what is the premise/gameplay loop\" section and have longer sections but I had to cut it all out so have _/5 ratings on the section titles instead. It's fine. I'm fine. Everything is fine.\n\nOk, review time.\n\nSTORY 4/5 NEATO\n\nThe story is great, and not quite what you might expect. It starts pretty light and cozy, with solid (and often meta) humor interspersed with cryptic moments. I like how casually the in-universe MMO is treated by the players. I enjoyed all the characters, including our mostly-mute but personable Lea. Once it ramps up, the story takes some exciting turns, too; the devs really know how to do drama without doing overdrama. I didn't relate too much to the story but I think it was told quite well. I like the portrayal of the antagonists for the most part, though I wish I could have felt their presence more often. The lore is also fascinating, if occasionally hard to grasp because the line between real and virtual is very thin due to the game’s particular premise. (The difference between real people and NPCs is sometimes unclear, for instance.) The ending was good, but I think the DLC epilogue wraps the game up far better.\n\nCOMBAT 5/5 WOWIE\n\nWhen you start out, combat feels almost hack-n-slashy. You can spam melee attacks and bullets for days, but you also have a charged projectile, a dodge-dash, and a shield. The elemental modes are absolutely the highlight due to the way enemies work, and the sort of limiter gauge they have forces strategy. Special moves are stylish and borderline absurd at higher levels. A huge skill tree controls them and much more; unlike some skill trees, this one requires choices, which is always a good sign. Oh and consumables are your main source of healing and buffs, and they aren't overpowered! Balancing win.\n\nThe enemies are really what make the combat fantastic. Almost every enemy has at least one gimmick and one visible weakness. The stun gauge mechanic is vital to all battles, forcing you to exploit those weaknesses to stun enemies and give you time to use your extra-long special moves. Bosses love to give you iterative micro-puzzles to fill their stun gauges, while minibosses are comfortably in-between. Bosses commonly have armor or invulnerability when not stunned, forcing even overleveled players to figure out the micro-puzzles to hit hard. (More great balancing.) Most weaknesses involve the element system, eventually encouraging you to swap elements multiple times mid-fight. The micro-puzzles will build on what you’ve been learning in a dungeon if it’s a dungeon fight. I'll mention that some normal enemies do feel like damage sponges at first, but you'll get used to this; the simple enemy design in the early game makes it seem worse than it is imo.\n\nPUZZLES 5/5 FUN COOL\n\nFor puzzles you've got your common environmental \"platforming\" puzzles, your specialized quest puzzles, your dynamic mini-puzzles in battles, and your iterative puzzling gauntlets in dungeons. Also almost everything is secretly part puzzle? Like, everything. They're an invasive species. They draw most of their complexity from the element system too. Each element has its own effects on certain objects and structures, and mainly you use charge shots to interact, though each attack has its own uses. Not much to say here; they're great puzzles. A couple may stump you for a while, but that's impossible to avoid, and I think CrossCode strikes a perfect challenge balance.\n\nQUESTS 5/5 WHEEEEEE\n\nWhile some quests conform to the typical hunting/gathering quests of MMOs, most boast some entirely unique content. Challenges range from unique bosses to puzzles to platforming to other familiar gimmicks that are secretly also puzzles. I won't spoil them. Quests generally use mechanics you have seen already in new, often very different, scenarios. NPCs are mostly there to be amusing or set up the gameplay, and that didn't bother me tbh.\n\nITEM MANAGEMENT 5/5 AAAAA\n\nItem and equipment acquisition? Engaging? WTF? Technically you get them like you do in any RPG. But, rare plants have high rare item drop rates, so if you know the platforming puzzle to reach em you don't have to waste much time. Enemies' drop rates rise with a high Combat Rank, which you get by killing many enemies in a row before the post-fight cooldown period ends and you get to heal to full and level up. This is tough until you're very comfortable with the area. Once you are, it's a whole new way of battling, using area knowledge to string together sequential fights. And what does the game do but give you a piece of upgradable equipment that grants the Combat Rating bonus to plants too?\n\nI actually cared about the equipment in the game too! *kisses Life Fiber Uniform* (yes they really make this reference) Equipment also matters more than level so the devs can control your power level better. Most times you can buy some basic equipment to explore, then return with items to trade to NPCs for stronger gear. Stronger gear has unique traits and you might prefer one over another, so it's nice that with trading you get to focus your resources on what you want. Sometimes you can trade some enemy drops for other ones, as I recall, which is a nice...uh, trade-off to get to make.\n\nQUALITY OF LIFE 5/5 HELP\n\nCONVENIENCE REIGNS in CrossCode. Text log like in visual novels? Check. Encyclopedia of story recaps, character summaries, CrossWorlds lore & terminology, etc.? Check. Enemy index? Check. Item drop rates? Check. Available trades? You beck. This is EXTREMELY helpful for an RPG, which otherwise would require a guide or plain luck to find rare item drops. Oh yeah also there's UI? I forgot about it cuz it's really good. Also the keyboard controls for swapping elements are a bit janky but I managed.\n\nAesthetics 3/5-5/5 SUBJECTIVITY WOOOOOO\n\nYeah if ya like what you see in the trailers and screenshots, that oughta be enough. I thought the art was average-good in the beginning, but like everything else the art improves as you go. They must’ve gone back and worked on old stuff, but not too much. The music is great. No complaints there. My one objective critique is, Lea has no depth perception -- the art makes similar-height platforms look identical. I ran into so many walls and stared at so many small flat gaps I thought I couldn't cross. I'm not a fool! It's the game's fault! But actually this time!\n\nA NEW HOME DLC 6/5 WTF OMG\n\nThe paid DLC is The Culmination of CrossCode. The epilogue is complex and fascinating and rewarding. The dungeon is an incredible all-elements send-off. I adore the new quests. And the art?? The environments, the enemies, the NPC portraits are all so pretty. Don't be fooled by the letters \"DLC\": this is not Discretionary Leisure Content. If you liked the base game, this is...Deluxe...eLite...C-content??? look these are not great letters to work with ok\n\nCONCDLUDSIONO\n\nWhat else to say? CrossCode good. Buy it. Do the thing. Also, look out for Project Terra, Radical Fish's next project. It translates their current style into a 3D environment with dynamic lighting. It’s pretty & it reduces that height perspective issue. There isn’t much info about it out yet, but keep your eyes out! (figuratively pls) I'm excited for what they'll come up with.\n\nHOLY **** I MADE IT AND WITH CHARACTERS TO SPARE YESSSS — ohnowai",

      "I have it on the Epic store but the amount of stuttering it has made it unplayable so I gave up. I got the Humble choice for $6 to get a steam key and try it on here because I have a few games on steam that run well but run poorly on other platforms like the awful Windows store or the below average Epic launcher, but it's unfortunately the same deal on here for this game. It has done it on two entirely different computer setups for me so that tells me that they didn't bother to spend enough time testing enough different pc setup combinations when it was in development, and my pc setup isn't rare by any means. The look and functioning of the UI and menu's shows that it is a obvious direct console port which would explain their lack of attention to the pc version.\n\nEven giving it a fair shot based on content, it's pretty much just a modified version of Borderlands 2. The amount of dialogue is unbearable. No one in the game EVER shuts up, and every single last word they say is cringe. It's like a kid in fifth grade who laughs at fart jokes wrote the entire script. In addition to everyone never shutting up, the main boss randomly has page-long speeches over the radio just to make sure you get the message that they want you to feel entirely uncomfortable at this game's bottomless amount of cringe.\n\nThe gameplay is identical to BL2, with the only real new noticeable features being that some guns have two functions that you can toggle on and off with the C key and of course the new playable characters. However even without the stuttering ruining the game for me, it's my opinion that BL3's negatives, mainly the insane amount of neverending dialogue and how unbelievably cringe it is, overshadow its positives.",

      "I'm gonna be talking about the game in very broad strokes so don't worry about spoilers. \n\nI'm bananas about the Dead Space series. The experience of playing the original in 2009 or so left a massive impression on me and I think this is overall a pretty fantastic update. I've played the original [strike] trilogy [/strike] duology to death on every system, listened to stuff, looked at stuff, everything. So as someone who has Nicole's monologue burnt into the back of my eyelids, I was pretty sceptical Motive would be able to win me over with Dead Space 23. I was very pleasantly surprised, though. It's clear a lot of love and care went into refining Dead Space for the remake and in many ways I find these refinements make the setting, characters, and mysteries all a lot more compelling. \n\nOn the lead up to release there was an IGN series of short interviews with developers, artists, writers, etc working on the remake. It was really fascinating hearing about how they were approaching different aspects of the project, there's a lot of interesting insights about the aesthetic and thematic goals of the game in there that get me really craving a Dead Space 23 art book. If you're sceptical about Dead Space 23, I think they're worth a watch. It's really striking how thoughtful they've been in creating their take on Dead Space and I don't think their efforts deserve to go so easily overlooked. If you're really interested in the artistry of the series I'd also highly recommend The Art of Dead Space, it's a great book and an amazing collection of art that really lays bare the core identity of the series. It's been a great companion piece to Dead Space 23.  I think a lot of people have been comparing the choices and artistic aims of the original team and the new devs in bad faith, I really can't see anything but reverence for the source material here. I'd also say that the differences that are there are interesting and well worth exploring!\n\nI'm also glad Dead Space has room to breathe again, EA really pushed the extended universe the first time around and I'm glad to see that mistake hasn't been repeated. I'm not someone who's super into lore, I like finding extra information that re-contextualises things in cool ways but this extended universe stuff can get pretty silly. There were animated movies, books, tie-in games, a Wii rail shooter (which I enjoyed) and most of it just served to undermine the setting and the horror for me. That isn't to say the remake shies away from its roots because it absolutely doesn't, there's an entire New Game+ path that I think incorporates a direct reference to one of the extended universe novels. If you're a lorehead you'll definitely recognise familiar names in text logs, even very forgettable characters get some mentions in. I really love this about the remake, it reincorporates a lot of this disparate stuff into more of a coherent whole. \n\nI think my favourite addition is the AI director that manages encounters and atmospheric effects. Dead Space is a game that invokes hypervigilance, I think that's part of what makes the series so compelling. You're always alert, always listening and watching, always looking over your shoulder. It has an intensity that I feel is absolutely unmatched. With the AI director in the mix that feeling is sharper than ever. You can't rely on memory alone to get you through now. Yeah, you can still memorise spawns and there are still an abundance of scripted encounters but you can never safely bet you know what's coming and when. Sometimes the lights will flicker and steam will hiss from the pipes- nothing. But sometimes a pregnant and most of a divider will be waiting for you right by the shop. You can truly never assume you're safe, that feeling is no longer illusory as it was in Dead Space 2008. I think that's great. I also found that the director would spawn interesting combinations of enemy types which is cool, it went a long way to making the threat more unpredictable. \n\nI never really experienced any of the performance issues everyone else is talking about so I think my main issue with the game is very petty. I flat out do not like the redesign of the Soldier rig. They look like those guys who're really into Mandalorian themed tactical gear and Punisher stuff. So, yeah, not sure if that's an intentional update to reflect reality but, aesthetically speaking, I found it very jarring. \n\nI think this is a very solid foundation to build on to bring back the Dead Space series. I hope in the future there might be more challenge modes, higher difficulties, more unlockable suits. Most of all though I hope Motive, like their predecessors, take some pointers from the Resident Evil games. I'm a big fan of the records system in the recent Resident Evil titles. It contributes enormously to replayability and it's neat getting to examine all the models, animations, concept art, all the good stuff. As someone who likes crafts and fan projects, something like that would be indispensable. it's all work that very much deserves to be admired, too. Some of the detail on the necromorphs is ludicrous. A records system would also be a great excuse to do wild runs like beating the game without healing or opening the shop. Just give me a reason, Motive.\n\nThere are thousands of things about this remake that I could just keep gushing about. Maybe I'll update this review over time and do just that (I have). But I hope for now this review has gone some way to convincing you to try out Dead Space. \n\nTanya Clarke killed it as Nicole, too.",
      "Such a neat concept!  Clear the table under so many \"strokes\".  Where it really shines, however, is all of the surreal bits you can add into your game like giant balls, conveyor belts, or balls that split when hit.  The game always has many challenges to complete that will require you to use the indicated table/ball/modifier and meet its requirements on your run (like make 3 long shots in a single run or pot multiple balls in a single shot).  Complete enough of these challenges and you'll unlock the next feature, but the game gives you a lot of freedom in which modifers you'll use in your run to increase your odds of completing the given challenge.",
      "Most of the negative reviews cover my complaints already. So I won't rehash the ones I've already read. \n\nHere's my biggest complaints: \n\n- Jumpscares have never been compelling to me. Doubly so on VR. Are you trying to injure me in my computer room? Stop. \n\n- Guns are fun. Not having ammo for them is not fun. (The game is pretty generous with ammo but it also encourages tediously conservative behavior, if you just unload clips at shit you'll run out pretty fast) \n\n- \"Continuous Turning\" feels so bad. Like, how can I turn my headset and everything looks smooth as butter, but as soon as I use the look stick for turning suddenly it's all choppy and looks wrong? I'm familiar with some of the motion sickness issues people get with turning in VR games, but this isn't that... \n\n\nThough honestly it seems like they just leaned really into the whole horror thing, which is fine, but also just super not my thing. \n\nIf the mechanics and some design choices had been better I might have slogged through it anyway. \n\n\nGame's beautiful, though, so they got that going for them.",
      "This game vs. HOI3:\n---------------------\n\nAdvantages:\n\n1.) The production system is more interesting and engaging, and far more balanced than the old IC system of HOI3. \n2.) The unit creation system is far more in depth and interesting, featuring many different brigade types and support companies, allowing you to change your divisions however you would like. \n3.) This game is far more stable than HOI3.\n4.) This game is updated regularly and has bugfixes regularly too, with content being added free along with every DLC. \n5.) The modding community of HOI4 is far larger with excellent mods such as Kaiserreich, Millenium Dawn, Red World, and Endseig.\n6.) HOI4 muliplayer is actually playable without making you want to shoot yourself.\n7.) China is no longer something Japan can take within 2 months.\n8.) An actual peace conference system and ideologies that actually impact the game.\n9.) Far easier to get into than HOI3.\n10.) Less railroading and the AI wont spaz if you do something ahistorical.\n11.) Planes are no longer as cancer as they used to be.\n12.) Far less micromanagement if you choose not to want to micro.\n13.) A better tutorial (still not a great one though.)\n\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n1.) The research system is bare bones in comparison to HOI3.\n2.) The War in the Pacific is basically nonexistant and naval warfare is awful (to be improved with next patch, being released eventually:tm:)\n3.) People dont really join the war in HOI4 unless theyre directly attacked, making continents like South America completely useless due to the fact that none of the countries there ever do anything but still build up their military, contributing lag.\n4.) Due to the game's engine, it can only use a single one of your processing cores, meaning regardless of your computer quality the game will run kinda slowly.\n5.) Speaking of slowly, the game is poorly optimized and frame loss is extremely common, especially 1942 onwards, when majors can have upwards of 300+ divisions. \n6.) The AI is often braindead, doing hilariously incompetent things such as charging endlessly into your lines, removing all its troops from your front, leaving major areas completely undefended, and completely ignoring the aerial aspect of the war.\n7.) Specific AI are even more braindead than the rest, specifically island nations, or nations that otherwise need to use navies and airforces more. Yes, the Japanese, American, and British AI are some of the worst in the game. In a WW2 game. \n8.) Your allies are completely useless and often you will find yourself doing all the fighting yourself, or even being hindered by your own allies. Playing as Germany the Italians likely wont place a single division in North Africa. In D-Day, you will either be the only one contributing anything or your allies will contribute so much that the supply is ruined and your troops all die of attrition. As the USSR you will recieve 0 lend lease, and as China you will get absolutely no support from the west. \n9.) HOI3 is a lot cheaper than HOI4\n\n\nOther things which I feel are worth mentioning but arent really advantages or disadvantages:\n\n1.) HOI4 contains a lot more alt-history options, which while not for everyone, are fun to try out. \n2.) The focus-tree system is something completely different from anything in HOI3.\n3.) The game has a less in-depth OOB(Order of Battle), which while to some people is nice because theyre bad with OOB, others dislike. Specifically this game lacks corps. \n4.) The battle-planning system of HOI4, while easier to use than the one in HOI3, is still flawwed. In HOI3 it did absolutely nothing, but in this game it is a core part of playing. Unless you want to mircomanage every single division, like you did in HOI3, you will use this system. \n5.) While simpler, the game still possesses a learning curve.\n\n------------------------\n\nOverall: \n\nHOI4 is a far less grounded and historical experience than HOI3. Is this a good or bad thing? That depends on your perspective. HOI4 obviously has significant advantages over HOI3 in certain areas but many consider HOI3 to be an overall better game. Personally I recommend HOI3 if you want a more micro-intensive, historical experience, and HOI4 if you want to just sit back and relax for a couple hours murdering millions of people. \n\nPersonally I would suggest either game, but thats just me.",
      "Refunded.\n\nFeels like they released the wrong game files - half the game seems to be broken or missing...\nBasic functions such as zooming in and out, no tutorial, huge amounts of buttons that don't have any impact. Good idea, terrible execution.",
      "Only originally bought this to support the artist, since I'm a huge fan of his pixel art work. It's amazing, and there's a tonne of eye candy to fill your eyeballs with. However, I can't recommend this to everyone as after the first few hours it's become a bit of a chore.\n\n- The game is a \"clicker\" type with rpg/upgrade elements. It's too slow to play in the background/absent mindedly but not fast enough to keep your attention fully.\n- Each round/attempt at a boss takes way too goddamn long. \n- Barely any interaction with the world. You build tower defense style, and equip new items, but beyond that you don't have any special abilities, no \"oh shit\" once per loop power, no ability to target specific enemies, nothing. Just watch everything play out and hope your little guy doesn't get pulped.\n- Crafting/Supplying is sort of hidden away and if you don't know about dismantling you'll never grind out all the items you need to build new stuff.\n- Lore/Journal entries are hidden away and require resources to unlock using a little button on the bottom of the screen that's easy to miss. I only found it 20 hours in. The writing is cringey and obviously done by someone who probably enjoys Adam Sandler films.\n- The card system is a neat idea, but jesus christ there's too much garbage shuffling. Imagine playing MtG with a deck of 100 cards and 90 of them are lands, and everytime you get a new hand you reshuffle the whole deck so all you get is more lands. Oblivion (destroys a tile) rarely, if ever, pops up. \n- Character skills are kinda bad? You might get a good one every level (which again, takes forever) but half the time it'll be useless \"leave 10% of food/resources at camp\" when you're not doing a resource grind run.\n- So much trash equipment you have to sort through and breaks game flow.\n\nAnd the biggest \"don't recommend\" from me would be the issue with how combining tiles works. If you put two tiles beside each other they sometimes change the tiles to something else. Example - put a Vampire Mansion beside a Village and you get a town full of ghouls that after 3 loops around the map turns into an upgraded town. But you still get trash equipment from the quests it gives, and putting a Vampire Mansion beside any other type of town doesn't change that town at all. So there's no reason to experiment, and it really limits the gameplay. You'd think they'd focus on that aspect gameplay wise, especially with experimentation to get the most bonuses out of all your tiles... but no. There's a small list of things that interact with each other, and that's it.\n\nI still highly recommend it since the game is cheap, the art is amazing and the artist/indie devs should get support. But I think it's a good 2-3 major updates, expansions or fan modding away from getting really, really amazing.",
      "This game is shit, and the devs should eat shit for shitting this shit on top of gamer community's head.\nCombat? You need a piano keyboard to dodgeparryhitlowhithighlowthendodge.

      "Coming from Monster Hunter World, I didn't like it for the following reasons:\n\n- WAY more anime than World. I could overlook the weird anime stuff from World because it was more subtle, but in Rise it is so in your face at all times. Matter of taste, but for me it made the game insufferable\n\n- tiny maps. I know that this is a return to old-school maps, made for portable. But coming from World it seems like a massive downgrade\n\n- graphics and ambience downgraded. Again, I know that this is because it's designed for Switch, but it doesn't change the fact that it feels like a huge step backwards\n\n- grapple zip thing. It's flashy and fast, but I felt that it takes a lot away from the methodical feel of the game. Makes the game feel more arcade\n\nMost of my complaints are based on taste, but for anyone without much MH experience before World, it's going to feel like a step back.",

      "(This is a spoilerfree Review)\nI recommend not to search any character or even the name of the game to avoid spoilers.\n\nBasic:\nDanganronpa Trigger Happy Havoc is a murder-mystery game with a focus on deep Story.\nThere are 3 main games and 1 spin-off game. This is the First one to start with.\nYou can expect about 40 to 50 hours in this game (depending on how fast you can read and think)\nI recommend reading all dialogue and not skipping any cutscenes.\nThe overall gameplay is simple and hard at the same time, but I bet everybody could play it.\n\nStory: (Spoilerfree/no spoiler)\nThe game is about a bunch of Students who were being dragged into a Killing Game.\nThe only way to escape is by killing another Student and getting away with it.\nYou'll learn more about it while playing, there are a bunch of unsolved questions in the beginning.\n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay is mostly divided into 2 different Parts: typical visual novel gameplay\n(freetime use and social interaction) and the Class Trials. In these class trials\nyou have to solve some Minigames but mostly try to discover the Murderer (or imposter if you played Among us).\nThe class trials are definitely the best Part of the game and you can be hyped about each of them.\nBefore each class trial you have to do some Investigation about the Murder and during that time you can\ntheorize who it was and how they've done it.\n\nCharacters:\nThe characters in this Game are as different as they can be. I bet you'll have different favourite ones.\nAll I can say is that you'll learn to love each and everyone on their own way.\n\nBuy Recommendation:\nDo I recommend everybody to buy this Game? No. If you are getting bored because you mostly \nonly play Shooters and MOBA's, I dont think you will enjoy this Game even if I did. But to everybody else\nwho enjoys mystery games like Ace Attorney or even mystery/detective shows I highly recommend buying this game\nand try it out. You'll enjoy it!\n\nAs I said try to avoid any spoilers. So dont look in the Steam Workshops etc.\nThank you for reading!",
      "EDIT: I nominated this game for game of the year (2023)\n\nLong ago I had heard about this game and how detailed and intricate it could be, and how you could spend hours upon hours building the massive empire of dwarves only for it to all come crashing down in some spectacular but unforeseen way.  Then I got into Rimworld briefly and thought it was ok, but it tended toward chaos a bit too much for my liking.  THEN I heard this game was coming to steam and I eagerly awaited it.\n\nIt's not necessarily that I was too good to play a game with mostly ascii/character graphics (I used to play them a lot back in the 1980s).  I was more intimidated by the depth of the game and not knowing if there was a wiki for it (there is) or how I'd find help if I needed it (I'm sure there's a ton of communities JUST for this game).  I expected that when it came to Steam, it'd be beefed up and worth the wait.\n\nWell it finally arrived and I think I'm STILL a bit intimidated by the sheer amount of options you have... mostly because it's not just me that I have to worry about, but a whole community of dwarves.  In the case of something like minecraft, I could dig a whole intricate tunnel and if stuff starts to go bad, I just high-tail it out of there and recover until I can go back and finish it.  In Dwarf Fortress though, if stuff starts to go bad, you can't just leave.  You are encouraged to deal with the adversity and push onward in the name of greatness... or something.\n\nIn a way it's like role playing, except you don't have to roll character sheets and you don't really control any of the characters directly.  You make decisions about where to mine, what trees to chop down, what to build, what to trade, what to plant, and for every thing there is a season (turn turn turn).  You're forced to deal with death, birth, attacks, sickness, madness, and a ton of other things that I have no idea are coming.  \n\nI keep thinking \"I could do better\" and I start a new game, but then I start to realize that no matter what I do, I'm never gonna have a perfect game, or a game where everything goes exactly according to plan.  I am eventually going to have to buckle down and stick to one game save to see it through.\n\nIf you're like me and starting something new holds a lot more interest than continuing an existing project (ADHD?) you may have difficulty with this game.  At the same time you may become so engrossed in it that you lose track of time and suddenly it's 6am and you wonder why you stayed up all night digging holes.  I'm starting to feel a bit of the madness myself.  (it's almost 4:30am as I write this)\n\nIn any case, it's probably not for everyone, but I'd say if you're unsure, find the non-steam version and try that, and if you can grok what's going on and it interests you, definitely buy this and support the developers... OR buy this and try to stay under the 2 hour refund  limit while you learn the basics (Good luck with that, it'll be 6 hours before you know what happened).  I believe this game is worth the money though (full price).  If you were going to wait for a sale you'd be waiting a long time anyway.  \n\nTL;DR If this looks interesting to you, don't wait! Buy now.  If you aren't sure, do a bit of research and come back and buy it.",
      "The classic just keeps getting better year after year.\n\nFor those new to the series, this is strictly a management sim.  No action aside from the outstanding baseball extravaganza your imagination cooks up from the play-by-play (if you so choose). (EDIT! There IS action now!  There is a 3D mode to put a little bit of animation to your imagination)  Guide your team over decades as a GM, manage your team pitch-by-pitch, or do both.  It's entirely up to you. \n\nIf you're like me and in every baseball game you've ever played you've found yourself saying \"but wouldn't it be great if it had (X) in it?\"  Well this is your dream game.  Whatever your X was, every time, since Triple Play Baseball on NES, this game has it.  And more.  It has literally everything in it that baseball has in it.  It is an outstanding work and is infinitely enjoyable for a baseball fan.  The only negative I can think of is that I imagine the learning curve is fairly steep (although I've been playing the series for 11 years now so I forget how it was to pick up).  \n\nA must have for any baseball fan.  10/10 (year, after year, after year)",
      "Upon further play, the game wasn't super luck based, it just doesn't do a great job explaining core mechanics that are crucial to gameplay. It has a more hands off, let the player discover how this works type of playstyle, but a simple line of dialogue alluding to these features would have been nice. That said, the story is really gripping, the gameplay (once learned) is fun, and overall, I definitely think it's worth $20.",
      "The fact that this VN used to be the highest rated game that hasn't been released outside Japan until, well, it was released outside Japan says it all. A must-buy position for every VN enthusiast and an insteresting position for any other player. Criminally underplayed (~55% of purchased copies haven't been started yet), true hidden gem. Consider buying it when on sale.",
      "Do you like baseball?\n\nI didn't. I really didn't. I liked a lot of different sports but I always thought baseball was boring, archaic and more an excuse to sit outside, drink beer and gawk at the occasional on-field event.\n\nBut then, for whatever reason -- I didn't have much else going on -- I started to watch baseball, because it was always on, pretty much every day, and it started to wrap itself around my brain in a pleasing way. Baseball is low-intensity matched with extreme peaks and valleys of emotion. \n\nMore importantly -- Baseball is a long continuous set of calculations based on the manipulation of variables in series after series of problems. Every at-bat, every pitch, every inning, every game is a test of odds and outcomes based on the pitcher, the batter, the fielders, the field, the weather, past results obscuring present values... Baseball is a worthwhile flux.\n\nSo - OOTP 17. This is the most advanced and ridiculously satisfying way to run your own personal baseball simulations. So maybe I should rephrase - Do you like Baseball as a concept? Because you will love OOTP.\n\n(Also this year they added little moving pawns to the broadcast view, so it's starting to get satisfyingly similar to half-watching an actual baseball game.)\n\nFor those already owning OOTP 16 and mulling an upgrade I would say - the engine runs much faster this year on x64, some under the hood stuff has been nicely tweaked, bells and whistles (the pawns) aren't nothing, and of course, I feel pretty good about supporting this developer, given their track record.",
      "You probably have to be a dedicated wargamer to remember Fields of Glory, a turn-based strategy series that covered almost every era of ancient warfare. The historical scope was deep and wide, but the rules and features were shallow and anorexic... just saying. The game needed an overhaul. The graphics needed a facelift, and the gameplay and ruleset needed growth hormones. This game addresses those issues definitively.\n\nIt was a matter of bringing the game over to the Battle Academy engine, Which in my opinion is one of the most robust tbs platforms out there. It handles WW2 games, fantasy games like Hell, Sci-Fi with Sanctus Reach, and historical wargames Pike and Shot and Sengoku Jidai. I'm assuming that, like the old FoG, this game will eventually have a slew of historical skins DLC. Everything will be overpriced and never go on sale, but if you're a fan of any of the games above like me, you'll bite the hook... like me.\n\nThe mechanics and rules of the game work almost the exact same way as Pike and Shot and Sengoku Jidai, not the old FoG. It's lazy but it works. If you've played either, you won't need the tutorial. You'd also recognize the soft pastel, almost cartoony maps. The game looks much better than previous games. The rigid, boxey blob models are gone, replaced by units that shuffle nervously, taunt their foes, and continue swinging at each other in between turns. It's a Slitherine tbs that actually feels alive and breathing.    \n\nIt's a straight up, left-click only tbs. You'll have a command unit with a command range, units outside of which will suffer a penalty. Units have zones of control. Once engaged in melee, units won't disengage, but will continue fighting each turn until one breaks. Victorious units may compulsively pursue routed foes, even disappearing off the map, never to be seen again...Units gain advantages and suffer penalties based on terrain and morale. Units get buffs for adjacent allies, and penalties if those allies are routed. There are bonuses for flanking, charging, and fighting on the high ground. There is no experience gain, no upgrades or leveling, and no rpg elements.\n\nAll the elements you'd expect from a good tbs are here, implemented in an approachable, almost casual way that you can enjoy without having to put down your drink or jazz cigarette. Turn based tacticians should approve. 8/10",
      "\nWell, after almost a year of not playing this game, I must say, the devs did fix most of my issues. *Most*. Creative mode is fun, but you still need to collect stuff to make things, which is incredibly tedious. On top of that, the character dialogue is still really annoying and you need a NASA computer to play at a stable framerate, but hey, you can actually play without getting your ass beat. I'd like to up my ranking to an 8/10. Very fun, but I highly recommend playing with others. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOG REVIEW (outdated):\nThis game has potential, but unfortunately having fun with it is impossible if you aren't a hardcore survivalist.\n\nCritical Issue #1:\nThe main characters won't stop talking. Everytime you eat or hold the torch they say an unfunny one-liner that makes me want to gouge my eyes out with forks. Even Robin Ayou from Subnautica: Below Zero talked less, and the original game had a silent protaganist. Having characters that have constant dialogue that always repeats is just so annoying to the point where I had to turn off the volume. If the main characters were silent but atleast talked with each other, then I could see potential in that. But they just talk and talk and talk and none of it means anything.\n\nCritical Issue #2:\nThe enemies are way too hard to battle. To make better gear, you need to take on enemies that are so difficult to battle. Maybe you could say I'm just not good at battling enemies in survival games, but I was able to easily battle monsters in Terraria, Minecraft, Subnautica and Raft just fine. When your in-game monsters are too hard to defeat without gear that requires you to battle even MORE monsters, it is not fun, repetitive, and frustrating.\n\nCritical Issue #3:\nThe story is in the background. The fact that the story doesn't impact the game as much as it should is probably the worst aspect of any piece of media out there. The game sends you an a goose chase to find the  main story and it is infuriating. The story itself is all over the place. First it just seems like you need to make yourself grow bigger, but then it goes completely off the rails and into this scientist bunker with a robot that gives you quests, but you can ignore him and continue playing. I don't know if they finished the story, but so far it is not good.\n\nSomewhat Critical Issue:\nThere is no setting to dial back the graphics without lowering the resolution to look like Terraria. I can't see, and it is dumb and brings the whole beautiful vibe of being small down, ironically.\n\nMinor Issues:\nThe music is bland, and although I love electronic/synth music, this is just not it. The fact that you can't have bugs as pets or mounts, or even herd them is extremely upsetting. The farming sucks ass, it gives you 4 items of what you grew every 2 in-game days, when you can just find that item in more abundance at the place where it is located. Under the pond... JESUS CHRIST, the graphics are so bad. The wavy filter looks so bad, and you can see the entire underwater area crystal f**king clear, even though other smaller bodies of water have some kind of murkiness to it. Minor issues like this hold back the game.\n\nAlthough this is still in early access, it feels as if they wasted a lot of potential already. For such a unique world and concept, it never really exploits the amazing and obvious things that it can accomplish. Why not grow your own personal army of ants? Oh sorry, you can pick up eggs but they hatch and they aren't friendly. Why not create a raft made of weed stems and lilypads? Oh sorry, you can just build a base that looks like a boat. Although there are much worse steam games out there, and ones that I have hated more than this, this was sort of a slap to the face. It's not god-awful, and there are a lot of good things about it like the cartoony bug designs and the beautiful graphics, but honestly, it's a 6/10 bordering on a 7, and although many others have enjoyed this, being the super critical demogorgon that I am, this didn't exactly \"ground\" me.",
      "I cannot help myself but to notice that this game has a failed Kickstarter campaign behind - which is why I was especially surprised and happy at the same time to find out it has been released no matter the odds. \n\nTo keep it short and simple: \"Think outside of the box\" is this game's motto. And it actually gives you an ability to rotate this box. \nCreator put a lot of effort in it. To say that this game is \"short\" is something I cannot do. While it is somewhere around 5 hours long - all those hours are filled to the brim with creativity, surprises, charming voice-over; it does not get repetitive and neither it gets overcomplicated. It is a great mix of involvement through thinking and relaxation. \n\nDefinitely worth it's money.",
      "As much as I was hyped for a different twist on farming sims, this just falls flat. The whole generation system [i]sounds[/i] good on paper but is just unused. You would almost be more hard pressed to actually age enough to need a second generation than not. Sure you can just opt in to moving along, but I just feel wrong killing off my character like that. As such the whole selling point is just, not a part of the game unless you really seek it out. \n\nSo this just leaves the normal farming sim aspects. Which uh... dont work too well either in my opinion. This game is focused less on skill, leveling, or tool quality despite having far more rpg aspects than most other games of this type. You have entire stat systems behind each charecter, buffs, multiple tool levels and materials. Yet none of it is used. What is used is weird cryptic proverbs that dictate item quality. \n\nWhat I mean is, did you catch that fish normally? Just walking along the river and thought to cast your line? Shame. Dont you know trout can only be caught well on the fourth day of the spring during rain while accompanied by a pet and under the influence of a charm buff? Im not exaggerating too much here either. Crops, fish, fruits, plants, and ore all have up to [b]four[/b] requirements. One per star. Some can be easy, like be skilled in said action, fishing/harvesting etc. But most will be odd things like harvest on the sixth day. Only fish during these hours. Be under a certain buff. Have a certain animal following you. Its all just... odd. \n\nWhats worse is its punishing. You want to just, idk, play the game your way? You want to enjoy this sandbox game at your leisure? Well I hope you are ready to be punished for it. You have to either memorise each and every requirement for hundreds of items. Or, just have a wiki page open at all times. Which just takes away the fun. Cant go fishing today, its not foggy. Cant harvest your grown crops right now, its not druida day. This game has you jumping through hoops, playing on [i]its[/i] time rather than your own. Its a relaxing farming sim, but played like an accountant looking at spreadsheets. \n\nIn essence, if you enjoy micromanaging each moment of your day down to the minute detail, go for it. You will love this game. But if you are looking for a laid back, head empty sim game, look anywhere else. This game will open palm slap you for wanting to play it laid back and to your own beat. I just feel this [u]FARMING SIM[/u] is not at all tailored for the crowd of people who play farming sims.",
      "I hated this game.\n\nHowever, it is undeniably brilliant. To try and explain how it is brilliant would cheapen the experience. I would put this game in the same category as The Stanley Parable, The Beginner's Guide, Dear Esther, and everything Freebird Games ever created. These are games that should be experienced by everyone.\n\nI was gifted this by my wonderful husband. I'm sure he meant well because he knows I like horror games. I'm going to choose to believe that anyway. What followed was five hours of paranoia, frustration, and more of a feeling that the game was playing me.\n\nThanks honey.",
      "Really grimy visceral horror game, Puppet Combo always scares me even as a life long genre fan. SOOTH is very challenging, but also very rewarding. Love the retro aesthetic and uncompromising brutal demeanor of it all, massive respect to the developer. This gameplay style isn't my favorite, took me a few attempts to get through Nun Massacre, I prefer The Glass Staircase/Murderhouse ect. But SOOTH is well executed enough that I was able to get into it. I did encounter some pretty gamebreaking bugs but reloading saves/brute force I was able to get past them. A lot of jank in this game could definitely use some more polish. Jumping into the vent on the lower bunker level was insanely annoying. It's not perfect but honestly I wouldn't want it to be that's part of the charm. Just the amount of mental/emotional strain the player goes through during a Puppet Combo game is hilarious I love it lol. The puzzles are also a huge improvement over previous titles. The ending I got was extremely macabre this game doesn't mess around. Overall I'm glad I waited for the full release and plan on trying some more endings. Horror fans if you don't know these guys yet this is a good one to start with. 8.5/10",
      "You will enjoy the game at the beginning, it's fun and entertaining...Until you start playing the harder and larger hospitals and you get plagued with bad pathing issues, bad AI, people getting stuck in rooms, people dieing but they idle in a death state and stay around forever and all kinds of glitches which kills the enjoyment and ruins the management aspects. I've had to stop playing this game until they patch it because right now you're just managing bugs and glitches and you will have to design hospitals to get around these bugs, so that means extra wide corridors and spacing items out so people don't get stuck. Which sucks.\n\nNeeded much more playtesting before being released.\n\n*This is from v1.01.*",
      "Ignore all the copers who think because they beat Celeste they're a platforming master.

That's why there is AN OPTION TO SET THE DIFFICULTY IN THE SETTINGS, and if you somehow are too proud to just tone it down a bit to get a better experience and instead decide to blame the game and its developer, then why are you even playing video games in the first place. They're supposed to be fun. This game can be a rage platformer, but it can also be a casual one. It depends on what you want.Will you snail has a great soundtrack, great level design, and super interesting story and lore. Is the game too hard? Change the difficulty. Do you not care about the story? Ignore the optional dialogue. It's that easy. This game is really really good, and don't let anyone convince you otherwise, especially people who can't deal with the fact that the rage game is hard",
      "The British Forces give the Allies a bit of the German defensive capacities. It has the problem of adding too many buildings to a game that is, in its core, dynamic and based on movement and aggressiveness instead of turtling. The British units are diverse and interesting, bringing much to the table. \n\nThe DLC lacks a proper campaign for the Brits, unfortunately, even though Caen, Goodwood, Arnhem and Walcheren could have been done in some interesting missions. But, for a game focused on multiplayer, the Tommies are obligatory in everybody's library.",
      "I backed this game back at the end of September 2013 and have finally played it through to completion. \n\nCandle is a beautifully unique game which takes elements from puzzle, platforming and point and click adventures. The puzzles, although sometimes frustratingly difficult, are all different and use different mechanics keeping the game engaging and fresh. Teku's Candle is such a interesting game mechanic that I really enjoyed getting to know and learn. As previously said, the game looks and sounds absolutely stunning. I don't think I have seen a game that looks this good before and that is attritubuted to every character and scene being hand drawn. Controls can be a bit finicky but not game breaking and you can easily adjust too. I would recommend getting this game because it provides a great whole experience.",
      "I would describe this game as a 'befriending sim' with a very shallow veneer of farming/resource gathering/'witchy' activities. The farming/mining/fishing is nowhere near as fun or sophisticated as other games e.g. Stardew Valley. And there are no customisation options - even very shallow ones - to make the game experience your own, e.g. the layout of your farm and buildings can't be changed or decorated, there's no home decoration, no character customisation or clothing options. So the game feels very linear and daily tasks are repetitive and grind-y. There's also a dearth of special/seasonal occasions which adds to the repetition.\n\nAnd even though this game majors on the social/befriending angle, which is largely ok, it still doesn't feel quite right. You can get to be 'good friends' with a character and they still repeat dialogue asking if you've met their family members (of course you have) and/or your character asks them really basic getting-to-know-you type questions that previous cutscenes have already answered. The voice acting is great though.\n\nI think this game would have been a lot better had it been done as an all-out graphic novel/choices matter game, and dropped the farming etc. As it is, it's a jack of all trades and master of none.",

      "To be completely honest, throughout my entire playthrough, I was thinking on giving this game a \"Not Recommended\" but it really wouldn't have deserved it. This game is at the same time both very difficult to recommend as to not recommend. It is really a beatiful and extremely original game, with a pretty well told interesting story. However, the problem it has is that it doesn't really work as a puzzle game. Puzzle solutions don't make logical sense most of the time and you end up brute forcing your way through most of the game. This means trying every posibility until something works and moves the story foward, and this is just not good puzzle design. This also distracts you from the story being told, which is in itself not so easy to understand, it requirers you to be paying attention to details, so your brain has to be constantly switching between \"puzzle mode\" and \"story mode\". Anyway, you can tell a lot of love was put into this game, and that is why I ultimately recommend it.\n7.5/10-",
      "Is Duskers a fun game? Yes. Would I recommend it? No, because of one simple reason:\n\nA lack of content with no mod support.\n\nDuskers is a little like No Man's Sky in the sense that the first few hours are filled with fun and wonder, but everything afterwards becomes a disappointment because the game turns out to be far more shallow than it initially seemed. As a player, I yearned to explore more of the randomly generated galaxy in Duskers because I wanted to see what other horrors, mods, and derelict types I would encounter in the empty universe - but in the end, it turned out that there was really very little else to see besides what you find in the first couple of hours. \n\nHere's a quick rundown of where the content was most lacking:\n\n--Enemy types: there's only 4 different enemies. FOUR. They also behave pretty much identically with the exception of the last one.  This was definitely the biggest interest-killer for me. \n\n--Derelict types end up mattering very little. Government A? Salvage C? Military B? It really doesn't change the layout in a particularly noticeable fashion, with the only differences being 1-2 extra ship defense turrets or something like that. \n\nI really, really wanted to give Duskers a thumbs up - I loved the aesthetic, I loved the atmosphere, and I loved the unique command line interface - but unfortunately, after a few hours, I came to realize that there's really just not enough actual content here, and that's heartbreaking for fans of this niche genre like myself.\n\n",
      "Honestly I don't think I've ever cried so much over one game.  This is definitely one of the best narrative driven RPG maker games ever made - it has everything you could want.  It has beautiful art, beautiful music, wonderful narration, it's atmospheric, great characters, meaningful choices, a story of overcoming hardships similar to a real life instead of just a story, and the ending I got was beautiful! I have only played the game once but the game has a lot of different branching paths with choices really making a large difference in the game.  This game will always have a special place in my heart.",
      "[H1] GUIDE TO THE PURCHASE OPTIONS [/H1]\nso heres how you can tell the difference between what your buying, because you don't wanna be like me, who often bought packs that did the same thing. \n\nHitman 3 standard edition - Just Hitman 3, so no Hitman 2 or 1. You get access to the newly added levels, as well as elusive targets and most of the escalations. This does not give you access to the 7 deadly sins levels.\n\nHitman 3 Deluxe edition - a bit scammy, not quite worth the money, but it comes with some music, 3 new skins and a couple of extra escalations. This won't give you any new levels. This does not give you access to the 7 deadly sins levels.\n\nHitman trilogy - Comes with nearly everything. If you want to buy hitman and access most of the levels, this is the one to go for. I believe the only things you do not get access to are the sniper edition levels, the patient zero campaign, the deluxe stuff, the 7 deadly sins levels and any extra skins. This is like the core of the game without any extra things.\n\nHitman trilogy premium add-ons - literally just hitman trilogy except it includes the features that aren't in hitman trilogy. You have to own the original Hitman trilogy in order to buy this one. The only thing it doesn't include is the 7 deadly sins. If you are stupid and can't comprehend what I just said; it doesn't include the base levels. Only the extra stuff\n\nHitman - 7 deadly sins pack - the new 7 deadly sins pack. It includes the 7 new levels that are a bit simular to escalations. Basically, there are still 3 stages in each sin, (they are sorted as targets, so every time you eliminate a target, its like a checkpoint. So you can really count it as just 1 stage with 3 targets.)  Its basically escalations but with a lot of effort put into them.\n\nHitman 3 access passes - these are basically dlc's that were put in hitman 2 and 1. If you already own these, you should automatically gain access to them during the carryover. There is one called 'hitman 3 access pass: hitman 2 gold', this basically means 'if you are new to the hitman trilogy, you can have access to the dlc in hitman 2 here'. \n\n\nhere are what the access passes do:\n\nHitman 2 gold edition - it gives you access to all hitman 2 levels, which is why its so expensive. It comes with all levels, including the sniper editions, the expansion pack (2 places, Maldives and New York) as well as some extra skins. Its pretty big if you ask me\n\nHitman 2 standard - gives you access to standard hitman 2 locations. This is basically the gold edition but without sniper edition, the expansion pack or extra skins. It gives you access to the base levels. Which is miami, columbia, mumbai, whittleton creek and the isle of sgail\n\nHitman 1 GOTY edition - gives you access to every level from hitman 1 but without campaigns\n\nHitman 1 GOTY upgrade - gives access to the hitman 1 campaigns, does not include the base levels.\n\n\nMost of these packs are worth the money. But most of them are on sale quite often. So if you think some of them aren't worth the money, you can always wait a month or two and get a massive sale on it.\n\nthank me later\n",
      "The demo was a lot of fun and the early access launch game which is more of that  was a lot of fun big surprise!\n\nOverall I would really recommend this game if you loved or enjoyed games like Warstride Challenges, Neon White, Speedrunners From Hell and other games with a focus on very short concise levels that are made for speedrunning. I will say while it looks off in the trailers the gun controls pretty nicely in the game no complaints there for me with this style of game. \n\n\nWhat I liked\n\n-controls feel great and very fast, you always feel in control and everything including enemies are very visible and have extra outline to help highlight them when in hectic combat\n\n- most levels are just the right length to not feel like you complete them before you even start them but not tedious to retry to get a better ranking\n\n-much improved optimization and performance wise from the demo, even on my laptop not really made for gaming got a easy 100 fps if I put all settings on low\n\n-Ranking system is pretty cool, you get extra points if you kill enemies, head shot them for critical damage, if you never get hit etc and more and of course ranked on time. There is a separate ranking for total points so say for killing a lot of enemies and in a row and then a separate ranking just for times for levels\n\n- Enemy A.I seems improved form the demo and they try to roll out of the way of gunfire or go behind kinda cover from the environments at times.This isn't a big thing since your flying through levels super fast anyway but nice to see\n\n-Decent number of standard guns and they are fun to use without trivializing using telekinesis and vice versa\n\n-Some stages focus on a large arena to fight waves of enemies and others don't so feels like game has decent level variety/variety in obstacles in levels\n\n-okay variety of enemies to fight so far\n\n-kinda humorous the odd time and there are stupid items to pick up with telekinesis and use like a live rat, a toy hammer, giant tennis ball etc.\n\n- telekinesis feels very seamless fast and fun/easy to use in combat, chucking random objects at enemies its a lot of fun\n\n- most levels are open enough to allow multiple paths to get through levels and you can usually skip fighting some enemies if you want to only go for a faster time in most levels \n\n\n\nSome Suggestions/Issues I had\n\n-maybe I missed it but no instant retry button if I want to retry a level instantly but haven't died\n\n-boss difficulty kinda feels a bit all over the place although there is not much boss fights, first boss feels way too easy, second one was fun and maybe just right although maybe on the side of   too easy from not having enough health \n\n-the second last level in this launch early access version \"\"\"\"\"stealth\"\"\"\"\"\" feels far too long and far too hard and full of way too much elite enemies and then it even has a boss fight to do in it too in the level all in one go without ever stop moving! \n\n-just a note when I played the demo version before the last boss fight in that felt like it should have either been a level with just the enemies and then a second separate level with a arena for the  boss fight not both that you have to do in the one attempt in a bigger level just kinda tedious imo\n\n-music isn't bad here but it feels like there is very little music and the music that is there kinda blends together a lot\n\n-hopefully this game can develop a big following community and maybe get a level editor down the line!\n\n-feels like you go in the 2 second slow motion mode when getting a critical hit on a  enemy or breaking glass a good bit too much in levels.\n\n- would be nice down the line to get bonus challenge levels, shorter much more difficult ones like how NeonWhite and War stride Challenges have bonus levels \n\n- for replay value might be nice to have 3 unique goals for a level e.g beat the level in under 40 seconds, only kill a certain number of enemies, kill no enemies etc.This is kinda in the game but levels don't seem to have specific or unique extra goals its the same ones for every level.\n\n- not a complaint but maybe later add a grapple hook, grapple hooks are always fun in first person shooters!",
      "I knew Journey is a great game,maybe one of the best video games in history,but...\n\nI didn't know why so many people moved by such a simple gameplay.\nI didn't know why people had a Journey-Fever,even players just bought PS3 only for this game.\nI didn't know how close a relationship could be in 100mins only.\nI didn't know how bad i wished to go back to the peak and stay with my friend i'll never meet again.\n\nNow I Know.\n\n“It is better to walk with a friend in the dark than alone in the light” – Helen Keller\n\nIt was an interesting experience for me, I had never played this game nor heard of it until recently. I went and looked at the store page, My Brother/Friend Ethan-Winters Just Told Me this game in the steam store now, so went ahead and bought it. After buying it, went and started up the game some day later. Went into the game, saw another model character that looks like mine, I thought it was an AI because I had thought it was a single player game. So I decided to play along with it, we went through the story, it progressed quite fast, mainly because we both did not really bother to check out other things. The more I played, the more I realized that the guy I was playing with was most definitely not an AI, it was a genuine player. As we went through the story, our cooperation got smoother, we no longer have a solo player attitude, we would signal to each other, wait for each other and walked, fly with each other. It was smoothing, relaxing, a truly unique experience. Even with the setbacks we had throughout our progression, we never gave up, we stuck together from the desert till the end, when one of us screwed up, we patiently waited for the other, chiming to the person where we are. I remember at the end, when i screwed up a jump and did not see the other player, I was genuinely scared, sad, I frantically searched for the person but to no avail. I was distraught, sad and disappointed but I continued onward. When I went up, there he was, chiming for me, assuring me that he had not left yet. I felt happy, comforted when I saw the person waiting for me and together we finished the story. I am not one to do reviews, but it was such a unique experience among my years of gaming that I had to share it. Thank you, punks for the experience, truly thank you. And thank you, for bothering to read my review.\n\ni'll never forget our journey kind stranger.\n\nThis wasn't a game, it was an experience. I highly recommend you do this.",
      "[i]While the artwork and combat remain enjoyable, the story, writing, and pacing were a major letdown.[/i]  \n\n***\nMINOR SPOILERS BELOW. If you're going to play the game, play before reading.\n***\n\n[b]The mature storylines, hard-hitting decisions, beautiful worldbuilding, and tight writing that made the first two so immersive is not present in this game.[/b] (You'll notice immediately that the writing for the caravan in the capital is [i]particular[/i] trite, awkward to read, and uninteresting.)\n\nUnfortunately, it's not just the writing that's weak. [i]The pacing is off.[/i] Antecedents are confusing, characters you'd expect to speak don't, events that should have been foreshadowed come out of nowhere. More frustrating are the serious character continuity \"errors,\" and arcs that disappear, change, or go nowhere. [i]In short, the events, decisions, and conflict from the previous games do not appear or resolve in a way that was suggested by the previous two[/i].\n\n\nHere's one example. In Banner Saga 2, Fosolt is unexpectedly rescued by Bolverk. [i]\"I have a message for Alette from the dead varl king,\" [/i]he said. That's pretty intriuging! Maybe there's a mystery, an oracle, an item, or just cool information about the Varl and their strange king? Maybe there'll finally be context about the bridge decision!\n\n[i]No! He has nothing interesting to say or add, and then his storyline just gets dropped and forgotten.[/i]\n\nWell, Bolverk's been possessed by Bellower! Gosh, who knows what Bellower will say? In fact, I can't wait to find out what happens to Bellower's body! \n\nWell, actually, Bolver's [i]not[/i] possessed, not really, certainly not like it was implied last game, and Bellower's body -- [i]a primary focus of the first two games[/i] -- isn't mentioned [i]once[/i]\n\nOr how about how they casually mention that Eyvyn is not only the [i]head[/i] of the Valka order, but also that he's had periodic bursts of hereditary madness all along? That's... odd. And it's not presented as an well-thought out [i]reveal[/i] or anything. It's presented matter-of-factly, like they were trying to ret-con in a less interesting story, or were tone deaf.\n\nYou'll notice that all the characters are underutilized and have unfulfilled storylines/tensions. Hakon has hard choices to make; Canary's a little crazy; Yrsa is mysterious; Gil's in love with Alette, etc. Will these build into choices? Reveals? Dependent endings based on choices? Will there be discussions referencing the past? Reflections on travels? Hints of despair?\n\nNo. In mine, Gil was [i]murdered[/i] and no one even bothered to reference it. Canary's situation never comes to a head. You never have to choose between Varls and Humans. Murdering people doesn't make people threaten to leave. Ubin returns randomly as an uber Varl and he's... learned the horseborne's language? Travelled the southlands? In like, a month? In a way that doesn't advance the plot? It's just... weakly done.\n\n\nThere are [i]so many[/i] examples like this, where the stories don't quite fit correctly, where what you picked up on in the early games about the [i]mysteries[/i] and the [i]world[/i] and what made it a [i]vibrant[/i] place were forgotten about by the writers. [b]The result is that it the game plays out in unsatisfying ways, in tenseless scenarios made vapid by watered-down morality, an inability to leverage the situation in fun ways, and low-quality writing, paucity of choice-making, a lack of exploration, lack of plot twists, simplified overworld mechanics -- all culminating in an almost staggeringly one-dimensional and shallow ending.[/b]\n\nThe Banner Saga series was always an experience that was greater than the sum of its part. An [i]experience[/i]. Of being [i]riveted[/i] to the computer, checking the map, worrying over supplies, guessing at mysteries, having my breath taken away at each hill. Unfortunately, that's not the case in this game. \n\n\nGameplay-wise, it's also a bit of a letdown. Combat is fun-ish, but you can make invincible character combinations and the mechanics don't even try to deal with this. There's an interesting new reinforcement mechanic that's not used heavily, and never pushes you like you think the end of the world would. You never really have to split up your forces. There's no novelty. Like maybe using a hero in a battle makes them fatigued, so you have to switch them up? Maybe you can station them different places, making them unusable for combat? Maybe you need to choose eight for a secret mission caravan? Maybe dream sequences? No, nothing like that. \n\nThe overworld gameplay had some changes that never really felt significant. Moreover, quite a bit felt taken away. You can't rest, do training missions, no longer weigh food vs upgrades. One example of all thise tone deafness was Iver's march through the destroyed world was consistently at \"Great Morale!\"\n\nThere didn't seem to be many flavor choices (\"Do we hang the criminals or let them join us?\"), including much less on social themes (\"Should women fight, if it disturbs the traditionally-minded men?\" \"One clan's rowdy, what do we do?\" \"They threaten to leave if so and so isn't banished\"), and less delayed results and fewer significant decisions, including among the game's built-up tensions among the factions. \n\n\nThere's also some cases of development [i]feeling[/i] cheap. Remember opening Banner Saga 2, and feeling that it was [i]fresh[/i], and [i]upgraded[/i]? There's little to make you feel that way here. The artwork is okay, but the environments feel more generic, with less variety, and the surreal landscapes in the darkness aren't especially interesting to look at for long periods of time. Iver is voiced by Bolverk's voice actor, and they sound exactly the same. The new title system is a fun idea, but is visually integrated into the game's menu system with the finesse of a cheap mod. \n\nThere's a moment in the game where the screen goes black for scrolling text and voiceover narration explaining the upcoming mechanic. Um, a character can't explain that? It was similar how the many two second animations are used, not to supplement the story, but to [i]replace[/i] written portions, making you feel unsure about what's going on. And finally, the game's pretty short, without fun combat challenges or interesting newgame+ challenges. \n\n\nWhat's [i]particularly[/i] frustrating is that the game's release date was moved forward four months. I don't know the story why, but I do know that a few more months of polish and story embellishment might have delivered the beautiful, grippingly interactive story we were hoping for. Because this is a watered down version of the previous two in just about every way.\n\nThis negative review is for whatever processes lead to this mediocre finale.\n\n---\n\n[i]Here's a plot that would have made more sense. Zephyr arrives and speaks to you secretly. There's a god that's still alive! Neat, now we'll finally get more story on that. Yay, fun caravan mode, now we need to take longships somewhere interesting!\n\nBut uh-oh! There's a Sundr villain going there as well, with an army of dredge! But at least now we'll finally get more story about the Sundr! \n\nThe god reveals something interesting, talks about Juno, the sun, gives a means to protect the city and help Iver. But when you return to the city, now the king and rugga and the factions have devolved into fighting based on your choices. How are you going to handle this? Which of many possibilities will ascend to the throne? How will you defend the city? And what mystery lies beneath the mountain of the city...\n\nFor Iver's caravan, there should be pockets of dredge villages kept alive by Spellsingers. Now you need to decide to plunder them or not! More stuff to do! Maybe go to the remains of the Varl capital first? Fight warped Valka? Realize deceptions, machinations, corruption, hear stories? Find new characters, have old ones die?\n\nInstead there... wasn't a plot?[/i]",

      "Volition ups the silly, and adds super powers, but loses a little something along the way.\n\nI loved Saint's Row: the Third, and by all rights should have loved IV as well, but I mostly just liked it. The set up was fun, and seemed to up the ante again, but then you get the presidency ripped away from you almost immediately (without even seeing the consequences of your first pushed legislation!). Placing the game in a virtual city for the most part with the only real characters being on your space ship, really kinda seemed to gut the game. Even when [spoiler]the world gets destroyed[/spoiler], a detached, \"meh\" was all I could muster. The humor is there, but it's mostly better in the DLC. The radio stations feel kind of underwhelming without DJs.\n\nFinally all the fun of collecting and customizing various interesting cars, and finding ways to climb or fall to interesting places with a stolen plane/parachute are gutted with the inclusion of super powers. Also, the super powers make gunplay, leveling any of your other stuff, and pretty much every mechanic carried over from Saints Row: the Third obsolete.\n\nIf you get this game, do yourself a favor and make sure you get all the DLC where most of the real fun is. Is it as good as the previous Saints Row? I don't think so, but I still recommend getting it and playing through it. It is a lot of fun, and I love the 50's break out scenario at the beginning.\n\nStacey's thoughts:\nStill awaiting DLC with Jane Austin and the D*ldo Bat.

      "After playing the game for almost 10 hours which i know is not a lot but still i had a great time the story kept me hooked from start to finish and i was always excited to find out what was going to happen next. I loved the idea that you could choose to play as a ghost and never get detected or never kill anyone or just go for the high chaos im going to kill everyone playstyle and even know the ability to choose your playstyle is quite oftenly seen these days but back in 2012 it was quite inovative.\n\nGameplay:\nIt had great combat and stealth.(Not Suprising based on thre fact that your an assasin)\nStory was well how to put this \"A rollercoaster of emotion\" it keeps you hooked from start to finish and you will never want to stop playing until you finaly get to the end.\n\nReplay Value:\nNow this is a big one in my opinion because i like games that make you play for hours and hours and I would say that Dishonored has great replay value this is mainly due to the fact that there are a lot of different acheivements, ways to complete each mission, different magic paths and weapon paths that can only be be completed if you play the game again and if your not comftable with fully restarting you dont have to because once you finish the main storyline you unlock the option to play them over which is useful if you want to unlock some of the other acheivements for example Clean Hands to get this acheivement your not allowed to kill anyone in the whole story how you do this i have no idea but thats the reason this game has good replay value.\n\nDLC:\nEven though i do not own the DLC (i will be purchasing them soon) from my knowledge of the normal game and how great that was it would suprise me if the DLC was bad.\n\nIn conclusion i would highly reccomend this game to anyone who doenst already own it!\n",

Made by the same people who made rollercoaster tycoon and man did they deliver on this.

The movement is quick and polished as well.\n- One level is on average 20 seconds. It's fun to improve your gameplay to get better times in the small levels. \n- It's really a blast getting a perfect run, killing enemies in bullet time or exploiting the enemies weakspots.\n- There is content for around 10-15 hours. Maybe more if you consider going for 100%.\n\n[b]Anyway there are also some flaws: [/b]\n- In Neon White or Ghostrunner the movement and pace through the levels often feels like a perfect choreographic \"dance\"\n- The levels and the areas in Warstride are verry tight. I often lost pace through \"stupid\" placed rocks or small doors.\n- There is not much to explore. The levels are verry linear. While in Neon White it was so much fun to explore shortcuts or other hidden possibilities to improve ur time there are no such mechanics in Warstride at all. I'd love to have some exploration at least in the \"long levels\".\n- It could get repetitive for some players as it's a core element to complete the levels on 5 different difficulties. \n\n[b]Conclusion: [/b]\nIf you like fast paced games like Ghostrunner, Neon White or Doom and you have no problem in repeating short levels several times and u don't except an extraordinary game u will have fun for several hours on a low price.\n",

The original one being free was a steal for being so good.\nEven to this day, I still get surprised on the level of detail of the sprites, the genuine sentimentality of the story and boy, did this version made me cry!\n\nA must if you are a fan of RPG maker esque horror games, or Madoka Magica, or deep dives into a person's psyche, or lolita fashion or all of the above :p",
      "I got this game for $12 off humble bundle. Me and my friends play it for hours on end. This game honestly feels like the perfect fighting game for me because there is no set style.

Brilliant characters, neatly constructed plot and enjoyable gameplay with the classic \"easy to play, hard to master\" aspect to it.\n\nI really can't pick at the graphics or music - they are just in line with the Supergaint roster, crafted at the level we have come to expect.\n\nIs there anything substantial that I would change?

      "So this is what upsets me about rainbow six siege as a casual player. I bought the starter edition like a moron. Thats on me. But I wasn't sure I'd like the game. Turns out I do. So now that I realize I like the game I want to fully purchase the game. Turns out you can't upgrade starter to standard. The game legit punishes people who want to play it. Who paid money to basically test if they would enjoy the game.  Why should I pay $55 for a $40 edition? Just let me pay $25 for the $40 edition. I already paid the money. Why are you punishing me for wanting to spend more?",

Lots of things I don't like in terms of menu navigation and difficulty curve, but conceptually one of the better games I've played in awhile.  I just wish the controls weren't so poor. Very tedious with doubletap movement to dodge/counter (keyboard)\n\nAlso not very optimized for steam link or the steam controller. In general the worst parts of this game are directly attributed to the fact that this is a port. One of the worst port jobs i've seen to be honest.  Definitely play with a good controller. \n\nThe game also does a poor job of introducing the \"extended\" story, I nearly missed what i would consider the best part of the game just because I stopped after the first round of credits. There is actually a ton more content afterwards. Very worth investing the time into watching everything play out.",

Everything depends on how you want to play the game.\n\nCons: \n-WIll drain so much of your life away (might've forgotten my gf's birthday ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ )\n-Main story was incredibly lackluster compared to previous Fallout games\n-Giving you the option to be literally any kind of character you want to be....except you're always tied to being a parent.\n-a few repitive quests. (although gives you opportunities to approach these quests, areas and enemies differently\n\nAll in all, If you're a Fallout fan because of previous stories then you might not feel fulfilled playing this game, however if you love character creations, lore and immersive environments with untold stories then I completely recommend this game to you.",
      "Looks like a game for children, but underneath the friendliness there is a great challenge! Move on the rhythm of good songs on a note bar! \n\n[h2]Swim! Swim little tredpole! [/h2]\nYou are a newborn tredpole. The first thing you do is break free of your egg! Through various rivers and waters you journey, and eventually save your pond from a disaster that will occur. \nEverything in the river translates to an instrument tone and respects the height on the note bar. The primary goal is to reach the finish. The melody is depicted as little mines which hurt your health if you swim across one. Along the way you can collect points by collecting bubbles (with a bonus if you collect them all), little bubbles, health packs, and you can slap your tail on bamboo or cymbals that launch you in the air! Many predators would like to make a snack out of you! \nAll this on the rhythm of unique songs! \n\n[h2]Thoughts [/h2]\nThis looks like a friendly game, a bit for kids perhaps, right? Well, I started with letting a non-gamer play this, without success. You need to have musical rhythm in you to perform well. None of my friends possess that really, so a simple playthrough wasn't all that easy. \nThe music is very original, and makes this game fun.

      "owned the original from all the way back in 2014\nloved it tons, even more than RoR2\nsaw RoRR get teased on twitter, was there for its release, thought to myself,\n\"i don't need this, i can just play the ror from 2013, i don't know how to feel about this new one, is it really just the same game again?\"\n\nand then i saw someone grab an item i've never seen before, while playing as a character i've never seen before, on a map layout i've never seen before, using alternate abilities to what was baseline for that character to fight an enemy i've never seen before, and then activate a shrine of the mountain from ror2, and then while doing the teleporter fight they activated a bunch of new machines that turned drones into items and activated a specific equipment for a fee... and then i saw that you can just opt out of whatever you don't like about any of that, at any time!\n\nwhat's not to love about that??",
      "Beware as you are just looking at the best 4X game that is.\n\nDon't look at my played time here, this game was available for years already from a very unheard of distributor BUT now is available on Steam at last for the people to see it already.\n\nMaybe you are wondering why it costs so much. Well it has 4 expansions build in it already so that's why. But believe me IT'S WORTH IT. If you like 4X games, this is just a must have.\n\nThe cons:\n\n1. The game is not turn based. Everything is done in real time. You can pause the game and speed it up or slow down at your own liking. This may be a + for someone though... \n2. It's not as shiny as some other 4X games so if pretty graphics are what you prefer you may be disappointed.\n3. The game can be demanding even on high end PC's if you run really large galaxy.\n4. Unfriendly UI. If you run huge resolution you will have problems to read the text.\n5. The learning curve... you will spend hours getting into the game. But don't be afraid, huge automation can be set up to help you.\n6. No multiplayer. I don't mind it but maybe you do?\n\nThe Pros:\n\nEverything else. It's the most complex, never ending fun 4X game I have played. Just the way how the AI is done hooked me up. But to make it fair here are some picks for you.\n\n1. Huge amount of races that actually play in character. It's not like in other games where every AI plays the same way but has different stats. Here the AI behaves in the ways how they are described. They play in character like in RPG game.\n2. HUGE galaxies. Trust me you never saw something like this before in other 4x games. Each game can last for dozens of hours if you want.\n3. Set up your game to the last possible thing you can imagine. The start up set up is just incredible.\n4. Automation ... don't like research, or ship design, or diplomacy, or anything else you can imagine? You can automate it. You can focus only on the one thing you like the most!\n5. Pirates ... you can even play as one.\n6. Mods ... do you want 10 more races or to play Star trek 4x? ... You can have it. \n7. Micromanagement ... it can be endless.\n8. The complexity, you can spend hours in design tables that make sense in comparison to Moo3 for example.\n9. Battles, there is very few games that can simulate such large scale engagements over the whole galaxy.\n10. Play it your own way. You can win the game without any battle if you want. On the other side waging wars is FUN.\n\nDo you need to know more? Watch some videos on YouTube from Das24680. He has also full tutorials for those who would need them.\n\n*Update - I have added more Pros as this game deserves it and I have forgot to mention them.",
      "As much as I adore this game's visuals, soundtrack, story, and... THE MEMES... I unfortunately can't recommend actually playing it.\n\nI can parry bosses in Dark Souls or Elden Ring with less frustration than in this game. The parry system requires you to execute a light attack towards an enemy right before they go in for a hit against you, which is usually telegraphed with a red glare in their eye. Unfortunately, even while using the lock-on camera (and by the way, you are never directly informed of its existence), half of the time my opponent was partially, or even completely off-screen. This is a problem, not only because it makes seeing an incoming attack difficult, but also because movement is tied directly to the parry system. You must execute an attack TOWARDS the enemy. With the camera having a seizure every five seconds, this makes it even more irritatingly difficult to aim your parries. I died to Blade Wolf repeatedly, not because of my own skill, but because midway through an incoming attack, the camera would decide to turn 90 degrees to the left, causing my movement to also shift to the left, nullifying my parry. \nIt's consistently inconsistent.\n\nIf there is some system in place that actually does help explain a lot of these game mechanics, fantastic. However, I find it inexcusable that whatever I might be missing would be so out of the way that I'd never encounter it unless I went out of my way to do so.",
      "Only one word to describe this game\n\nOutdated.\n\nThere is no real point to get this game unless you want a slightly better looking UI and atmosphere. L4D2 already contains the campaigns from L4D1 and is where the entire Left 4 Dead community is. Only a small playerbase still plays l4d1, mostly out of nostalgia. But there is quite literally no reason to get the game.\n\nYou can grab it if you are into achievements, but only do so when it goes on sale, i grabbed it for a couple penny, still a bad idea.",
      "This is less of a review and more of me gushing about how much im enjoying myself, but you can still get a idea of what the game is from it. I am not usually a puzzle game player, or even a \"chill\" game player. im usually all about quick shooters, fighters, and platformers, but i decided to give this game a shot and i am very glad i did. with a mechanic as simple as pushing trees i thought that it would be simple enough for me to have a good time, the last time i played a puzzle game was BaBa is You and i put 14 hours into it and never got past word 3, it was just too much for me. but this game manages to still be challenging even with it laying all the pieces out in front of me, it introduces new features not by putting one in a level and saying good luck, it makes you do something you have done before but gives a new outcome, because you never got to do that thing in that exact way before, and when puzzles start requiring you to do those things you wonder how you ever got that far without doing one of those things before. all of the mechanics and solutions also are based in logic, all your doing is pushing things, so you dont have to suspend your current understanding of things to learn a new mechanic. The world of the game is also very relaxing and sucks me right in, its a museum of the \"past\" of humans that takes place in the far future from the perspective of monsters who dont really understand human culture, and it is hilarious! the music is very chill and moves with your actions, when you push something in a specific way the music also does a specific things, and its part of the reason this game is so relaxing. most other puzzle games i have played frustrate me when i get stuck on a puzzle for a long time, but seeing the monster relax helps me relax and keep a level head to get to the next museum exhibit. i dont know how to end this review but if you read it i hope you dont feel like i wasted your time!",
      "VIDEO REVIEW: https://youtu.be/DzdF-i2drLs\n\nI loved this game!  It was a worthy prequel to Cthulhu Saves the World!  If you’re a fan of the games from this company I recommend playing it!\n\nIf there is one downside to the game, it’s that it’s very linear. Every game day you just make a selection to the R'lyehtionships options, a cutscene occurs and you get a reward item. Do that for a few in game days than the next level plays. These levels are just as linear as there’s very little deviating. \n\nHowever the rest of the game makes up for that short coming. The R'lyehtionships choices give great replay value, the writing is spot on, and the fighting is just as good.\n\nAlso the addition of a “skip incoming random battle” option was refreshing. \n\nSo overall i say that the game is another Zeboyd games classic that is perfect for the holiday. \n\nPRO\n+Great funny writing as per Zeboyd Games\n+Amazing graphics on par with Cosmic Star Heroine\n+Great music\n+Combat is easy simple and fun\n+Challenging but fair\n+ R'lyehtionships gives clever replay value \n\nCON\n-Game is painfully linear.\n-Very little places to wonder around in gameplay\n-R'lyehtionships causes Uber simplified “quests” to be glorified cutscenes\n-Needs more interactive items in the maps for more funny writing \n\nI’d give the game an 8/10! It’s highly recommend it if you’re a long time fan and it’s worthy a purchase during a sale if you’re unsure.",
      "good game but later missions seem to be less polished ran in multiple bugs when playing as The Son enemies getting stuck in impossible to reach places and for some odd reason some characters have dog killing animations that for the most part are bugged and only work half the time causing an insta death and a retry don't even understand why later in the game you have to do animations to kill dogs as for basically the whole game you don't need to perform animations also seems to have some input lag throughout the whole game but overall its decent and when its on sale you should buy it.",
      "So I'm going to assume that you've played CIV V in the past. Endless Legend's another 4x game like it, but in my opinion, it's so much better. And here's why:\n\n1) I know this is the advantage of being in a fantasy setting as opposed to the \"Real world\" (You get what I mean, I know Civ 5 isn't historically accurate, but it tries to stay in the world of realism), but all the factions feel genuinly different and exciting from one another. Both in style and aesthetics, the difference between Wild Walkers and Ardent Mages is far, far greater than say The Netherlands and Japan. \n\n2) I like the way that influence is a resource. I know it kinda takes the place of culture in that it's used for policies, but having to save up a resource that's more than just troops for wars and the like makes diplomacy far more meaningful, I find.\n\n3) The way strategic and luxury resources are done. Instead of \"This deposit has 8 iron\", it says \"This deposit has titanium\", and just gives you 1 per turn. It let's you build things that require a lot of that resource even if you only have 1 source, just slower than other people who have more. It makes a lot more sense to me. the fact that each luxury item is different from one another and have different effects is a lot more interesting than just giving +Happiness, and the booster system means that having 5 dye deposits (I wish) is more useful than it is in civ, where you have to desperatly try and peddle it off or it's a huge waste.\n\n4) This is a personal thing, but I like the fact that technology is seperated by era rather than previous tech. I find it a far nicer system to work with as it lets me get what I want when I want it, instead of having to research bloody sailing even though I'm completely land locked.\n\n 5)  I know this is locked away in Tempest, but naval warfare is so bloody interesting now. With ocean based citadels and bloody weather effects that you have to wrstle with, I've never been happier to play on ocean-heavy maps. The ocean's not just an awkward land, it's its own living breathing world. \n\n6) The living breathing world that is Auriga. The lore I'm uncovering from quests and gameplay is ridiculous, and it really brings the world to life. It makes me sympathise and despise each faction for their motives and executions, and I love it. Plus, I'm learning the more and more I play that this is Sci-Fi, not high fantasy. It's amazing.\n\n7) Minor Factions are a far better method of doing barbarian encampments and city states. They're a great blend of the two, spawning enemy units like barbs, and giving meaningful bonuses like city states. Plus, your opponents can't just take them over and use them as a base of operations against you.\n\n 8) I know this is a controversial one, but I love winter. 1-30 turns where I'm surviving rather than thriving? I'm amazed with how much I love the double edged sword of dread and gratitude depending on whether or not I'm being invaded at the time\n\n9) I love the region system. There's X regions, this is their shape and size, and there's one city for each. I think it makes placing cities a lot more important than in civ where you can fart them around all over the place, and I get a lot less worried about having my neighbours settle all over me (Like the bloody shoshone). Plus, I think it makes zooming out and gazing upon your empire more satisfying. They're something nice about having all those rough edges instead of clean hexagons. Losing a city means losing a huge chuck of territory, and taking a citygains a huge chunk. The wars I've been in have been far more exciting as a result.\n\n10) Populations gets you citizens, like in Civ. I like just yelling at them to make more cabinets, sell more cabinets, or research new and exciting cabinets rather than making them work tiles. The fact that all the tiles get worked on automatically fits into this, as does the fact that your 20 population city is probably going to take up a hell of a lot more space than 1 tile. The fact that you can actually expand cities is something I love\n\n11) The way wars are fought. it;s not just blankets of single units, but a few core armies with 6-8 units in each. It makes it a HECK of a lot quicker and cleaner, while still having a grand scale. The fact that you can hands on rather than auto is something that I like to do if the odds are against my favor, but I can think of a clever stretegy to turn the tide in my favour.\n\n12) The hero system is something I like far more than the great person system. Instead of getting four bloody musicians I can't do anything with until the bloody modern era, you just get heros who you can use as spies, governers or generals, each able to be upgraded into whatever you want them to be or do. It's a super nice system I find, as I can just always get exactly the hero I need when I need them, which leads me nicely onto...\n\n13) The marketplace system is one I like. \"Oh I have no adamantium and noone will trade it with me!\". Well little Billy, you don't just have to resort to war anymore, you can just buy some. At a high price so it shouldn't be your first option, but it's nice to always be able to get what you need. Plus you can play the stock market in case you want to play Offworld Trading Company while you play Endless Legend.It's a nice way to get extra troops and great people too.\n\n\ntl;dr: It's a good game.\n\nGet it.",
      "I technically got this game for free, as it was bought for me from a friend. And honestly, I didn't really like it.

      "I bought this game in order to review it, seeing as there were no current reviews for it. \nI thought I'd help the game out by maybe giving it that tiny bit of publicity it needed to get off the ground.\nIn doing so I have failed. As this game isn't worth reviewing, there is nothing to review. Well, I should say there is stuff to review but I feel as though the dev's didn't even attempt to make this a game that anyone would enjoy.

      "UPDATE: This remains to be one of the best games I have ever played. The company that created the game though... One more launcher that is completely unnecessary. The performance with the 'next-gen' update is horrible. I have half the fps I used to have on the very same rig and that is after going lower with the settings that I used to have. Why did you have to do this b U Ll $I t?\n\n\nThe best way to embrace the true greatness of this game is to look on how the series has improved since the first and the second part of The Witcher. You simply won't find anything that hasn't changed for the better.\n\n- Vast open world that IS NOT randomly created and filled with dull stuff,\n- Story which engages you from the first 10 minutes to the very end,\n- Graphics, even despite the whole controversy of a thing called downgrade, still makes this game THE BEST LOOKING RPG ever created,\n- Soundtrack, it finally goes back to the style presented originally in The Witcher 1, something that makes you forget that's just the video game, it gives you the feeling you are in there, in some village, city or that you are fighting with someone / something, which turns every single battle into an unforgettable memory,\n- Every single side quest, and believe me, there is A LOT of them, is actually a little story that keeps you playing with the same force as the main quests - I call it - a new quality in RPGs,\n- Choices and their impact on the story - even a small choice that seems insignificant at the time can wage on the whole world around you,\n- THIS GAME IS MATURE, finally a game dealing with a lot of subjects which are usually handled very childishly or not at all,\n- Combat - nothing more to add, it's decent, though it's nothing to be praised really, you won't be able to mash buttons and win - you have to dodge, use signs, and on higher difficulties get yourself ready to have an oil for a specific enemy and a bomb to be able to put an end to his or her misery.\n\nThe Witcher 3 is not a game without its flaws, although nothing that can't be fixed - some balance issues, economy basically showing Geralt as a very wealthy person (who he should not be), small performance problems like stuttering in Novigrad and in my opinion very limited after the end content (fixed by the expansions). Many of the things I struggled with have been already fixed and there is no need to disclose them. \n\nAll in all, one of the best games in the last few years (even a decade).",
      "i would recomend it because the physics are great, the game has 8 or 9 level packs (i dont know if there will be a 9th because there are 7 at the time of this review) the units are diverse, there are a lot of secret units to find and i dont know for the final boss because the most expensive unit artimis isnt a good final boss like the dark pesant in the alphas but i hope that the games final boss unit is actually hard to kill and requires more than 7 archers because that wasnt hard or anything hopefully they will make the most expensive unit actually overpowered and unballanced because that would be a great final boss, the sandbox mode is great i like the custom campains , the custom units arent out yet so i cant say anything about that over all this game is worth the money and if its near a sale time like a few days away from a sale then get it on sale if not then just get it you wont regret it and if it lage turn off all the graphics settings",

      "Launch controversy aside, what this game should have been called for the longest time is 'Early Access'. Around the time of the Beyond update is when I'd say would have been the true 'launch'. \n\nI didn't get this when it first came out, but even when I did it was a fragmented mess of a game. Now, finally, with the Beyond and Synthesis updates there's a solid game here that's almost (but not quite) like what Sean Murray promised way back at the beginning.\n\nPerformance on PC has dramatically improved with the switch over to the Vulkan API, and it finally supports Ultrawide and various other PC-specific options. The game itself provides a significant amount of variety, offering a combination of Elite-lite and 'Minecraft in Space' mechanics. There's plenty to see and do, and the exploration aspect is enjoyable - if a little bland. The planetary biomes and overall game could still do with further diversity, but there's plenty here to get to your teeth into.\n\nHello Games show no sign of slowing down their support for the game either, having just recently released a bizarre in-game music synthesizer of all things, and going by the evidence of their progress to date I can only see the game improving further as time moves on.\n\nEDIT - 24/09/2020 \"Origins\" Patch: well, you can ignore the previous comments about diversity being a bit on the low side. They already added things like living ships, derelicts, space creatures and robots since I made this review, and with the Origins patch the variety of experience on offer is on such a scale now that I don't think I'm going to be lacking for things to do for some time. Also, impressively, the game runs even better than it did when I originally posted this - and the rejigged UI looks fantastic on Ultrawide. \n\nBrilliant work by the team at Hello Games. I can't think of any game I've played (and I've been indulging since the late 80's) where I've ever gone from \"I can't stand this\" to \"this is one of my favourite games\". It's taken a while to get here, but No Man's Sky is definitely one of the greats.",
      "I like the game, but I'd recommend waiting for the full release.\nDon't get me wrong, the game is beautiful and it's got great potential. The problem with it is, mostly, the keybindings. They are incredibly uncomfortable to use and you cannot change them.\nPlus, the dialogues sometimes feel never ending and quite pointless.",
      "111 reviews, only 15 bucks, published way back in April... how unfortunate.\n\nOnly one guide for this game. One. The only one that I could find anyway. I only really looked for it because I had a slight difficulty with something I missed. I'd seen what I needed to do earlier, I just didn't remember, probably because I'd run out of coffee quite a while ago.\n\nAnything I could rag on this game would pretty much be nitpicking. In all honesty, if this game made any screw-ups, they are no worse than certain AAA titles that get stupidly enormous amounts of undeserved praise. The ending wasn't perfect, I kinda saw it coming, but it gripped me and it didn't piss me off. Granted, yes, a few holes were left unfilled, but ultimately they can somewhat be ignored due to the way things were wrapped up being quite final. It did seem a tad abrupt, though, but I've seen far worse endings, believe me.\n\nThe gameplay tries to draw elements from all the previous titles and succeeds rather well. I felt it was a bit of a challenge without being completely convoluted and irrational as torturing your neighbor's dog for no reason, so I'm happy. At no point did I really need a guide, but nothing was excessively easy. This and the last game both did this pretty well, unlike Convergence which felt rather too straightforward to me.\n\nMaybe the series could have kept going, wrapped a few more loose-ends up, but overall I think this was a fine conclusion to an excellent series. It's a shining light at the end of it all.",
      "First of all - Subnautica is a good game. Very atmospheric, very scary and overall a really overwhelming experience. At first. \nThis might be the only negative review in this month, but I think some of you might appreciate a different view than \"omg this game is just awesome\". Which it kinda is, but in some points it maybe isnt.\n\nThis first section of the review doesnt contain any major spoilers for the story, just a comment on the overall progress through the game stages.\nAt the time of writing this review, I played the game for ~ 35 hours, I have advanced quite a bit. The first few hours were fantastic, I was looking for new things to explore, the blueprints for all the stuff that I need and every new thing felt like I made a progress. But then at a certain point nothing new happend. It seemed to me like I had all resources I could ever need (even the blue crystals), I had all the vehicles you could build, all the upgrades I needed.\nAnd then there was no challenge anymore. You build your submarines, your bases and the game gets too easy, its not a challenge anymore. Don't continue reading after this point, if you havent played the game yet.\n\n[spoiler] The big strength of this game is the immersion in the seemingly endless underwater worlds. But at a certain point this immersion breaks (at least it did for me).\nNone of the monsters can really harm you, not even the biggest ones are a real threat. Just hop into you seamoth and out-speed everything. If there is a leviathan, just hug the walls or strave, they cant catch you. And if they do, just step out, repair your ship and continue. None of the threats is really dangerous. You really need to have bad luck to die. And if you do ... nothing happens. You just respawn.\nAt first the map seems endless, since you cant move fast. But once you get the seamoth, the map is very finite. Sure, there are deeper levels you cant access with the moth, but everything on the surface is within reach. Its the same with the deeper levels and the prawnsuit.\nSurvival is hard at first, since you constantly need to get water and food. Once you can plant you own food, you have unlimited supply and the survival aspect becomes just an annoyence.\n\nAnother thing that bothers me is the amount of resources you need to build stuff. In the later part of the game you need to build a giant structure. But the necessary resources are just like \"get 3 wooden planks, 2 nails and a hammer\". And with these resources you build the statue of liberty.\n\nMy last point is about the storyline. After something like 15 hours into the game there was a major stall for me - I had no clue where to go, to me it seemed like I searched everything I had access to at that time. I searched for 10 hours and found nothing. I went to the Islands twice to check if I missed anything, but no. I dont know, maybe I just had bad luck and something didnt trigger right, I missed a hint somewhere or something. It eventually went on, but on that point I already had the big submarine, the prawnsuit and everything. The story felt like I just need to run from A to B and back, there was no challenge anymore. \n [/spoiler]\n\nSo anyways. If you made it this far in the review, thanks for reading. If you disagree with me, thats totally fine for me. I don't want to ruin the game for anyone, maybe the points that bother me dont mean much to you.\nI know that my critique is pretty harsh. There are many positive aspects in this game. If you can really dive into this game and fully roleplay it, submerge in its story and ignore some flaws, this is a fantastic game.\nBut maybe some of you are like me, so some of my mentioned points could bother you too.\nThanks for reading, I hope I didnt butcher the English language too badly, feel free to comment, if you like.",
      "It's about time i wrote a proper review for one of my favourite games ever.\n\nRivals of Aether is a platform fighter that tries to follow Super Smash Bros. Melee and P+'s footsteps by making a competitive focused game, but also while trying to keep it more accessible than the former. The game also has a very active workshop that allows players to create their own characters and play ones made by other creators, alongside custom made stages and buddies.\n\nI will focus on the purist aspect of the game first.\n\nAs for many \"smash clones\", the game will feel very familiar to people who already played a smash game, with the controls being nearly identical but with some key differences:\n\n1. THERE'S NO SHIELD. Rivals of Aether is probably the first game in its genre to forgo the iconic \"bubble\" shield, choosing it to replace it with a parry instead. Parries are riskier, staying out for a few frames, and will reward you immensely by either stunning the opponent or reflecting their projectiles. Since parrying is so risky, the game's neutral and defense (but also its offense) will be focused on movement, especially thanks to wavedashing, wavelanding alongside some more niche or character specific movement techs. \n\n2. THE STAGES HAVE NO LEDGES. This means your way to safety when you get knocked off the stage will be actually landing onto the main platform, rather than aiming for the ledges. Rightfully so, the game offers much more options when offstage compared to smash games, with every character having access to wall jumping, an airdodge that doesn't send in freefall and the ability to walljump and cancel special falls, allowing you to use your up special two times. This means the offstage game is a lot deeper than in other game, as there will always be a way back onto the stage since almost every character is allowed a lot of freedom while in disadvantage.\n\n3. THERE'S NO GRABS. There's not much to add here; the absence of a shield makes grabs unnecessary, and thus they're not present in the game. Some characters have command grabs, though.\n\nThere's a total of 14 characters in Rivals of Aether (free from the beginning), with 4 more to come in future patches. Although the cast might seem very slim for people who are used to smash games, it's incredibly diverse. Enough to probably warrant you to try every character. Each character has a lot of depth and can shape the stage in some way. Some fighters take inspiration from smash characters, such as Clairen having a tipper mechanic like Marth, or Absa having Ness and Mewtwo's movement turned up to 200 and Zelda's lightning kicks; this means you'll probably find a character you're familiar with in case you're not confident to play with a brand new character yet. It's also worth mentioning that the game is very balanced, with tiers being very subjective. Regardless, RoA's current top player plays the character that is considered the worst in the game by most, so that should prove that the balance state is very good.\n\nNetplay is not perfect, but it's very good and playable. As i'm writing this review, there's currently a beta build that includes rollback netcode, which presents a couple of bugs and desyncs but does its job quite well. Default build uses delay netcode, which also works just fine in case you're dissatisfied with the rollback beta. Rollback is expected to become the default build once the dev team fixes all its kinks.\n\nEvery stage has both an \"aether\" (casual, with hazards) mode and a \"basic\" (competitive, no hazards) mode. Every single stage in \"basic\" mode is tournament legal (with the exception of tempest peak in some regions), adding a lot of stage variety. Aether stages are aimed for a casual audience, with some spicy traps and whacky platform arrangements for a more casual and laidback experience.\n\nOn that topic, there's no items in this game, so the chaotic free-for-all  factor goes down by a notch, to the discomfort of players who like the party game side of platform fighters.\n\nThe community may be small, but it's very active and constantly organizes weekly and monthly tournaments, with the active (financial and whatnot) support of the game devs themselves, so you will quickly find a community in which to play. Sadly, though, having a small community means you'll be bound to experience some \"dead lobbies\" from time to time.\n\nSolo play, i'll have to be honest, is incredibly lackluster. This game was mainly thought to be played with other players and as a result, single player content is very scarce. There's an arcade-styled story mode which only features a handful of characters (the original 4+2 more), that will have you fight some random fighters until you reach your character's \"rival\" at the end of the story. The cutscenes go from average to bad, depending on the character's story. Each story is very simple and resolves itself in the course of 5 encounters, with a super boss+ a final cutscene once you complete every character's story mode\n\nThere's also \"endless abyss\" mode. It's similar to smash's multi-man mode, where you'll fight a never ending horde of weak cpus, with some minigames slapped inbetween, like a platforming section or explosive enemies. You will have to fight a weaker version of the story mode's boss after a set number of waves each time. The most interesting part of this gamemode is probably the rune system. The rune system will allow to buy runes with the in-game currency that will make your character stronger, be it by making them faster/more powerful or improving their moves. These runes can also be used in abyss versus, which is basically pvp but with runes.\nSadly, endless abyss can become repetitive very quickly, with its never changing waves and gimmicks and grind you have to go through to be able to buy (and use) your runes.\n\nThere's one more mode called Tetherball. It's actually a PvP mode, but i'm putting it in the solo play paragraph because it's a very casual mode. Simply put, the goal of this mode is to hit a beach ball that is attached to a pole by a string and make it spin around it. You score one point when the ball-on-a-string completely wraps the pole. You will have to fight your opponent to keep the control of the ball, as they can hit it as well and make the ball \"theirs\". It's a very fun but often shunned aside mode so i felt like putting it in this review. Please, play Tetherball with me. \n\n\nAs for workshop...\n\nIf you're not big on the competitive scene of platform fighters, this is probably why you came to this store page and. as you may have gathered, casual play is not very fleshed out, with only aether mode and some solo modes as your only options. That's where workshop shines! You'll be able to download hundreds of play made characters, some with the intent of being serious, competitive fighters, while others (most) are aimed to a more casual audience. Characters can go from original characters to the reckless wii mote guy, so you'll have plenty of fun by browsing the worshop page and finding the perfect character, be it an original character or a direct transposition of greninja from Smash Ultimate. Needless to say, you'll also have a huge choice of stages and music packs, alongside some hidden gems like new gamemodes that often pass under the radar. I bet you didn't know you could play Uno in Rivals of Aether!\n\n\n\nTo wrap things up, i'd like to comment on the great pixel art graphics which does its job very well and will appeal to retro gamers specifically, and give my shoutouts on the incredible OST made by flashygoodness. Every track fits the stage perfectly and gives the right atmosphere to this fast paced fighting game.\n\nIn other words this game is a very good purchase for both casual players, thanks to the workshop, and competitive players because of its deep yet accessible design. I hope this review made whoever is reading it consider buying Rivals of Aether and join the community.",
      "the game would've been better if Leon moaned more tbh...",
      "SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT.\n\nAs the store page states, NOREN is supposedly a 'simple' keyfinding game. That would be true if there were any keys actually in the game, but as it stands it seems that NOREN is a simple abandoned shovelware game that's impossible to progress in, let alone beat. You play as some soldier in a massive, dark castle, equipped only with a dying lantern. The light fades quickly, and you can regain light slowly by... standing by a light source. That'd be simple enough if you weren't endlessly pursued by dinosaurs that are programmed with AI which knows your exact location at all times; three chomps and you're 'aparted' from the world, where you respawn with whatever amount of light and sanity you have left. Additionally, the translation attempt is abysmal at best. \n\nBoth NOREN and its developer, ThroneLab, should be banned from Steam. I do not blow the 'scam' whistle lightly, and I only do such when I am 100% certain of something actually being a scam. There are a handful of videos of this title on YouTube as well, with only one being over 5 minutes long. No one found a key. If evidence can be presented to me that there is in fact a way to progress in this game, I will rewrite this review. Until then, beware and stay vigilant.\n\n[h1]Rating: [b]0.0/5.0[/b] - WARNING.

      "Overall, there's just too many things about this game that rub me the wrong way.\n\nFirst of all, I definitely like the art, visuals, music, voice acting, and writing. They don't hold your hand when it comes to explaining the story and it forces you to pay attention and also encourages you to try lots of different function combinations so you can learn more about the characters, if you care to.\n\nOther than that, though, there's not much I like. The most important aspect of games to me is whether the gameplay is fun, and honestly transistor's gameplay isn't that much fun for me. Like others have said, not being able to do anything after you pause time and plan out a sequence of moves just sucks. They don't even give you enough mobility to dodge shots. All you can really do is try to get to cover and hide out until your meter replenishes. And if you opt to instead play without using turn (or using turn to pause and think and then unpausing and simply executing your actions manually), you'll probably disappointed by that experience when comparing it to the action oriented gameplay of bastion. One of the worst things, in my opinion, is that you lose access to functions when you lose all your health. Honestly I'd rather just die and restart from checkpoint. I can see that they're trying to encourage you to try different combinations of things, but it still just frustrates me losing the build that I was in the process of learning. And when your options are limited the gameplay just gets more and more boring because you might have to resort to gimmicky tactics depending on what functions you are left with. Overall, it's certainly a unique idea to blend the turn-based with real-time combat, but, in practice, it ends up just not being all that fun to me. I'd rather play a turn based game or an action game. My brain doesn't like switching between the two so rapidly.\n\nI would say get this heavily discounted and play it for the uniqueness and aesthetics. Don't come here expecting something very heavy or that you're going to really want to sink countless hours into or replay. My first playthrough was done in 6 hours and I was glad to be done with it. I have to complement them for not dragging it out or having some frustratingly long and tedious boss fight at the end. If the story went on even an hour longer I might've just gotten sick of it and given up.\n\nIf you're into experience games more along the lines of how you experience art or other aesthetic experiences (and not necesarilly for the thrill of challenge and victory), you should definitely consider this game. There's a lot there to process. I personally don't care much about that sort of thing when it comes to games, though.",
      "Edited\n\nI Didn’t have high expectations for this game. I read the reviews and expected a mediocre game from ubisoft. I was let down big time. I was given a watered down version of Syndicate that had terrible game mechanics.\n\tAs I navigated the first enemy compound I came across it felt difficult to navigate through the grass and between the buildings. Clearly not developed as a stealth game. Once I had given up on the whole stealth aspect of the mission I was very easily able to slaughter all of the guards in the compound. I trying using the bow but it’s hard to use compared to Tomb Raider and Far Cry Primal’s easy to use bow. Sword combat could have been improved but it wasn’t the worst I’ve seen. No skill required, just click the mouse button rapidly to kill all of the guards in your path. The devs clearly didn’t try that hard because they knew that people would by their game anyways because of Ubisoft and Assassin’s Creed fanboys.\n\tAssassin’s Creed: Origins could’ve been an amazing game that would revolutionize the series but no. The devs had to ruin that possibility by being lazy and making a watered down version of Syndicate. I’ve played Syndicate quite a bit and I thought it was a good game. Don’t get this game for the full price or even for $35. Let’s hope Ubisoft gets their shit together and doesn't fuck up Far Cry 5.\n\nThank you for your time.",

      "[h1]Dishonored 2.[/h1]\n[i]If old Samuel could see me now...[/i]\n\n[b][u]Introduction[/u][/b]\nAt its core, Dishonored 2 is little more than a mechanically and narratively contiguous continuation of the Dishonored formula. This isn't a bad thing - the first Dishonored was one of the best stealth-action games of all time - but innovation is too often overlooked in the games industry. DH2 does bring some nuance to the franchise, but new drawbacks are packaged in as well. Put plainly, Dishonored 2 is a game I adore just as much as the original, but there are aspects that certainly left me wishing for better.\n\n[b][u]Plot[/u][/b]\nThe game begins 15 years following Empress Jessamine's assassination, and her daughter, Empress Emily Kaldwin, has ruled the isles since that time. Her father and Lord Protector, Corvo Attano, advises and keeps close watch over her at court. Quickly after Dishonored 2's opening however, the Duke of Serkonos, Luca Abele, comes to Emily's royal tower - bearing a gift. He brings Emily's supposed long lost aunt, Delilah Kaldwin, who then immediately stages a coup in a bid to take the throne. She is successful, and you must escape the city of Dunwall as either Emily or Corvo (more on that later). You then travel to Karnaca, the capital of Serkonos, where you begin a personal crusade to [i]take back what's yours.[/i]\n\n[b][u]Technical Revamp[/u][/b]\nShifting focus for a look at DH2's presentation, the game is gorgeous. There's a hint of the old, comic-book-like aesthetic that was present in the original game, but the graphical fidelity has been greatly improved in this sequel. The textures, lighting, animations, visual effects, and environments are all elegantly rendered. It's easily one of the most beautiful games of 2016. As for the audio; sound effects and voices are realistic, and the OST is as iconic, if not more so than the first game's. Although, when it comes to performance, Dishonored 2 clearly falters. DH2 was a technical mess on launch, and while it runs decently now; some bugs, stutters, and crashes still persist. Overall the presentation is good, but the performance is surely sub-par.\n\n[b][u]Setting & Exploration[/u][/b]\nAs stated earlier, Dishonored 2 is set in Serkonos's city of Karnaca; known as The Jewel of the South. Gone are the dark grays and subdued browns of Dunwall, as Karnaca replaces them with bright, pastel blues and yellows. The metropolis has distinct cultural differences from Dunwall as well, whether it's the widespread use of wind-power over whale oil, or Karnaca's reliance on silver mining to employ its working class. In terms of level design, DH2's stages are much more expansive than anything seen in the first game too. There's lots to explore in every district of Karnaca, especially when verticality and hidden locations are taken into account. There's several routes toward all objectives as well; emphasizing Arkane's \"play your way\" motto. All considered, Dishonored 2's game world is exceedingly well-built.\n\n[b][u]Depth in the Details[/u][/b]\nOne of the most effective ways DH2 differentiates itself from its predecessors is through what I'd call 'structural gimmicks.' To break up the standard pacing, a couple of the game's missions have special set-pieces which can completely turn gameplay convention on its head. An example of this is the 'Clockwork Mansion' on the fourth level. This inventor's home has levers in essentially every chamber that reconfigures a room's layout - such as turning a trophy room into a grand hall. These levers can be used to access new areas or evade enemies, and even reveal traversable spaces behind the walls. It's this degree of imaginative design depth that distinguishes Dishonored 2 from most other games in its genre.\n\n[b][u]Stealth & Combat[/u][/b]\nMoving over to the core gameplay loop, not much has changed from the first game. The stealth and combat are still just as exquisitely implemented as before, with only a couple of refinements. The deviations that come to mind are that drop-assassinations can now be used non-lethally as drop-knockouts, and assassination animations are a much more brutal (but cathartic) spectacle to watch than before. Dishonored 2's central mechanics are near flawless to be sure, but this sequel suffers by adding few new gameplay elements to the mix. Except - well - there is one big feature I've neglected to elaborate on as of yet.\n\n[b][u]Emily [i]or[/i] Corvo[/u][/b]\nIn Dishonored 2, you can play as either Emily Kaldwin, [i]or[/i] Corvo Attano. When Delilah first takes the throne you get a moment to choose one or the other, after which the character you don't pick is turned into a cold, stone statue. Both Emily and Corvo have separate voice actors and personalities, but they share the same goal throughout the game's duration: to save the last of their family, and reclaim the throne for the true Kaldwin heiress. After receiving the mark of The Outsider, Emily and Corvo have different magical abilities too. Where Corvo has blink, Emily has far reach; or where Corvo can stop time, Emily can chain together the lives of her enemies, and kill or incapacitate several people at once. All in all, the decision to allow the player to progress the campaign as either Emily or Corvo was a stroke of brilliance in my estimation.\n\n[b][u]Main Story[/u][/b]\nReturning to the main story - it's another point of criticism for me. There are some magnificent aspects; such as the nostalgic callbacks to events in the first Dishonored or reappearances of some of the original game's best characters, but all considered most of the writing is retreading a beaten path. Just as in Dishonored 1, the game flows from mission to mission where the chief objective is simply to eliminate a key player obstructing your path to the throne. This is perfectly fine from a gameplay perspective, but it can lead to a bit of déjà vu from a narrative outlook. Dishonored 2's writing quality isn't poor, but it doesn't distance itself from the comfortable story-staging of its predecessor, making it feel slightly lazy.\n\n[b][u]A Reactive World[/u][/b]\nOn the other side of the same coin, the narrative reactivity of Dishonored 2's world to your choices is truly admirable. Playing DH2 in high chaos; where you murder many people throughout the game, results in huge environmental storytelling changes compared to low chaos. Here's an example. If you flood the streets of Karnaca red with blood, subsequent levels show you've harmed the city's inhabitants before you even arrive. Citizens’ moods and perceptions will have soured as they become depressed or monstrous in the wake of their crumbling city - causing suicides and murders to spike throughout Karnaca. And corpses bring bloodflies, which further tarnishes The Jewel of the South in a vicious cycle. You can, of course, avoid all this... by showing a whole lot of care in your actions toward others.\n\n[b][u]Conclusion[/u][/b]\nWhen all is said and done, the Dishonored formula is a fantastic one that it's hard to not have fun with. Karnaca is riddled with environmental detail, the stealth mechanics are flawless, combat is devilishly enjoyable, and the game judges you intelligently on your choices. The Dishonored IP is incredibly strong... The tweaks provided are appreciable; I just wish DH2 had made a concerted effort to make it even stronger. But, god-dammit, I enjoyed Dishonored 2 way too much over it's 20+ hour campaign to critique it any longer. Get the game and play it - despite all my pissy complaints, you won't be disappointed.\n\n[h1]Personal Rating: 9/10 - Absolutely Outstanding[/h1]",

      "An interesting experience for RPGMaker vidya enthusiasts.\n\nBefore you pick up this title, be sure to download and play the demo, as the demo is the (free) first episode of the series, this game being the second episode.\n\nA Psychological Thriller, as stated in the description, is probably the best way to describe this series, an adventure through bizzare yet oddly pretty settings.\n\nThe first episode is quite a fun, humorous adventure, but still manages to be gripping and gut-wrenching in some areas. Difficult for me to describe in words, but it's free, so there's no reason not to play it.\n\nThe second episode strays from the fun, humorous side of things and focuses more on story, an unexpected yet completely welcome change of tone. If you enjoyed the first and got to like the characters, the second episode is well worth the price.\n\nFeel free to pick it up if it seems interesting to you.",

      "Wow! Let me start by saying that for the last year, I worked in what could be called a high tech arcade. We featured a number of VR stations there, and I watched people playing Beast Pets that entire time. I ended up leaving the arcade before being able to try the game (the stations were only on when customers came in, which is when I left for the day), but since I had watched enough people try it, I felt like I had a pretty good grasp of the gameplay -- cute and light. When I saw it hit the Steam store, I was curious to finally play it. I'm more of an FPS/RPG kind of gamer, so I wasn't sure how much I'd be playing it. Well...it's really fun!! There's an immersive aspect to interacting with little AI's in VR that completely changes the experience. For example, while playing Skyrim, you get to have little companions. You interact with them a bit, they follow you around, and that's basically it. But when you're in VR, it actually feels the same as when I'm playing with my puppies. These little guys can fetch, follow a laser, and interact with the environment. There are places for you to explore, and each location offers something unique for the dragons (and you) to play with. And speaking of the environments, they're really pretty! The art style is low-poly, and it works perfectly to create ambiance while allowing you to interact with your new pets. The creators came up with some really clever conventions for interaction that make the experience smooth and hassle-free. This game is great for everyone, and I promise you it's absolutely worth your time.",
      "[strike][h1]Best Sex Language Synonym Reference Book 2016, 10/10[/h1][/strike]\n\n-Nah. Not really.\n\nEdit: Upon completing this game, here's something I'll have to claim in advance: while still recommending this great game with an 8 out of 10 and it has quite a solid story, I'll have to admit  that apart from Dorothy's hidden scenario, this game did not dig very deep into its cyberpunk/dystopian background, which is really a pity - and it's becoming the reason to expect another game (more specifically, A [b]SEQUEL[/b]!!!!! or prequel) from them :)\n\nVA-11 Hall-A - or Valhalla for convenience - while seemingly was a Waifu Bartending Simulation game, is actually somewhat [i]Papers, Please[/i] with excellent characters, vivid graphics, elaborated dialogues and not-so-mind-fucking gaming mechanics.\n\nDon't get me wrong: I love [i]Papers, Please[/i] and of course would rather NOT say that one is superior to another; they are both one of their unique kind, but with the very same root - under the daily life of dystopia denizens, truth and conspiracies weave with vague notices in advance; and just before you could think twice things are going really, really out of track.\n\nThat being said, I mean these two games are very similiar in story-telling: as long as you enjoy taking in all the random, weird stories as a bystander, just to find out that all these fragments come together and form a bigger picture, this game is definitely for you. And you get cyberpunk waifus, a Joshikousei hologram, a pretty cool onêchan as protagonist - and more!\n\nLast but not least, the developers of this game are nothing but truly [b]RESPECTABLE[/b]. We have crybabies on Kickstarter and Steam Early Access every focking day blaming everything for their faulty products, while this army of two whined [b]NOTHING[/b] about all the fuck-ups in Venezuela unless asked. Game dalayed? Only apologies, no excuses. That deserves a huge fricking medal and Developer of The Year.\n\nGrab the game if you want some real relax and good story before they grab Dorothy. And support the developers! They deserve this, Dorothy deserves this.",
      "EDIT:\n\nWhile I have played Squad quite a bit for a few years, the large update named \"V6.0 Infantry Combat Overhaul\" unfortunately did not sit well with me.\n\nThe goals for the update:\n\n- Increase length of fights.\n- Reduce the impact of lone wolfs (solo players).\n- Increase emphasis on teamwork mechanics, which mainly meant supression.\n- Increase gunplay diversity, to create choices between optics, since the old meta meant that the magnified optics were greatly outperforming iron sights and holo sights.\n\nWhile I do not disagree with some of the goals, the implementation of them left a lot to be desired.\n\nAfter the update most gunfights became a mess of supression, without either side being able to effetively kill each other beyond 200m.\nGunhandling was also drastically nerfed, creating the sense that your character has never held a rifle before, or even used an optic for that matter.\n\nI can unfortunately no longer recommend this game, since I myself no longer feel drawn to play it.\n\nIf enough changes are made, I may revisit the game and this review, but for now there are better options out there.\n\n\n** OLD REVIEW ** \n\nCan the game be amazing and fun - yes! Do I recommend this for everyone? - No.\n\nThe experience of the game largely depends on what servers / communities you play with. If you play the core game with no moderation (no rules or admins), the game will become a race to make the first unit and lock others out and a race to get armor, then proceed to rush the enemy and end up spawnkilling them near their main spawn.\n\nIf you play on moderated servers with established rules and active admins, then you may experience a great sense of teamplay - other times not so much.\n\nBefore you buy it though...\n\n- Microphone and willingness to use it is REQUIRED for a good experience (People will quickly kick or become hostile towards you, if you do not communicate)\n- This is not battlefield or call of duty, running of solo to pull off 360 noscopes will probably get you kicked/ killed.\n- You will die without knowing from where and you will get into situations in which you have no option to survive, especially if you're new to tactical shooters.\n- You will end up running... A lot..\n- Armor is not like battlefield or call of duty, you need a driver, gunner, commander and possibly a loader (has a machinegun). Where you hit the enemy matters as much as what you hit him with (Armor piercing on his front turret will likely bounce, but even a high explosive may hurt if you can hit him up the rear)\n\nStill here... ?\n\nIf I haven't scared you off, here are my personal tips:\n- Play. The. Tutorial.  Like really...\n- Try different graphic settings, shadows especially makes a big difference in enemy visibility (game looks better with them though)\n- Start as infantry and pick rifleman, but remember to join a squad.\n- Find a server that seems to have active admins and have a ruleset you agree with.\n- Try NOT to give up when you die, generally it isn't worth throwing away a ticket to respawn if you have friendlies within 100m. Sometimes it is the right choice, but before you know which is which, it's a good idea to hold on for a medic.\n- Not all squad leaders know what they're doing, do not be afraid to join another squad if it turns out your squad leader is a fool.\n- Defending is often as important (if not more), than attacking... But you may end up waiting 30 minutes without getting shot at or shooting anyone.\n\n\nAs you can probably tell... Squad is a community based game, with in-depth enough mechanics, while also being easily accessable.\nIf you want a good sense of what the game is, check out some lesser known streamer playing it (bigger streamers will often give you the wrong sense of what a game is like)\n\nHope this helped you make an informed decision.\n\nbut for now there are better options out there.",

      "I hated Undertale.\n\nIt was, pretty clearly, a game about sexy skeletons. I did not care about sexy skeletons. I refused to play a game about sexy skeletons.\n\nThen my friend made me listen to the soundtrack, and I decided I could deal with a few hours of sexy skeletons if I got to listen to the best video game music I had ever heard while doing it. \n\nI played Undertale. It's not a game about sexy skeletons. It's a game about choices, maybe, or morality, or curiosity. It's a game about pushing the limits. It's a game about experiences, about \"what would happen if I did this?\", about storytelling so intricate and complex and raw that it shouldn't be able to fit into seven hours of bullet hell and pixel graphics. But, somehow, it does. Every choice you make has an impact. Every object you check has a story. The soundtrack, the witty yet profound writing, the simple pixel graphics, and even the menu screens and bullet patterns themselves all intertwine in order to tell a story that only you decide the ending of.\n\nAlso, the skeletons aren't even sexy.\n\nMy advice to you: Go in as blind as you can. Don't read walkthroughs. Don't watch playthroughs. Don't prepare yourself. Don't even look at overviews. Hell, don't even read the Steam page description. Just buy the game (and give some well-earned money to a little white dog), and, as it were, climb the mountain yourself. Don't let anyone backseat. Don't listen to people who tell you there's a right way to play.\n\nAnd when you think you've reached the end, just think--what other choices could you have made?\n\nSo, yes. I hated Undertale.\n\nAnd then I played it.",
      "This game has such a HUGE potential like Stardew Valley in its early days!!\nCollecting stuff, helping people by crafting potions its so rewarding and lovely pls dear developers keep working on it. I BEG YOU! :D\nSure it has some bug right now but even on day one they managed to get some fast fixes and tried their best to make it work for everyone. \nThe controls were a bit tricky in the beginning (used Playstation 5 Controller) but its just a matter of time, its just not the normal controls like in other games.\nThe music was pretty nice and chill and also the animations were super cute, i love watching little Rubrum built his sandcastles over and over again. >3< \n\nOverall a good game, but could become even more better in the future, keep going guys!!",
      "Alpha, Beta, Finished Product... I hear lots of Blah blah blahs complaining about this game not being out of Alpha after years and years, but it isn't like we've been paying a monthly fee for it.  I paid one time to support this game and I've got years of play out of a product that I enjoy.  There aren't too many games that scratch an itch like this game for me... Open World, completely editable/buildable environment and zombies!  One of my biggest issues with a game that I like is that after I buy it, they release a few DLCs and then move on to their next product.  Alpha, Beta, Finished or Not... the developers have given me years of standing by their product and many updates with new content and mechanics.  For that alone, I love their game!\n\nGraphics: 3 outta 5 graphics, she looks a little dated but they keep updating it... It looks better than it originally did.  There's growth\nReplayability: 5 outta 5\nGameplay:3 outta 5... sometimes she's a little clunky\n\nI definitely still believe that this game is worth buying and that they devs and their product is worth supporting.

      "Why did i get this game???\n\nWell.. Mainly because i've always liked seeing those big trucks driving by me, So i wondered what it would feel like driving a big tractor trailer, And so i got this!\n\nHonestly, I can't say if it's anything like a real truck, But this game does get very very complicating when it comes to parking with your 53' container, And it makes me wonder, Wow! Those guys must really have some good practice! Because if i can't do it here, I for sure wont be able to do it in real life! xD\n\nMultiplayer is super fun as well, Driving next to other truck drivers and then honking at them, or meeting new friends, SOME actually truck drivers, and then traveling with them, Stopping to weight your freight, getting gas and such, It's a very fun experience.\n\nHonest Rating: 10/10 As of right now, Because I feel like i haven't played enough to experience any problems or bugs, But the game is very fun!! ***ONLY IF YOU LOVE SIMULATOR GAMES, If you don't, Then maybe think twice, But I enjoy simulator games.*** And if you want to give this game a try as your first Simulator game, Then i would recommend it!\n\nRecommendable? Yes, I recommend it to people who want to give Simulator games a try, This is a perfect one. (Or Euro Truck Simulator) Although if you're from the USA i recommend this one, Because Euro Truck Simulator has different driving rules than US, So you might get tickets for some things you don't know lol..",
      "Do you like Super Metroid? if you do, just play this game. \nThis game has a lot of exploration, a lot of colectables and weapons, a big world filled with secrets, a very interesting story, a lot of cool abilities and a very cool artstyle.\nThis days the tag \"metroidvania\" is on almost half of all the indie games I see on steam. But I  can honestly say, that this one is one of the few (if not the only one) that truly deserves that tag.\nIt gives you the feel of those 2d metroid and castlevania games, but with a lot of little tweaks that brings that play style to the new era of gamming.\nTo make this whole thing even more amazing, this game was made by just one man.

      "A missed opportunity. But, if you liked the original, you'll like this one as well.\n\nGreat graphics and sound, just like its predecessor. Once again, bonus points for ultrawide support. No complaints about the presentation, but some of the characters definitely rub me the wrong way. YMMV in that department. \n\nI had read that the original writer passed away. I see this left the team with a difficult choice. To their credit, I could not tell the difference between the two. It emulates the same style and tone, and I imagine this is intentional to honor the spirit of the original author's intent. Unfortunately, I think the writing was the worst part of the original by far, and I see this as a missed opportunity to move on from that. \n\nAll of the supernatural elements in this story are but the thinnest of veils for what is ultimately a collection of modern day social media discourse. There is rampant virtue signaling, and every character speaks about the world around them as if they live inside Twitter. There are a scant few genuine moments, and I can appreciate the fact that the writer(s?) clearly feel a lot of angst about putting themselves out there and the creative process in general. There is a complete lack of subtlety in the writing regarding this, but I see it and I get it. \n\nIt feels a lot more disappointing than the first one, as we're familiar with much of the cast already, and there's not a lot of progress or poignancy in their respective narratives. I genuinely came away from this game feeling like I spent a few hours reading Twitter threads. It's nothing but surface level social commentary.\n\nGiven that the intent here was probably to honor the original writer, I'd still be in for a Coffee Talk 3 in the hopes that they show some growth and try something different. If that one also ends up being the same, I'd definitely call it quits. \n\nFWIW, this is certainly a worthy tribute for those who do not find fault with the original.",

      "[h1]Strategy at its finest[/h1]\n\nInto the Breach is Subset Game’s latest title, following on from their massive hit, FTL. I put off trying Into the Breach for a long while, but I finally got it when it dropped down to $10 on HB a couple of months ago and I’m so glad I did. This game isn’t for everyone, it’s kind of rogue-like mech chess, but if it clicks for you then it’ll be one of the best strategy games you’ll ever play.\n\n[h1]Positives:[/h1]\n[list][*]First up, the game looks fantastic. The pixel art here is great, from the backgrounds to the mechs and even the pilot portraits. The animations here area also really good. There’s nothing too complicated here but it’s all well executed. On the topic of appearances, I also really like the way the maps are laid out, the 8x8 grids on a plain background work really well here and it reminds me of simple boardgames. I think it works well for the game.\n\n[*]As with any good strategy game, it’s easy to pick up, but hard to master. You have a squad of three mechs (there are a few different mech groups to unlock with gold coins (?) and you can also create custom groups from the mechs you’ve unlocked). Each group has a unique element, but they all follow the basic structure of one close-range mech, one long-range mech and one support mech. Each mech has a different ability/weapon and they’re all well varied. The mech teams are really well designed here so that no one mech is super powerful and they all work really well as a unit. \n\n[*]The combat is excellent. It’s really simple but it works so well. You’ll quickly learn the different roles your mechs have and figure out the best strategies to use them. There are two ways to kill most enemies. Getting rid of all of their HP or pushing them into water/lava (with the exception of boss enemies or flying enemies). However, a lot of the time you probably won’t even be trying to kill your enemies in a given turn. You can always see what the enemies will do on their next turn and so you always want to be playing to react to/prevent their next move. Typically, enemies target civilian buildings or buildings related to your objective, so it’s usually better to focus on moving them away from these buildings rather than focusing on killing them. If you’re really smart/lucky you can also push enemies so that they attack each other, as friendly fire is a major part of this game. It’s really satisfying when you line it up right so the enemies are killing each other rather than attacking you or the buildings you defend. You can even block them from spawning by moving something on top of them!\n\n[*]Unlocks in this game are handled better than in FTL in my opinion. There are six actions that you can complete with each mech squad to earn those gold coins I mentioned in order to unlock new mech squads. The first three are the three possible victories: two, three and four island (more on that in a second) and then the other three achievements are unique to each mech squad. They’re centred around the unique aspect of each squad, tasking you to get a bit creative with the way that you’re playing. I know some players didn’t like the way that unlocks worked but I think it’s a really good way to handle it and encourages you to try new strategies. \n\n[*]The game has five islands, with one of those being the final boss fight. Each island is basically a different biome with different enemies and environmental hazards. They aren’t necessarily easier or harder than each other to start with, but the difficulty does increase as you move from island to island. There is some crossover with the enemies you’ll see, but they at the very least have a different appearance and most of them behave differently. There are also enemies unique to each island. \n\n[*]On each island, you’ll need to complete several missions before facing off against the island’s mini-boss. The missions all have different objectives for you to complete, though the win condition is always just to survive all of the turns (typically 5 turns). The different objectives vary but there are usual two, with some easier missions only having one and harder missions having three. Completing these objectives gets you certain rewards. You can either get stars, which are used upon completing an island to purchase new pilots, abilities or weapons. There is grid power which restores or increases the grid power you start with (grid power is lost when buildings are destroyed, losing all grid power results in a loss). Lastly, some of the missions award power cores (usually you only see this as the third reward for a hard mission) which allow you to upgrade your mech’s weapons or abilities (super handy). The mission variety is fairly good.\n\n[*]There are a range of different pilots in the game. You always start with one ‘special’ pilot and two regular pilots but more can be found in cryo-pods or bought at the end-of-island store. All pilots earn xp at the end of missions and when they level up they get some kind of upgrade, like more mech health or an extra movement per turn. The ‘special’ pilots all have some kind of special ability, such as being able to attack twice if you don’t move or the ability for the piloted mech to fly. Some of these require a power core, but they’re definitely worth it.  [/list]\n\n[h1]Negatives: [/h1]\n[list][*]Honestly, I’m clutching at straws here for negatives. One thing I would mention is that I don’t think this game will have as much replay value as FTL does for most people (completionists have an awful lot to do here) which shouldn’t put you off from getting it, but is something to base your expectations on. I also felt like Chris Avellone was a bit wasted on this game, his writing is fantastic but there just isn’t much of it. [/list]\n\n[h1]Verdict: [/h1]\n\nInto the Breach is as close to a perfect strategy game as I’ve ever played and it’s an excellent follow-up to FTL. This game is easy to pick up, hard to master and it looks beautiful the whole time you’re playing this weird mech chess. I can’t recommend this enough and at $15 it’s an absolute steal. This was easily one of my favourite releases of 2018 and anyone who likes strategy absolutely needs this in their library. \n\nIf you found this review helpful, please check out my other reviews over at [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33633486/]Kemo's Corner.[/url]",
      "There is an ethereal beauty to Ori that makes you believe in the power of love. As you play it you know you're experiencing something special that comes around very seldomly and that you should do everything within your power to appreciate it. It feels like a special privilege to play through it. Its a piece of art for the twenty first century. It's a reminder that there still exists impossible beauty in what sometimes feels like a bleak hopeless materialistic world. If you remain steadfast though and look for it, you will find things that will inspire you, things that will give you hope again and things that will remind you of why life is so beautiful and worth fighting for. Don't despair, fight. Fight for Ori and everything she stands for. It's worth it.",
      "So um, I don't usually write reviews like this or much at all really. I mostly make unfunny jokes and call it a review or something super generic. I guess I'll just write whats on my mind.\n\nI really liked this game.\nI felt like I was a kid again playing Super Mario 64.\nSometimes I get tired of shooting guns. Or slashing fantasy monsters with some shiny sword. Or saving the magic land from evil. Or using hyper combos I never remember. Or collecting resources to build a quirky town. Or time managing some distant farm. Or driving some tricked out vehicles. Or investing in status points to make super strong characters. Or following a long and convoluted plot with crazy lore.\n\nSometimes I just wanna run and jump around while I pick up some cool looking stuff.\nI, uh, had a lot fun playing this game. \nThanks.",
      "Let's get this out of the way: If you're into Chris Avellone/Obsidian/Black Isle kind of games and know what that even means, you know what you're getting. Another clunky game with writing so good you'll forgive any of its flaws. It's another one of those games: a Baldur's Gate, NWN2, Kotor 2, Fallout: New Vegas, Alpha Protocol kinda game.\n\nIf that paragraph didn't make any sense, the rest of this review is for you. Planescape: Torment tends to be less hack-and-slash than it looks, playing according to a system roughly based on second edition Dungeons & Dragons. But in a big departure from both, you can solve a huge amount of your problems with minimal combat and the real meat of the game comes in your decision making, mystery solving, and dealing with people around you. True to the Planescape setting, Torment is a game about the power of belief and the battlefield of ideas.\n\nI don't want to oversell that because you *will* be attacked by random thugs, some combats are downright mandatory, and there is a very real difficulty spike about three quarters through the game. But the allies you keep and the knowledge you gain can help you bypass some encounters or at least trivalize them under mountains of xp gained from unraveling cosmic questions. \n\nIt's a grim, often macabre journey back and forth across the boundaries of life and death where even the happiest endings are pretty heavy, but it's also a brilliantly written, thought-provoking experience that's well worth the time and money. Just make sure to go deep on wisdom, okay, berk? Don't need some dusty penning you in the deadbook because you couldn't see the dark of things, cutter.",
      "I don't like rogue-likes ( or rogue-lites). Don't get me wrong, I've tried! I'll buy some well-reviewed game like Enter the Gungeon, boot it up, play for an hour or two, then let it sit in my library until time immemorial. It's a cycle I was loath to repeat which is why despite enjoying the rest of Supergiant's games I stayed away from Hades for about a year.\n\nThis is not like other rogue-likes.\n\nThere are going to be a lot of reviews about Supergiant's signature visuals, rocking soundtrack, and tight combat( or about how Cerberus is a good boy). These are all true, and if you already like the rogue-like genre should sell you on this game, but if you're like me that's not enough. The reason I've played more of this game than any other rogue-like is because of Supergiant's ability to combine story and gameplay. In a lesser game, picking up a powerup consists of a menu screen or a short visual cue, but in Hades picking a boon means learning more about the crazy gods on mount olympus. Is Poseidon jealous of Zeus? Does Athena resent Ares? Is Dionysis drunk?  You'll get to experience all of these little dramas and more as you progress through a run, but where Hades really sets itself apart from the rest of genre is what happens after a run. \n\nDying in Hades isn't like losing, it's like coming home. \n\nYou'll get to check in on all of the characters in the masters house, from hypnos the sleepy doorman, your mentor Achilles, to mother night herself. Not to mention the adorable house-keeper. Sometimes it's not about Zagreus, but the relationships all of these colorful characters have which each other which will develop over each failure as you return to the house of Hades. Afterwards I can unlock new weapons (or weapon aspects), new powerups, or see the new items I've collected and prepare for my next run. It's a thoroughly satisfying loop, so even if you don't think this is your type of game, you should give it a shot.",

Cutscene? Crash. Go down the wrong hall? Crash. Jump at the wrong time? Crash. THE GAME IS UNPLAYABLE. \n\nI never write reviews, but I can't let this one go. If I can prevent just one other person from purchasing this trash fire, it will be worth it. Again: DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A SIGN AS TO WHETHER TO BUY THIS GAME OR NOT, HERE IT IS. DO NOT.",
      "It's hard to recommend Spelunky 2. Not because it is a bad game, but because it can be frustrating. As with most roguelikes, dying means going back to the beginning. In Spelunky however, nothing carries over to future runs. All you get to bring in to your next run is your own experience and knowledge; And when half the things in the game kill you instantly or stunlock you to death, having a great run end in a quick death can be damaging to one's will.\n\nThankfully, your own experiences count a great deal towards your progress. Most hazards and enemies in Spelunky 2 have a very simple and predictable behaviour. But keeping track of everything on the screen is still a challenge. Enemies and traps will also work together (or against each other) and still bring your demise somehow. Either by bumping your helplessly stunned body into other enemies and traps, or enemies having their own flaming corpse launched towards you and your flammable jetpack. It's actually quite funny sometimes. A good deal of entertainment can be had recording your own amazingly nonsensical deaths.\n\nSpelunky 2 improves upon Spelunky HD's gameplay by adding split paths, which allow for more variety and decision-making in your runs while staying true to the feeling and style of previous entries. It also adds a back layer to each level, allowing for more secrets to be kept. After successfully completing your first run, you can try to discover these secrets and find hidden bosses and areas and even different endings!\n\nAnyway, you might enjoy the game if you're a masochist or something.",

Now Rez Infinite comes out, and the cycle repeats itself...\n\nBut this time, I'm wearing a f**king VR helmet. As someone who played many VR titles before this, and as someone who wanted this game, but put off playing it for full price... it lives up to the hype (it might help that this is the first time actually wearing headphones with it too...)

Decent gameplay that grows on you, cool sound track helped immensely by the cool way the sound effects play a part of the song, and great visuals all combine to explain how this game is pretty much the start of any cliche \"games are art\" speech. If you never played it and don't have VR, it's worth $15 (I'm sure. Haven't played this on the flatscreen, but I spent $15 on Rez HD I think, and I didn't regret it). If you have VR and any sort of nostalgia for this game, you probably wouldn't hate yourself buying it at full price, even if you're as cheap as me. If you only kind of liked the game before but didn't really see what the fuss was about, the ten or so minutes of Area X will probably show you why this game has such a cult following. \n\nAnd if you're a Rez fanatic? You'd spend $50 on Area X and still say you got your money's worth, short as it is.",
      "If Animus would have ever spent a night of passion with GlaDOS, then this would be their child :) Influenced by Portal series and early Assassin's Creed games, among others, this game is a mind-blowing combination of puzzle-solving tasks with a story which builds a philosophical bridge between religion and science in a way that can only be called a stroke of genius.\n\nI can't say that Talos Principle is better than Portal. It's beyond Portal.\n\nIt takes Portal's approach to first person environmental puzzle solving and, standing on its shoulders, reaches higher, offering you much more sophisticated puzzles of various kinds that sometimes have several layers and sometimes even inter-operate. The reality you are operating in is filled with messages and secrets, not unlike the world of Animus from Assassin's Creed, telling you a story and fuelling your brain. And just like in AC, you get some secondary things to do when you get tired of the \"main\" puzzles.\n\nThe graphics are fantastic. Landscapes are gorgeous. Controls are perfect. Music is superb. Voice acting is impeccable. Length is ideal. Puzzles are mind-bending. Progression is non-linear. This game might be officially \"indie\", but its quality is triple A. Or quad A. To call it non-trivial is like to say that a rocket is non-slow. And what's most valuable, is that you don't feel that profits were the top priority for the makers. The game was.\n\nThe things I love about it the most:\n• Assisted jumping. Just brilliant. If only Quantum Conundrum had it.\n• No fake puzzles based on arcade elements.\n• Weather effects.\n• I can get as close as I can to a wall and still see no blurred textures.\n• Wherever I go, I never get stuck in terrain.\n• Skippable intro movie and sensible menus.\n• Runs on my Macbook Pro.\n• Has a free demo.\n• It's so clever, it feels alive.\n\nThe things I dislike:\n• Loud \"Death\" sequence can give one a pretty good scare when comes unexpected.\n• It ends.\n\nIf you like puzzles - buy it. If you like first person games - buy it. If you like philosophy - buy it. If you like lasers - buy it. If you like finding secrets - buy it. If you like clever writing - buy it. If you like computer games - buy it! And if you don't like computer games... You just never played this one :)",

      "Should you buy this game? So glad you asked. Yes!\n\nShould this be your very first JRPG? Yes, [i]but...[/i] read on.\n\n*\n\nMy recent gamplay was a 90+hr adventure (some offline) that was well worth the discounted price (-50% = 8€). The game's positive reviews are well-deserved, but tell little of actual gameplay to someone who might be interested in this kind of RPG, but never did play a JRPG/SRPG. \n\nThis was may be your case, too, so here's what I learned... \n\n***** [b] World of Zemuria[/b]: thoughtful, detailed, infinitely rich. (5/5)\n\nFor this installment in the popular franchise we get to adventure in Kingdom of Liberl, discovering a wide-reaching plot and tackling some mysteries. Cliché much?\n\nThis game does not shy away from the overused concepts, but delivers them with fresh spins, and gives them some unexpectedly serious reasoning. Talking to various NPC's, including random household members, paints the game's stage a somber shade of grey - with much emphasis on recently fought war and new orbment technologies available. (You'll be amazed at how many NPCs stress over a family member unable to get or hold a job.) As you march on, you'll learn that beneath all the apparent sweetness lies a serious, compelling narrative. Its logic includes economy, psychology and strategy and favours realism + logic to drive and resolve many conflicts. The overwhelming cuteness and apparent anime-aesthetics serve as a visual counter-point and a fun diversion for the consumer - as ever.\n\nXSEED did a wonderful job on translating and adapting the game. [url=xseedgames.tumblr.com/post/92769039590/xseed-blog-the-legend-of-heroes-trails-in-the]With the problems they faced[/url] and work ahead of them, this needs to be stressed.\n\n[i]Warning for the easily offendable:[/i] This RPG follows the tradition of amalgamating many diverse cultural and historical influences in a distinct blend of East & West. When the Gospel and an Apostle make an appearance, they singify something else from what one might expect. Also, while loved and cared for, children of Liberl do get exposed to real danger. That orphanage you helped? Burnt to the ground. The grand-daughter wanting to help her grandpa? Gets sternly warned, but ultimately joins for an incredibly dangerous infiltration mission to rescue him.\n\n***** [b]Playable characters[/b]: varied, with very flexible builds, require some system mastery. (5/5)\n\nYou get to make a party of up to 4 PCs and as the story goes on, more people join the Bright kids. The Bracer Guild they're a part of provides them with much quest fodder and some plot protection, but ultimately, they're on their own. Their companions are darn well excellent and come in very handy: if you can't fight through an area, wait until your ranks well. Of the 6 available, Schera's and Oliverier's antics made me giggle ever so often, and they are my favourites. In lieu of an old favourite of mine, imagine a game where most of in-game banter has Sands pitted against Neeshkas... You'll love it.\n\nSo what's with the builds? They are limited, but not in a bad way. The character level-ups are automated, abilities are unlocked intermittently and vary greatly (each character has a different build, but no class). You get a pick of 5 equippable items + some slots to fill wil crystals which are more than wondrous items, because they synergize. You may play around for a bit and just pick anything to wear/slot, because there's always a reload/retry or flight from a battle... I've actually made it halfway through the game before I read up on those orbal crystals and made my first optimized builds. \n\nAll in all, the character building is very beginner-friendly, which helps a lot. And there's ample room for experiment, which is great. Strategic value of turn-based combat is best described elsewhere, but let's just say it doesn't disappoint.\n\n[i]Warning for the lazy:[/i] The characters need to be fine-tuned, eventually. Final chapter presents a tournament which requires a higher level of orbal system mastery, while the final battle sequence ranges from enjoyable (if you got the combinations right) to downright enfuriating (if you didn't).\n\n[i]Warning for time-constrained:[/i] Beware the walls of text. Seriously. It's a living book.  It eats players.\n\n[i]Warning for the romantically inclined:[/i] There is much in-game talk about the nature of Joshua and Estelle's growing relationship, yet not one NPC seems to mind the fact that they're officially siblings (Estelle is Cassisus' daughter, and Joshua's his ward/stepson). Which is fine by me, because the two couldn't be more opposed than they are, and their confusion about life & love is delivered tactfully and with much wit. \n\n*** [b] The gameplay [/b]: a rocky ride to get through the story. (3/5)\n\nWhat I didn't miss here was a feeling of game being rushed and some content dropped because of time constraints - something my favourite Western RPGs chronically suffer from. The main narrative is one of adventure, with walls of text hinting at massive spoilers. I enjoyed it immensely, and can't wait for the sequel!\n\nWith that said, there are some glaring issues with gamplay and story presentation. The one thing I did have a problem with were wildly varying secret quests one can discover along the way (you'll need to consult a [url=www.gamefaqs.com/psp/933329-the-legend-of-heroes-trails-in-the-sky/faqs/62079?single=1]guide[/url] to get them). In-game Junior Bracer Journal served me well as an agenda, so that's a plus. \n\n[i]Warning in general:[/i] achievements such as best rank/weapon take a lot of time and effort, so be warned and grab a guide BEFORE starting the game properly. As TvTropes put it, my playthrough suffered a heavy case of Guide Dang It!\n\n[i]Warning for time-constrained:[/i]  I didn't mind all the grinding, but you can't escape it. Especially if you want the best gear the game's got or insist on micro-managing stuff. The difference between starting the Chapter 1 as L14 (my first try) and L18 (the second playthrough I finished) taught me to grind as I save: at every opportunity, as much as I can. And also, the railroading, apparently a traditional facet of the JRPG genre. Finally, hasty decisions versus small time windows. You can miss so much with only a click. I re-did the Prologue because I was merely getting to know the ropes and I missed two books I wanted to collect. The re-run was worth it.\n\n*\n\n[b]TL;DR[/b]: Very good game, with some issues for the uninitiated. Merits a sequel (localization's in the works!) and a second playthrough (especially for achievements).\n\n*\n\nThank you for reading this review. It was my first, and I hope it served you well. =)",
      "You will enjoy the game at the beginning, it's fun and entertaining...Until you start playing the harder and larger hospitals and you get plagued with bad pathing issues, bad AI, people getting stuck in rooms, people dieing but they idle in a death state and stay around forever and all kinds of glitches which kills the enjoyment and ruins the management aspects. I've had to stop playing this game until they patch it because right now you're just managing bugs and glitches and you will have to design hospitals to get around these bugs, so that means extra wide corridors and spacing items out so people don't get stuck. Which sucks.\n\nNeeded much more playtesting before being released.\n\n*This is from v1.01.*",
      "This game will leave you satisfied.\n\nI know that doesn't sound like much of a selling point, but it is. This game won't give you a sequal hook, it won't give you a product carved away like a thanksgiving turkey, each part sold seperately or held to ransom. \n\nThis is not a game about standing victorious over your enemies, it's not a game with some kind of adrenal rush that will leave you drained and empty afterwards.\n\nThis isn't a game about saving the world, as surprising as that may sound considering the hero's goal.\n\nThis is a game about hope. Hope for tomorrow, hope for your fellow man, hope for dreams and wishes, hope for a last shimmer of light in the encroaching darkness.\n\nThis is a game that will make you ask things about yourself, even if only subconciously. \n\nBut, most importantly of all, this is an experience that will make you say \"I was happy to be there, if only for a time.\"\n\nAnd I was, in fact, happy to be here.\n\nHats off to you ladies and gentlemen, you made a cyinical old bastard smile for a good ten hours.",
      "This game is extremely addictive for one simple reason: it's a sandbox survival game with zero grind, because everything can be automated.\n\nIn a normal survival game, to craft 100 items, you need to first harvest 100 of some resource. In this game, you set up a power plant, a coal mine to fuel the it, an iron mine, a few assembly plants, a few conveyor belts and a chest and then wait for it to fill up with 100 grenades while you go work on another part of the factory. Meanwhile, the increasing pollution makes the bugs native to the planet increasingly agitated.\n\nAutomation is extended into every single part of the gameplay - you can mass produce buildings, then use robots to place them according to blueprints, transport items with automatic trains, and create complex control networks to let production adapt to demand. There is always something to do with very little repetition - a sudden bug attack, a bottleneck in your iron production, a depleted ore patch that forces you to explore for a new one. People spend absurd amounts of time on this game because it doesn't waste any of it.",
      "Tentative review of game in progress, but so far it is amazing and I had to leave a review in support of it.  As far as the game itself goes, I'm giving it a 9/10.  As far as the port goes, the lack of keyboard input prompts seems frustrating when they already have the ability to change between xbox and ps4 buttons, but I use a controller and expect most will for this, but it's worth mentioning in the sake of fairness and accuracy.  There is a certain graphics setting called \"effects\" with high and low.  High is causing major fps drops under certain conditions even on a pc with an rtx 3080 and a 5800x cpu.  Devs have acknowledged it and are working on improving it.  Other than these issues though, no problems at all.  Online play has been smooth and i haven't experienced any disconnects.  The game itself has only crashed once in 93 hours, but that was also during excessive alt tabbing while the game was in true fullscreen mode, and it crashed on an alt-tab itself, so I'm not really blaming the game on that one given it was the only time.  Again, overall the game is playing great and I have no problems with it on a functional level as well as an entertainment level, I just want to be as fair and accurate as I can, and these were really the only problems I could find with it.",
      "It's about time i wrote a proper review for one of my favourite games ever.\n\nRivals of Aether is a platform fighter that tries to follow Super Smash Bros. Melee and P+'s footsteps by making a competitive focused game, but also while trying to keep it more accessible than the former. The game also has a very active workshop that allows players to create their own characters and play ones made by other creators, alongside custom made stages and buddies.\n\nI will focus on the purist aspect of the game first.\n\nAs for many \"smash clones\", the game will feel very familiar to people who already played a smash game, with the controls being nearly identical but with some key differences:\n\n1. THERE'S NO SHIELD. Rivals of Aether is probably the first game in its genre to forgo the iconic \"bubble\" shield, choosing it to replace it with a parry instead. Parries are riskier, staying out for a few frames, and will reward you immensely by either stunning the opponent or reflecting their projectiles. Since parrying is so risky, the game's neutral and defense (but also its offense) will be focused on movement, especially thanks to wavedashing, wavelanding alongside some more niche or character specific movement techs. \n\n2. THE STAGES HAVE NO LEDGES. This means your way to safety when you get knocked off the stage will be actually landing onto the main platform, rather than aiming for the ledges. Rightfully so, the game offers much more options when offstage compared to smash games, with every character having access to wall jumping, an airdodge that doesn't send in freefall and the ability to walljump and cancel special falls, allowing you to use your up special two times. This means the offstage game is a lot deeper than in other game, as there will always be a way back onto the stage since almost every character is allowed a lot of freedom while in disadvantage.\n\n3. THERE'S NO GRABS. There's not much to add here; the absence of a shield makes grabs unnecessary, and thus they're not present in the game. Some characters have command grabs, though.\n\nThere's a total of 14 characters in Rivals of Aether (free from the beginning), with 4 more to come in future patches. Although the cast might seem very slim for people who are used to smash games, it's incredibly diverse. Enough to probably warrant you to try every character. Each character has a lot of depth and can shape the stage in some way. Some fighters take inspiration from smash characters, such as Clairen having a tipper mechanic like Marth, or Absa having Ness and Mewtwo's movement turned up to 200 and Zelda's lightning kicks; this means you'll probably find a character you're familiar with in case you're not confident to play with a brand new character yet. It's also worth mentioning that the game is very balanced, with tiers being very subjective. Regardless, RoA's current top player plays the character that is considered the worst in the game by most, so that should prove that the balance state is very good.\n\nNetplay is not perfect, but it's very good and playable. As i'm writing this review, there's currently a beta build that includes rollback netcode, which presents a couple of bugs and desyncs but does its job quite well. Default build uses delay netcode, which also works just fine in case you're dissatisfied with the rollback beta. Rollback is expected to become the default build once the dev team fixes all its kinks.\n\nEvery stage has both an \"aether\" (casual, with hazards) mode and a \"basic\" (competitive, no hazards) mode. Every single stage in \"basic\" mode is tournament legal (with the exception of tempest peak in some regions), adding a lot of stage variety. Aether stages are aimed for a casual audience, with some spicy traps and whacky platform arrangements for a more casual and laidback experience.\n\nOn that topic, there's no items in this game, so the chaotic free-for-all  factor goes down by a notch, to the discomfort of players who like the party game side of platform fighters.\n\nThe community may be small, but it's very active and constantly organizes weekly and monthly tournaments, with the active (financial and whatnot) support of the game devs themselves, so you will quickly find a community in which to play. Sadly, though, having a small community means you'll be bound to experience some \"dead lobbies\" from time to time.\n\nSolo play, i'll have to be honest, is incredibly lackluster. This game was mainly thought to be played with other players and as a result, single player content is very scarce. There's an arcade-styled story mode which only features a handful of characters (the original 4+2 more), that will have you fight some random fighters until you reach your character's \"rival\" at the end of the story. The cutscenes go from average to bad, depending on the character's story. Each story is very simple and resolves itself in the course of 5 encounters, with a super boss+ a final cutscene once you complete every character's story mode\n\nThere's also \"endless abyss\" mode. It's similar to smash's multi-man mode, where you'll fight a never ending horde of weak cpus, with some minigames slapped inbetween, like a platforming section or explosive enemies. You will have to fight a weaker version of the story mode's boss after a set number of waves each time. The most interesting part of this gamemode is probably the rune system. The rune system will allow to buy runes with the in-game currency that will make your character stronger, be it by making them faster/more powerful or improving their moves. These runes can also be used in abyss versus, which is basically pvp but with runes.\nSadly, endless abyss can become repetitive very quickly, with its never changing waves and gimmicks and grind you have to go through to be able to buy (and use) your runes.\n\nThere's one more mode called Tetherball. It's actually a PvP mode, but i'm putting it in the solo play paragraph because it's a very casual mode. Simply put, the goal of this mode is to hit a beach ball that is attached to a pole by a string and make it spin around it. You score one point when the ball-on-a-string completely wraps the pole. You will have to fight your opponent to keep the control of the ball, as they can hit it as well and make the ball \"theirs\". It's a very fun but often shunned aside mode so i felt like putting it in this review. Please, play Tetherball with me. \n\n\nAs for workshop...\n\nIf you're not big on the competitive scene of platform fighters, this is probably why you came to this store page and. as you may have gathered, casual play is not very fleshed out, with only aether mode and some solo modes as your only options. That's where workshop shines! You'll be able to download hundreds of play made characters, some with the intent of being serious, competitive fighters, while others (most) are aimed to a more casual audience. Characters can go from original characters to the reckless wii mote guy, so you'll have plenty of fun by browsing the worshop page and finding the perfect character, be it an original character or a direct transposition of greninja from Smash Ultimate. Needless to say, you'll also have a huge choice of stages and music packs, alongside some hidden gems like new gamemodes that often pass under the radar. I bet you didn't know you could play Uno in Rivals of Aether!\n\n\n\nTo wrap things up, i'd like to comment on the great pixel art graphics which does its job very well and will appeal to retro gamers specifically, and give my shoutouts on the incredible OST made by flashygoodness. Every track fits the stage perfectly and gives the right atmosphere to this fast paced fighting game.\n\nIn other words this game is a very good purchase for both casual players, thanks to the workshop, and competitive players because of its deep yet accessible design. I hope this review made whoever is reading it consider buying Rivals of Aether and join the community.",
      "I backed this game back at the end of September 2013 and have finally played it through to completion. \n\nCandle is a beautifully unique game which takes elements from puzzle, platforming and point and click adventures. The puzzles, although sometimes frustratingly difficult, are all different and use different mechanics keeping the game engaging and fresh. Teku's Candle is such a interesting game mechanic that I really enjoyed getting to know and learn. As previously said, the game looks and sounds absolutely stunning. I don't think I have seen a game that looks this good before and that is attritubuted to every character and scene being hand drawn. Controls can be a bit finicky but not game breaking and you can easily adjust too. I would recommend getting this game because it provides a great whole experience.",
      "Techland sold out to Tencent. Let this be a reminder to gamers that no matter how beloved your favorite game studio is, sooner or later they'll have a downfall. \n\nI've been a fan of Dying Light since the first game released in 2015. So it pains me to see one of my favorite series' fall like that with the introduction of microtransactions and garbage live service elements. \n\nThe story in DL2 is somehow worse than the original. While DL1's story was pretty generic, at least it wasn't crap. DL2's story is more generic and all of its characters are absolutely obnoxious (except for Hakon). I don't know why western devs and movie makers think writing obnoxious characters is good. Don't get me wrong, you can write an entertaining character who's obnoxious, but in DL2 they characters are just obnoxious, not entertaining. \n\nThe combat gameplay in DL2 feels off. When you swing your melee weapons sometimes they don't connect with zombies right in front of you when they should. And the gore seems broken. Even with the Gut Feeling update. The gore might look good but it doesn't feel like its actually tied to the combat. For example, you could drop kick a human enemy and somehow all of their hands and legs would rip off after hitting a wall which makes no sense. Somehow DL1's gore is more realistic. With DL2 being a Chinese game now I think the gore might get downgraded later on. \n\nI might be a minority on this one but I never really had any complaints about the parkour. I thought it was a definite improvement over the first game and with the Good Night, Good Luck update they improved it even further. I also don't mind the lack of guns in the game. DL was always focused on melee combat and the lack of guns makes the game more challenging whereas in DL1 nighttime became a joke as soon as you got a powerful shotgun where you could also buy ammo for very cheap instead of it being scarce like in Resident Evil. But being OP and shooting volatiles was still fun in its own way NGL. \n\nSpeaking of night, it's laughable how initially Techland completely nerfed the night time experience just to appeal to casuals. Instead of making the night scarier and more complex in DL2 for the millions of fans of DL1 they thought it was a good idea to appeal to people who dropped the game because they were scared of playing a HORROR game. I'm sure the devs had fun wasting their time reworking a core mechanic of the game months after the game was already out when they could've avoided this altogether if they didn't have the bright idea to remove roaming volatiles. But at least they added them back in and made it similar to how it worked in DL1 though it's not perfect yet. It's BS that volatiles NEED to be hit a certain amount of time before they die now. It feels like artificial difficulty. \n\nTo Techland's credit, they did add a community map creation feature which I think more devs should do for their games. Even if DLC2 sucks and Elyseum is never included in the game, fans can now make their own maps and modes and have fun. I hope they keep expanding on this feature. It's also nice that Techland actually listens to feedback and include requested features as soon as they can. They promised at least 5 years of support and before the buyout it really did seem possible. \n\nI really wanted to love Dying Light 2. And I still do to some extent. But the game fails to live up to the first game even over a year after its release. And after the buyout, I don't think this game will ever do. My hype for DLC2 is almost zero. But that's only because I know almost nothing about the DLC except leaks and rumors as Techland didn't announce anything. I really hope this won't affect the updates Techland makes to change the game for the better but at this point I'm not sure anymore.",
      "Ahh, CrossCode.\nLet's start this review with what this game does right.\n\nPros:\nEverything. There review is complete. But on a serious note I'll elaborate.\n\nThis game starts out very generically. You got an amnesia stricken heroine. You got fairly archetypal characters. The story is the typical trying to figure out your past. But it's not. I lied about all that, that only covers the first 10-15 hours then you see drastic changes in the pace and tone. The story turns out to be well done, not the best, but enjoyable. 8/10 for story and characters.\n\nLet's talk about gameplay. It's perfect, seriously. The pacing of combat is fairly quick. There's a decent variety of enemy types which nearly all of them have some sort of unique trait. Your skill set leaves you with a lot of variety and different tools to take on different situations. I have yet to get bored of it, despite the fact combat isn't inherently profitable for most of the game. Puzzles. You have timing puzzles, logic puzzles, memory puzzles, enemy based puzzles. It's all there. It's all enjoyable. They're quite varied, no two puzzles feel the same. This game has over 200 'maps'. And just about every 'map' has a puzzle or two (optional or not). Ez 10/10.\n\nArt design. I'm a sucker for 16 and 32 bit graphics. The level designer, this guy made the game. He created some beautiful and interconnected maps with nearly everything having purpose. In all honesty, I have never seen design quality this high, it even beats out SquareSoft games (you know before they became that crappy company that is SE). 10/10 again.\n\nCharacter design. It works. Not the best. Not bad. The characters look the way they should. Lukas' nose drives me crazy, it's huge. But Holiday Man is solid. 7/10.\n\nMusic. Some of it's great. Some of it annoyed ME (but I'm picky). They stayed true to what they were trying to make. But it's obvious their composer was no Yasunori Mitsuda. But still, what I enjoyed, I really enjoyed. 8/10.\n\nDid I enjoy it? Every single minute of it. Even when I was confused. \"I WILL figure this puzzle out.\" 35/40, based off my personal taste, but CrossCode is as damn near perfect as you can get.",

      "I reviewed the original Mark of the Ninja more than 4 years ago. I liked its stealth-based gameplay approach and praised the learning curve experienced throughout the story.

I do not have a 4K display so this higher resolution I cannot enjoy. Compressed in-game art or not the original already looked very good. But the creators confirmed this will give us an enhanced experience even under 1080p resolution. \n\nWell, I did complete the game once again as this is how much I love MoN. I recommend that you do the same.\n\nPS: It may be possible that you are required to have the special edition of the original version to get the remastered version.",
      "After the past few years of broken, buggy AAA games I've started to lose the passion I once had for the industry. This masterpiece came out of no where and completely reignited my love for gaming. PLEASE do not sleep on this game, it's such a breath of fresh air from the garbage you'd normally expect from modern day companies. Definitely taking a spot in my top 5 favorites and I haven't even scratched the surface of the game yet, it's just that good. Beautiful art style, crisp animations, a unique concept, FUN gameplay, its everything I've been wanting and more. Kudos to the devs for making this absolute banger <3",
      "A really well-crafted piece of interactive media, that sets a very high bar for future video game \"making of\" projects. \n\nI had only vaguely heard of Karateka before, but nevertheless really enjoyed how this story was told. All the supporting documents, assets and (playable) prototypes are presented in a neat timeline, alongside the released games and remasters, with video interviews that tie it all together into a great story.\n\nIf you have an interest in video game history, solo video game development, or game publishing in the 1980s, do yourself a favor and check this out!",

      "I have played OSU!, Muse Dash and stepmania plenty and I gotta say that this does not feel like a rhythm game at all. The premise of matching the shape of the map to music sounds interesting but some of the songs I feel like are not mapped out correctly. Or in general this game relies less on music cues and more on visual cues? It felt like maps are only 50% related to the song and you have to ignore what you hear because the map randomly demands patterns that have no matching audio equivalent and everything becomes pure visual memorization.",
      "Absolutely amazing. PLEASE don't judge this game based on how it looks. You must try it yourself! I thought it would be terrible but a friend convinced me to try it, and I'm glad he did. I haven't had so much fun in a game in a long time.",
      "Guys literally only want one thing and it's this.\n\npure JRPG nostalgia",
      "First of all, i'd like to mention that i found this game by chance. But it's surprisingly better than some RPGMaker game i've tried and it's not your typical RPGMaker which is surprising since it's developed by one person.\n\n[h2]Story/character[/h2]\nOverall the story is good enough to keep myself immersed with the game. However the story and characters aren't really memorable. For lack of better comparison, it's similar with movie which entertain you but you won't remember it for long time. Although it's probably because i've played many top-rated RPGMaker game which have more budget/resource.\n\n[h2]Gameplay[/h2]\nWhile the developer emphasize this game is story-focused game, i would also describe this game as puzzle-focused RPGMaker game. Store page mention 3 hours, but it took me 9.5 hours to beat this game. Although if i never experience bug (mentioned below) and stuck at one puzzle (where i asked help on Steam discussion), i expect i would spend 7.5 hours.\n\nThe amount and variety of puzzle presented on this game is surprisingly very diverse. Some of them are the best puzzle I've experienced even though I've played fair amount of RPGMaker game. Although few others feels repetitive, difficult due to lack of hint or force you to walk around if you miss/skip something. Lack of option to run/always run is also mildly annoying for me.\n\nAnd since the puzzle of this game is rather challenging/tricky for RPGMaker game, here are few general hints from me in case you're stuck,\n[list]\n    [*]Check for hidden/invisible wall.\n    [*]Try to use items on your inventory.\n    [*]Some interactive object have no impact to solve the puzzle.\n    [*]The game show some hint, usually by highlight/flicker certain object.\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Graphic/music[/h2]\nNothing much to say here. There's few usage of stock RPGMaker asset which used accordingly. The music is nice. While the artstyle/visual is on good side, personally i feel it doesn't match very well with space/sci-fi theme. The cutscene CG also looks good.\n\n[h2]Misc.[/h2]\nThis game runs well on Linux with only minor problem. I experienced one bug which makes me unable to continue the game (not caused by Linux, since it also happen on device which use Windows OS), but the developer fixed it after some time. The game only offer single save file which is annoying to me since i experienced a bug and few puzzle are very tricky.\n\n[h2]Conclusion[/h2]\nOverall Mihirha's Legacy is nice RPGMaker despite few hiccups I've mentioned above. The developer is also responsive to my query which is also plus point. If you're RPGMaker enthusiast, you might want to try this game.",
      "I finished the game on keyboard and had some pretty good fun with it.\n\nno way in hell am i going to try and S-rank all the levels, though.\n\nEDIT: this morning I woke up and thought \"well i'll only try to S-rank level 1 and then i'll put it down\", so that's the story of how i S-ranked every level in the game.",
      "So Epic takes over, breaks the game, can't connect to the Epic Services so I can't play, takes away garage items, and then Steam blocks new reviews due to \"off topic\" review activity unless you change the settings manually. Went from a game a played daily to a game I literally can't play. Epic can go blow themselves.",
      "Before you flame this review to note that \"Clicker\" is literally right there in the name and I should have known better:\n\n1) the game tags list \"Clicker\" and \"Idler\" as the top two tags\n2) This genre as a whole tends to wrestle with how to appeal to both camps, often being better at one than the other.  \n\nAs such, this is really a neutral review.  In short, Cookie Clicker is a good active clicker game, but not much of an idler.\n\n Until your first ascension you won't gain any progress off-line, and even leaving the game running in the background, your progress will be significantly hampered both because of the need to buy upgrades and grandmas steadliy, but moreso because clicking Golden Cookies and later also wrinklers are a huge percentage of your revenue, and farms and towers will also require some regular attention. As a result it feels to me like the game doesn't really value strategy either, it really just values in-game time and clicking.\n\nI'd say if you want a very active clicker game that you can dedicate a lot of time to paying attention to, Cookie Clicker does have a lot of charm (albeit the text flashes at the top get old very quickly) and a lot of bells and whistles to keep you clicking.\n\nIf you're wanting something you can really walk away from, and still feel like you're progressing, Cookie Clicker really isn't that game.\n",
      "***NEWBIES*** At least 50%, if not more, of this game is map knowledge. So don't beat yourself up if you're  super lost and everyone is yelling at you over game chat. Just mute the salty people and report them if they TK. Trust me there are a lot of people in the game that will back you up and want to help, so don't let one bad experience make you quit the game for good.\n\nThere are a LOT of maps to learn and a lot of small details in every one. It's going to take the average person until your siege level is at LEAST 50 before you really start recognizing map layouts and details on all maps - including room orientation, call outs, soft wall, hard wall, what should be reinforced in each site, common paths of travel, etc..  And then probably until 75 until you're actually comfortable with most maps and operators. I'll give 15% to your own gun skills, 20% to team work and communication (call outs call outs call outs, people. Don't be that guy that just looks at memes after dying. Unless it's casual.), and 15% to your knowledge of the operators and ability to utilize their gadgets. \n\nMore tips:\n-There are a lot of Diamond/Plat smurfs in newcomer that like to make new accounts and s*** on actual new players because it makes them feel good for some reason, so you're better off playing quick match. \n-To learn maps faster, make your own custom games and run around in them. \n-When you die, make sure you watch the replay so you know what cheeky angle the enemy was holding and then don't do what you did next time, or use it to your advantage when you switch sides. \n-If you're not on cams, watch teammates. Look at the places they check as they sweep rooms. Watch the paths they take. Look at how they engage in gun fights and how they rotate around the map. \n-Spend the extra few dollars to buy a version with some operators - it'll make game play more fun for you and you'll have an easier time finding operators that work best with your play style. \n-Squad up with friends - being able to communicate and laugh in a discord can really improve the game experience, even if it's just one other person.\n-Best way to really understand an operator is to play them, so take advantage when there are siege events that allow you to play whoever you want. Use this information to purchase your next operator with the game currency. \n\n",

      "In terms of originality, this gets a zero.  It's a Robotron clone with pretty graphics.  There have been many of these, and my personal favourite is the original Mutant Storm which is sadly no longer available to buy.  However, the graphics are really really pretty, and the game play is really really good.  So for being the best implementation of the Robotron idea to date it gets a big thumbs up!\n\nSuggestions where it could be improved:\n[list]\n    [*]Graphics are so pretty they do sometimes make it hard to see what's going on.  Maybe have a less pretty looking mode.\n    [*]4 player co-op\n    [*]Online co-op\n    [*]Ability to save/pause arcade mode so you don't have to play through entire game in single session.\n[/list]",

Its impossible to just simply quit the game without messing with the entire interface in a while goose chase for a way to exit the application.  I finally settled on ctrl-alt-del, but the game even withstood an end task and simply kept playing.  Had to hard boot my computer.\n\nTotal garbage.",
      "Ni no kuni II: Revenant Kingdom is a great RPG that, while a little dissapointing in some aspects, makes up for it with it's positives.\n\nLet's start talking about the negatives: \n\n- the characters are a little bland, most of them barely get anything added to their backstories nor are there any specific sidequests for them (yet). They're not bad, and Evan/Roland are good characters, but the rest falls a bit short.\n\n- The soundtrack is a little forgetable, even if it does have a few good gems in there\n\nNow the \"neutral\" points:\n\n- The main gameplay is simple, with only a few attack buttons and barely any combos, so if you're looking for a deep combat you're going to be a little dissapointed.\n\n- The story is simple; i personally enjoy it and how it ends but i could see someone who's looking for some deep story to be left unsatisfied.\n\nNow for the good aspects:\n\n- The graphics are beautiful, it's basically a playable Ghibli Studio movie\n- The gameplay (both combat and army based) is fun, fast and rewarding to do, especially when you unlock more spells\n- The kingdom management is simple to do and it gives you a sense of pride and accomplishment (unlike EA) when you expand it with new building and bigger borders\n- The sidequests are for the most time fun with cool citizens to meet and recruit\n- The random dungeons are cool to explore\n\nI played 85 hours of this game and i enjoyed every second. If you're a fan of Action RPG with a touch of base management and \"tactical\" combat you're certainly enjoy this beauty of a game.",

      "Firstly, neutral reviews should be a thing. Because although the game's story is pretty solid (and some elements of it still very relavant even today), the game suffers from a multitude of issues, so no, I don't truly recommend this game because of those factors. Rockstar themselves should be fixing the broken state of the game, instead of leaving it to people to fix it.\n\nThe problem with this game is that you need to be online to be even able to play it. You NEED to be online to PLAY a SINGLEPLAYER game FROM 2009. I don't know what Rockstar was thinking when they force you to play online, but this is just not okay. There is no online functionality for the game besides maybe cloud saves - something steam cloud could've done just as fine instead of leaving it to their own messy launcher.\n\nBut that's not the only problem with this game. Being that it's an old game, it does not run well on modern systems, not anymore. It suffers from various performance issues. Thankfully, you can use DXVK to get around this problem - but as i said earlier, you shouldnt HAVE TO do this. Rockstar could have easily patched the game to fix the performance issues (that still happen with DXVK mind you - but compared to without DXVK it is MUCH better), instead they focused on patching who knows what.\n\nExcept after you use DXVK, you HAVE to edit a game file to let the game use more than 2 gb of ram. Again, SOMETHING Rockstar could've easily done by updating the game's code to meet the modern standards. Nobody has specs like the one in the minimum recommend anymore. After you do that, you HAVE to edit the amount of vram the game detects by using a command line to fix it. That's already 3 things you have to deal with JUST to be even able to play the game normally.\n\nSome people may see this as a small botherance - some people may see it as a huge inconvenience, but the apparent problem with this is that, once again, you SHOULDNT HAVE TO do all of this. Going past those issues and playing the game, you also have to ensure you limit the fps to 60, either using DXVK or the in game vsync (former being more recommendable as it doesn't hog as much as cpu power). If you decided to bother with all of those steps to make the game playable, congratulations. Now be severely annoyed like I did  because Rockstar has not, for all this time, patched the final mission with the helicopter QTE. One suggested fix for it was to limit the FPS to 60 - which did NOT help me. Other was to install a script file to fix it, which ALSO failed at first, till I tried again like 5-6 times. You as a player should not have to install this stuff and edit games just to fix the game, when the publisher themselves should be doing it. I expect a game to be supported if it's still being sold on Steam. And don't think they don't care about the games being on Steam - they clearly cared when they removed the classic gta trilogy from Steam (which were also left in even more of a broken state compared to how they first came out - but that is an entirely different point).\n\nPutting all of those factors aside, the game itself is very solid, story wise. I really loved all of the symbolism that was apparent throught the game, and concepts such as \"American Dream\" or \"Land of Oppurtunity\" being presented as something that was clearly flawed - which is precisely why people like Nico go down the path of killing people or doing drugs just to survive. You can't go from rags to riches in a \"strong eat the weak\" country - you either do whatever it is you have to do - like Nico - to survive, or you let yourself and your close ones get killed. There are other things the game criticizes as well, like that one conversation where Nico criticizes the food in the city for using \"chemicals that your body spends time getting it off your system\", or something along those lines. I don't think I need to mention that this isn't something they added as a joke, because it is very much there. The game's serious and dark tone might be considered bad by people, but it is because of this dark tone and seriousness that we can actually learn some lessons from it and open our eyes to some truths in our lives.\n\nThe gameplay itself isn't really that complicated, except when it comes to driving the vehicles in the game. They are based on a realistic driving system and although it is debatable how much of a good gaming experience it really is when they made it so realistic, since it introduces a huge learning curve and can end up frustrating the player, I actually ended up loving it for what it is, except when it came to driving motorcycles of any form. The game's simplicity in other regards is what makes it pretty good, in my eyes. Though it sometimes doesn't work the way you think it would (like when you are playing with a controller and have to use auto aim), it is nevertheless solid enough that those are only minor inconveniences and not the kind of problem where you'd want to stop playing the game.\n\nThis game definitely deserves more attention and love - but Rockstar really needs to fix this game themselves if they are still keeping it on Steam's store, because the current situation of the game is not acceptable.\n\n",

      "The Witch's House has been my most favorite RPG Maker horror game for years and now I have the remaster which I can buy to directly support the developer. Needless to say how good it is so I will only talk about what is changed and what still remains.\nThe game is still suspenseful and very atmospheric. Some people may worry that the updated graphic and engine may take that away but trust me it is still there and not going anywhere.\nSome sound effects/dialogues have been changed beside the graphic which I am not against it at all. Still very like the remaster.\nThe control is still the same which is as clunky as before when you are not used to. I think the developers know that and decided to not change it so I won't complain. Just say it out for you to know because the game is very old so the control is still there in the past with many other RPG maker games.\nI very like the new graphic and I think they deserve much more compliments for this. However, I like the weird-big-eye Viola model and her less hair skinny portrait more. It look weird and funny at the same time. The new model makes her more beautiful but the portrait makes her kinda fat (at least to me).\nThe new hard mode is.... hard that all I can say without spoiler.\nI don't know whether or not I should calll this a remake but at least it is done better than DSR. And Small indie developers should be supported more. May be \"Ib\" will be remastered some days too if this game is success\nThump Up!",
      "Edit 2 (9/24/22): The devs have made several updates now to address some of the UI problems. And right now, the in battle experience is greatly improved, especially when not using a mouse. It's good enough that I'm having fun playing it now, and am looking forward to seeing more of it so I'm reversing the thumb on this review. However, the experience remains decidedly clunky, especially with a mouse and especially out of combat. Overall, to anyone who is expecting a modern game with modern usability and controls, this game is not for you. But if you don't mind those things so much, this game has some real meat on its bones. It also has delightful music and sound. I'm leaving the original review here, as I hope the devs will continue to improve on the usability of the game so that everyone can enjoy it fully. If you're playing on keyboard and mouse, I'd recommend using the option that disables the mouse, the jank doesn't feel as bad when you're not clicking\n\nEdit: The devs have taken this feedback very seriously, I'm keeping a close eye on this game to see when things change so I can give this game another go.\n\nAgh... I really want to like this game. The customization and squad building seems like it will get really cool in the later parts of the game. But I don't think I'm going to make it to the later parts of the game. Why? Because the UI and controls are so frustrating. Camera movement is frustrating, selecting units is frustrating, distinguishing between your units is difficult, managing your squads is frustrating, promoting your characters is confusing, even attacking is a pain in the butt. Every time I go to do anything there's always some interface or controls issue in my way. And every time I finish a map and have to go do the in-between battles management, I know the UI will fight me every step of the way. \n\nMy thoughts on what should change:\n\nOut of battle:\n- On the \"Organize Army\" screen, I shouldn't need to click \"Squad Operations\" first to look at a squad. Simply clicking a squad should do that.\n- When returning to \"Organize Army\" from a squads view, \"Squad Operations\" is deselected, and has to be clicked again.\n- It is not possible to scroll the squad list without clicking \"Squad Operations\"\n- When I am in one mode on the squad screen (say \"Move Unit\") I can't switch to another mode by clicking the appropriate button, I have to cancel first.\n- When changing classes, there is not a clear enough indicator on the version of the unit I need to click that shows it has an upgrade available.\n- When changing classes, an extra click is required for no reason (and with no UI indication) before the upgrade options are viewable.\n- When changing classes, it should be easier to see what the next tier options will be for that class.\n- There should be a way to quickly view and either upgrade or sleep for a year all units who have class mastery between battles, so I don't have to check every squad.\n- From the Organize Army screen, there is no way to see a squad's capacity, so you have to click into every squad to see if you can add another unit.\n- When equipping an artifact, the first empty slot should be selected automatically.\n- When equipping an artifact, if I click the item first and then the slot, that should work. Drag and drop would be nice too.\n- On unit details screens (such as Unit Status or Change Class) there should be derived stats, that let me see how much damage the unit does / resists. As is, it's hard to tell what my stats are doing for me.\n- Unit traits should show a tooltip saying what they do when you hover or click the name or icon, I shouldn't need to go to another page for that.\n- Affinities should show a tooltip saying what they do when you hover or click them, I shouldn't have to go all the way to the game manual for that.\n- When using an item, I should be able to see my list of items before selecting which unit I want to use it on.\n- When using an item, an extra click is needed before you can select the item, for no reason.\n- There should be a better visual indicator on the squad screen of who the squad leader is.[strike]Right now Jules looks identical to the archers on either side of him.[/strike]\n- In the marketplace, if I've clicked on \"Recruit\", and want to switch to buying items, I should be able to click direclty on \"Trader\" and vice-versa, without needing to cancel first.\n- When recruiting units, there should be a way to lock a units stats in place so I can look at their traits without accidentally mousing over another units name and switching it.\n- There should be a way to see what the deploy limit for the upcoming battle is, so I can organize my squads appropriately, without needing to go back to the battle prep screen after seeing it.\n- The mouse scroll wheel doesn't work on the game manual / tutorial pages\n\nIn Battle:\n- There should be a way to move the camera with the keyboard without moving the targeting cursor (this is necessary if I want to move the camera while still having my hand on the mouse)\n- It should be possible to move the camera with the mouse by left-click dragging, instead of having to bring the mouse near the edge of the screen (this is especially vital in windowed mode)\n- There should be a toggle to turn off the need to select \"Move\" for moving units on capture points\n- There should be a toggle to allow the turn to end automatically when all squads have taken their turn.\n[strike]There should be a hotkey to end the turn.[/strike] (There isn't, but double-tapping space is close to good enough)\n- There should be a hotkey to display the mission info, and the mission info should appear automatically at the start of a map.\n[strike]There should be a hotkey to move to the next unit whose turn is still available, so I don't always have to scan the screen visually for this.[/strike]\n- There should be a way to see a units health (% of units alive, maybe?) and morale at a glance from the battle map. It takes so much time to dig out morale information for each unit by clicking all the way into their unit details.\n[strike]When you hover a unit, their morale needs to appear in the little mini-squad-view that pops up.[/strike]\n- There should be a way to see a tooltip explaining what a piece of terrain does.\n[strike]There should be a way to make an enemy unit's attack range stay visible on the screen so I can plan around it. Ideally, I'd be able to have multiple units selected for this at once, and be able to highlight them in different colors.[/strike]\n- There should be a way to quickly distinguish between squads led by the same unit type at a glance, especially when both squads are led by main characters. [strike]Right now Jules' squad and Narima's squad are identical visually.[/strike]\n- During combat, there should be a clear indicator of which unit is the squad leader.\n- After selecting an attack type, and a squad to target, on the screen that shows the two squads, there should be buttons I can use to change my attack type (such as switching to \"Force Surrender\" after seeing the enemy's morale is low).\n[strike]If I back out of an attack, I should be able to change attack type, or which action I do without the unit undoing their entire turn and deselecting themselves[/strike]\n- On the list of attack types, \"Force Surrender\" should have an indicator of what the surrender chance is, so I don't have to keep checking it.\n- It should be easier to tell at a glance if a unit has ranged attacks. Especially, some of the icons for cavalry ranged units are hard to identify.\n[strike]When moving units, it would be nice to have a visual indicator for units I can do a charge or ambush attack against[/strike]\n\nGeneral:\n- There need to be better resolution settings. Almost every piece of text in the game is difficult to read on a high resolution monitor.\n- The game needs rebindable controls, it's an accessibility issue.\n\nIf the game sees improvement in this area, I hope to be able to give it another chance and change my review.",
      "WHERE ARE MY OG DS FANS OF THIS GAME? REJOICE BRUDDAS!\n\nNo but seriously, I loved this game to DEATH when it first came out on the DS and to now see an HD version of this game on steam. It's quite a whiplash but a good one! To anyone who loves mystery/ detective games, YOU NEED TO GET THIS!!! Good story, soundtrack and gameplay <3 AHHHHHH!!!",
      "Go ahead and try to find something to criticize about this game. \n\nMaybe graphics scalability? Can you even be offended at that? The game does use polygonal graphics and what appears to be vertex lighting, but I think most integrated graphics chips can handle this amount of detail. Don't quote me on that one. Most systems out there can run this game no problem... If they are Windows systems.\n\nMaybe the friend requirement? Flipping through the manual yourself still provides an interesting experience. The entire game can be beaten with one person or with the participation of 20 or more people. How many games are like that?\n\nLack of voice chat feature? The game has full Steam support, making this a non-issue.\n\nLack of netcode? The design of the game makes this irrelevant. You don't even need an internet connection, but to initially download the game.\n\nFrustration? You can pick up or close the game at any time. Learning to play it without griping at others or being discouraged is probably good for your social health. It's far less frustrating or \"cheap\" than many modern games, too: bounding boxes in Dark Souls 2, spawns in flanking in Call of Duty, unreasonable level design in Hotline Miami 2. Bombs are self-contained puzzles and you lose only seconds if you make a mistake, not hours of effort. In fact, the more level-headed you are, the better you will be at the game.\n\nBrevity? This one I could see, but the main collection of bombs is only to introduce the mechanics and give some gimmicky setups in the first place. Once you complete it, you can free play whenever you want, as the design calls for well over 11^11 (that's about 2.9 * 10^11) variations. It's unlikely you will ever play the same bomb twice if your objective is variation.\n\nCost? It's $15 right now; if you go in with friends it's a drop in the bucket. I don't feel too bad about the development:cost differential, but I suppose that's up to personal preference.\n\nKeep Talking and Nobody explodes is an accessible, inexpensive, tightly designed game. Even if you've never played a party game or don't care for them, this one is a glimmering example. After hours of consideration, the only problem I can think of is that it seems to be Windows-only at the moment. Do you have Windows and some fraction of $15? Do you like fun games that reward skill, intelligence, and cooperation? If you said yes, it's time to buy.",
      "Don't play this game. \n\nWhen you realise you almost completed it and the 112% is approaching, you start to think \"What the fuck am I going to play after this?\".\n\nThe lore is incredible.\nThe gameplay is so hard sometimes, but extremely satisfying. \nThe bosses are super hard, yet super fun.\nThe OST is insane.\n\nIf you never played Hollow Knight and you are about to begin your journey in Hallownest, bapanada to you.\nYou're very lucky and I am very jealous.",
      "I was lured in by all the positive reviews and the beautiful art style. Once I started playing, I really tried to love this game. I really tried. I got thirteen levels in before I couldn't escape that I hate this game more than any game I can ever remember hating.\n\nThere are a lot of reasons why. Many are nitpicks, but there is one overwhelming one: This Game Is Almost Never Fun. I started out enthusiastic, but it wasn't long before all the enjoyment drained out. I went from looking forward to the next level, to only wanting to complete the current one just so it would be over and done with. I could not help contrast Tri with games like Portal or QUBE where, most of the time, the challenge is in figuring out the puzzle. Once you know how it's done, you can do it. In Tri, this is not the case. Realizing the solution just means understanding how much tiring, precarious, exacting, chore-like work you have to do before you can DO the thing you figured out how to do. This is a game where there is no such thing as a simple solution. If solving a puzzle can be made more difficult, it has been. Not in a mentally challenging way, but in a way that feels like having to walk for miles over uneven rocks. (Especially once they introduced having to direct light beams by reflecting them off triangles. This requires innumerable microscopic adjustments each time.)\n\nAnd even that would be fully forgiveable, if the game's difficulty was FAIR. For me, half my frustration came from the increasingly difficult puzzles, the other half came from inconsistent mechanics. Sometimes when I had to run up walls, a triangle that showed I could walk on it would suddenly let go of me and I'd plummet. Sometimes I got trapped in places I should have been able to jump out of. Sometimes lasers would bleed right through triangles I put up to block them (In one case, I had to layer down twenty-four of them). But the worst was the jump. At first I thought it was a nifty idea that if you were jumping towards a high ledge, you could keep pressing space to haul yourself up and over. I grew to hate this mechanic because of how often it failed. Jumping up a simple step could take five or six tries; impotently bobbing up and down going \"HUHHP! HUHHP! HUHHP!\" each time. There were also plenty of times when it seemed like random chance whether a given platform could be jumped to or not. Plus there was the tendency of jumps to send you up and over a thin ledge you were trying to reach, instead of onto. I quicksaved OFTEN.\n\nTri feels like it lives up to its name: they tried. They really did. They had ideas with a lot of potential and the level design is frequently gorgeous. But too often these ideas were implemented poorly, or were not conveyed at a reasonable difficulty level. I quit. I don't want to, and I am massively disappointed to, but I'm giving up and uninstalling this game. I know I'll never see the end cutscene, but honestly, not playing anymore feels like more of a reward to me.",
      "I reviewed the original Mark of the Ninja more than 4 years ago. I liked its stealth-based gameplay approach and praised the learning curve experienced throughout the story. I bought the [i]Special Edition[/i] which practically meant an add-on with some more levels, a custom and the option to replay the entire game in commentary mode. \n\nYou know some games get re-released due to the availability of a new console generation. This [i]Remastered[/i] edition is what was made available for PS4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch users not long ago. We, PC gamers (who already own the original Mark of the Ninja), can get this version free-of-charge in our library.\n\nThere's not much to say, really. I do not have a 4K display so this higher resolution I cannot enjoy. Compressed in-game art or not the original already looked very good. But the creators confirmed this will give us an enhanced experience even under 1080p resolution. \n\nWell, I did complete the game once again as this is how much I love MoN. I recommend that you do the same.\n\nPS: It may be possible that you are required to have the special edition of the original version to get the remastered version.",

      "Started strong, ended annoyingly.\n\nMoral of the story? People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.\n\nIt paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that \"routine\" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.\n\nI liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters. But it all fell apart and tries to teach a very vapid moral that someone in their early 20's who has never had a meaningful relationship would idealize.\n\nAt least it was short.\n",
      "I would give this a mixed rating if I could. \nThe story is told in such a boring way that it's hard to stay invested.

There is very little gameplay in the overland content and everything plays like a bad visual novel.\n\nAAR, the first MSQ is just one fetch quest after the other with little story in it. Oh there is some story there, but it's not great. The characters are shallow with few expectations, both the supporting cast and villains. \n\nHeavensward, the expansion I got through before my time ran out, is better than ARR but not that enjoyable. There were parts I like (not to give spoilers, it was the part where you go on a “journey”) Sadly, that part of the expansion was far too short.

It was a thousand years ago.[/spoiler]\nPro:\n-If you like story, and only story, you will like this game.\n-A lot of content\n-Trial fights. (Good boss fights without the boring part of dungeons)\n\nCons:\n-Little in the way of gameplay outside of dungeons and trials \n-ARR is a slog and not worth reading. Skip as fast as you can and just watch a recap video.\n-dungeons are locked behind the story and not unlocked as you level up.\n-The story is on the lower end of other final fantasy games.\n-Lalafells are in the game.

      "Melatonin is a simple rhythm game, with a focus on ease of gameplay and calmer sounds.\nIf you're expecting something on the tougher or more upbeat side, this ain't it.  Ironically, I had more fun as I stopped focusing on scoring well, and more fun when I was just feeling the music and half-asleep.  The sounds and songs are quite relaxing lol.\n\nOn the shorter side of games, it still delivers an enjoyable experience in what it offers. The timing is a *little* on the forgiving side, and there are even accessibility options if you need a little more help, such as timing circles, metronome, and a bigger Perfect window.  If you'd rather go for a challenge, a Perfect only option is also available.\n\nControls are quite simple, using [strike]4[/strike] 3 directional keys and an action key (Space by default). In each tutorial, you're told whether you'll need to hit directional keys or the action key, and whether they're held or not, as well as general timing.  For some stages, the instructions don't give you as good an idea as the tutorial itself/timing circles do (Work and Time levels for me).  All good, but in some levels you get tempo changes in the middle of the song that can throw you a bit off, especially if you're just grooving to the audio cues... when you can hear and distinguish them.  Unfortunately, there are a few levels where the audio cues are either far too similar to each other, or happen too quickly to react to.  This can be a bit of a bummer, as I prefer working off audio for rhythm games, as their focus should be lol.  \n\nWhile Melatonin doesn't bring a whole lot to the table, it doesn't need to.

Each stories of the main spirits are well written and realistically human. The endings are top notch too.\n\nIf you’re even considering playing it… play it… I promise you won’t regret it. I was much more emotionally invested in this game than I was on Hollow Knight. Lilly is an amazing protagonist… and she never even utters a word.

My only real complaint was a bit of exploration fatigue having to go around finding all the collectibles. \n\nI think the easiest way to sum up Ender Lilies is \"It's Momodora, but better.\" It has the same gameplay loop of \"slash slash roll behind the enemy slash slash repeat\" and fairly challenging bosses, in a much bigger and more non-linear world with nearly every single room having some sort of collectible. It's also aesthetically atmospheric and pleasing, and the soundtrack is great.\n\nI can safely say that this game is a creative masterpiece.

But if youre looking for a fantastic ravioli recipe you've come to the right place.\n\nIngredients\n- To Make the Dough\n375 grams (3 cups) plain flour\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n2 eggs\n1/4 cup (50 ml / 3½ tablespoons) olive oil\n1/2 cup (120 ml / 8 tablespoons) water\nExtra flour for dusting \n\n\n- To Make Cheese Filling\n15 ounces (425 grams) container Ricotta cheese\n5 ounces (142 g/about 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons) \"3 Cheese Italian Blend\" (Parmesan, Romano & Asiago)\nNote: grate these cheeses yourself and create your own custom blend.\n1/2 cup cheddar cheese\n2 eggs, lightly beaten\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/2 teaspoon pepper\n\n\n- Extras\nYour favorite sauce for the ravioli (i.e. marinara/ marijuana)\nParmesan cheese\nBasil\nFried vegetables\nShrimp\nFish slices\nChicken pieces \nMake the Ravioli filling.\n\n- In a small mixing bowl, add the ricotta and mash with a fork.\n- Add in the 3-cheese blend, Cheddar cheese, eggs, salt, and pepper.\n- Mix all ingredients thoroughly until you have a smooth, paste-like consistency.\n- Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. \n\nMake the Ravioli dough.\n\n- Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.\n- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.\n- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.\n- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.\n- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.\n- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).\n- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. \n\nFill the Ravioli shells.\n\n- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.\n- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.\n- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.\n- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.\n- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. \n\nForm the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.\n\n- Roll the dough into two sheets\n- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.\n- Fill with the ravioli mixture.\n- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.\n- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.\n\nCook the Ravioli.\n\n- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.\n- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.\n- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest \n- Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed plates\n\nServe it up.\nTop with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!\n- The best games Telltale has ever made, plus one that is very mediocre\n-Season One: 10/10 - A masterpiece, prepare to be hit right on the feelings and cry a lot\n-Season Two: 9/10 - Awesome, and very very sad.

And he really does! The level design is great and the areas are cool and unique and a real joy to explore! A really slick zelda-like souls-like-ish game. \nBut that's not all.\nThe gimmick of this game, and the thing that really sets it apart and makes it go above the rest, is the manual. The whole gimmick is that the game is written, mostly, in an unknown runic language, forcing the player to figure out game mechanics, progression and puzzles on their own. You have only one thing to help you: as you progress you collect pages of a manual, in the style of those old console games, which gives you again pseudo-cryptic hints, because it's also mostly in the other language.\nThe way the manual and the knowledge based progression flow into the design of the game is nothing short of genius. It's hard to gosh about just how amazing it is, because that would be spoiling it, but it's completely genius. \nGame's a masterpiece for me, a strange mesh of Hollow Knight  meets  Outer Wilds-based knowledge progression. \nDefinitely a must-buy, don't even worry about it going on a sale, it's an easy indie GOTY for me\n- [b] Target Audience: [/b] [I] Anyone with a Soul[/i]\n\n[b] Summary: [/b]  \n\nIt's a damn shame that this game isn't topping people's game of the year list this year, because Wandersong is one of the best story based experiences that I've played on Steam. A game that is beautiful woven from start to end, every element works together in harmony to make what will be a cult classic in my mind: and only a cult classic due to the fact that it should be a blockbuster, but won't get the recognition. The 3 man team took an upbeat story of a young bard on a whismical journey and \nmade someone who usually gravitates toward more depressing/out there stories and fall in love with the Bard, Miriam, and the vast cast of characters here. \n\nThe funny thing is, it's hard to quantify what makes Wandersong such a complete package, because everything works in harmony so well with everything else. Take the music for example: I actually struggled to specifically remember any individual track at first, and that's because the games tracks are so tied to the emotions that you feel during scenes. You are the music in how you play through your game, you experience this game how you want, and it's singing mechanic that alters the world aroudn you allows you to be the player you want to be while still staying in a relatively linear story line. The color and presentation is fantastic, the gameplay mechanics stay just long enough before changing up, it's hard to really think of anything that the game did wrong.\n\nLook, even those who may hate games with less “gameplay” will most likely be charmed by Wandersong's spell. It's a siren of sorts: except it'll make you crash into jagged rocks of love and happiness. Story elements feel earned. Everything has very specific detail. It's clear this was a labor of love, and it shows even in the scene select: where the splooshes by the team just make you smile. You will sit and wonder about your own life after playing certain sections, and the club scene is one of the best set pieces I've seen in character development. Honestly, I really struggle to think of negatives for the game: each thing has a purpose and is there for a specific reason, and executes it beautifully. \n\nIf you're reading this review, it's because you're considering buying the game.

[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/6861768/]Dragnix Curator [/url][/b]\n- An okay game that wastes your time.\n\n\nI played on the hardest difficulty. For me there was a pretty big difficulty spike somewhere in chapter 6 or 7. Apparently I had been skipping on the battles earlier on and was a bit too low level. No problem, I had just unlocked skill trees for the characters, so some XP spending made things manageable. I had to try the map a few times, but once I downed a few mobs and gained some levels, all was going well. The objective was to kill all the enemies by certain time, and that's what I aimed to do. Except, once I'd killed all the enemies, the objective changed and I would've needed to trudge to the other side of the map and kill the boss as well. Yeah, fuck that.\n\n\nThe combat works round-by-round in speed order. If your characters go faster than the enemies, you can simply spam AoE attacks and kill droves of them before they go. If enemies are faster, you're kind of screwed because they hit hard, you're on the defensive, have to spend turns healing and cannot attack that much. And levels seem to make a huge difference here. Combat seems sort of poorly balanced in this respect; maps are hard at the beginning, but by the end just a joke because you gained a few points of speed and are now overall faster and can spam AoE attack and kill enemies in droves.\n\nThe user interface and usability is pretty archaic. For example, to get out of a menu you have to explicitly click on the button that says \"back\" instead of just clicking a right mouse button or Esc or whatever.\n\nThe writing was quite funny at times. It also seemed of a mixed quality. A lot of times it seemed clearly aimed at 13-year olds.  (Especially cringey are the first pair of \"combat helpers\" you get.) I also did play the game for a lot longer at once than I usually do. I think there's some kind of magical simplicity about it, and it's fun to play.\n\nIt's just, in general, the one thing I dislike the most is doing again the exact same thing that I just did. That's the developers' way of saying \"fuck you\" to me, and so I don't want to play this game anymore. If you don't mind that, and the game looks like something you'd like, then I don't doubt you'll like it. Don't get it for 20 moneys though. 15, perhaps... 10 yeah, sure. Because reading the reviews, the one thing many agree on is the later you get the more garbage the combat gets. So, in essence, you only have the visual novel aspect. And if you're not 13 anymore, I don't know. Play something else perhaps.\n- very fun there is lots to do \nit runs well\nglitches are very funny\nable to download community made maps and mutators from workshop\ncan unlock different mutators as you play\nyour a goat\nyou do goat things\nyou can do non goat thing such as being a shopping cart or a microwave\nyou can also be a goat\n**Spoiler**\n[spoiler] Im a goat [/spoiler]\n\n GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!\n- Yeah sooooo I went 1k words past the max...had to pare this down...it's ok...I'm mentally stable...\n\nCrossCode is a top-notch indie in its genre. I'd mention it in the same breath as Celeste, Hades, and Outer Wilds. (guess I just did.) If you can at least enjoy both puzzles and real-time combat, this game is for you; it's not as much of a JRPG as it might look. The only real flaw I care to levy is that it isn’t incredible out of the gate; it’s merely good, and gets much better. I was going to summarize my reactions and add a \"what is the premise/gameplay loop\" section and have longer sections but I had to cut it all out so have _/5 ratings on the section titles instead. It's fine. I'm fine. Everything is fine.\n\nOk, review time.\n\nSTORY 4/5 NEATO\n\nThe story is great, and not quite what you might expect. It starts pretty light and cozy, with solid (and often meta) humor interspersed with cryptic moments. I like how casually the in-universe MMO is treated by the players. I enjoyed all the characters, including our mostly-mute but personable Lea. Once it ramps up, the story takes some exciting turns, too; the devs really know how to do drama without doing overdrama. I didn't relate too much to the story but I think it was told quite well. I like the portrayal of the antagonists for the most part, though I wish I could have felt their presence more often. The lore is also fascinating, if occasionally hard to grasp because the line between real and virtual is very thin due to the game’s particular premise. (The difference between real people and NPCs is sometimes unclear, for instance.) The ending was good, but I think the DLC epilogue wraps the game up far better.\n\nCOMBAT 5/5 WOWIE\n\nWhen you start out, combat feels almost hack-n-slashy. You can spam melee attacks and bullets for days, but you also have a charged projectile, a dodge-dash, and a shield. The elemental modes are absolutely the highlight due to the way enemies work, and the sort of limiter gauge they have forces strategy. Special moves are stylish and borderline absurd at higher levels. A huge skill tree controls them and much more; unlike some skill trees, this one requires choices, which is always a good sign. Oh and consumables are your main source of healing and buffs, and they aren't overpowered! Balancing win.\n\nThe enemies are really what make the combat fantastic. Almost every enemy has at least one gimmick and one visible weakness. The stun gauge mechanic is vital to all battles, forcing you to exploit those weaknesses to stun enemies and give you time to use your extra-long special moves. Bosses love to give you iterative micro-puzzles to fill their stun gauges, while minibosses are comfortably in-between. Bosses commonly have armor or invulnerability when not stunned, forcing even overleveled players to figure out the micro-puzzles to hit hard. (More great balancing.) Most weaknesses involve the element system, eventually encouraging you to swap elements multiple times mid-fight. The micro-puzzles will build on what you’ve been learning in a dungeon if it’s a dungeon fight. I'll mention that some normal enemies do feel like damage sponges at first, but you'll get used to this; the simple enemy design in the early game makes it seem worse than it is imo.\n\nPUZZLES 5/5 FUN COOL\n\nFor puzzles you've got your common environmental \"platforming\" puzzles, your specialized quest puzzles, your dynamic mini-puzzles in battles, and your iterative puzzling gauntlets in dungeons. Also almost everything is secretly part puzzle? Like, everything. They're an invasive species. They draw most of their complexity from the element system too. Each element has its own effects on certain objects and structures, and mainly you use charge shots to interact, though each attack has its own uses. Not much to say here; they're great puzzles. A couple may stump you for a while, but that's impossible to avoid, and I think CrossCode strikes a perfect challenge balance.\n\nQUESTS 5/5 WHEEEEEE\n\nWhile some quests conform to the typical hunting/gathering quests of MMOs, most boast some entirely unique content. Challenges range from unique bosses to puzzles to platforming to other familiar gimmicks that are secretly also puzzles. I won't spoil them. Quests generally use mechanics you have seen already in new, often very different, scenarios. NPCs are mostly there to be amusing or set up the gameplay, and that didn't bother me tbh.\n\nITEM MANAGEMENT 5/5 AAAAA\n\nItem and equipment acquisition? Engaging? WTF? Technically you get them like you do in any RPG. But, rare plants have high rare item drop rates, so if you know the platforming puzzle to reach em you don't have to waste much time. Enemies' drop rates rise with a high Combat Rank, which you get by killing many enemies in a row before the post-fight cooldown period ends and you get to heal to full and level up. This is tough until you're very comfortable with the area. Once you are, it's a whole new way of battling, using area knowledge to string together sequential fights. And what does the game do but give you a piece of upgradable equipment that grants the Combat Rating bonus to plants too?\n\nI actually cared about the equipment in the game too! *kisses Life Fiber Uniform* (yes they really make this reference) Equipment also matters more than level so the devs can control your power level better. Most times you can buy some basic equipment to explore, then return with items to trade to NPCs for stronger gear. Stronger gear has unique traits and you might prefer one over another, so it's nice that with trading you get to focus your resources on what you want. Sometimes you can trade some enemy drops for other ones, as I recall, which is a nice...uh, trade-off to get to make.\n\nQUALITY OF LIFE 5/5 HELP\n\nCONVENIENCE REIGNS in CrossCode. Text log like in visual novels? Check. Encyclopedia of story recaps, character summaries, CrossWorlds lore & terminology, etc.? Check. Enemy index? Check. Item drop rates? Check. Available trades? You beck. This is EXTREMELY helpful for an RPG, which otherwise would require a guide or plain luck to find rare item drops. Oh yeah also there's UI? I forgot about it cuz it's really good. Also the keyboard controls for swapping elements are a bit janky but I managed.\n\nAesthetics 3/5-5/5 SUBJECTIVITY WOOOOOO\n\nYeah if ya like what you see in the trailers and screenshots, that oughta be enough. I thought the art was average-good in the beginning, but like everything else the art improves as you go. They must’ve gone back and worked on old stuff, but not too much. The music is great. No complaints there. My one objective critique is, Lea has no depth perception -- the art makes similar-height platforms look identical. I ran into so many walls and stared at so many small flat gaps I thought I couldn't cross. I'm not a fool! It's the game's fault! But actually this time!\n\nA NEW HOME DLC 6/5 WTF OMG\n\nThe paid DLC is The Culmination of CrossCode. The epilogue is complex and fascinating and rewarding. The dungeon is an incredible all-elements send-off. I adore the new quests. And the art?? The environments, the enemies, the NPC portraits are all so pretty. Don't be fooled by the letters \"DLC\": this is not Discretionary Leisure Content. If you liked the base game, this is...Deluxe...eLite...C-content??? look these are not great letters to work with ok\n\nCONCDLUDSIONO\n\nWhat else to say? CrossCode good. Buy it. Do the thing. Also, look out for Project Terra, Radical Fish's next project. It translates their current style into a 3D environment with dynamic lighting. It’s pretty & it reduces that height perspective issue. There isn’t much info about it out yet, but keep your eyes out! (figuratively pls) I'm excited for what they'll come up with.\n\nHOLY **** I MADE IT AND WITH CHARACTERS TO SPARE YESSSS — ohnowai\n- Did you like the first two chapters?\nWell, here we have everything and tons of new and improved things, like the 2nd chapter did with regards to the first one (which was awesome, but quite simple gameplay-wise).\nA classical turn-based strategy game, now more polished than ever with wave-like combats and tons of units to start with, to upgrade and well, we don't even have real classes here - more correctly, each hero is a class on its own and has different abilities and such.\nThe story follows always the same one-way saga and you'll have to make lots of choices determining your fate, your battles and so on; the graphics are the most beautiful I've ever seen here and the soundtrack is quite amazing and atmospheric too.\nYou'll have also many features like arena combat, and a great history re-telling if you don't remember the first two chapters, plus a great tutorial to start with even if you're not new to the series and the genre.\nIt's quite fundamental if you're a little bit interested in this awesome story to play the other chapters - here in fact we'll start with all the old heroes, all the story right back from the caravan that reached Arberrang.\nWe're basically reviewing one of the best strategy tactical turn-based role-playing games of the last 5-10 years and I won't add more than this, it has already thousands of reviews and mine is quite useless I think. \nLots of endings, lots of characters to explore and promote, lots of weapons, accessories, modes.. we have everything. Recommended to anyone (maybe with a little discount).\n- They added \"Precision\" mode for the mouse under controls, which is pretty much raw mouse movement. YAY!\n\nAnyway, one of my favorite games of all time easily at this point. Incredible story, fun combat, and awesome world. A must play for sure, especially if you've never played it before on Play-Station (like me). It also has a New Game Plus mode that unlocks different NG+ only armor that are insane.\n\nI played at normal, and aside from the Valkyries the other bosses are a cakewalk. Maybe play on hard or hardest.\n- Pros \nReally good voice ending.\nCreepy and you are unsure of everything which makes this more interesting.\nDecent story\n\nCons\nEnding just fucks up everything.\n\n\n\"I don't want Pewdiepie making money off my game.\" Im sure you made more money off Pewdiepie for advertising this shi*ty game lol.\n- Probaly the best game ive ever told people to hold back on\n\nIts fun, its rude, it's the best Southpark Game ever made, but its only a 10 to 14 hour game. Its a satisfying 10 hours mind you, i dont think i have played a game in recent memory good enough to hold me the way this game has, the atmosphere and envoriment just puts you right in a long southpark episode, and youll love every minute of it.\n\nSadly, there are not enough minutes of it for $59.99, and thats why i sadly don't recomend this excelent game.\n\nAnd to clarify, its 10 hours if you just take your time enjoying the story, its plausible to 100% this game in under 20 hours, and thats if you are in no hurry, with no game guide.\n- Ib manages to do for me what so few horror games manage to accomplish, and that is to actually give a sense of unease and dread. Without going into spoilers, it's only a few minutes into the game that things start to tread the path of uncomfortable surrealism, with the art growing considerably more disturbing in how Ib interacts with it, and how the art interacts with her.\n\nWith all due respect to more conventional horror titles, say, Dead Space or The Evil Within, Ib maintains a feeling of dread and discomfort. Enemies can be evaded, yes, but there's a feeling of being stalked while trapped in a world you can't possibly fully understand. \n\nContrast Dead Space remake, where soon enough the horror gives way to cutting off an abomination's arm, then using telekinesis to impale it or another horror with said arm, then simply setting fire to the more mobile enemies.\n\nThis is not, I repeat, not to disrespect games in which reducing enemies to a smoldering heap of charred body parts is an acceptable tactic- there is a time and a place for the cathartic destruction of the nightmares that haunted our closets and lurked under our beds. Ib, however, leans firmly towards the horror and self-preservation of being in a hostile and unknown environment, where the only feasible option is to run, hide, and hope whatever nameless horror eventually loses track of you.\n\nAnd let's face it- some modern art galleries are creepy enough already, even in the daylight.\n\n- Been playing now for 56 hours and love it apart from one thing.... too many press conferences! Seems like every other minute I'm told I'm due to go into a press meeting... so, apart from that, I'm enjoying the game. Have to confess as a 60 year old woman, I do cheat... have much fun creating a team, buying loads of top players and winning every match... so satisfying! Anyway, can't cope with the action games and find the pace of this right up my street. Have been playing since the original Championship Manager games back in the 90s so would call myself a fairly seasoned player!\n- I had never played a Monster Hunter game before this, but World has definitely turned me into a fan. The fights are exhilarating, and I always feel like I'm making progress towards something- a new gear set, a cosmetic, an upgrade for the base, or even just filling out the monster guide. The environments are sprawling, beautiful, and full of opportunites to use the terrain against your foes. \n\nI have been playing the game entirely in co-op, with no issues after the first couple weeks. Playing story missions together is unintuitive, but only a minor inconvenience once you've figured it out. And story missions account for a very small amount of the content- this game is huge.\n- Most of the negative reviews cover my complaints already. So I won't rehash the ones I've already read. \n\nHere's my biggest complaints: \n\n- Jumpscares have never been compelling to me. Doubly so on VR. Are you trying to injure me in my computer room? Stop. \n\n- Guns are fun. Not having ammo for them is not fun. (The game is pretty generous with ammo but it also encourages tediously conservative behavior, if you just unload clips at shit you'll run out pretty fast) \n\n- \"Continuous Turning\" feels so bad. Like, how can I turn my headset and everything looks smooth as butter, but as soon as I use the look stick for turning suddenly it's all choppy and looks wrong? I'm familiar with some of the motion sickness issues people get with turning in VR games, but this isn't that... \n\n\nThough honestly it seems like they just leaned really into the whole horror thing, which is fine, but also just super not my thing. \n\nIf the mechanics and some design choices had been better I might have slogged through it anyway. \n\n\nGame's beautiful, though, so they got that going for them.\n- With approximately 55,000 reviews -- 96% of them positive -- at the time of my posting this, it is hard to know what more I can add to [i]It Take Two[/i]'s well-deserved acclaim.  As others have said, it is an excellent cooperative multiplayer game with very satisfying controls, varied levels, and superb production values in art and audio.\n\nAside from these things, what stood out to me was the game's decency.  It is *anti*-exploitative, quite deliberately excluding features like collectibles (let alone microtransactions) or character advancement that are predicated on Skinner box treatment of the player.  Rather than finding ways to [i]take[/i] more from the player (money, time, etc.), the developers have found ways to [i]give[/i] more to the player, with many small delights to be found.  In addition to not exploiting the player, the game doesn't exploit its characters -- only very occasionally playing the cheap tropes that the game's set-up would tend to invite.  The game's narrative may lack subtlety and surprise, but its straightforward positive message never feels preachy, perhaps because the scenario is so ridiculous.\n\nIt is rare to play a big-budget game (the credits go on FOREVER!) that seems to have as its goal that players will find a fun, full, satisfying experience and go away better than they came.\n- It's hard to review a game like this.\n\nAs a game in it's own right, if you've never played it before, it's a good game. Typical crazy Final Fantasy story (although it takes a bit to get into it), interesting characters, and simple but fun real-time turn-based combat. Final Fantasy games are known for their stories and characters, which are great in this member of the series.\n\nIf you've played the game before on PS1, then it's good for nostalgia. However, many people complain about it being a bad port. It has built-in cheats, in case you just want to be able to enjoy the story, characters, and side-quests. I played this years ago on PS1, and I really enjoyed my trip down memory lane with this game.\n\nIf you're an achievement hunter, this game is horrible. There are achievements that, unless you're literally following an online scripted step-by-step walkthrough, you will miss some random little thing, not know it, and then have to play the entire game over. Another achievement requires you to speed through the game in under 12 hours, which means you will grind through the game you already played, watching the same story you just watched, all over again, wasting six hours (that's how long it took me), just for the sake of one achievement... There's also another achievement to kill 10k enemies. when you can play the whole game and not even kill 1k enemies... You might think, \"oh they just want you to play the game through 10 times then\". No. It's 10k enemies in one playthrough. You run out of content, and have nothing to do, except grind battles, for literally dozens of hours. It's terrible.\n\nDespite my bitterness about the achievements, it's a really enjoyable game. Considering the FF series are mainly known for their stories, it lives up to its reputation. If you're an RPG fan, this is definitely on the list of \"must plays\".\n- I've read some of the negative reviews and name calling is petty so instead I'll just say a lot of those opinions are dumb.\n\nLook. This isn't Firewatch. This is a seven year old game that pissed off a lot of bros and continues (apparently, christ) to do so because it embraced not only being a walking simulator but a gay one at that. And yeah bro, 15 bucks seems steep for a game that you can finish in under an hour, but hell, maybe don't speed run? It's a walking simulator after all. Or maybe support indie game devs. *Or maybe* read the Steam tags that say \"short\" and \"walking simulator\" and then don't count that against the game. You don't review CS;GO and say \"not bad, but too much shooting\" right? RIGHT? \n\nLook. I've had some wine. And I've had some feelings. And Gone Home is a piece of video game history whether people want it to be or not. It's a game I wish I would have known about when it was first released. Hell I needed it five years earlier than that. \n\nIf you're pissed that Gone Home wasn't dramatic enough or that it's \"homosexual\" then maybe realize that this game wasn't made for you and that does not qualify it as bad. \n\nAnyway, that cat journal achievement was neat.\n- I'm 45, I've had good times and bad times.  I've fallen in love, grown up, gotten married, beaten alcoholism, \nhad a child, fought off depression, led my wife through her kidney failure, carried the death of loved ones, and come back from the brink.  I've weathered the storm of life like anyone else . . . I'm not special.  I'm not rich, but comfortable, and I've gathered quite a steam library as a hobby over the last 10 years.  Something I have rarely done, during my time with almost 4000 titles, is write a review.  Two, maybe three for 4000 games.  Think about that for a second.\n\nI'm 45.  I just cried playing a video game, something I can't ever remember doing.  I feel like my heart is going to burst.  It's joy, and sadness.  It's like a good memory with a parent who's long gone, bubbled up at random, making you laugh and ache at the same time.  It's bittersweet.\n\nThe music and visuals are subtle and flashy at the same time, they get under you and lift you up.  It's got spirit of the 60's, the heart of the 80's, and feels like every memorable video game trope from the 2000's, with the social softness of the 2020's.  It's huge and tiny at the same time, and thoughtfull and meditative together . . . it tells the story of leaving your comfort zone, and makes you comfortable.  It's heavy and light.  It's all of these and more.\n\nMy emotions are a flood.  I had to write a review, and let people know how I feel.  I can't describe it, I feel like I found my heart again, and I didn't even know it was lost.  Life was comfortable before 2:00pm today . . . now it's magical.  It's these small things that I forget, and remember, and then forget again . . . the birth of my son, the feeling of nervous sweetness on my first date with my wife, an unexpected comment from a random stranger about my eyes, finding an old photo of my dad that no one ever remembered taking --\n\n-- This game is like that sweet, fleeting memory.\n\nTL;DR:  45-year old man cries after finding his heart lost in a game, and writes a review while his wife asks him if he's okay.\n\n11/10, would purchase these feels again.\n- While i'm not far into it, so far it is great. All negative reviews are due to the stuttering. I have a 3070 and I googled a solution.\n\nWIth Nvidia GPUs go to Nvidia control panel and change the global shader cache size in 3d settings to unlimited. Also limit the fps of Elden Ring, I have it set to 60 fps. So far no problems on my end. Hope this helps somebody choosing to get the game.\nIf u have AMD GPUs I don't know specifics so please ask google sorry for not being able to help, but I know it is a similar process.\n\nNow 30hrs in the game is so good too\n\nNow done with the game it is amazing\n- Pros:\n\n+ Game mechanics that you would expect from a city builder\n\n+Built in modding tools\n\n+Beautiful Graphics\n\n+It's challanging (learning curve)\n\n+No lag, and I have a computer that doesn't meet the requirements\n\n+Lots of replayability\n\nCons:\n\n-takes over your life\n\n***\n\nSpecs that are below the minimum requirements:\n\n2.8ghz (3.0 is the minimum)\n\nAMD Radeon HD 8400 video card ( nVIDIA GeForce GTX 260, 512 MB  or ATI Radeon HD 5670, 512 MB is the minimum)\n\nEverything else is above the minimum required.\n- Civ 5, Heroes of Might and Magic had a baby together and that baby grew up and had a baby with Endless Space and this baby has now grown up and it is glorious in every level.\n\nIncredibly polished, incredibly neat, incredibly addictive and a game that stands out from the rest. If you like Empire-builders, this game is for you!\n\nIgnore the \"Early access\". This game is ready to be sold. I have only experienced one single bug in this game and the MP works like a clockwork. It's highly optimised, full of features and pretty to look at. I wish more Devs would make their games this way, it warms my heart!\n- [h1]Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Save scumming is a game-play mechanic and the game is balanced around the player being able to quick-save and reload whenever they want.\n[*] The game seems highly objective oriented, and I wish there was more optional treasures to collect, as I am a pirate.\n[*] While many guard situations appear to have a clear solution,  you can always just brute-force your way through or take another less contrived route, so the game doesn't devolve into a stealth puzzle game.\n[*] Post-game summary shows your route and enemy eliminations at hyper speed, and is always a fun watch at the end of a level.\n[/list]\nI really enjoy finally having a top-down style stealth game. Games such as Hard West and Divinity: Original Sin 2 also featured stealth elements but they were sorely lacking in favor of the turn based combat of the game. Furthermore, this game has pirates, making it an instant hit (for me).\n- I'm gonna be talking about the game in very broad strokes so don't worry about spoilers. \n\nI'm bananas about the Dead Space series. The experience of playing the original in 2009 or so left a massive impression on me and I think this is overall a pretty fantastic update. I've played the original [strike] trilogy [/strike] duology to death on every system, listened to stuff, looked at stuff, everything. So as someone who has Nicole's monologue burnt into the back of my eyelids, I was pretty sceptical Motive would be able to win me over with Dead Space 23. I was very pleasantly surprised, though. It's clear a lot of love and care went into refining Dead Space for the remake and in many ways I find these refinements make the setting, characters, and mysteries all a lot more compelling. \n\nOn the lead up to release there was an IGN series of short interviews with developers, artists, writers, etc working on the remake. It was really fascinating hearing about how they were approaching different aspects of the project, there's a lot of interesting insights about the aesthetic and thematic goals of the game in there that get me really craving a Dead Space 23 art book. If you're sceptical about Dead Space 23, I think they're worth a watch. It's really striking how thoughtful they've been in creating their take on Dead Space and I don't think their efforts deserve to go so easily overlooked. If you're really interested in the artistry of the series I'd also highly recommend The Art of Dead Space, it's a great book and an amazing collection of art that really lays bare the core identity of the series. It's been a great companion piece to Dead Space 23.  I think a lot of people have been comparing the choices and artistic aims of the original team and the new devs in bad faith, I really can't see anything but reverence for the source material here. I'd also say that the differences that are there are interesting and well worth exploring!\n\nI'm also glad Dead Space has room to breathe again, EA really pushed the extended universe the first time around and I'm glad to see that mistake hasn't been repeated. I'm not someone who's super into lore, I like finding extra information that re-contextualises things in cool ways but this extended universe stuff can get pretty silly. There were animated movies, books, tie-in games, a Wii rail shooter (which I enjoyed) and most of it just served to undermine the setting and the horror for me. That isn't to say the remake shies away from its roots because it absolutely doesn't, there's an entire New Game+ path that I think incorporates a direct reference to one of the extended universe novels. If you're a lorehead you'll definitely recognise familiar names in text logs, even very forgettable characters get some mentions in. I really love this about the remake, it reincorporates a lot of this disparate stuff into more of a coherent whole. \n\nI think my favourite addition is the AI director that manages encounters and atmospheric effects. Dead Space is a game that invokes hypervigilance, I think that's part of what makes the series so compelling. You're always alert, always listening and watching, always looking over your shoulder. It has an intensity that I feel is absolutely unmatched. With the AI director in the mix that feeling is sharper than ever. You can't rely on memory alone to get you through now. Yeah, you can still memorise spawns and there are still an abundance of scripted encounters but you can never safely bet you know what's coming and when. Sometimes the lights will flicker and steam will hiss from the pipes- nothing. But sometimes a pregnant and most of a divider will be waiting for you right by the shop. You can truly never assume you're safe, that feeling is no longer illusory as it was in Dead Space 2008. I think that's great. I also found that the director would spawn interesting combinations of enemy types which is cool, it went a long way to making the threat more unpredictable. \n\nI never really experienced any of the performance issues everyone else is talking about so I think my main issue with the game is very petty. I flat out do not like the redesign of the Soldier rig. They look like those guys who're really into Mandalorian themed tactical gear and Punisher stuff. So, yeah, not sure if that's an intentional update to reflect reality but, aesthetically speaking, I found it very jarring. \n\nI think this is a very solid foundation to build on to bring back the Dead Space series. I hope in the future there might be more challenge modes, higher difficulties, more unlockable suits. Most of all though I hope Motive, like their predecessors, take some pointers from the Resident Evil games. I'm a big fan of the records system in the recent Resident Evil titles. It contributes enormously to replayability and it's neat getting to examine all the models, animations, concept art, all the good stuff. As someone who likes crafts and fan projects, something like that would be indispensable. it's all work that very much deserves to be admired, too. Some of the detail on the necromorphs is ludicrous. A records system would also be a great excuse to do wild runs like beating the game without healing or opening the shop. Just give me a reason, Motive.\n\nThere are thousands of things about this remake that I could just keep gushing about. Maybe I'll update this review over time and do just that (I have). But I hope for now this review has gone some way to convincing you to try out Dead Space. \n\nTanya Clarke killed it as Nicole, too.\n- the game itself is pretty ok and fun for what it is, and runs great on deck. but man, F**K THE ALWAYS-ONLINE-DRM WHICH AT TIMES TAKES AGES TO CONNECT, GETTING THE GAME STUCK IN THE MENU WITH NOTHING TO DO!!\n\n>> Update after 20h played:\nI really enjoy playing the game. It is good, it is fun and runs great on the Steam Deck, which is especially important to me, as I tend to travel a lot as part of my job.\n\nThat being said, however, is core of the issue: The Always-On-DRM actually prevents me from playing this game on the go. Having this sort of DRM is, in my opinion, only predatory and inexcusable in any way. I get that the online-components of the game will not work when I am on the move, but I am mainly interested in the single player experience, from which I am also locked out. I am even locked out of the main menu without a stable internet collection, which is just ridiculous.\n- Okay so,\n\nFirst off, the Streaming of the game play yesterday did this title zero favours. Whoever made the decision to allow a copy of the game which was 400 builds behind to be live streamed made a mistake.\n\nThe character creation is a nice touch, makes you think and get involved with it characteristics of the nation you pick to play as. I like this and rarely see stuff like this in game.\n\nThe Steam page states 'SuperPower 3 is tailor-made for all the megalomaniacs out there who are convinced they can do a much better job at running the world than real politicians and military leaders across the globe'. That's a rather bold statement for a game that has 5 or 6 laws you can change for a whole country...., \n\nOverall the game in its current state is incredibly basic and lacks any depth in regards to the actual management and running of a country. No parliaments behind a leader etc, why? Even the excuse of the focus is around you and your characters decisions doesn't make much sense. It takes away the feeling of running a country, that which you are describing in the games description. Where are the ministers, the scandals that come with the running of a country?\n\nThe game isn't a write off, I personally feel it will be good in time but looks to be missing alot. Overall 5/10. Product refunded.\n- The playtime I have on Steam is nowhere close to the amount of time I've put into this game on Xbox.\n\nWhen I first heard of Tetris Effect back in 2018, I was so mesmerized by the visuals the game had. Everything looked amazing, and I really wanted to try and play it. Shame I didn't have a PS4.\n\nThe game had a multiplayer release on Xbox, and when I first heard about it, I bought a copy instantly, finally ready to experience the game on PC.\n\nI'm not exaggerating when I say that buying this game actually changed my life.\nWhen I bought this game I not only got to play one of my favorite games in a completely unique experience, but I managed to find an amazing community to boot. Since then, I've accomplished so much in the game, befriended lots of people, and managed to change several aspects of myself.\n\nThis game has been a perfect mixture of visual, auditory, and emotional presentation, and it's given me tons of inspiration for multiple projects.\n\nIf you're shrugging this game off as \"just Tetris\", please take a look at a playthrough. Calling this game \"just Tetris\" is a massive injustice to the creativity, effort, love, and time that the development team have put into this.\n\nI have been following this game for nearly a year now. I wouldn't have it any other way.\n- I have been a big fan of the Halo series since CE so I may be a bit biased but yea.\n\nPositives\n- Good campaign\n- Fun coop\n- Good story\n- Good mechanics\n- Graphics are good\n- Good price, honestly don't wouldn't even wait for it to go on sale\n\nCons\n- I have noticed a sound delay every now and again\n- A few graphical glitches every now and again, not really regular\n- The fact they exchanged the original Halo Reach XP and levelling system with \"seasons\" \n     - Can no longer just buy what you want, you need to play 4 million mp matches just to \n       unlock the helmet you want then repeat that for the matching chest piece in the next \n       season\n     - Can no longer get experience from the campaign (Edit: This has since been updated so \n       you can ear medals from campaign but you still can't directly earn xp) \n     - The maximum experience able to be collected is to low for the later levels. I think the max \n        should be lifted fro everyone, or slowly go up depending on what level you are\n- How long it takes to level up is just stupid. It was good for the first few levels then it feels like there is a massive jump in time.\n- A few audio glitches here and then. (For me anyway you need to be facing the sound to hear it, even if its over comms\n\nI love the game and would honestly recommend it but think a few things could be changed in my personal opinion.\n- ... and G*d said let there be Mushihimesama. An extremely accessible and satisfying bullet hell vertical shooter developed by Cave Interactive which debuted on the PS2 and has been ported to multiple systems.   The Steam version controls perfectly, plays almost perfectly and looks satisfactory given its age.\n\nThree modes; Novice (highly accessible for beginners), Normal, Arrange, Ver. 1.5 (dlc)\nThree sub modes for each mode; Original, Maniac, Ultra.\n\nMultiple scoring strategies and works with direct input and xinput controllers, \n\nFull compliment of Steam Features;\n[list]\n[*]Plenty of achievements\n[*]Cloud saving\n[*]Trading Cards \n[*]Leader-boards\n[*]Remote Play TV / Together.\n[/list]\n\nNot only is Mushihimesama a fantastic game to experience, instilling a let's do that again after every play-through, Mushihimesama bleeds Starship Trooper vibes.  A remarkable vertical shooter which all shooter fans must experience.\n- OBJECTION, YOUR HONOR!\n\nHow can it be a hate crime if my client loved doing it?\n- The Graphics of this game don't match the high price tag\n- The Steam version of this game has some serious problems, most notably the high chance of losing your entire account. The game's servers have sync issues with Steam, and thus are not reliable at saving your progress. I played for 8 hours only to lose all progress and the entire account, forcing a restart from scratch.\n\nIf you link your google account, this seems to provide a reliable way for the game to save your progress, but nothing ever tells you this. It's absolutely inexcusable that the Marvel Snap servers cannot link to a unique Steam account without needing to link a gmail.\n\nAside from these massive issues, the gameplay is quite fun. However, the UI is a straight mobile port and needs a total overhaul. It also demonstrates a lot of the annoyances of mobile games, such as constant rewards and notifications littered all over the UI pointing you to those rewards.\n\nIf you can look past some very serious issues, as stated above, the game is very enjoyable.\n- I wish there were a \"mixed\" option for recommending this game, as I think for a lot of people out there, this is a fantastic game, and it's definitely well made with a lot of love and attention to detail in many respects. I really like puzzles and problem solving, so part of my disappointment with The Witness is that I really thought I would enjoy the game. Myst was one of my favorite games growing up, and I was extremely excited to see a well-reviewed game in the Myst genre surface after far too long. \n\nThe problem for me was that The Witness is very much a game about the journey, and not the destination. It turns its head on the genre as it's less a game about solving puzzles within a set of rules, and more about discovering what those rules are. And for the most part, it does that well. Instead of the usual game conventions, rewards for solving hard puzzles weren't any kind of story unlock, more just to give you a harder puzzle. That approach was fun for awhile, but some story unlock would've been appreciated, especially because there is so much mystery and it's such an immersive world that was clearly built for a reason and has a fascinating backstory. \n\nSome of the mechanics also just seem arbitrary, or at the very least, not quite obvious enough. Sometimes perspective puzzles require you to either take a screenshot or jot down on pencil and paper the answer, then transfer it on screen. That seems like lazy game design and worst of all, takes you out of the immersive experience. It's possible I'm mostly tone deaf, as some of the sound puzzles seemed almost impossible to me, despite numerous listens. There's also just the repetitiveness of the \"pathfinding\" puzzles, which range from challenging (and satisfying) to punitive in their difficulty spikes. It's in these difficulty spikes where I think the core game mechanic of pathfinding lets you down, as it requires you to be much more of a planner than a \"hands on\" problem solver. In a game like this, I would think it would accommodate multiple approaches, but really there's a right way to approach this game, and a wrong way. Unfortunately for me, I think the way I approach puzzles (trial and error) is strongly discouraged, at times in punitive ways. \n\nThe philosophy from the audio/video portions will likely be appreciated by some, and for some come off as the worst kind of douchey-hipster nonsense. Had they been delivered in shorter pieces, I might've fallen into the former. But as rambling as some of them are, I found them more annoying than enjoyable unfortunately. \n\nI don't know, I'm really torn on this. It's a well made game, and while it seems so open and non-confined, I found the game to be far too linear in mechanics and how to approach problem solving. At times it actually made me feel like a lesser thinker because I have a different approach to puzzles than what the game designer prefers. What I'm sure is a really fun journey for some, left me disappointed with the destination. \n\nAm realizing this reads a lot like an apology for not liking this game, which I think it is. I really, really wanted to love The Witness, but in the end, not only was this game not for me, but I genuinely feel lesser for that fact because I feel like I should have loved it, and just didn't.\n- One of the most likable FPS game in recent years.\nGreat for free roaming and exploring and the combat is challenging enough to keep one on their toes.\n\nAnd, surprising, has a very good story to it.\n\nBest Far Cry to date.\n- Remember the way Monkey Island 2 ended? That weird mess that confused the hell outta everybody? Well, the first 15 minutes of this game manage to \"save\" it completely and suddenly, it all makes sense.\n\nAnd this is just one reason (out of many, many reasons I will experience as I play this game, I believe) you owe it to yourself to play RtMI. \nThank you, Ron!\n\nEDIT: 3+ hours in and I love it! The music is there, the humor is there, and it's the perfect combination of nostalgia and fresh. The puzzles so far are fun and the inclusion of a hint book as an inventory item that never gets in your way is rather clever. Oh, and I love the trivia book! Really tests your knowledge of the series! \n\nYou can clearly tell that this game is a labor of love. And the art style - love it or hate it - simply works when you see it in motion.\n\nEDIT 2: Have a drink whenever someone mentions \"The Secret of Monkey Island\". Now there's an idea for a party game that will get everyone drunk! :D\n- At a first glance I thought I would hate [b]Human Fall Flat[/b]. \n“Oh, this is another one of those wonky psychics ragdoll games that are obnoxiously hard to control,” I thought. \n...\nAfter playing it, I can now confidently say that my first impression was spot on. The only surprise was how much I enjoyed playing it. \n \n[h1][u]Positive:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]I can’t fully explain why but I found Human Fall Flat charming. The “human” is adorably simplistic and can complete daunting tasks despite only being able to jump and grab onto things. It reminds me of a very energetic toddler, especially when you raise your arms and jump - [b]it’s so cute[/b]. Something about an awkward “human” taking on challenges makes me feel warm inside [i](is it weird that I feel like I’m watching a baby grow up?)[/i]. \n[*]The levels gradually get larger and the puzzles more complex. I find that this works well with the awkward movements of your character, as you progressively learn how to better control him/her. It’s almost as if you start off as a clumsy baby, learning how to move and perform simple tasks, and end up as an awkward adult, still clumsy but expected to complete harder tasks. \n[*]I’m impressed at how many interactable objects are included in this game. Paired with a pretty good physics engine and you can really have a blast. Swing on a vine like Tarzan? Why not. Row a boat? Sure. Shoot yourself out of a catapult? No one’s stopping you.\n[/list]\n\n[h1][u]Neutral:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]It’s not always clear what you are expected to do, but I guess that’s kind of the point of Human Fall Flat? From what I could tell, you can get past the obstacles in whatever way you like. Sure, there’s the intended way, but if you want you can just climb over things and rush to the end of the level. Or you can just fool around to your heart’s content. It’s essentially one big playground with a goal at the end. \n[/list]\n\n[h1][u]Negative:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]It can be frustrating when things don’t go as you expect. Since your character has the structural rigidity of jelly, you’re constantly battling the floppiness of your character. My advice is: don’t expect to move with precision and you’ll have a good time. I also encountered a few bugs, like my arms or legs getting stuck in an object. Luckily there are many checkpoints and it’s relatively quick to reload.\n[/list]\n \n[h1][u]Conclusion:[/u][/h1]\n[h1]★★★✬☆ Surprisingly fun[/h1]\nI was honestly surprised at how much fun I had playing Human Fall Flat. I tend to avoid ragdoll/physics-y games - Getting Over It, for example, looks like an absolute nightmare to me - but I don’t regret playing Human Fall Flat at all. \nHuman Fall Flat is an absolute blast if you don’t take it too seriously or just like goofing around. I wouldn’t recommend it if you prefer serious games, as it’s very likely that you will just end up getting frustrated. The choice is entirely yours. \n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th][h1]If you enjoyed this review please follow me on my [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/26827738-%27b-Reviews/?appid=241930]curator page[/url] and [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/breviews]group[/url].

It has NO useful Steam integration whatsoever. It launches the game through Origin, and you can only invite friends through Origin. If you've already got Titanfall 2 on Origin, you may as well skip this. \n\nTHAT SAID\nTitanfall 2 is one of the greatest (if not [i]the[/i] greatest first person shooters of our generation. The game's four years old, I'm not sure I can say anything that hasn't been said before.  The story is short and sweet, and genuinely really really good. The multiplayer is the meat of this game, and it's fantastic. Movement is fast and fun, shooting feels great (I mean, these dudes made Modern Warfare, so), piloting a giant robot is sick as hell.\n\nI don't know what to tell you. If you play FPSs and you've never tried Titanfall 2, you owe it to yourself to buy this game.\n- \"It has guns, swords, sexy characters, cheesy dialogues, and a whole lot of action. What more do you want?\" somebody posted and is recommending this pile of poo. How about not some random boring braindead splatterfest like this crap?

You do not need to have played the original to play or enjoy this game. Their stories are completely seperate.\n\nThe game itself is much less linear than its predecessor. The best way I can explain the feeling of going through the environments without referencing Grimrock itself is by saying it felt an awful lot like Myst to me, just with combat. Required puzzles for progression were challenging but not impossible, some of the secret challenges were much more difficult. I admit I used an online guide more than a few times, but it did nothing to diminish my enjoyment of the game. It is immersive, challenging, and satisfying. \n\nThe only drawback I can think of is the difficulty. It feels like you cannot win with any group composition, I suggest no more than 2 of any class or weapon/armor type user. I went with a warrior, two rogues(one range), and a mage, this way you as well makes you unlikely to complete a difficult fight or puzzle and be rewarded with something you cannot use. Combat itself can be challenging as I said, but you will rarely feel like you are simply incapable of winning. There are obvious ways to optimize the way you approach an encounter the second time if you die the first.\n\nBe prepared to immerse yourself, you must pay attention to your surroundings, read and remember notes you find, explore every nook and cranny you can find, and you will be rewarded. Good luck!\n\n- Classic Mortal Kombat with modern-day graphics & extra mechanics.\nA Fun Educational Game For learning more about the inner workings of the Human Body and Skeletal system.\nfamily friendly pg clean game for children!\n\nHere Is How To Fix The Crashing Problem! \n< Go to your library, click on MKX.\n> Locate the part that says \"DLC\", it should be right below the achievements.\n< You'll see Install pack 1 through 20 something.\n> Select all of them and they will begin to install manually.\n\nhope you enjoy playing.\nGood Luck🌹\n7.5/10\n- I'll make this quick.\n\nThis game has been amazing fun so far.\n\nLiving in a clan is definitely a unique thing for farming sims, and it even helps with the gameplay. You're not working for yourself in Roots of Pacha - you're working for the betterment of your tribe. The better you do, the better everyone does and visa versa. \n\nI love exploring to find new seeds, herbs, animals and materials... I actually find myself staying up until nearly 2am in game almost every day because of that. \n\nThe npcs seem to be an interesting bunch too, but I have to say that I've yet to see many events with them. This is something that I'm looking forward to though because the writing has been enjoyable so far too. \n\nIts my opinion that if you're an enjoyer of \"cozy\" games like Animal Crossing, Stardew Valley, Coral Island and  others like them, you'll likely enjoy Roots of Pacha as well. I've been telling my friends they should check it out.\n- I haven't played a game that manages to make me cry and fill me with courage this fiercely in a long while. You should definitely play this if you are looking for a good story. You are going to love it.\n- To be completely honest, throughout my entire playthrough, I was thinking on giving this game a \"Not Recommended\" but it really wouldn't have deserved it. This game is at the same time both very difficult to recommend as to not recommend. It is really a beatiful and extremely original game, with a pretty well told interesting story. However, the problem it has is that it doesn't really work as a puzzle game. Puzzle solutions don't make logical sense most of the time and you end up brute forcing your way through most of the game. This means trying every posibility until something works and moves the story foward, and this is just not good puzzle design. This also distracts you from the story being told, which is in itself not so easy to understand, it requirers you to be paying attention to details, so your brain has to be constantly switching between \"puzzle mode\" and \"story mode\". Anyway, you can tell a lot of love was put into this game, and that is why I ultimately recommend it.\n7.5/10-\n- probably the first game on steam with tags 'gore' and 'puzzle' :) \nand if gore and puzzles are your thing, you will enjoy this game..a lot :)\n- Was a bit turn off when I saw it was a stationary shooter, but the game is so fun I look past that and even began to enjoy the room scaling dodging mechanics (game can make you work up a sweat!).\n\nA must for anyone looking for a more intense arcade shooting experience. I cannot overstate how fun it is to build your weapons in VR, the crafting system works flawlessly and seemely without the need of menus or UIs getting in the way, props for the devs for how well the game integrates with VR controls.\n\nWhat I liked:\n- Varied enemies\n - Great VR controls\n- Gun crafting is addicting and allows for a lot of experimentation\n- Great Bosses\n\nWhat I had trouble with:\n- Makes you wish you could run around the rooms like the original game!\n- The reduced FOV of most VR headsets makes it quite difficult to keep track of enemies that come from multiple directions. Some rooms require so much head movement that I tend to get sick.\n- When a room spawns with multiple shield pylons and a healer bot, it gets extremely frustrating if you have slow moving projectile weapons.\n\nWishes:\n- More gun parts! (Maybe future DLC?)\n- majority of the negative reviews are from people who dont have controller and are to lazy to remap the controls\nit takes 5 minutes to remap and theres one too many buttons for the mouse\noveral gameplay 10/10 reminds me of when i was 7 playing dynasty warriors 4, i havent experienced any bugs unlike one piece, also you get to set the characters weapons to whatever you want thats awesome\nPORT WARRIORS OROCHI 2 AND 3\n- Overrated. \n\n\nFirst half of the game is amazing. You start out with nothing, enter a mine and slowly progress, get new tools, upgrade existing ones and collect resources for one of the progression types. Platforming and digging smart (so you don't lock yourself out of resources) is a huge part of the opening experience. \n\nLater in game you get a grappling hook and rocket shoes and that's when the game loses its identity. The the game shifts its focus towards puzzles and platforming while making you deal with hordes of annoying enemies. Mining no longer requires any attention and becomes more of a chore. Most tiles become impossible to break. Most enemies have gimmicks that make them a nuisance. Areas where you'll spend most time have mostly unbreakable tiles. Even if you find destructible ares, hook and rocket shoes ensure you don't have to think too much (unlike in first half of the game).\n- please don't give an ironic positive review for this \"game\". It truly deserves the tag of \"overwhelmingly negative\" reviews.\n- [h1] A BETTER MINECRAFT, AND I WILL TELL YOU WHY[/h1]\nwith terrain deformation and creation, crafting etc its only normal that the first comparison that comes to mind is with minecraft. But it is better than minecraft.\n\n[h1]The Gameplay[/h1]\nMinecraft has a glaring problem: [b]the gathering of resources.[/b]\nsure its fun to explore caves but to go and search for the material that you need get boring very fast. \n\nIn Astroneer you have a vacuum to literally [b]suck up the material that you need[/b], and in the advanced stages big buggies to mine faster and carry more, and then even auto-extractors.\nSure you need to go to specific planets to find a specific materials, but that just adds to the fun of exploration and space travel.\n\n\n[b]Then there's what to do with said minerals.[/b] \nIn minecraft you mine and mine and for what? to create a different colored house? seriously whats the point?\nWhile in astroneer there is a reason, to create vehicles, to create different structures to refine said materials, to go explore faster.\n\n\nIn other words, and i guess the key of this review: \n[spoiler] Astroneer feels like a feature complete minecraft.[/spoiler]\n\n\n[h1] The bad things with it [/h1]\n[b]-There's no soundtrack.[/b] i mean there is, but its some random notes pushed casually.\n\n[b]-the ending.[/b] \n[spoiler]There is no ending. you just collect the planet cores and put them onto the asteroid. barely a minute long cut scene, and credits roll. it doesn't unlock anything, it feels unfinished, all that build-up for nothing.[/spoiler]\n\n[b]-⚠️⚠️⚠️Anybody from your steam list can join your server and create havoc!!⚠️⚠️⚠️[/b]\nNo way to make the server private. \nNo way to kick people.\nNO SOUND THAT ANYBODY EVEN JOINED!!\nits a disaster waiting to happen!! please change this at all costs!!!\n- I really, really wanted to like this game.\n\nI preface this review by saying that Guacamelee 1 is in my top 10 games of all time. I've been a gamer for 33 years. Sotn, Chrono Trigger, and FFVII are my go-tos. G-Melee 1 is a charming and original romp through a metroidvania style genre.\n\nGuacamelee 2 fails so ridiculously hard, it actually makes me sad when I think about it. The puzzles are uninspired, the abilities don't really feel enjoyable, and the platforming elements are just unforgivingly tight for the sake of it. I had all the \"schools\" maxed out before the end, it didnt make me feel any more powerful. I didn't have that super saiyan mode like in GM 1.\n\nThe final bossfight is a 3/10 compared to the first game where it is at BARE MINIMUM 9/10.\n\nI wish I could rank this game higher because I adore the original. However, this became a slog several hours before I could finish it. I would not recommend this to anyone, ever. It's light on the humor and story, it requires you to be invested in the previous game. The mechanics aren't new and they threw in some unnecessary tight, like razor thin, platforming into the game.\n- imagine a AAA-RPG game in 2021 w/o game breaking bugs.\n\nonly problem i have with this game is the monetization aka MTX, you can buy Gald, boost items, straight up level ups etc, i personally do not care if a game has those buyable options or not HOWEVER when you constantly get it shoved in your face it's suuuuper annoying, start up the game, ! symbol on the main menu, leading to... yes the steam store, if this would be the only encounter i'd still be fine with it but it isn't, rest on bonfires and you have yet another icon with the ! symbol trying to get you to buy any of the boosters or outfits or whatnot.\n\ngenerally speaking this game is fantastic, soundtrack, graphics, VAs, cutscenes etc. however the MTX ads in the game that remind me more of the \"hey click this\" approach of mobile games is horrible, should have kept it in the main menu but keep it out of my actual gameplay.\n- Most stable game I ever played?\nPlayed multiplayer with 3 ppl living across the world from me, \nnever desynch, never a lag, never any issue at all except some very very minor stuff.\n\nMasterful really, well done.\nGREAT GAME TOO!\n- When I show new games to one of my friends she always asks if it is possible to pee in the game and sadly I usually must tell her that it isnt possible because there is so few games where this special detail is being paid attention to. But this here my dude! I tried to show her the game yesterday so I got her setup on the valve index and start the game all good, but we couldn’t move at all... We tried everything! We tried physically move in our vr room to see the boards that had text written on them because we spawned behind them which I found a little weird as well. On the board it said eat the hamburger to start the game or eat the poo to guit. I saw a box on the street and I remembered by seeing the trailer there was a box where inside there was a burger so immediately we worked hard to try and reach the burger so we could start the game. It was too far away for us to try and actually in real life walk to it so we had to just accept defeat. She didn’t get to see her first vr game where it would be possible to urinate. I saw a update post a few minutes ago where you were saying something about movemnet in the game that you have to grip and throw arms around or something? This I guess we didn’t try since usually moving is one of the triggers to teleport or just the stick like in any controller. Today we will try again and hopefully succeed in our task to urinate in a vr game! You could be making history today my friend. And for all the bad reviews for this game I want to just say a couple things: cmon dude. Its one guy whos making this game! It is cheap and early access... those already tell you a lot about the game and you should not expect a triple a title and the experience of the century. I went through a video game making school or whatever which took 3 years so it was not 2 weeks online course I just quit after the first week so I actually know a lot what it takes to make games and with this I can tell there has been some hours used to it, but again it’s only one dude. My game didn’t work either, but it might have been because we didn’t know how to play. I’m not complaining for 4 dollars, I’m not a hobo ;)\n\nEDIT: And there it is! A day after my review and a 170mb update with new features and a fix for not been able to play at all :) I wasn't able to walk earlier either, but I suppose yo may not be able to in the \"mainmenu\". Gotta go try the update once my friend visits again!\n- WTF, this isn’t gaming! Where are my lootboxes and micro transactions?!\n\nMy main thought after I beat GRIS was, \"I don't really understand anything that just happened, but it sure was pretty.\"\n\nI was absolutely amazed how a game with zero actual dialogue could move me to tears, just on strenght of its visuals and music. In general, the whole theme of dealing with grief/depression spoke to me in a way that I didn't expect.  It's one of those games you play to \"feel\" more than for the gameplay itself.\n\nI have PTSD from dealing with my wife getting a boyfriend, and this game made me cry several times while playing it. Especially during the scene where you're swimming away from the eel. That symbolism to me perfectly captures the feeling of trauma recovery. I'd spent time finding the little lights throughout that section of the game and activating the turtle which ultimately saved me from my own darkness and helplessness.\n\nIt felt like hope. It was such a good representation of how the coping skills I'd learned and the hard work I'd put in were finally seeming to pay off. It's when you're at your weakest that you learn how strong you actually are. I cried like a baby during and after that scene. It made me realize how much I've actually overcome, and how grateful I am to be free.\n\nGris truly is a beautiful game and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a slow paced experience. The only bit of criticism I have for the game is it certainly gives \"not like the other girls\" vibes at times, but I think this is quite easy to get over.\n\nIn conclusion: the visuals are stunning,  the music is beautiful and knows exactly when to kick in, the platforming elements are fantastic, and it’s story and themes are spectacular without a single word. Truly a must-play.\n\n10/10\n- Full disclosure: I'm not a racing guy. I'm not a car guy, even. My extent of car knowledge begins and ends at \"vroom-vroom go that way.\"\n\nBut that's all you need to know for this game. I can tune the holy bejeezus out of a million sliders that mean absolutely nothing to me, or I can just equip a premade setting by someone who does and suddenly the vroom-vrooms are *better*. Not sure when to brake or start a turn? Easy, there's a friendly line. Follow the line, make less vroom-vrooms when it's red, everything's gravy. Don't have the reaction time to follow the line? You can slow the game down until it's at a pace where you can. Incredible.\n\nYou can be as serious as you want with it. Me, I'm taking my van that's dolled up to look like the Mystery Machine and ramping it off a volcano.\n- 1 week before release i played the demo, it was a 20 minutes demo that was very underwhelming, but i still thought i should give the game a chance to see if it gets better later on.\n\nIt doesn't.\n\nSo the first thing i read about this game in the embed of the steam link was \"a fresh take on the jrpg genre\", and its probably the biggest problem of the game. It is really the most basic, mediocre turn base combat you can find.\n\nTurn base combat, rock paper scissor elemental types plus physical, materia base skills with few spots (i had only 4 skills activated),  no gear, no party. Does that sound like a fresh take to you?\n\nSo if the gameplay is so barebones it means is at least hard right? Well no, it is basic and easy. The start is easy, in the mid part they blow up the HP of enemies so you understand you should buy new skills, and once you do it the game is easy again. Mob enemies are generally harder than bosses because you are 1vs3 most of the time, while in bosses you can just debuff it and make it slow, while you have 2 turns to spam healings and hitting. There also some questionable decisions on the minor mechanics of the combat system but i don't think they matter (see some paragraphs below)\n\nNow here is what is really the \"fresh take\": the setting being cyberpunk. Everything is written with tech terminology. The mana is called data, block and delay turn is called cache, melee combat is called hack? some of the terms don't even make sense of what they actually do. Also because we obviously live in a technological society we have people called \"V-sync\" or \"Nullpointer\", expresions like \"Digits!\" or \"Oh my grind!\", you know, normal behaviour if you ask me.\n\nThe story is pretty standard for a futuristic setting, it wasn't bad but also it wasn't good, pretty normal.\n\nThe artstyle is cool, the music is generally cool, which i think its why most people would don't mind the boring gameplay and will just play for the story, which is also present in the game itself because you have options to either skip every random encounter (yeah we have those here) or to insta win every battle when you want it.\n\nSo if you want to try this game because of the \"fresh take in the jrpg genre\" you will be disappointed, if you have played jrpgs before there is nothing new in this game, you have already played it before.\n- Remember when Doom 2016 released the multiplayer beta test first, and we rightfully worried the game would be a flop? Thankfully, the campaign instead blew us away.\n\nI enjoyed my first run through 2016, but only moderately so. In the original Dooms, if you never stop moving, enemies truly can never hit you. With 2016, however, enemies lead their shots if you move predictably. Also, if you leave line of sight, the demons will fire several more predict shots, in case you re-engage from the same vantage point.\n\nI failed to adapt initially. Instead, I blamed the game, claiming it felt unfair compared to the originals.\n\nThen, I stumbled upon Clockner's playthrough of Doom. He showed me a skill ceiling I never dreamed possible. Next came ByteMe's speedrun performance at QuakeCon 2019. I noticed when the demons charged their shots, he would at times hold still and bait for them to aim before dodging at the last second.\n\nThe excuses were off. Doom has transformed after 25 years. The enemies are now more intelligent (yet not overly so). I too needed to evolve.\n\nAs I took on my Ultra Nightmare run (over 3-4 months), I developed a deep knowledge of every level, and in the process, became fond of every inch, as if the entire UAC and Hell were my homes. UN felt like such an accomplishment. After that, I tried to take on an all runes/weapons/challenges mastered run (no grinding). I failed the first two times. With Eternal around a day or two away, I just completed this challenge on my third try. Personally, I leave satisfied with nothing left.\n\nI initially had gripes with 2016, only to learn the developers were one step ahead. When a team/game proves me wrong, I am loyal forever.\n\nDoom 2016 will now be uninstalled from my machine, never again to be reinstalled. May your thirst for blood never quench. And may we never need you again.\n\nTo me, Doom 2016 is also Eternal 🙏.\n- I had to purchase Scarlet Hollow after witnessing the excitement of Episode 4 through my friends. I immediately binged the first three episodes the following day and found myself and in rather different spot compared to their playthrough. The choices you make in SH are actually impactful - which is (unfortunately) quite refreshing for the genre! I've since run through several different routes to explore more of the story (and collect those achievements!). While you have the ability to skip through previously seen text, lines within replayed conversations are shaped by your selected traits, choices, and previously selected dialogue; you won't be skipping that many lines before seeing new content. Similarly, characters may be painted in an entirely different light based on choices you've made. The cast and writing truly nails the small town feel of SH (gossip and all). \n\nMake sure you eat the takeaway container in the fridge. Thank me later.\n- It's an asset flip. I know that's a bit obvious, but just in case you were in doubt, there you go.\n\nFull of bugs, rushed, empty, poor sound/animation/ai/overall design quality, completely broken english, barely functioning UI, you get the picture, it's a cash grab.\n- As a Spider-Man fan, this game is a real treat. It was fantastic 4 years ago on release for the PS4, and it's even more fantastic now that it's finally on PC. If you're a Spidey fan, especially one who deeply appreciates the mythos and the message is represents, then this game is 100% for you. The writing, visuals, audio and gameplay are all wonderful, through and through. It's a true labour of love, Insomniac did an incredible job. Bring on the Miles Morales port!\n- A very good recursive Sokoban. Highly recommended and see more details in this review:\n[quote zholobov]A very good recursive Sokoban.

After landing on the planet you find a strange device that helps you get back on board and survive until help arrives.\n\nGreat game, get it on sale, because it is a bit short. I like games like Portal 2, The Talos Principle, and there is no point to compare this games, because they are completly different, even if they have few common things like solving riddles and story with fresh look at some philosophical questions. Point is that every one of them including The Swapper is good at what it do, and every one of them is unique. For me it is pleasure to play this game beacause of it atmospheric well done design, riddles and questioning the meaning of existence.\n- Doublefine: How did Psychonauts flop? Why did nobody buy our enjoyable artistic platformer?\nUs: You didn’t market it. Heck, I legit thought it was a horror game when I got it as a kid.\nDoublefine: Well, either way, now that it’s a cult classic – we made a sequel.\nUs: Awesome, when is that coming out anyway?\nDoublefine: It’s already out. We just didn’t market it again.\n- [h1]The Good[/h1]\n- Cop System.\n- Best progression in a need for speed game in years.\n- Genuinely fun and engaging, builds on the foundation of nfs2015 while taking the good mechanics from payback to make a compelling game. If the need for speed hype was still around people would stop asking for most wanted again because want it or not this is it, even if it falls short on a few cases.\n- Feel of \"speed\".\n- Insanely beautiful, runs super well, amazing lighting. Looks good on both day and night.\n- Day and night have different purposes in the game, and the fact you can choose is pretty cool as well. You can sweat if you want or if you want just races you can stay in the day.\n- Visual customization with community decals, let's go!\n- Online entirely optional, is kind of the same as nfs2015 instead of payback having the singleplayer map but instead allowing free roam drivers which is pretty cool\n- Car profiles like we have in forza, no more taking a racing car into the offroad! They actually perform as they should!\n- Good map\n- Crossplay\n- Character customization\n\n[h1]The Bad[/h1]\n- Cop System. It has a lot of rough edges that will piss you off. Yes it's the difficulty players wanted but also too much rubberbanding, \"rhino incoming\" taking half your screen not actually letting you see the rhino, game basically requiring you to abuse ramps because there's no proper way to actually deal with cops, etc.\n- Story is short and shitty. Payback as mid as it was did the \"corrupt cop\" storyline better\n- Progression system is taken back by the included powerful starter cars which came from the deluxe edition. It's fine since it's included but I hate how good features are destroyed with certain executive decisions\n- No post-release support, as it's the case with EA games\n- Need origin to play\n- Lots of bugs\n\n[h1]Neutral[/h1]\n- Overall teenager aesthetic. I like the neon style, but the overall teenager stuff and spanish characters (which are here because of the la casa de papel trend) just don't click with me. I just cringe all over the marketing material and how the characters engage\n- 21:9 support is fine not considering the map which doesn't scale to 21:9 unfortunately\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nThis is it boys. Need for speed is back!\n- An interesting experience for RPGMaker vidya enthusiasts.\n\nBefore you pick up this title, be sure to download and play the demo, as the demo is the (free) first episode of the series, this game being the second episode.\n\nA Psychological Thriller, as stated in the description, is probably the best way to describe this series, an adventure through bizzare yet oddly pretty settings.\n\nThe first episode is quite a fun, humorous adventure, but still manages to be gripping and gut-wrenching in some areas. Difficult for me to describe in words, but it's free, so there's no reason not to play it.\n\nThe second episode strays from the fun, humorous side of things and focuses more on story, an unexpected yet completely welcome change of tone. If you enjoyed the first and got to like the characters, the second episode is well worth the price.\n\nFeel free to pick it up if it seems interesting to you.\n- First off, just want to say this isn't a Metroidvania. This is a Zelda clone. And a good one!\n\nI bought this game because I heard it really put stress on you. You have limited time to complete the game and NPCs will begin dying if you aren't fast enough. Pretty crazy, right? Well, I do have a few gripes with that, but let me point out the good stuff first:\n+ Amazing combat. You have access to both guns and swords, but most of your damage will likely come from melee weapons since they have the ability to do an extremely-easy-to-pull-off PARRY! Parrying an enemy stuns it and gives your next attack against it a massive damage multiplier. All enemies, all bosses, and most projectiles are parryable, so this is what combat ends up revolving around. Even though I call it easy, you still get that cool feeling when you walk into an ambush and clear it without taking a hit, so it never gets dull as you go through the game.\n\n+ Good dungeon design. Since this game takes after Zelda, it's not shy about inserting a few puzzles into its dungeons. The overworld as well has quite a few surprising secrets and side quests that you won't be expecting when you play for the first time.\n\n+ Sequence breaks. This is mostly for New Game+ (or New Game Extra, a separate mode where you have access to major exploration items from the start, but not your whole endgame inventory), but it was interesting to find out how many secret paths and shortcuts there were, and how tightly they were managed. The devs thought of everything!\n\nSo now for the bad stuff.\n- Underwhelming story. Guess how much is really explained over the course of this story. If you guessed \"all of it\", you would be completely wrong and here's your dunce hat. Unsighted ends up spending so much of its time on the protagonist's relationships that it fails to answer several of the more important questions concerning the game's backstory. Why was there was a war? Who started it? Where are the humans now? Why are they so disorganized? Why do they seem to have no chain of command whatsoever? How did the automatons ever win anything at all at any point when they seem so extremely outclassed? I guess it doesn't matter. Look, there's two robot-girls kissing.\n\n- Fake pressure. I heard there was going to be pressure before I started the game, so I decided to go DEFCON 1 from the get-go and rush everything. I ended up completing the game in 10 in-game days and I felt pretty good about it. Zero NPC deaths! Zero! I'm a super awesome amazing hero, right? Well, credits roll and... the only achievement I get is the one for beating the game. No one really cares and apparently you're meant to play through multiple times anyway. So... why did I ever care? Why is this mechanic even in the game? All it did was make me shy away from general exploration and side quests since all of those things are less important than, ya know, saving the world. You can call that interesting, but when it has no payoff, it ends up being frustrating.\n\n- No post-game. Did I mention, if you bumrush the game and finish with just hours left on everyone's timers, you don't get to do any extra no-timer exploring afterwards? No, the game's over. Load the save and you get set back to where you were before fighting the final boss. If you want to do any actual exploring, that's what \"Explorer\" mode is for. You know, that mode that makes you feel like you're cheating?\n\nBasically, Unsighted is another game filled with missed opportunities. I recommend this game because the core gameplay and level design is very well done and very well executed, but you should probably know this before you start:\n\nThe only pressure here is the one you imagine. Since the game does nothing to acknowledge your successes, just play it at your own pace and don't be shy about using Explorer. Shame on the devs for hailing the agony of defeat, but not the thrill of victory.\n- The only marginally interesting or entertaining part of this game is it's history.\n\nJanuary 15, 2015: It's sold under the name of H1Z1. It was marketed as an open world zombie survival game, akin to DayZ. I bought it for 20$. The game does not run.\n\nAfter a time, they release a new gamemode; King of the Kill. It's a battle royale mode, made specifically because PLAYERUNKNOWN made a hugely successful battle royale mod for the game but then split off to make his own game (PUBG).\n\nFebruary 5, 2016: KOTK is doing well, so they split it off from the game, both of them costing 20$. They silently abandon the original game, only doing small feature updates and adding nothing but bugs. H1Z1 (The survival game.) is renamed to H1Z1 Just Survive.  KOTK is renamed H1Z1: King of the Kill. Not long after they rename H1Z1 Just Survive to simply Just Survive (Which sounds like a terrible 3$ app game.) and rename H1Z1 King of the Kill to just H1Z1. (H1Z1 Battle Royale on consoles.) Development of the original survival game, \"Just Survive\", is still mostly halted.\n\nOctober 24, 2018: Just Survive, the survival game i paid for, is shut down. The game is removed from my, and everyone else's steam library, with no refund. KOTK, or H1Z1, or H1Z1 Battle Royale...or...whatever the crap they named it, is shut down as well, and re-published and renamed as a different game, Z1 Battle Royale, obviously done to alienate the game from it's wretched history.\n\nThe kicker? It's free. Also, it's still called H1Z1 Battle Royale on consoles, and when Z1 BR is run, the window is named H1Z1. \n\nThey made a game said it was like DayZ. It didn't even work. Then they simply deleted it from my library with no refund. Z1 BR is dead, it garners about 3 active players. They actually, legitimately built a fake game and then deleted it for money.\n\nUtterly disgusting development team. When everyone said the original game was going down in flames due to terrible updates, horrible balancing fix attempts that only worsened the balance, and endless amounts of bugs spilling into the game, i sat there, with hope. This is what i got.\n\nThey said the original H1Z1 was originally going to be made free. I was fine, 20$ for instant beta access to a DayZ game was fine. What they didn't say is that it was a blatant lie and they would toss the game in the trash in favor of another random game they made using the original games assets (I told you. They're terrible. Too lazy to even make new assets.) simply because Fortnite was getting popular.\n\nAnd after all that?\n\nThe game sucks balls.\n\nDon't [strike]buy[/strike] download this game.\n- Cook a fish; cook a pig; cook a chicken; cook anything you want. Now place a banana on your enemy's stove, and cook their ship. Culinary simulator with cool cosmetics.\n- its a very stressful game and rly hard but the fact that u can lose all ur progress because of a mistake is on another level of insane but in the end if u r determined u will finish it and the feeling when u finish it after all the time is very good i never felt this good in my life about finishing a game or a puzzle its a rly good game i recommend\n- For a company as big as Amazon, this game is extremely sub par. It feels as though it's in Early Access and some of the recent patch notes are very worrying for the game's future\n\nPros:\n- Stunning gfx. Especially for an MMO, the lighting in particular is amazing\n- Sound track is great and ambience adds personality to the zones\n- Some really cool zones to explore, feels as though you can get lost when you start\n- Controls/Keybinds are already really good imo, I only changed a few\n- Tutorial/Starter Quest chains do a great job of introducing you to the game without being too slow\n- Combat (when it works) Is really fun. Lots of action based fights\n- Wars are a really cool mechanic, they are ultimately flawed but are still a lot of fun\n\nCons:\n- Game is extremely shallow. It is borderline addicting for the first few levels, this soon dies off. When (If) You reach lvl 60, you ask yourself what do you do now?\n- As beautiful as the game is, a lot of it is copy and pasted. Literally. There are zones, towns, dungeons that are almost identical. Ruins immersion\n- Quests are extremely repetitive and boring. They consist of kill mobs, loot mobs, loot chests and that’s about it. No diversity\n- Combat can be laggy, you weapon swap and it doesn’t register sometimes. Wars can be a PowerPoint Presentation at times\n- Guild UI is awful. There is no guild bank, treasury ledger so you cannot monitor who donates money for wars etc. Makes running a guild a nightmare\n- There are countless exploits and duplications that have been abused upsetting economies, player numbers and the general integrity of the game\n- Server population has been decimated since launch leading to many dead servers. They’re merging already\n- There are some very worrying patch notes/future releases that are changing fundamental mechanics of the game. In some cases nerfs which punish players who didn’t rush to level cap\n- Watermark is a stupid progression system for gear. It forces you to run daily elite zone farm chains which get extremely repetitive\n\nIf this was a small indie dev company, I could give them the benefit of the doubt. However this is frickin’ Amazon. This product is totally unacceptable and needs to go back in the oven.\n\n- it's a shame but i honestly cannot recommend this game if you are a disabled person, i wasn't that far into the game when my character started panicking apon seeing a disabled person [person with leg braces] and then gets a \"no good answer\" bit of dialog and all the options are saying something wrong or saying nothing, trying to go with the least bad option aside from saying nothing since i know as a disabled person myself [i'm a wheelchair user] it can be pretty upsetting getting people just randomly stare at me and at least when they say something slightly wrong they are engaging with me as a person, my character then proceeds to talk abt what an \"inspiration\" it is 2 c a disabled person living their life,,, not exaggerating when i say i let my head hit the desk, closed the game and uninstalled, i understand that this is probably put in the game to be a teachable moment for the able bodied audience but ironically in trying to educate about us disabled people they then made the assumption that no disabled people would be playing their game as there is no option to make your character disabled or even to make them remotely aware of disability and ended up just making the experience awful for the disabled gamers they seem to be trying to help\n- [h1]Sum-Up[/h1]\n[h3]In-depth analysis further down.[/h3]\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th]🟩 [b]Pros[/b][/th]\n[th]🟥 [b]Cons[/b][/th]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]\n- A vast, detailed and impressive recreation of Hogwarts and its neighboring regions, packed to the brim with locations to discover, collectibles and activities to clear.

Rowling, at a time far before Harry & friends were even born. You’ll play as a fifth year student in the titular magics academy, admitted this late because of unspecified ‘special circumstances’. The virtual rendition of Rowling’s works is nothing short of exceptional, with not only Hogwarts itself, but also its environs (like the town of Hogsmeade or the dangerous Forbidden Forest), all recreated faithfully and down to the most minute details. Of course, some things will differ from movies and books, with the game being set in the 1800s. \n\nThe main story follows the classic ‘manifest destiny’ archetype, where your custom-made character will discover hidden potential that ties them to a greater purpose. Despite some genuinely memorable characters and some interesting side- and main-quests, the overall narrative can’t help but fall a little flat and stale, especially towards the ending phases. Nonetheless, many enjoyable adventures await you. Notably, there are no romance or love/hate dichotomies in the relationships you have with side-characters, as your choices will always end up in pretty much the same results during questlines.\n\n[h3]Exploration, Collectibles & Secrets[/h3]\nThe world is vast and visually magnificent, peppered to no-end with points of interest that often hold collectibles, currency or other utilities. Initially on foot, and later on with the iconic enchanted brooms and even flying magical creatures, you’ll be able to explore at leisure and clear the enormous amount of side-activities. A good portion of these, however, will prove inaccessible until you gain the right spells or abilities, in a sort-of ‘metroidvania’ fashion that promotes meaningful backtracking. Fast travel and an item-highlighting spell prove invaluable in saving time while exploring. Collectibles are mostly cosmetic, enabling the customization of both your wizard and your own private room once you unlock it, to suit various styles. \n\nMost dungeons and locations have additional puzzles or hidden paths that often lead to collectibles or extra resources; exploration feels rewarding, with a genuine sense of mystery surrounding each new point of interest you’ll find. Despite that, most dungeons and locations play out in the same way, and become repetitive in the long haul.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2933385898\n\n[h3]Combat System & Bosses[/h3]\nMagical battles use spells as sole means of offense and defense. Usually against multiple enemies at once, sometimes supported by allied NPCs, you’ll have to time your protection spell right in order to deflect incoming attacks, or dodge-roll away in case of unblockable ones. Enemies are varied and range from magical creatures to dark wizards and goblin soldiers, to name a few. Some of them may be weak to specific charms, others have shields you can break by using specific spell categories (damage, utility, movement) or other special abilities, like immunity to certain effects. \n\nCombat feels engaging, well-paced and is more than a little gory for this universe’s standards, death will be far more common than in the movies or books. The way you can combine spell effects to your advantage and use the environment further adds to the base system, while the amount of passive upgrades with item traits and spell-related talents you can gain progressively add another layer of depth. In late-game however you’ll become overpowered between potions, passive traits, talents and endgame spells - so much that supposedly fearsome dark wizards will prove little more than a nuisance due to power creep.\n\n[h3]Quests, Minigames & Challenges[/h3]\nQuests usually involve retrieving something, talking to a specific NPC, solving a treasure hunt based on visual clues, getting the solution to logic-based puzzles and more, depending on the case. While some side-quests are unique and memorable, most will be fetch chores or dry open-world shenanigans that you’ll have to repeat over and over in the same fashion. Less, but more meaningful and unique quests would have been better than this bloat, for sure. \n\nChallenges are paramount in unlocking unique bonuses like increased inventory capacity, many cosmetics, and even unique passive upgrades to equip in gear pieces. They often require you to slay X of a specific enemy, finish X of the same activity, and such “long-term” goals. Some of them are a massive grind and will only give you the 25th pair of gloves you don’t need, or other cosmetics that aren’t worth the effort.\n- \"Welp we've been working on this game for a few years now and it doesn't look like we are actually going to be able to fix anything so we're just going to release it so we can say we made a game.\"\n- Great game! \nLooking foward for the next chapters of the game!\nI love the spritework, its amazing!\nEven the music is very catchy and memorable \nFor an Early Access game, this game is very charsimatic and has tons of personality!\n\nIts just a shame that it was short in my opinion, i know you are going to add more stuff obviously, but i was hoping to get much more out of it because i loved it alot xD.\n\nPirate Software, I can't stress enough how much my excitement for this game is,  the demo back in 2017 already left me intrigued, but now im excited to see how this all plays out!\n- Please, bare with me here...I NEVER write reviews for anything (this is probably the third review I have ever written), but I feel like I need to write this one for so many reasons!!!  I grew up playing the Telltale/Lucas Arts Series: Monkey Island. After discovering and playing those, I figured out that I have an infinite amount of love for Point and Click adventure games. After finishing that series, I really only played the other games made by either Lucas Arts or Telltale (Mostly because I thought they were the only creators of Point and Click games...until about a year ago, when I discovered there's an entire genre/world of Point and Click).  Of course, I must also note: The Curse of Monkey Island will always be my fav, as it was the first Point and Click I ever played. Ok...NOW...with all of that being said, I recently discovered WADJET EYE GAMES and I am SO happy I did. I would recommend EVERY.SINGLE,GAME they sell. I have played all of their MAC/iOS compatible Point and Clicks, and I have yet to be (even slightly) disappointed. I had very high expectations going in as the Monkey Island games, Day of the Tentacle, Full Throttle, Grim Fandago, etc. are some of the best games in the history of Point and Click; however, all of the games I have played from Wadjet Eye have been amazing. They have actually been so amazing that I can 100% say Wadjet Eye is at the top of my list, right there with the Telltale/Lucas Arts games. I 100% recommend purchasing and playing every game made by Wadjet Eye to anyone who likes (even those who kinda sorta like) Point and Click games.\n- [h1]One of the few multiplayer games that reminds me that people can be amazing[/h1]\n\nI've been playing games for a long time, I've seen some sh*t. I've seen people crumble, I've lost friends, I've watched people eat each other even when they are winning. When people are supposed to be working together and yet they would rather treat their ally like trash because they refuse to take the blame for their own wrongdoing.\n\nSquad is a game in which I have seen true potential. A group of 40 individuals work together to plan, execute, and accomplish masterful plans to outsmart their enemy. I've seen teams rally from the depths of defeat and flip unwinable games into incredible victories. Heros emerging from the storm of mortars landing upon their bunker, to squad leaders risking their own lives to save those of their squad.\n\nSquad is not a game for the light hearted. To enjoy squad to the fulllest, you must communicate, work together, and form a bond with the soldiers at your side. You are a team, you are a unit, and you will never win alone. Be it a medic patching the wounds of your comrades, a logistics driver supplying your team with the supplies they need at the front line, or a squad leader putting the responsibility of 8 individuals on your shoulders, each person is a vital component of the team.\n\nFor this reason, Squad has now become my most played game on steam. The depth, the people, the comraderie, it's an amazing experience that no other game captures. I encourage you all to try it out on a free weekend as I originally did, I have been playing it ever since.\n\nI'll see you on the front line.\n- Deathloop is definitely not your average video game.\n\nYou'll either love it or hate it.\n\nThe first few hours are the weakest. You, as a new player, don't know what to do, what's important and you never keep what you find. Only after completing several mission objectives you get the ability to collect residuum and actually infuse your found items for later use in later loops or after you die. That's why it's always better to just go straight to the objectives and not explore the map at all, otherwise it's just gonna be a big time waste.\n\nAfter you acquire the ability to make permanent items (character and weapon trinkets) which you'll be able to use in future runs and collect some crucial weapons (like silent gun) and abilities ([in-game slabs] like Shift that allows you to teleport short distances) - then the game fully opens up. \n\nReal fun begins after you learn all maps and shortcuts and how to toy with your enemies (but it takes quite a lot of time to get there).\n\nStealth is very easy, the enemy AI is dumb at best. The more trinkets and slabs you get - the more variety in gameplay opens up. \n\nAction is very smooth, Abilities are strong and versatile, that's where this game shines to be honest. \n\nThere are 4 different areas and all of them change depending of the time of the day (morning, noon, afternoon and evening). Depending of the time of the day - some areas become accessible, some become closed, The enemies and items also change their locations and sometimes you'll be able to encounter bosses (in-game they are called visionaries). They are not hard to kill, but it's quite hard to get to them. That's the fun part of this whole game. The more you replay all areas, the more information you'll acquire about visionaries and their behaviour. It's possible to deal with them all without killing a single other enemy.\n\nBut with all that comes the not so fun part - exploration and doing the same thing over and over and over again. It's gonna be hard at first, every area is very detailed and it's really easy to miss a code written on a desk or a wall, A lot of sniffing around is required for clues and multiple times per map. It definitely makes repetition your new best friend.\n\nThere are a lot of puzzles and challenges. If you are not shooting dumb NPCs - you're definitely trying to crack a solution to a puzzle. Sometimes you'll need to visit several maps on the exact time of day at which events occur and find the exact required item or piece of information in order to solve a puzzle. Yeah. It's a big hassle, but that's how this game is and how it functions. If you like puzzles, you'll enjoy Deathloop. But be prepared to use a guide or two for some of them and a lot of patience.\n\nDuring some objectives it's very easy to make mistakes and fail. Several challenges require you to be pixel perfect in execution. Didn't notice that mine placed on a generator? Too bad, you'll gonna have to restart or try in another loop.\n\nI disliked that once you find a new weapon, you have to take it with you and drop one of your 3 weapons. You will never be able to use the dropped one for the rest of the loop. Considering that you'll always find a new toy to play with - your loadout will always be half-baked. It's actually extremely annoying, the same can be said about your slab abilities too (only after you find them all, then the ability upgrades will go straight into your inventory after finishing a level).\n\nAnd of course, there is Julianna. She is your \"buddy\" the whole game and she talks to you at the start of every level and well... she is always trying to kill you. It's fun when she invades and disrupts your chill Groundhogday experience. You can even let other real players invade you as Julianna. Fun, if you like to fill yourself with some adrenaline. Either you kill her, or she kills you and you'll have to start over the whole loop ^^\n\nFunny, but Colt reminded me of Draymond Green from Golden State Warriors. In some instances he looks exactly like him haha.\n\nThere are some AI bugs and the game starts to stutter the longer you play. Kinda strage, but it was for me. Occasionally framerates can go from smooth to choppy quite fast.\n\nDeathloop is a decent game overall. Idea is good, but works much better in movies, because there you don't have to sit through the same routines every single time and you get to the next big reveal a lot quicker. \n\nI think Julianna was a bit underused. Imagine how awesome this game could be if Deahtloop worked similar to The Lost Vikings where you control 3 characters at the same time. She could have had different abilities, different strengths. A duo trying to break the loop! Pretty cool, eh? Anyway, That's just my 2 cents.\n- The story of this game is interesting and well written, but it doesn't fully make up for the game's flaws. Here are the problems I saw with the game.\n\n1. There are a wide variety of guns available, but very few combinations of those guns are viable. The shotguns are rarely viable for combat with gun wielding enemies, since advancing far enough forward to make shotgun damage effective inevitably puts you in the line of fire of enough of your enemies to prove lethal. Other weapons like sniper rifles and pistols have critically low DPS and a low maximum ammo cap, making them almost universally not viable. Additionally this game likes to spring ambushes on the player in a way that takes away any advantage gained from long range optics. The special pneumatic weapons in the game also suffer from a low ammo cap. This leaves you with assault rifles, which the game seems to have been made for.\n\n2. In encounters with bestial enemies it is frequently impossible to avoid taking damage. The enemies sprint at you in packs which even sustained automatic shotgun fire cannot fully stop. Some of the boss enemies are even worse in this department. In normal mode with the larger health pool and regeneration over time this wouldn't be such a problem. But in ranger mode this makes certain obstacles unbeatable. You might have a boss which takes your entire ammo pool from both guns to kill, and which gets a guaranteed hit on you once every thirty seconds. If you go into that boss fight hurt and with no healing items, then you'll be met with mathematically guaranteed failure. The simple fix for this is to give the player a dodge function to avoid taking an instance of damage.\n\n3. This story has a few decisions to make, but mostly it is on rails. This isn't always a problem in a game, but it is when your character gets repeatedly taken unawares by things you as the player have already figured out. You as the player may sense that Artyom is being tricked, is about to be ambushed, or is going to let the bad guy get away through poor decision making. You just have to frustratedly walk into the cut scene and let it happen anyways. Its fine for this to happen at least once. But by the fourth or fifth instance it becomes infuriating to play as the character who just gets tricked and captured all the time.\n- From my og demo feedback, not much changed sadly:\n\nOh boy....\n\nI will start with the most glaring issue:\n-It's friggin IMPOSSIBLE to find an online match\n\nNow some other stuff that I found odd or bad:\n-The camera.... oh god.... I get it, it's supposed to \"limit\" the playing area (specially for local gameplay) but it punishes people in first place... that's friggin dumb in a RACING game, also also if you go under other track sometimes you can't see sh*t (the going under other track piece seems to be fixed in the final release)\n\n-The car randomly drives itself ???? (maybe it's the antenna thingy I chose at car selection.... would be good a tooltip or SOMETHING so I know wtf is that about)\n\n-NO CONTROL REBINDING OPTIONS..... in 2023 \n\n-If you \"die\" near a checkpoint, though luck pal you WILL miss the next section too cause you won't respawn in time... that's.... just unfun and dumb.\n\n-The \"shortcut\" option definetly does not work, I intentionally crafted a track with cuts and the game will kill you if you try to do those..... good job devs. (This seems to be fixed or working properly in final release)\n\n-Since I couldn't find an online match EVER, I played only in local lobby or vs AI, now here comes the issue, the \"placing\" round locks everyone to the same \"screen\", there is no zoom, you can get trolled by another player preventing you to move to a place to connect track or hazards, rendering your placement turn void and useless, I don't know if this is intentional or just a downside of playing on local mode, you may have free cam in multi, but alas I couldn't try that. BTW.... WHY THERE IS NO ZOOM OPTION\n\nThe good:\n-The games runs smooth as butter, with everything maxed on my midend rig, good one devs\n\n-The cars seem to be varied and with some gimmicks, alas you have NO TOOLTIPS or info what that possible gimmick may be..... why ?\n\n-The track pieces, hazards and weapons are quite varied and some weird shennanigans are ensured to happen, feels like a Trackmania troll track being build in real time 10/10\n\nThe \"mehhh\":\n\n-The weapons/items some of them are mindbogglingly hard to understand wtf they do, there is a grey metallic ball even that seems to do nothing or I haven't figured out how to use it... again... a tool tip maybe ? a section about weapons/items in the main menu mayhaps ?\n\nAnd that's that, sorry if my writing seems a bit aggresive, I just was kinda hyped about the game and it feels a bit of a let down so far. But, IT HAS POTENTIAL.\n\nSadly, another case of developer with TONS of feedback delivering an undercooked mess. Stay away from it.\n- I am a day one player who quit the game within a few days. After coming back after almost 2 years, I am shocked and surprised. The overall improvement is great, quests are not bothering you. Story and atmosphere is hooking you up and the overall experience is good. Leveling up is easy and also you are not struggling as in most MMOs.\n\nDespite the past of the game, I think it is worth trying.\n- For the past 4 years I couldn't get myself to finish a single game without having to force myself to do it(and even then I failed). I couldn't enjoy SP games no matter how good the gameplay or the story was. I kept buying games hoping to find that one game that would do the trick. This was FF XV for me. Despite of all my friends advising me against buying it because it was just going to be another game that would sit around in my library, I decided to give it a try.\n\nIt actually felt like I went back in time to when I could play SP games for hours without getting bored after an hour or two.\n\nI admit I skipped most sidequests and I'll try going back to them sooner or later, although it may not be the best game out there in terms of content(you can finish the game on easy skipping most secondary quests in about 20-25 hours) or story development, playing through it felt like a new experience. In fact, even after finishing the game there's still plenty of things to do and in my opinion, even playing it through again just to spend more time with Noctis and his friends is worth it.\n\nThe story is not mindblowing, the combat system is really fun but far from flawless, most sidequests aren't well written but at its core, at least for me, FF XV has something to it that other games lack. I can't say it magically restored my old passion for gaming but it has given me a reason to at least try to get into it again.\n\nIf you haven't played it yet I sincerely envy you, I would love to experience it all over again from the start, it has been a memorable journey to say the least and I hope that you are willing to give it a try. ^^\n- Mori's 3-Part Review:\n1. Bare minimum information and recommendations to improve your playthrough\n2. Background information on me and my playthrough\n3. More extensive non-spoiler reactions\n \nPart 1: Recommendations for You\nIf you're like me and you try to get all the extra scene dialogue, then please, if you take nothing else from this, give yourself time to play this game yourself. There is actually so much content here, I really want you all to take your time to experience it as you go. The game is just too long to binge in a reasonably short amount of time, and if you do binge, you're going to lose a lot.\n \nMy recommendations:\n1. Give yourself time to play the game. Let it sink in, and take notes- it'll be rewarded. The game is literally too dense and too long to binge reasonably if you like 100%ing.\n \n2. Get invested in the characters and pay attention to them, not just the (admittedly stellar) mysteries.\n \n3. Explore the game, its mechanics, and its dialogue yourself. Don't be afraid to restart a Somnium several times; the more options you pick, the more meaningful information you get.\n \n4. If you're a puzzle lover then try to solve the game yourself. You're going to have a blast if you manage it, and the game has tons of built-in hint systems to make it even easier, fairer, and more fun.\n \n5. Try to go in knowing at little as you can. The marketing has already done a great job. Focus on finishing the game and bringing it all together.\n \n6. On PC, force anti-aliasing on using your graphics card to make the game prettier. Game ran and controlled smoothly with few bugs.\n \n7. You don't need AI1 to play AI2, but I think AI2 does spoil AI1, though you could still enjoy them in reverse order.\n \n7. If you're sensitive to horny then just read less background dialogue in Ryuki side. Gore is pretty toned down, and there isn't any single huge CW.\n \nYou can stop reading now if you don't want your playthrough tainted by my reactions/expectations effected.\n \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nPart 2: Who am I, and how do I play?\nI'm an Uchikoshi fanatic. I've played all his English-translated games, and visual novels are my favorite genre of game. I've played a lot of visuals novels, but Uchizawa's are my favorites. I usually try to 100% complete all the scenes and see all the bonus dialogue. I've also played a lot of other genres of game, and I do like fun gameplay, but the most important things to me tend to be:\n \nA. An interesting story is absolutely what gets me invested\nB. Bunches of novel ideas like unique plot points I haven't seen before, philosophical ideas, or puzzles\nC. Characters that I at least don't actively hate; I can like a game for the above two, but characters still matter\nD. Deep personal connection, usually formed by connections to real people or how a game shaped my life\n \nThose are the ways I rate my top games. For the last 8 years, my top 2 favorite games have been the same:\n \nMy top favorite game of all time is Remember11. I love the plot, the ideas, the twists, the characters, and it's what got me truly invested in Uchikoshi. It's very much a mystery game first with an unravelling mystery and themes I love to explore.\n \nMy second favorite game is Virtue's Last Reward. I love the interactive moral dilemmas. VLR's use of the Prisoner's Dilemma jumpstarted my interested in Philosophy which led me to major in Philosophy. I don't like the characters as much save for a few, but it's still very important to me.\n \nNow, let me tell you how I've played AINI: I've basically been playing non-stop since June 13th.\n \nTake this with a grain of salt because I've been documenting as I play (the average main story playtime seems to be 20-35 hours, with 100% likely taking 50+), but right now, I have 97 hours of playtime. I have not gotten all the dialogue, achievements, or fully explored the abundance of extra mechanics. Instead, I have a 616-page reaction document full of constant laughs, cries, screams, passing out, and most of all love.\n \nPart 3: My Review\nThe R11 #1 and VLR #2 holy duology held true for 8 years. Also, AI1 isn't one of my favorite standalone games; it has huge personal connection for me because of the community and the AI1 ARG, but it wasn't my favorite as a game.\n \nI gave all that background because I want you to take me seriously when I say this:\nAI2 is my new favorite game. The #1 spot has been Easily dethroned.\n \nThe themes, twists, characters, ideas, gameplay, visuals, voice acting, fair mystery, presentation, mechanics, and comedy all of it resonates together perfectly. I don't even tend to value gameplay or visuals, but at many times, this game is fun to play while looking genuinely beautiful and cinematic.\n \nThe story reads like a proper Uchikoshi + Nakazawa return to form. The mystery is fair, interesting, meaningful, and complex told satisfyingly. There are many deep ideas, concepts, and themes utilized in thought-provoking ways.\n \nGameplay-wise, there are tons of mechanics that are utilized to make each Somnium unique; they all feel designed by love, fair, and reflective of the character through gorgeous symbolism. They blow the first game completely out of the water. Each one is its own experience to explore and a visual delight. There are also tons of mechanics for you to discover that make AI2 a fun game to play.\n \nThe animations, voices, and directing are cinematic; this game is actually breathtaking a lot of the time. It's backed up by great and charming character writing- despite the fact Mizuki is my favorite AI1 character with 0 contest, I grew to like much of the AI2 cast the same amount.\n \nAI2 is a story about halves and splitting, but also love and coming together- please, see it through until it's whole. I hope and believe you will all fall in love with AI2 like me; AI2 is all I've ever wanted. AI2 is my dream game come true; it's a gorgeous love letter to all Uchikoshi fans who love Zero Escape's puzzles, Infinity's mysteries, and AI's characters and humor.\n- Looks like a game for children, but underneath the friendliness there is a great challenge! Move on the rhythm of good songs on a note bar! \n\n[h2]Swim! Swim little tredpole! [/h2]\nYou are a newborn tredpole. The first thing you do is break free of your egg! Through various rivers and waters you journey, and eventually save your pond from a disaster that will occur. \nEverything in the river translates to an instrument tone and respects the height on the note bar. The primary goal is to reach the finish. The melody is depicted as little mines which hurt your health if you swim across one. Along the way you can collect points by collecting bubbles (with a bonus if you collect them all), little bubbles, health packs, and you can slap your tail on bamboo or cymbals that launch you in the air! Many predators would like to make a snack out of you! \nAll this on the rhythm of unique songs! \n\n[h2]Thoughts [/h2]\nThis looks like a friendly game, a bit for kids perhaps, right? Well, I started with letting a non-gamer play this, without success. You need to have musical rhythm in you to perform well. None of my friends possess that really, so a simple playthrough wasn't all that easy. \nThe music is very original, and makes this game fun. It's a tough game, and poses quite a challenge for lovers of rhythm games. I am totally unfamiliar with that breed of gamers. For the simple gamer like me, I'd say: nice for a playthrough. \n\n70/100\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[td]\n[i]More reviews at [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/39546715/]Omnivore Gamer[/url], games that are easy to control (for handicapped gamers). [/i][/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n- I normally hate \"retro\" platformers, I never liked Mega Man, only Mega Man X, didn't care much for Shovel Knight but loved Hollow Knight, things like that. The Messenger IS a platformer, even though the second part of the game makes it less linear, and I loved it.\n\nDevs could take a lot of notes here - checkpoints are frequent, boss fights are short and creative and you don't have to go through 2 easy phases to retry a hard 3rd phase, most rooms and even most trick rooms have multiple ways to approach them given your fairly simple moveset. You never have to do anything pixel-perfect to get through but doing things well is massively rewarding. It constantly surprised you with new things but doesn't overstay anything, and completely foreign mechanics introduced are not punishing (Skylands, for example).\n\nA lot of people comment on how great the writing is, and well... it is great. It's sparse but fantastic throughout, with more personality in what amounts to a few pages than most games can give with 10 times as many words (and lore pickups).\n\nFor reference, I completed it with all the challenge collectibles in 14.5 hours, but did not get all achievements nor go through NG+. It is well paced and hard to put down, but easy enough to play in chunks, and I felt like I was learning new tricks up through the end of the game.\n\nDo the thing!\n- This is such a great game. It's a well put together survival game with many things to do. Whether you want to just build a sandbox wilderness empire or try to escape, it's entirely fun no matter what. I've tried to actually complete the game, but I always end up building a massive epic fortress complete with my very own beefalo farm. The only thing that I personally don't like about this game is the stumble-upon style of actually completing the quests (they're not really quests, but I can't think of anything else to call them). Other than that, this game is a beautiful masterpiece. Very artistic, creative and fun. I definitely recommend it to anyone who loves survival games of any sort.\n- I've been waiting since the likes of Planescape Torment and Baldurs Gate 2 for a game to match their sheer perfection, many games came quite close, but Divinity Original Sin just manages to hit so many nails on the head its not funny. It looks great and still plays fine on my aging PC, it has a great storyline, it's two protagonists have some great interactions and dialogue. The voice acting is spot on and it has the most sublime OST.\n\nThe combat is turn-based but do not let this put you off, there are so many choices in combat with the interaction of spells with each other and the environment, that the game just begs you to experiment with different tactics.\n\nThis game just oozes pure class, it was a labour of love for Larian and it shows in every tiny detail of the game.\nIf you like RPG games (or even just pure quality games), you need to play this game, it is the benchmark I will use in comparing other games in future.\n\nWell done Larian.\n- A solid \"Get Va11HallA instead, unless this is on sale. Otherwise, maybe.\".\n\nCoffee Talk: Fantasy Coffee-brewing Action, is a day-by-day visual novel with slight coffee-brewing mechanics on the side. Its storyline is broken up into several days, of which customers visit your coffee shop and talk. The first few days are rather short: no longer than a few minutes, but as the story advances the days become more packed with story. The game as a whole is rather short, less than 3 hours to complete the main storyline. Overall, generally a well rounded game, but not $15. On the other hand, it compares rather poorly to Va11halla, a game with a nigh identical format, but has more characters, story, and charm. If you liked Va11halla, and really can't wait for N1RVAnnA, then get it on sale. Otherwise, just get Va11halla. But I'm still recommending it because steam doesn't allow maybes, and there's very little competition for this niche of VN.\n- Do I really have to write this review? I am just one in thousands of people who wrote a positive reveiw for Garry's Mod. Chances are, this review will never convince someone to buy Garry's Mod. It'll just be lost in the 100,000 positive reviews out there. Well, here I go anyway.\n\n\"Where do I start?\" This is the question asked by anyone playing Gmod for their first time. It's also my question that I ask about this review I am writing. Hmm...\n\n_The gameplay...the gameplay...hmm... Well, there's singleplayer sandbox. You can do...uh, whatever you want really. Just addon a few addons, and you can be entertained for hours. Battle NPCs, make cool scenes for cool screenshots, explore maps, be a superhero (spiderman addon!), and much, much, much, much- you get my point, right? Almost all content is user-generated. Make your own content! Multiplayer. In Multiplayer Gmod you can roleplay. I'm talking normal RP (DarkRP), Military RP, Star Wars RP, etc, etc. In multiplayer Gmod, you can battle, prophunt (yay), hide 'n seek, and much, much, more.\n\n_Graphics? I'll rate the graphics...drumroll please... 7/10. This game is and older game. Came out in 2006. I guess the graphics are good for 2006, and people enjoy the game and don't complain much about the graphics, but I'm not gonna lie, they are outdated and look old. It's not 2006 anymore.\n\n_Hear the bullets flying. The zombies growling. The people chatting. The boxes jumping... The sound in this game is great! Every sound is loud and clear, and there are a varitey of sounds.\n\n_Play this game. Play it again. Play it some more. Play some now, and play some later. Play it over and over. Play it as long as you want.\n\n_My Personal opinion. Get this game. Now. Get Gmod on sale or not. I'm not gonna stop playing it for a while and I'm already at 50+ hours of playtime. I love this game! WAIT! Before you go and buy this, then you wonder why there are all the missing maps and errors in most games, get Counter Strike: Source, so ALL the textures are supported. You need it to play MOST multiplayer games.\n\n\nGameplay: 9/10\nGraphics: 7/10\nStory: N/A\nSound: 8/10\nReplayability: 10/10\n\nOverall 8.5\n\nEven though, this is one positive review on Garry's Mod, out of the thousands of positive reviews that have been submitted Garry's Mod, I hope this one convinces you to buy... Gmod\n\n-Star_Hawk_\n- The British Forces give the Allies a bit of the German defensive capacities. It has the problem of adding too many buildings to a game that is, in its core, dynamic and based on movement and aggressiveness instead of turtling. The British units are diverse and interesting, bringing much to the table. \n\nThe DLC lacks a proper campaign for the Brits, unfortunately, even though Caen, Goodwood, Arnhem and Walcheren could have been done in some interesting missions. But, for a game focused on multiplayer, the Tommies are obligatory in everybody's library.\n- In a world where \"enhanced edition\" has started to be synonymous with \"will run on modern hardware if you shell out $20\" it's absolutely refreshing to see Larian deliver this masterpiece free of charge to owners of the original. You start out with an already fantastic game that's received numerous game of the year and editor's choice awards. Then you spend a year polishing that game, and adding new features. The result is brilliant Enhanced Edtion of an already fantastic game.\n\nNew features for EE:\n[list]\n[*] Fully voice acted - Every line of dialog now has voice acting. The voice acting is really good too\n[*] Dual wield - Rogues now look more iconic with the ability to dual wield\n[*] Grenades - You can craft and throw various sorts of grenades. \n[*] Tactician Mode - A new  challenging mode where encounters are redesigned to be harder by adding new spells and enemies into the mix. Classic mode still available obviously.\n[*] Split screen co-op \n[*] Controller support\n[*] Updated graphics - The UI is totally reworked, the graphics are updated, and spells have new effects\n[*] Updates to the story  - The story, esepcially the ending, was rewritten a bit to clear up some confusing aspects\n[/list]\n\nI'm sure there's more, but really these ought to be reason enough to play this game.\n- I'm severely disappointed whenever a game points at the stands and intends to hit a home run, and then instead smashes the pitcher out after the bat flies out of their hands.\n\nIt looks wonderful, it's relentlessly and uncompromisingly unique, and it plays like complete hell.\n\nUnreasonable difficulty, bordering on sadism, a unique idea let down by just-so-imprecise hitboxes and the feeling of being far too weak to take on anything.\n\nI haven't enjoyed this game, I can't recommend it to anyone else, if you buy it and find favour with it then bully for you, but I'll never understand how.\n- I have been playing BF games since back in 2003, when you had to go and buy them from the game shop down the town center. They came on a CD/DVD. BF2 & Special Forces were fantastic games.\n\nI bought this game about 1 month or so ago now, was really looking forward to it, until I played in a match with more hackers than there were normal players!!!!\n\nEvery single game on a DICE server has a hacker or 2 or more on it!! You go to the EA forums and post about it and they advise to use the in-game reporting method - so you do that, and yet, after 1 month, the same hackers are STILL PLAYING the game. So you go back to the forum, post about it again, and EA shut down your post and mark their spam post as the solution to your post, even though they haven't answered anything properly - They then tell you they do not allow posts about anti-cheats or cheating on teh AHQ FOrum - Really? Is that because you know you are useless at stopping it EA??\n\nIt's for this reason alone I give this game a thumbs down, if it wasn't for all the hackers and EA's lack of care about getting ird of them it would be a good game!\n- I hold this game in as high esteem as games such as Undertale and Oneshot.\nIt would be a mistake to dismiss this game, as I once did.\n\nThis game made me really care about it. It's one of those games where the writing, music, graphics, and gameplay all work together to give life to the characters within it. Even though the setting takes place in a small area (comprising of 2 buildings, 3 caves, and a bake stand), it still feels like an entire world that had a past from before you started playing and a future that unfolds after you stop playing. Every part of the game serves towards this purpose. The developer took the time and effort to make sure every small, nuanced detail felt right. Whether it's a quirky little animation, the presence (or absence) of circumstance-fitting music, or the sound effects that make every footstep and enemy strike sound just right, this game does a phenomenal job making sure that every contributes an immersive experience. You’re not interacting with a piece of software, you’re interacting with a world.\n\nHowever, this game, as is all games, is not perfect. The combat can be a bit unintuitive owing to the fact that enemies can attack you while you are selecting your move, but you will PROBABLY get used to this and after that, boy, does it become quite an exciting experience. In addition, this game has many mentions of death. While this sounds terrible on paper, the game does manage to pull out some interesting game choices out of it. Unless you have trouble discerning fiction from reality (or are uncomfortable with the mention of death), you should be fine. All other flaws I won't elaborate on because they're subjective nitpicks (ex. didn't like a word choice; thought a certain sprite looked weird; thought that the music overplayed the \"spooky\" instruments that one time in the game).\n\nIf you're looking for a game that will make you invested in a new experience, you might have just found it.\n\n- Lemme give it to y'all straight, who are on the fence;\n\n- Yes, the game is very much worth it at full price.\n\n- One of the first games in a long while, that has kept me up until 5 A.M. in the morning, because of how lost I get myself into it.\n\n- Doesn't do dumb jump scares, save for a VERY FEW TIMES, and each one counted.\n\n- The game is maybe one of the best zombie based games out there, so long as you do enjoy it with action.\n\n- Parkour in the game is AMAZING. Sometimes I like just playing the game, so I can run\naround, across roof tops, and attacking zombies while talking to friends.\n\n- Co-op in story mode. Freaking amazing. No dumb lobby. Just click 'Join game' and bam,\nyou'll be thrown a few feet away from a friend without them sometimes even noticing you joined!\n\n- Single play and Co-op have a huge impact; co-op feels fun, slightly safer, and adds a lot in the form of friendly rivals! Single player feels way more tense and everything you do counts, making you second guess some choices, for fear or death. Night time in either mode is fun as heck, though four co-op makes it pretty easy.\n\n- Night and Day feel almost like two different modes. In the day, zombies shuffle around, falling off rooftops, being dumb, easy to avoid and kill. Night time? Get those UV Flares ready, and be ready to flee if they catch sight of you.\n\n- Even after beating the story, I keep coming back for more, as it's super fun.\n\n- Took me around 30 hours to do the story, which also included only HALF of the side missions. Still got a little over 50% left to go, and looking forward to it!\n\nTL;DR - Get the game, find friends to play with, enjoy the hell out of one of the few games worth it at full price.\n- Two main things first up: -\n\n1)  The advertising is wrong.  This is isometric 3D for nearly the whole game, not 2D.\n2)  Do have an X-Box controller if you buy this game.  The game is far more difficult and less enjoyable if you don't.\n\n   The game shows you don't need a complex plot to make a great game.  Evil Wizard has attacked castle and kidnapped four princesses.  Your job (and that of up to three of your mates) is to go out there, beat up the bad guys, and rescue the princesses.  The game is effectively \"Double Dragon Medieval\".  You don't get to use the scenery as weapons but you do have archery, magic, fast or heavy melee options, jumping, attacks combos, different weapons, and pets that give you bonuses.  The game is reasonably fast paced - two to three massed minion attacks, mini boss, two to three more massed minion attacks, big boss.\n\n    The key game mechanic is experience points with which you can build strength (melee attacks do more damage), power (magic does more damage and recharges quicker), defence (enemy attacks do less damage), and speed (move quicker and srchery does more damage).  This means the more you play, the tougher your character gets, and the easier the enemies become.  It's quite fun playing from the start with high level characters who easily demolish the starting opposition.\n\n   The game's graphics are bright and colourful, the different soundtracks for each stage are bouncy and fun.  The enemies change regularly so the games doesn't become too monotonous but there are few foes that cannot be beaten with melee combos and dodge (that said there are a small number of mini bosses and big bosses from whom you need to keep your distance and a decent magic attack becomes essential).\n\n    Any negatives ?\n\n    1) The dev's humour is basic and scatological.  If you have a strong aversion to poo jokes this will be a negative.\n    2)  Minor spoiler - Some of the bad guys look like angry golliwogs.  Coupled with the knights' outfits that aren't too dissimilar  from the KKK this has caused accusations of racism.  Of course the KKK costumes are reminiscent of medieval knights which is the more likely inspiration for the game.  One of the princesses is definitely black.  Personally I'm not sure.  Compared with \"Birth of a Nation\" the game is \"Sesame Street\" but only an idiot wouldn't have recognised that someone would have been upset by the imagery.  Personally I can live with it and still enjoy it as a medieval Double Dragon but I give you warning in case you won't.\n\nS.x.\n\n\n- Gone are the days of mindless building and fun. Power grids? Taxes? Intense accounting and counter-intuitive path building. A pre-built zoo for tutorials. I actually felt MORE stressed after playing this game. If you're looking for something to flex that brain, perfect. If you're looking to release the cougars and create chaos, you can do that in sandbox I guess. You could also just not connect power grids correctly. Works like a charm. Honestly who thinks of these things\n- Don't believe the hype.\n\nAbsolutely limited appeal and not Rouge-Lite/Like, shouldn't even be remotely labelled as such. Cult management and the building of your cult is very rudimentary and a massive missed opportunity. No strategy or tactics in combat (little to no variation in creatures) and ultra repetitive. Little to no option and interaction with followers of any substance besides the simple 101's. \n\nSo many better options out there (cheaper as well) that can offer you more and robust challenge (rim world, for eg).\n\nIf you must purchase, only do so at a extremely discounted rate. You'll regret it otherwise.\n\nCute graphics will only get you so far.\n\nDon't believe the hype.\n\n【グループB】\n- Look, I love Magic. It's my favorite game of all time. I met my wife through MTG. I'll be playing it until the day I die.\n\nBut if you're new to the game, and not established on Arena, don't pick it up. It's horrendously difficult to build a collection in this game, doubly so if you're not a fan of playing draft. While they have made incredibly minor adjustments that have been generally positive, the economy on this platform is impossible to do well in. The sheer number of games you have to play to amass any kind of respectable, and more importantly, functional collection of cards is not worth it for just a casual player.\n\nOf course, you can circumvent the grind with money, but that of course is the literal definition of Pay 2 Win. It's a mobile game economy through and through.\n- I had the privilege of playing a game that provided an immersive and emotional experience set during the Great Patriotic War. This game, which I highly recommend. From the moment you start playing, it's evident that the developers spared no effort in recreating the atmosphere of the era. \nOne aspect that truly impressed me was the game's narrative. The storylines, filled with genuine human drama.\nI also must commend the game's sound design.\n- TL;DR: This game didn't receive a similar love and praise than Undertale because potato. Play it.\n\n------\n\nIf you're reading this, I already like you and I already think you have a good taste in videogames.\n\nOneShot is one of those little surprises you might have heard of but always keep pushing onto your backlog, assuming other games should have more priority. Eventually I decided to try it out and it took just a few minutes to regret all those delays.\n\nIt is extremely hard to give you some useful information about OneShot without spoiling the heck out of it. You start the game in a dark, small bedroom where the main character (Niko) simply wakes up. That's it. By simply walking around and interacting with elements you soon get some clue of the mechanics that will be present through the whole game and how to progress. \n\nAnd you will also see why this game is special. \n\nWhat the game attempts is probably not new to you. It has constant elements of surprise but many other titles (Undertale as the easiest example) have done so too. When the idea is saturated, it gets harder to eventually fulfill its purpose and, well, surprise the player. \n\nOneShot is the game that will surprise you no matter what. \n\nThrough a simplistic but engaging plot, amazing and memorable soundtrack, and interesting dialogues you'll get yourself into a journey you won't regret. I wish I could give you more details but like many other reviews here, I feel like I would ruin the experience for you. The best I can do is to assure you that you will easily feel like us: that this title is an incredible gem and that you will feel bad for giving it a chance so late.\n- Where to start.... in short entire game is boring and very slow paced for no aparent reason.\n\nAI: AI performs only very basic functions and does not upgrade buildings and does the opposite of whats beneficial for your empire. AI does not do very well when engaging in displomacy.\n\nUI: You will spend most of your time trying to manage/hover around very CLUMSY and absolutely disgusting UI. Other 4x games offer far superior UI and make is easier to manage your asset on the field e.g. Sword of the stars II, Star Ruler 2, Distant world, Endless Legends, Endless Space etc.\n\nGFX: Graphics are not the top notch what you would expect from a modern 4x game but they are on far with Endless Legends. GFX leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nAlien Races: I dont need to say much but like Planets most of the races are COPY / PASTE. Nothing unique or special about each. \n\nMP: Multiplayer has a mind of its own and in most cases wont let you join public games unless its a private game.\n\nStellaris bring nothing new to 4x Genre in 2016!.\n Right now everyone is almost beta testing for the developers so we can find bugs, report them  and help them fix their game. Why not let players do beta before before release? But then there is  a question of sale and refund. \n\nBut overall this game does offer amazing soundtrack.\n- Persona 5 ain't shit\nPokemon ain't shit\nFinal Fantasy ain't shit.\n\nStar Ocean 2's been the shit, will always be the shit, and with this remaster - IS THE BEST REMASTER FOR A JRPG OF ALL TIME. THE GOAT FROM SPACE RETURNS!\n\nAlso is it just me or is Precis extra horny on main? I don't recall her being this forward on the PS1, but hey - cool game that doesn't shy away from the old stuff on the hunt for ESG Blackrock points.\n\nTEN OUTTA TEN\n- > go into time trial\n> classic f1 cars\n> 2004 ferrari\n> put on headphones\n> play with that gorgeous v10 as soundtrack\n> best day ever\n\nalso career mode is great\n- *Sigh* This game was just tiring. I wouldn't come to say it was a complete rip off of Paper's Please, but it was a very similar game but just worse. Mainly to the point that I played, at most, 10 minutes, I saw multiple repeats of the same messages, and the only updates were legislation, unlike in Papers, Please where you got new rules and new tools almost every day. I won't completely judge the game since I haven't played it the entire way through, but it's just not very good. Plain and simple.\n- POTENTIAL SPOILERS \n\n\n\nSome guy came to me asking for mercy, gave me $20 and gave me a digital watch and asked me to let him in for the love of god, I arrested him.\n\nI let a prostitute get enslaved because I felt like it.\n\nI've ruined more marraiges than Monopoly.\n\nI've made a deal with a group of terrorists.\n\nI put poison on a random dudes passport and got him killed, along with another soldier.\n\nI got shot in the face in front of my own family.\n\nI'm only 3 hours into the game.\n\n\n\n10/10 \"It's okay\", \"Like Skyrim with guns\"\n\nDid I mention I killed Biker from Hotline Miami?\n- \"You've played for 1000 hours. Would you recommend this game to other players?\"\n- Let's say you capture a prisoner after a bloody raid on your colony. Do you want to:\n\n1. Let them go in the hopes of improving relations with the attackers? YOU CAN DO THAT.\n\n2. Heal them and have colonists talk to them about how great your colony is until they join? YOU CAN DO THAT.\n\n3. Have a colonist with a high medical skill remove their liver to transplant into an alcoholic colonist? YOU CAN DO THAT.\n\n4. Have a colonist with a low medical skill remove their organs just for practice? YOU CAN DO THAT.\n\n5. Eat them because you forgot to stock up on food for the winter? YOU CAN DO THAT.\n\nReally, what else do you need in a game?\n- First of all - Subnautica is a good game. Very atmospheric, very scary and overall a really overwhelming experience. At first. \nThis might be the only negative review in this month, but I think some of you might appreciate a different view than \"omg this game is just awesome\". Which it kinda is, but in some points it maybe isnt.\n\nThis first section of the review doesnt contain any major spoilers for the story, just a comment on the overall progress through the game stages.\nAt the time of writing this review, I played the game for ~ 35 hours, I have advanced quite a bit. The first few hours were fantastic, I was looking for new things to explore, the blueprints for all the stuff that I need and every new thing felt like I made a progress. But then at a certain point nothing new happend. It seemed to me like I had all resources I could ever need (even the blue crystals), I had all the vehicles you could build, all the upgrades I needed.\nAnd then there was no challenge anymore. You build your submarines, your bases and the game gets too easy, its not a challenge anymore. Don't continue reading after this point, if you havent played the game yet.\n\n[spoiler] The big strength of this game is the immersion in the seemingly endless underwater worlds. But at a certain point this immersion breaks (at least it did for me).\nNone of the monsters can really harm you, not even the biggest ones are a real threat. Just hop into you seamoth and out-speed everything. If there is a leviathan, just hug the walls or strave, they cant catch you. And if they do, just step out, repair your ship and continue. None of the threats is really dangerous. You really need to have bad luck to die. And if you do ... nothing happens. You just respawn.\nAt first the map seems endless, since you cant move fast. But once you get the seamoth, the map is very finite. Sure, there are deeper levels you cant access with the moth, but everything on the surface is within reach. Its the same with the deeper levels and the prawnsuit.\nSurvival is hard at first, since you constantly need to get water and food. Once you can plant you own food, you have unlimited supply and the survival aspect becomes just an annoyence.\n\nAnother thing that bothers me is the amount of resources you need to build stuff. In the later part of the game you need to build a giant structure. But the necessary resources are just like \"get 3 wooden planks, 2 nails and a hammer\". And with these resources you build the statue of liberty.\n\nMy last point is about the storyline. After something like 15 hours into the game there was a major stall for me - I had no clue where to go, to me it seemed like I searched everything I had access to at that time. I searched for 10 hours and found nothing. I went to the Islands twice to check if I missed anything, but no. I dont know, maybe I just had bad luck and something didnt trigger right, I missed a hint somewhere or something. It eventually went on, but on that point I already had the big submarine, the prawnsuit and everything. The story felt like I just need to run from A to B and back, there was no challenge anymore. \n [/spoiler]\n\nSo anyways. If you made it this far in the review, thanks for reading. If you disagree with me, thats totally fine for me. I don't want to ruin the game for anyone, maybe the points that bother me dont mean much to you.\nI know that my critique is pretty harsh. There are many positive aspects in this game. If you can really dive into this game and fully roleplay it, submerge in its story and ignore some flaws, this is a fantastic game.\nBut maybe some of you are like me, so some of my mentioned points could bother you too.\nThanks for reading, I hope I didnt butcher the English language too badly, feel free to comment, if you like.\n- Hi, I think there's been a mistake, when I open the programme it tells me that there's no game at all. Somehow, I still managed to find myself entertained for 4 hrs with beautiful graphics, intelligent puzzles and brilliant, soulful music.\nI'm only not asking for a refund because some mysterious voice requested me not to. (He sounded.. Russian)\nWould be happy if this could be fixed soon.\n- I hated Undertale.\n\nIt was, pretty clearly, a game about sexy skeletons. I did not care about sexy skeletons. I refused to play a game about sexy skeletons.\n\nThen my friend made me listen to the soundtrack, and I decided I could deal with a few hours of sexy skeletons if I got to listen to the best video game music I had ever heard while doing it. \n\nI played Undertale. It's not a game about sexy skeletons. It's a game about choices, maybe, or morality, or curiosity. It's a game about pushing the limits. It's a game about experiences, about \"what would happen if I did this?\", about storytelling so intricate and complex and raw that it shouldn't be able to fit into seven hours of bullet hell and pixel graphics. But, somehow, it does. Every choice you make has an impact. Every object you check has a story. The soundtrack, the witty yet profound writing, the simple pixel graphics, and even the menu screens and bullet patterns themselves all intertwine in order to tell a story that only you decide the ending of.\n\nAlso, the skeletons aren't even sexy.\n\nMy advice to you: Go in as blind as you can. Don't read walkthroughs. Don't watch playthroughs. Don't prepare yourself. Don't even look at overviews. Hell, don't even read the Steam page description. Just buy the game (and give some well-earned money to a little white dog), and, as it were, climb the mountain yourself. Don't let anyone backseat. Don't listen to people who tell you there's a right way to play.\n\nAnd when you think you've reached the end, just think--what other choices could you have made?\n\nSo, yes. I hated Undertale.\n\nAnd then I played it.\n- There's a lot to like about Control, and I'm glad I played it. It's unfortunate how often I found myself thinking, \"they shouldn't have bothered\". The environments and level design are quite good, and I liked poking around and finding lore. I can't avoid mentioning the destruction physics and graphics, which were beautiful, impressive, and made me feel like I was actually destroying the world around me. The story and characterization are decent, with par for the course voice acting for a video game. The game is a fine length with plenty of levels and missions. Overall, Control is a solid game that's worth trying.\n\nThe gunplay is another story. While levitating, dashing, launching, seizing, shielding, and the other combat powers you have at your disposal felt effective and even enjoyable at times (especially launch), the guns never felt right in any of their incarnations. The visual effects of the service weapons as they shapeshift are a nice touch, though many of them feel either inaccurate or unable to rise to the task, damage-wise. For magic guns they felt very much like something was missing, and could have used some more work. For a game with so much of its duration devoted to combat, it doesn't feel like gunplay got its fair share.\n\nWith such anemic gunplay, I was surprised to see a skill tree, crafting, and randomized mods complete with a rarity system. This is where \"they shouldn't have bothered\" comes in. The skill tree is utterly boring, being mostly +X% to a stat with the occasional ability upgrade that could have been a quest reward. With an expensive reset cost and the fact that you'll be able to nearly max out everything, the skill tree doesn't exactly play into buildcrafting. Then again, neither do the mods. \n\nWhen I say \"randomized mods\", I mean in the style of an MMO. Each mod has a random stat and then a random buff to that stat within a range, depending on its rarity. These things are everywhere, trip over a box and you'll find three. I feel that this system makes little sense for this game. Especially with the DLC mods, there are so many different effects that you'll find it difficult to create a specific \"build\" and will probably stick to the core stats like damage, hp, energy, etc. It's a thin veneer of progression that wouldn't be out of place in a multiplayer game, RPG, or MMO.\n\nSo say you want to engage with the mod system and flesh out a \"build\". Well, the jukebox has you covered. After you've farmed up or crafted some coins (tickets), you can pay to enter a repeatable mission and earn some random mods. This is the exact same mission every time you play it. It's not even changed procedurally or set in different areas of the game. It's the exact same level, the same objectives, the same enemies, the same boss, etc., every single time you play it. This mission is designed to be farmed. It's not the only farming you're encouraged to do, either. What's worse, as you play, your tiny inventory quickly fills up and you'll find yourself stopping after each mission (or in the middle of a mission) to do inventory management. Compare mods, equip mods, delete mods, farm mods, fill up your inventory... it's not an engaging system. They simply shouldn't have bothered.\n\nControl is at its best when it's being a single player game, with environments and worldbuilding that suck you in, with exploration and lore, and with the missions and duties of being the director. Control is at its worst when it thinks it's a multiplayer game, with boring skill trees, mods, crafting, and inventory management. It's so needless and mars what would otherwise be a perfectly serviceable game (save the service weapons).\n- Remember when you first played Thumper, and you were expecting a rhythm game but got so much more?\nOr when you played Thomas Was Alone, and you somehow fell in love with characters who were literally monochromatic rectangles?\nOr when you got to the final level of Journey, and you nearly cried of amazement at the emotional EXPLOSION AND RELEASE?\nAll those feelings? That is Sayonara Wild Hearts.\n- Overall its a great hunting game. The base game is good enough on its own to give you an enjoyable experience hunting several varieties of animals. \n\nI feel that some of the best content is in the DLC's. I dont mind the price tag for maps are they are just a large and some of them have a truly diverse animal population. \n\nThe Weapon Packs have some items that really should have been available in the base game (.22 rifle).\nTripod stands, Tents and ATV's are also DLC items that i feel should have been included in the base game. \n\nThe cost for these packs are not huge, and I have bought them, but they really do impact your play in a meaningful way so it is hard not feel like they were left out on purpose. \n\nBeing a former hunter in real life I would say that the realism of it is pretty good. Lung shots and heart shots drop animals quickly and using the right ammo along with good aim greatly influences this. A poor shot will leave you tracking this wounded animal across the map till you sneak up on it again or just give up. \n\nThey have a system called Tru Racks (sumthn like that) that simulates different qualities of animals. So you end up with little bucks, average bucks, and monster bucks. Weight and coloration plays a part in this too. In short every animal has a trophy of some kind and they are varied by what must be some sort of RNG. \n\nAll that having been said, this game can devolve into a shooting gallery were you kill everything on sight as there in no real incentive not to. You get money and experience for every kill you claim and wiping out a heard of deer with your DLC M1 Garand on your DLC Tripod Stand becomes the quickest way to bypass the grind.\n\n It feels like the game starts as a \"hunting sim\" and becomes a \"poaching sim\" once you realize the progression system is going to take a long time to do...\"ethically?\".\n\n\nAgain, this is a game i would recommend, but it is just that, a game. \n\n\n- 2023...\n\n2 years...\n\n2 Languages...\n\nEDIT:\n\nTLDR: Game is too simple, better get Factorio or Riftbreaker\n\n\nPlayed again after ~1 year, nothing has changed in the basic QoL or coding system.\n\n\n- It still uses an older builder system than Factorio did 10 years ago: you actually have to craft the base material manually every time before you can build the building, instead of it being done automatically by a simple click on the building in the build menu.\n\n- If you have crafting orders set, new items added to your inventory will not be read by the current crafting orders and keeps on produce stuff your already own...\n\n- Items don't have their own output for transport lines, but instead require this stupid additional output... (I think the developer couldn't create a better output than this simple one)\n\n\n20 minutes and that's enough for me for now, I'm not putting in any more effort for EA project\n- I shall start by saying that if you are deciding to buy this game then don't let the negative reviews sway you. In general, Fallout 4 is an amazing game and can be incredibly fun.\n\nPros: \n-Very immersive and will drain so many hours, days, weeks and months from your life.\n-Far Harbour, Automotron and (first half of) NukaWorld DLC have really good stories, quests and environments.\n-Mostly fluid combat system. Everything depends on how you want to play the game.\n\nCons: \n-WIll drain so much of your life away (might've forgotten my gf's birthday ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ )\n-Main story was incredibly lackluster compared to previous Fallout games\n-Giving you the option to be literally any kind of character you want to be....except you're always tied to being a parent.\n-a few repitive quests. (although gives you opportunities to approach these quests, areas and enemies differently\n\nAll in all, If you're a Fallout fan because of previous stories then you might not feel fulfilled playing this game, however if you love character creations, lore and immersive environments with untold stories then I completely recommend this game to you.\n- theres 2 options with this game, either you play the original without mods wich is still a very good game\nor you have the untitled goose, matt from wii sports, sans undertale, and barack obama fight on top of a mcdonalds\n\n10/10 game\n- We need a 60fps patch ASAP. Having 30fps content on PC in [current year] is not acceptable.\n\nOther than that the game is pretty solid! It looks great, it plays great, the story was good imo, the characters are interesting and the amount of solo content is decent.\n\nHowever, the gear system is not as elaborate as in Mk11 and the microtransations are NOT a welcome sight. Denuvo also has to go. If Harada agreed that the addition of Denuvo in Tekken 7 was a mistake, so should NetherRealm.\nI also don't like that 2 characters that are going to be in the Kombat Pass are already in the game (Ermac and Quan Chi). Just give us these characters and come up with other ones for the KP. This is super greedy and lazy.\nIt's even worse than Sektor and Cyrax in MK11, at least you didn't let us play them, period. this time you decide to not make them playable (even thought they work for the AI) AND sell them at a later date? That's awful.\n\nThe game is good but needs improvement and shouldn't ship with performance issues, 30fps content, microtransactions, Denuvo and greedy DLC tactics. I would put a \"meh\" review if I could because of the negatives but for that reason I have to say \"no\".\n- A dude looked at you funny? Punch him. Some guy is chilling by the river? Kick him in. A girl has a cute outfit on? Divekick her from across the street. Bought pizza at a food truck? Uppercut the staff. Violence is never the answer; It is in fact the question, and the answer is YES.\n- [h2] Visual Novel Reviews [/h2]\n\n[b] TLDR [/b] Two scenes, no customization, no choices, character development needs work, but the Extremely short story delivered (If you know what I mean) a whopping 38 minutes of game play for me. \n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [th]Question[/th]\n        [th]Answer[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Buy Again[/td]\n        [td]No, I wouldn't.

This is the second game that this developer has released, so I am not disappointed that I spent 5$ dollars on a game that they created, but I will say that I will think Long and Hard (No Pun Intended) before purchasing another game from this studio.\n- Yeah sooooo I went 1k words past the max...had to pare this down...it's ok...I'm mentally stable...\n\nCrossCode is a top-notch indie in its genre. I'd mention it in the same breath as Celeste, Hades, and Outer Wilds. (guess I just did.) If you can at least enjoy both puzzles and real-time combat, this game is for you; it's not as much of a JRPG as it might look. The only real flaw I care to levy is that it isn’t incredible out of the gate; it’s merely good, and gets much better. I was going to summarize my reactions and add a \"what is the premise/gameplay loop\" section and have longer sections but I had to cut it all out so have _/5 ratings on the section titles instead. It's fine. I'm fine. Everything is fine.\n\nOk, review time.\n\nSTORY 4/5 NEATO\n\nThe story is great, and not quite what you might expect. It starts pretty light and cozy, with solid (and often meta) humor interspersed with cryptic moments. I like how casually the in-universe MMO is treated by the players. I enjoyed all the characters, including our mostly-mute but personable Lea. Once it ramps up, the story takes some exciting turns, too; the devs really know how to do drama without doing overdrama. I didn't relate too much to the story but I think it was told quite well. I like the portrayal of the antagonists for the most part, though I wish I could have felt their presence more often. The lore is also fascinating, if occasionally hard to grasp because the line between real and virtual is very thin due to the game’s particular premise. (The difference between real people and NPCs is sometimes unclear, for instance.) The ending was good, but I think the DLC epilogue wraps the game up far better.\n\nCOMBAT 5/5 WOWIE\n\nWhen you start out, combat feels almost hack-n-slashy. You can spam melee attacks and bullets for days, but you also have a charged projectile, a dodge-dash, and a shield. The elemental modes are absolutely the highlight due to the way enemies work, and the sort of limiter gauge they have forces strategy. Special moves are stylish and borderline absurd at higher levels. A huge skill tree controls them and much more; unlike some skill trees, this one requires choices, which is always a good sign. Oh and consumables are your main source of healing and buffs, and they aren't overpowered! Balancing win.\n\nThe enemies are really what make the combat fantastic. Almost every enemy has at least one gimmick and one visible weakness. The stun gauge mechanic is vital to all battles, forcing you to exploit those weaknesses to stun enemies and give you time to use your extra-long special moves. Bosses love to give you iterative micro-puzzles to fill their stun gauges, while minibosses are comfortably in-between. Bosses commonly have armor or invulnerability when not stunned, forcing even overleveled players to figure out the micro-puzzles to hit hard. (More great balancing.) Most weaknesses involve the element system, eventually encouraging you to swap elements multiple times mid-fight. The micro-puzzles will build on what you’ve been learning in a dungeon if it’s a dungeon fight. I'll mention that some normal enemies do feel like damage sponges at first, but you'll get used to this; the simple enemy design in the early game makes it seem worse than it is imo.\n\nPUZZLES 5/5 FUN COOL\n\nFor puzzles you've got your common environmental \"platforming\" puzzles, your specialized quest puzzles, your dynamic mini-puzzles in battles, and your iterative puzzling gauntlets in dungeons. Also almost everything is secretly part puzzle? Like, everything. They're an invasive species. They draw most of their complexity from the element system too. Each element has its own effects on certain objects and structures, and mainly you use charge shots to interact, though each attack has its own uses. Not much to say here; they're great puzzles. A couple may stump you for a while, but that's impossible to avoid, and I think CrossCode strikes a perfect challenge balance.\n\nQUESTS 5/5 WHEEEEEE\n\nWhile some quests conform to the typical hunting/gathering quests of MMOs, most boast some entirely unique content. Challenges range from unique bosses to puzzles to platforming to other familiar gimmicks that are secretly also puzzles. I won't spoil them. Quests generally use mechanics you have seen already in new, often very different, scenarios. NPCs are mostly there to be amusing or set up the gameplay, and that didn't bother me tbh.\n\nITEM MANAGEMENT 5/5 AAAAA\n\nItem and equipment acquisition? Engaging? WTF? Technically you get them like you do in any RPG. But, rare plants have high rare item drop rates, so if you know the platforming puzzle to reach em you don't have to waste much time. Enemies' drop rates rise with a high Combat Rank, which you get by killing many enemies in a row before the post-fight cooldown period ends and you get to heal to full and level up. This is tough until you're very comfortable with the area. Once you are, it's a whole new way of battling, using area knowledge to string together sequential fights. And what does the game do but give you a piece of upgradable equipment that grants the Combat Rating bonus to plants too?\n\nI actually cared about the equipment in the game too! *kisses Life Fiber Uniform* (yes they really make this reference) Equipment also matters more than level so the devs can control your power level better. Most times you can buy some basic equipment to explore, then return with items to trade to NPCs for stronger gear. Stronger gear has unique traits and you might prefer one over another, so it's nice that with trading you get to focus your resources on what you want. Sometimes you can trade some enemy drops for other ones, as I recall, which is a nice...uh, trade-off to get to make.\n\nQUALITY OF LIFE 5/5 HELP\n\nCONVENIENCE REIGNS in CrossCode. Text log like in visual novels? Check. Encyclopedia of story recaps, character summaries, CrossWorlds lore & terminology, etc.? Check. Enemy index? Check. Item drop rates? Check. Available trades? You beck. This is EXTREMELY helpful for an RPG, which otherwise would require a guide or plain luck to find rare item drops. Oh yeah also there's UI? I forgot about it cuz it's really good. Also the keyboard controls for swapping elements are a bit janky but I managed.\n\nAesthetics 3/5-5/5 SUBJECTIVITY WOOOOOO\n\nYeah if ya like what you see in the trailers and screenshots, that oughta be enough. I thought the art was average-good in the beginning, but like everything else the art improves as you go. They must’ve gone back and worked on old stuff, but not too much. The music is great. No complaints there. My one objective critique is, Lea has no depth perception -- the art makes similar-height platforms look identical. I ran into so many walls and stared at so many small flat gaps I thought I couldn't cross. I'm not a fool! It's the game's fault! But actually this time!\n\nA NEW HOME DLC 6/5 WTF OMG\n\nThe paid DLC is The Culmination of CrossCode. The epilogue is complex and fascinating and rewarding. The dungeon is an incredible all-elements send-off. I adore the new quests. And the art?? The environments, the enemies, the NPC portraits are all so pretty. Don't be fooled by the letters \"DLC\": this is not Discretionary Leisure Content. If you liked the base game, this is...Deluxe...eLite...C-content??? look these are not great letters to work with ok\n\nCONCDLUDSIONO\n\nWhat else to say? CrossCode good. Buy it. Do the thing. Also, look out for Project Terra, Radical Fish's next project. It translates their current style into a 3D environment with dynamic lighting. It’s pretty & it reduces that height perspective issue. There isn’t much info about it out yet, but keep your eyes out! (figuratively pls) I'm excited for what they'll come up with.\n\nHOLY **** I MADE IT AND WITH CHARACTERS TO SPARE YESSSS — ohnowai\n- This is trash, I mean if you eat shit for breakfast I'm sure you'll like it.  You have to pay to have access to graphics better than the PS2's, also your stuff gets deleted every week. All there is to do is punch a couple zombies.  Don't get this game.\n- I have it on the Epic store but the amount of stuttering it has made it unplayable so I gave up. I got the Humble choice for $6 to get a steam key and try it on here because I have a few games on steam that run well but run poorly on other platforms like the awful Windows store or the below average Epic launcher, but it's unfortunately the same deal on here for this game. It has done it on two entirely different computer setups for me so that tells me that they didn't bother to spend enough time testing enough different pc setup combinations when it was in development, and my pc setup isn't rare by any means. The look and functioning of the UI and menu's shows that it is a obvious direct console port which would explain their lack of attention to the pc version.\n\nEven giving it a fair shot based on content, it's pretty much just a modified version of Borderlands 2. The amount of dialogue is unbearable. No one in the game EVER shuts up, and every single last word they say is cringe. It's like a kid in fifth grade who laughs at fart jokes wrote the entire script. In addition to everyone never shutting up, the main boss randomly has page-long speeches over the radio just to make sure you get the message that they want you to feel entirely uncomfortable at this game's bottomless amount of cringe.\n\nThe gameplay is identical to BL2, with the only real new noticeable features being that some guns have two functions that you can toggle on and off with the C key and of course the new playable characters. However even without the stuttering ruining the game for me, it's my opinion that BL3's negatives, mainly the insane amount of neverending dialogue and how unbelievably cringe it is, overshadow its positives.\n- It's a R@PE SIMULATOR. Games like this should not be played. I was tempted to play, and will do so for a few hours in future, may be a demon has possessed me...or may be I just don't waste my money that I have spent on it. But really, you should not encourage these games.

Im not sure why that guy put misinformation in the beginning of his review.\n\nIf you have 3 friends, only one of you needs to buy this and invite them through remote play and you will have a BLAST. First session we played 3 hours straight and laughed so hard we gave ourselves a headache.\n\nAlot of love went into making this game and a lot of hidden easter eggs nodding to other games. If you need something to play with your group of friends during quarantine, this is the game!\n- As i previously stated, i was going to play through metro fully and i have done so, so here is my update to this review. \nThis game is not the best selling triple A game in the world and it may have some bugs (like a table that wasnt solid or the objects in that room lol) however it is a decent game. the story is decent and the characters voices are way off but they sorta make up for it with their personalities. \n\nExploration in this game is by far one of the most interesting in my opinion and the way your character acts in the enviroment makes it more interesting aswell, for example wiping your visor when it gets dirty (wasnt that helpful for me in my play through but it was a nice touch) and your visor taking damage in combat adds to the immersive feel of this wasteland/paradise almost. Scavenging weapons and parts and combining them to make better equipment is quite intriguing and quick to do if you can find the parts. \n\nat the end of the day my final review of this is its a good game i would play it again even if it is a bit clunky sometimes (atleast it was for me lmao)\n\n\n\n\n\nOh and hopefully my punctuation is good enough so no one passes out this time lmao\n- Finished pillars of eternity 1 as a priest of berath, pledging my soul to the god of cycles, life and death. Promising to release the thousands of captured souls back to the wheel of reincarnation at the end of the game.\n\nStarted pillars of eternity 2, only to find out I was murdered after the events of the first game by a god who was believed to have been slain during the saints war. \n\nMy soul then comes face to face with the god I have devoted my life to, the god of life, death, and reincarnation.\n\nAfter a brief discussion about how I kept my promise at the end of the first game, my favoured god revealed to me he wants me to come back to life and serve him once again, and slay the being that killed me.\n\nI refused. It is only right that my soul is allowed to be reborn and return to the cycle, as I have worshipped this diety my whole life.\n\nMy god agreed. I was reborn as a wolf and the credits of Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire started to roll.\n\nPretty short game but 10/10\n- I'm gonna be talking about the game in very broad strokes so don't worry about spoilers. \n\nI'm bananas about the Dead Space series. The experience of playing the original in 2009 or so left a massive impression on me and I think this is overall a pretty fantastic update. I've played the original [strike] trilogy [/strike] duology to death on every system, listened to stuff, looked at stuff, everything. So as someone who has Nicole's monologue burnt into the back of my eyelids, I was pretty sceptical Motive would be able to win me over with Dead Space 23. I was very pleasantly surprised, though. It's clear a lot of love and care went into refining Dead Space for the remake and in many ways I find these refinements make the setting, characters, and mysteries all a lot more compelling. \n\nOn the lead up to release there was an IGN series of short interviews with developers, artists, writers, etc working on the remake. It was really fascinating hearing about how they were approaching different aspects of the project, there's a lot of interesting insights about the aesthetic and thematic goals of the game in there that get me really craving a Dead Space 23 art book. If you're sceptical about Dead Space 23, I think they're worth a watch. It's really striking how thoughtful they've been in creating their take on Dead Space and I don't think their efforts deserve to go so easily overlooked. If you're really interested in the artistry of the series I'd also highly recommend The Art of Dead Space, it's a great book and an amazing collection of art that really lays bare the core identity of the series. It's been a great companion piece to Dead Space 23.  I think a lot of people have been comparing the choices and artistic aims of the original team and the new devs in bad faith, I really can't see anything but reverence for the source material here. I'd also say that the differences that are there are interesting and well worth exploring!\n\nI'm also glad Dead Space has room to breathe again, EA really pushed the extended universe the first time around and I'm glad to see that mistake hasn't been repeated. I'm not someone who's super into lore, I like finding extra information that re-contextualises things in cool ways but this extended universe stuff can get pretty silly. There were animated movies, books, tie-in games, a Wii rail shooter (which I enjoyed) and most of it just served to undermine the setting and the horror for me. That isn't to say the remake shies away from its roots because it absolutely doesn't, there's an entire New Game+ path that I think incorporates a direct reference to one of the extended universe novels. If you're a lorehead you'll definitely recognise familiar names in text logs, even very forgettable characters get some mentions in. I really love this about the remake, it reincorporates a lot of this disparate stuff into more of a coherent whole. \n\nI think my favourite addition is the AI director that manages encounters and atmospheric effects. Dead Space is a game that invokes hypervigilance, I think that's part of what makes the series so compelling. You're always alert, always listening and watching, always looking over your shoulder. It has an intensity that I feel is absolutely unmatched. With the AI director in the mix that feeling is sharper than ever. You can't rely on memory alone to get you through now. Yeah, you can still memorise spawns and there are still an abundance of scripted encounters but you can never safely bet you know what's coming and when. Sometimes the lights will flicker and steam will hiss from the pipes- nothing. But sometimes a pregnant and most of a divider will be waiting for you right by the shop. You can truly never assume you're safe, that feeling is no longer illusory as it was in Dead Space 2008. I think that's great. I also found that the director would spawn interesting combinations of enemy types which is cool, it went a long way to making the threat more unpredictable. \n\nI never really experienced any of the performance issues everyone else is talking about so I think my main issue with the game is very petty. I flat out do not like the redesign of the Soldier rig. They look like those guys who're really into Mandalorian themed tactical gear and Punisher stuff. So, yeah, not sure if that's an intentional update to reflect reality but, aesthetically speaking, I found it very jarring. \n\nI think this is a very solid foundation to build on to bring back the Dead Space series. I hope in the future there might be more challenge modes, higher difficulties, more unlockable suits. Most of all though I hope Motive, like their predecessors, take some pointers from the Resident Evil games. I'm a big fan of the records system in the recent Resident Evil titles. It contributes enormously to replayability and it's neat getting to examine all the models, animations, concept art, all the good stuff. As someone who likes crafts and fan projects, something like that would be indispensable. it's all work that very much deserves to be admired, too. Some of the detail on the necromorphs is ludicrous. A records system would also be a great excuse to do wild runs like beating the game without healing or opening the shop. Just give me a reason, Motive.\n\nThere are thousands of things about this remake that I could just keep gushing about. Maybe I'll update this review over time and do just that (I have). But I hope for now this review has gone some way to convincing you to try out Dead Space. \n\nTanya Clarke killed it as Nicole, too.\n- Such a neat concept!  Clear the table under so many \"strokes\".  Where it really shines, however, is all of the surreal bits you can add into your game like giant balls, conveyor belts, or balls that split when hit.  The game always has many challenges to complete that will require you to use the indicated table/ball/modifier and meet its requirements on your run (like make 3 long shots in a single run or pot multiple balls in a single shot).  Complete enough of these challenges and you'll unlock the next feature, but the game gives you a lot of freedom in which modifers you'll use in your run to increase your odds of completing the given challenge.\n- Most of the negative reviews cover my complaints already. So I won't rehash the ones I've already read. \n\nHere's my biggest complaints: \n\n- Jumpscares have never been compelling to me. Doubly so on VR. Are you trying to injure me in my computer room? Stop. \n\n- Guns are fun. Not having ammo for them is not fun. (The game is pretty generous with ammo but it also encourages tediously conservative behavior, if you just unload clips at shit you'll run out pretty fast) \n\n- \"Continuous Turning\" feels so bad. Like, how can I turn my headset and everything looks smooth as butter, but as soon as I use the look stick for turning suddenly it's all choppy and looks wrong? I'm familiar with some of the motion sickness issues people get with turning in VR games, but this isn't that... \n\n\nThough honestly it seems like they just leaned really into the whole horror thing, which is fine, but also just super not my thing. \n\nIf the mechanics and some design choices had been better I might have slogged through it anyway. \n\n\nGame's beautiful, though, so they got that going for them.\n- This game vs. HOI3:\n---------------------\n\nAdvantages:\n\n1.) The production system is more interesting and engaging, and far more balanced than the old IC system of HOI3. \n2.) The unit creation system is far more in depth and interesting, featuring many different brigade types and support companies, allowing you to change your divisions however you would like. \n3.) This game is far more stable than HOI3.\n4.) This game is updated regularly and has bugfixes regularly too, with content being added free along with every DLC. \n5.) The modding community of HOI4 is far larger with excellent mods such as Kaiserreich, Millenium Dawn, Red World, and Endseig.\n6.) HOI4 muliplayer is actually playable without making you want to shoot yourself.\n7.) China is no longer something Japan can take within 2 months.\n8.) An actual peace conference system and ideologies that actually impact the game.\n9.) Far easier to get into than HOI3.\n10.) Less railroading and the AI wont spaz if you do something ahistorical.\n11.) Planes are no longer as cancer as they used to be.\n12.) Far less micromanagement if you choose not to want to micro.\n13.) A better tutorial (still not a great one though.)\n\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n1.) The research system is bare bones in comparison to HOI3.\n2.) The War in the Pacific is basically nonexistant and naval warfare is awful (to be improved with next patch, being released eventually:tm:)\n3.) People dont really join the war in HOI4 unless theyre directly attacked, making continents like South America completely useless due to the fact that none of the countries there ever do anything but still build up their military, contributing lag.\n4.) Due to the game's engine, it can only use a single one of your processing cores, meaning regardless of your computer quality the game will run kinda slowly.\n5.) Speaking of slowly, the game is poorly optimized and frame loss is extremely common, especially 1942 onwards, when majors can have upwards of 300+ divisions. \n6.) The AI is often braindead, doing hilariously incompetent things such as charging endlessly into your lines, removing all its troops from your front, leaving major areas completely undefended, and completely ignoring the aerial aspect of the war.\n7.) Specific AI are even more braindead than the rest, specifically island nations, or nations that otherwise need to use navies and airforces more. Yes, the Japanese, American, and British AI are some of the worst in the game. In a WW2 game. \n8.) Your allies are completely useless and often you will find yourself doing all the fighting yourself, or even being hindered by your own allies. Playing as Germany the Italians likely wont place a single division in North Africa. In D-Day, you will either be the only one contributing anything or your allies will contribute so much that the supply is ruined and your troops all die of attrition. As the USSR you will recieve 0 lend lease, and as China you will get absolutely no support from the west. \n9.) HOI3 is a lot cheaper than HOI4\n\n\nOther things which I feel are worth mentioning but arent really advantages or disadvantages:\n\n1.) HOI4 contains a lot more alt-history options, which while not for everyone, are fun to try out. \n2.) The focus-tree system is something completely different from anything in HOI3.\n3.) The game has a less in-depth OOB(Order of Battle), which while to some people is nice because theyre bad with OOB, others dislike. Specifically this game lacks corps. \n4.) The battle-planning system of HOI4, while easier to use than the one in HOI3, is still flawwed. In HOI3 it did absolutely nothing, but in this game it is a core part of playing. Unless you want to mircomanage every single division, like you did in HOI3, you will use this system. \n5.) While simpler, the game still possesses a learning curve.\n\n------------------------\n\nOverall: \n\nHOI4 is a far less grounded and historical experience than HOI3. Is this a good or bad thing? That depends on your perspective. HOI4 obviously has significant advantages over HOI3 in certain areas but many consider HOI3 to be an overall better game. Personally I recommend HOI3 if you want a more micro-intensive, historical experience, and HOI4 if you want to just sit back and relax for a couple hours murdering millions of people. \n\nPersonally I would suggest either game, but thats just me.\n- Refunded.\n\nFeels like they released the wrong game files - half the game seems to be broken or missing...\nBasic functions such as zooming in and out, no tutorial, huge amounts of buttons that don't have any impact. Good idea, terrible execution.\n- Only originally bought this to support the artist, since I'm a huge fan of his pixel art work. It's amazing, and there's a tonne of eye candy to fill your eyeballs with. However, I can't recommend this to everyone as after the first few hours it's become a bit of a chore.\n\n- The game is a \"clicker\" type with rpg/upgrade elements. It's too slow to play in the background/absent mindedly but not fast enough to keep your attention fully.\n- Each round/attempt at a boss takes way too goddamn long. \n- Barely any interaction with the world. You build tower defense style, and equip new items, but beyond that you don't have any special abilities, no \"oh shit\" once per loop power, no ability to target specific enemies, nothing. Just watch everything play out and hope your little guy doesn't get pulped.\n- Crafting/Supplying is sort of hidden away and if you don't know about dismantling you'll never grind out all the items you need to build new stuff.\n- Lore/Journal entries are hidden away and require resources to unlock using a little button on the bottom of the screen that's easy to miss. I only found it 20 hours in. The writing is cringey and obviously done by someone who probably enjoys Adam Sandler films.\n- The card system is a neat idea, but jesus christ there's too much garbage shuffling. Imagine playing MtG with a deck of 100 cards and 90 of them are lands, and everytime you get a new hand you reshuffle the whole deck so all you get is more lands. Oblivion (destroys a tile) rarely, if ever, pops up. \n- Character skills are kinda bad? You might get a good one every level (which again, takes forever) but half the time it'll be useless \"leave 10% of food/resources at camp\" when you're not doing a resource grind run.\n- So much trash equipment you have to sort through and breaks game flow.\n\nAnd the biggest \"don't recommend\" from me would be the issue with how combining tiles works. If you put two tiles beside each other they sometimes change the tiles to something else. Example - put a Vampire Mansion beside a Village and you get a town full of ghouls that after 3 loops around the map turns into an upgraded town. But you still get trash equipment from the quests it gives, and putting a Vampire Mansion beside any other type of town doesn't change that town at all. So there's no reason to experiment, and it really limits the gameplay. You'd think they'd focus on that aspect gameplay wise, especially with experimentation to get the most bonuses out of all your tiles... but no. There's a small list of things that interact with each other, and that's it.\n\nI still highly recommend it since the game is cheap, the art is amazing and the artist/indie devs should get support. But I think it's a good 2-3 major updates, expansions or fan modding away from getting really, really amazing.\n- This game is shit, and the devs should eat shit for shitting this shit on top of gamer community's head.\nCombat? You need a piano keyboard to dodgeparryhitlowhithighlowthendodge. Its a clusterfuck! Reaction time? None. I tried to dodge, I got damaged, Parry same story. And don't get me started on fucking archery! HELLOO ITS 2021, PUT A FUCKING CROSSHAIR so I can hit something !!\n\nWow, what a piece of shit. 18 hours of my life spent TRYING to make sense of this clusterfuck of a game. Pity I can't get a refund AND throw dung at this whitewashed game, like people did to Deuscht.\n\nI hope you devs sit on it and rotate.\n\n- Coming from Monster Hunter World, I didn't like it for the following reasons:\n\n- WAY more anime than World. I could overlook the weird anime stuff from World because it was more subtle, but in Rise it is so in your face at all times. Matter of taste, but for me it made the game insufferable\n\n- tiny maps. I know that this is a return to old-school maps, made for portable. But coming from World it seems like a massive downgrade\n\n- graphics and ambience downgraded. Again, I know that this is because it's designed for Switch, but it doesn't change the fact that it feels like a huge step backwards\n\n- grapple zip thing. It's flashy and fast, but I felt that it takes a lot away from the methodical feel of the game. Makes the game feel more arcade\n\nMost of my complaints are based on taste, but for anyone without much MH experience before World, it's going to feel like a step back.\n- You had me at creating adventure log, well actually no, at the starting song perhaps. How many years have I been waiting for full fledge, non portable DQ since DQVIII in PS2 ?\n\nThis PC port is a great one, neat and very beautiful. I was playing at 4k/~30fps and since my GPU is not fast enough I switched to 1440p/~50-60fps instead. I wish more and more JRPGs to do PC concurrent launch like this one. A day later I switched back to 4k and change internal resolution to 80% then it was pretty much perfect.\n\n- You can choose default A/B button.\n- You can choose resolution and 30/60 FPS mode. There is a way to unlock 60+ FPS for gaming monitors, google it.\n- You can invert cameras both ways.\n- You can choose classic battle mode.\n- You can press L3 and enjoy the view.\n- Load time is non-existence with SSD.\n- Ultra Widescreen is NOT supported. Waiting for mods at the moment.\n- Keyboard and Mouse is fine but playing with controller is wayy better.\n- Fully customisable keys / controllers.\n- Story synopsys at game loading screen.\n- Silent Protagonist.\n- Full voice cutscenes.\n- Auto-run button.\n- You can jump.\n- Pros \nReally good voice ending.\nCreepy and you are unsure of everything which makes this more interesting.\nDecent story\n\nCons\nEnding just fucks up everything.\n\n\n\"I don't want Pewdiepie making money off my game.\" Im sure you made more money off Pewdiepie for advertising this shi*ty game lol.\n- (This is a spoilerfree Review)\nI recommend not to search any character or even the name of the game to avoid spoilers.\n\nBasic:\nDanganronpa Trigger Happy Havoc is a murder-mystery game with a focus on deep Story.\nThere are 3 main games and 1 spin-off game. This is the First one to start with.\nYou can expect about 40 to 50 hours in this game (depending on how fast you can read and think)\nI recommend reading all dialogue and not skipping any cutscenes.\nThe overall gameplay is simple and hard at the same time, but I bet everybody could play it.\n\nStory: (Spoilerfree/no spoiler)\nThe game is about a bunch of Students who were being dragged into a Killing Game.\nThe only way to escape is by killing another Student and getting away with it.\nYou'll learn more about it while playing, there are a bunch of unsolved questions in the beginning.\n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay is mostly divided into 2 different Parts: typical visual novel gameplay\n(freetime use and social interaction) and the Class Trials. In these class trials\nyou have to solve some Minigames but mostly try to discover the Murderer (or imposter if you played Among us).\nThe class trials are definitely the best Part of the game and you can be hyped about each of them.\nBefore each class trial you have to do some Investigation about the Murder and during that time you can\ntheorize who it was and how they've done it.\n\nCharacters:\nThe characters in this Game are as different as they can be. I bet you'll have different favourite ones.\nAll I can say is that you'll learn to love each and everyone on their own way.\n\nBuy Recommendation:\nDo I recommend everybody to buy this Game? No. If you are getting bored because you mostly \nonly play Shooters and MOBA's, I dont think you will enjoy this Game even if I did. But to everybody else\nwho enjoys mystery games like Ace Attorney or even mystery/detective shows I highly recommend buying this game\nand try it out. You'll enjoy it!\n\nAs I said try to avoid any spoilers. So dont look in the Steam Workshops etc.\nThank you for reading!\n- EDIT: I nominated this game for game of the year (2023)\n\nLong ago I had heard about this game and how detailed and intricate it could be, and how you could spend hours upon hours building the massive empire of dwarves only for it to all come crashing down in some spectacular but unforeseen way.  Then I got into Rimworld briefly and thought it was ok, but it tended toward chaos a bit too much for my liking.  THEN I heard this game was coming to steam and I eagerly awaited it.\n\nIt's not necessarily that I was too good to play a game with mostly ascii/character graphics (I used to play them a lot back in the 1980s).  I was more intimidated by the depth of the game and not knowing if there was a wiki for it (there is) or how I'd find help if I needed it (I'm sure there's a ton of communities JUST for this game).  I expected that when it came to Steam, it'd be beefed up and worth the wait.\n\nWell it finally arrived and I think I'm STILL a bit intimidated by the sheer amount of options you have... mostly because it's not just me that I have to worry about, but a whole community of dwarves.  In the case of something like minecraft, I could dig a whole intricate tunnel and if stuff starts to go bad, I just high-tail it out of there and recover until I can go back and finish it.  In Dwarf Fortress though, if stuff starts to go bad, you can't just leave.  You are encouraged to deal with the adversity and push onward in the name of greatness... or something.\n\nIn a way it's like role playing, except you don't have to roll character sheets and you don't really control any of the characters directly.  You make decisions about where to mine, what trees to chop down, what to build, what to trade, what to plant, and for every thing there is a season (turn turn turn).  You're forced to deal with death, birth, attacks, sickness, madness, and a ton of other things that I have no idea are coming.  \n\nI keep thinking \"I could do better\" and I start a new game, but then I start to realize that no matter what I do, I'm never gonna have a perfect game, or a game where everything goes exactly according to plan.  I am eventually going to have to buckle down and stick to one game save to see it through.\n\nIf you're like me and starting something new holds a lot more interest than continuing an existing project (ADHD?) you may have difficulty with this game.  At the same time you may become so engrossed in it that you lose track of time and suddenly it's 6am and you wonder why you stayed up all night digging holes.  I'm starting to feel a bit of the madness myself.  (it's almost 4:30am as I write this)\n\nIn any case, it's probably not for everyone, but I'd say if you're unsure, find the non-steam version and try that, and if you can grok what's going on and it interests you, definitely buy this and support the developers... OR buy this and try to stay under the 2 hour refund  limit while you learn the basics (Good luck with that, it'll be 6 hours before you know what happened).  I believe this game is worth the money though (full price).  If you were going to wait for a sale you'd be waiting a long time anyway.  \n\nTL;DR If this looks interesting to you, don't wait! Buy now.  If you aren't sure, do a bit of research and come back and buy it.\n- The classic just keeps getting better year after year.\n\nFor those new to the series, this is strictly a management sim.  No action aside from the outstanding baseball extravaganza your imagination cooks up from the play-by-play (if you so choose). (EDIT! There IS action now!  There is a 3D mode to put a little bit of animation to your imagination)  Guide your team over decades as a GM, manage your team pitch-by-pitch, or do both.  It's entirely up to you. \n\nIf you're like me and in every baseball game you've ever played you've found yourself saying \"but wouldn't it be great if it had (X) in it?\"  Well this is your dream game.  Whatever your X was, every time, since Triple Play Baseball on NES, this game has it.  And more.  It has literally everything in it that baseball has in it.  It is an outstanding work and is infinitely enjoyable for a baseball fan.  The only negative I can think of is that I imagine the learning curve is fairly steep (although I've been playing the series for 11 years now so I forget how it was to pick up).  \n\nA must have for any baseball fan.  10/10 (year, after year, after year)\n- Upon further play, the game wasn't super luck based, it just doesn't do a great job explaining core mechanics that are crucial to gameplay. It has a more hands off, let the player discover how this works type of playstyle, but a simple line of dialogue alluding to these features would have been nice. That said, the story is really gripping, the gameplay (once learned) is fun, and overall, I definitely think it's worth $20.\n- The fact that this VN used to be the highest rated game that hasn't been released outside Japan until, well, it was released outside Japan says it all. A must-buy position for every VN enthusiast and an insteresting position for any other player. Criminally underplayed (~55% of purchased copies haven't been started yet), true hidden gem. Consider buying it when on sale.\n- Do you like baseball?\n\nI didn't. I really didn't. I liked a lot of different sports but I always thought baseball was boring, archaic and more an excuse to sit outside, drink beer and gawk at the occasional on-field event.\n\nBut then, for whatever reason -- I didn't have much else going on -- I started to watch baseball, because it was always on, pretty much every day, and it started to wrap itself around my brain in a pleasing way. Baseball is low-intensity matched with extreme peaks and valleys of emotion. \n\nMore importantly -- Baseball is a long continuous set of calculations based on the manipulation of variables in series after series of problems. Every at-bat, every pitch, every inning, every game is a test of odds and outcomes based on the pitcher, the batter, the fielders, the field, the weather, past results obscuring present values... Baseball is a worthwhile flux.\n\nSo - OOTP 17. This is the most advanced and ridiculously satisfying way to run your own personal baseball simulations. So maybe I should rephrase - Do you like Baseball as a concept? Because you will love OOTP.\n\n(Also this year they added little moving pawns to the broadcast view, so it's starting to get satisfyingly similar to half-watching an actual baseball game.)\n\nFor those already owning OOTP 16 and mulling an upgrade I would say - the engine runs much faster this year on x64, some under the hood stuff has been nicely tweaked, bells and whistles (the pawns) aren't nothing, and of course, I feel pretty good about supporting this developer, given their track record.\n- You probably have to be a dedicated wargamer to remember Fields of Glory, a turn-based strategy series that covered almost every era of ancient warfare. The historical scope was deep and wide, but the rules and features were shallow and anorexic... just saying. The game needed an overhaul. The graphics needed a facelift, and the gameplay and ruleset needed growth hormones. This game addresses those issues definitively.\n\nIt was a matter of bringing the game over to the Battle Academy engine, Which in my opinion is one of the most robust tbs platforms out there. It handles WW2 games, fantasy games like Hell, Sci-Fi with Sanctus Reach, and historical wargames Pike and Shot and Sengoku Jidai. I'm assuming that, like the old FoG, this game will eventually have a slew of historical skins DLC. Everything will be overpriced and never go on sale, but if you're a fan of any of the games above like me, you'll bite the hook... like me.\n\nThe mechanics and rules of the game work almost the exact same way as Pike and Shot and Sengoku Jidai, not the old FoG. It's lazy but it works. If you've played either, you won't need the tutorial. You'd also recognize the soft pastel, almost cartoony maps. The game looks much better than previous games. The rigid, boxey blob models are gone, replaced by units that shuffle nervously, taunt their foes, and continue swinging at each other in between turns. It's a Slitherine tbs that actually feels alive and breathing.    \n\nIt's a straight up, left-click only tbs. You'll have a command unit with a command range, units outside of which will suffer a penalty. Units have zones of control. Once engaged in melee, units won't disengage, but will continue fighting each turn until one breaks. Victorious units may compulsively pursue routed foes, even disappearing off the map, never to be seen again...Units gain advantages and suffer penalties based on terrain and morale. Units get buffs for adjacent allies, and penalties if those allies are routed. There are bonuses for flanking, charging, and fighting on the high ground. There is no experience gain, no upgrades or leveling, and no rpg elements.\n\nAll the elements you'd expect from a good tbs are here, implemented in an approachable, almost casual way that you can enjoy without having to put down your drink or jazz cigarette. Turn based tacticians should approve. 8/10\n- \nWell, after almost a year of not playing this game, I must say, the devs did fix most of my issues. *Most*. Creative mode is fun, but you still need to collect stuff to make things, which is incredibly tedious. On top of that, the character dialogue is still really annoying and you need a NASA computer to play at a stable framerate, but hey, you can actually play without getting your ass beat. I'd like to up my ranking to an 8/10. Very fun, but I highly recommend playing with others. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOG REVIEW (outdated):\nThis game has potential, but unfortunately having fun with it is impossible if you aren't a hardcore survivalist.\n\nCritical Issue #1:\nThe main characters won't stop talking. Everytime you eat or hold the torch they say an unfunny one-liner that makes me want to gouge my eyes out with forks. Even Robin Ayou from Subnautica: Below Zero talked less, and the original game had a silent protaganist. Having characters that have constant dialogue that always repeats is just so annoying to the point where I had to turn off the volume. If the main characters were silent but atleast talked with each other, then I could see potential in that. But they just talk and talk and talk and none of it means anything.\n\nCritical Issue #2:\nThe enemies are way too hard to battle. To make better gear, you need to take on enemies that are so difficult to battle. Maybe you could say I'm just not good at battling enemies in survival games, but I was able to easily battle monsters in Terraria, Minecraft, Subnautica and Raft just fine. When your in-game monsters are too hard to defeat without gear that requires you to battle even MORE monsters, it is not fun, repetitive, and frustrating.\n\nCritical Issue #3:\nThe story is in the background. The fact that the story doesn't impact the game as much as it should is probably the worst aspect of any piece of media out there. The game sends you an a goose chase to find the  main story and it is infuriating. The story itself is all over the place. First it just seems like you need to make yourself grow bigger, but then it goes completely off the rails and into this scientist bunker with a robot that gives you quests, but you can ignore him and continue playing. I don't know if they finished the story, but so far it is not good.\n\nSomewhat Critical Issue:\nThere is no setting to dial back the graphics without lowering the resolution to look like Terraria. I can't see, and it is dumb and brings the whole beautiful vibe of being small down, ironically.\n\nMinor Issues:\nThe music is bland, and although I love electronic/synth music, this is just not it. The fact that you can't have bugs as pets or mounts, or even herd them is extremely upsetting. The farming sucks ass, it gives you 4 items of what you grew every 2 in-game days, when you can just find that item in more abundance at the place where it is located. Under the pond... JESUS CHRIST, the graphics are so bad. The wavy filter looks so bad, and you can see the entire underwater area crystal f**king clear, even though other smaller bodies of water have some kind of murkiness to it. Minor issues like this hold back the game.\n\nAlthough this is still in early access, it feels as if they wasted a lot of potential already. For such a unique world and concept, it never really exploits the amazing and obvious things that it can accomplish. Why not grow your own personal army of ants? Oh sorry, you can pick up eggs but they hatch and they aren't friendly. Why not create a raft made of weed stems and lilypads? Oh sorry, you can just build a base that looks like a boat. Although there are much worse steam games out there, and ones that I have hated more than this, this was sort of a slap to the face. It's not god-awful, and there are a lot of good things about it like the cartoony bug designs and the beautiful graphics, but honestly, it's a 6/10 bordering on a 7, and although many others have enjoyed this, being the super critical demogorgon that I am, this didn't exactly \"ground\" me.\n- I cannot help myself but to notice that this game has a failed Kickstarter campaign behind - which is why I was especially surprised and happy at the same time to find out it has been released no matter the odds. \n\nTo keep it short and simple: \"Think outside of the box\" is this game's motto. And it actually gives you an ability to rotate this box. \nCreator put a lot of effort in it. To say that this game is \"short\" is something I cannot do. While it is somewhere around 5 hours long - all those hours are filled to the brim with creativity, surprises, charming voice-over; it does not get repetitive and neither it gets overcomplicated. It is a great mix of involvement through thinking and relaxation. \n\nDefinitely worth it's money.\n- As much as I was hyped for a different twist on farming sims, this just falls flat. The whole generation system [i]sounds[/i] good on paper but is just unused. You would almost be more hard pressed to actually age enough to need a second generation than not. Sure you can just opt in to moving along, but I just feel wrong killing off my character like that. As such the whole selling point is just, not a part of the game unless you really seek it out. \n\nSo this just leaves the normal farming sim aspects. Which uh... dont work too well either in my opinion. This game is focused less on skill, leveling, or tool quality despite having far more rpg aspects than most other games of this type. You have entire stat systems behind each charecter, buffs, multiple tool levels and materials. Yet none of it is used. What is used is weird cryptic proverbs that dictate item quality. \n\nWhat I mean is, did you catch that fish normally? Just walking along the river and thought to cast your line? Shame. Dont you know trout can only be caught well on the fourth day of the spring during rain while accompanied by a pet and under the influence of a charm buff? Im not exaggerating too much here either. Crops, fish, fruits, plants, and ore all have up to [b]four[/b] requirements. One per star. Some can be easy, like be skilled in said action, fishing/harvesting etc. But most will be odd things like harvest on the sixth day. Only fish during these hours. Be under a certain buff. Have a certain animal following you. Its all just... odd. \n\nWhats worse is its punishing. You want to just, idk, play the game your way? You want to enjoy this sandbox game at your leisure? Well I hope you are ready to be punished for it. You have to either memorise each and every requirement for hundreds of items. Or, just have a wiki page open at all times. Which just takes away the fun. Cant go fishing today, its not foggy. Cant harvest your grown crops right now, its not druida day. This game has you jumping through hoops, playing on [i]its[/i] time rather than your own. Its a relaxing farming sim, but played like an accountant looking at spreadsheets. \n\nIn essence, if you enjoy micromanaging each moment of your day down to the minute detail, go for it. You will love this game. But if you are looking for a laid back, head empty sim game, look anywhere else. This game will open palm slap you for wanting to play it laid back and to your own beat. I just feel this [u]FARMING SIM[/u] is not at all tailored for the crowd of people who play farming sims.\n- I hated this game.\n\nHowever, it is undeniably brilliant. To try and explain how it is brilliant would cheapen the experience. I would put this game in the same category as The Stanley Parable, The Beginner's Guide, Dear Esther, and everything Freebird Games ever created. These are games that should be experienced by everyone.\n\nI was gifted this by my wonderful husband. I'm sure he meant well because he knows I like horror games. I'm going to choose to believe that anyway. What followed was five hours of paranoia, frustration, and more of a feeling that the game was playing me.\n\nThanks honey.\n- Really grimy visceral horror game, Puppet Combo always scares me even as a life long genre fan. SOOTH is very challenging, but also very rewarding. Love the retro aesthetic and uncompromising brutal demeanor of it all, massive respect to the developer. This gameplay style isn't my favorite, took me a few attempts to get through Nun Massacre, I prefer The Glass Staircase/Murderhouse ect. But SOOTH is well executed enough that I was able to get into it. I did encounter some pretty gamebreaking bugs but reloading saves/brute force I was able to get past them. A lot of jank in this game could definitely use some more polish. Jumping into the vent on the lower bunker level was insanely annoying. It's not perfect but honestly I wouldn't want it to be that's part of the charm. Just the amount of mental/emotional strain the player goes through during a Puppet Combo game is hilarious I love it lol. The puzzles are also a huge improvement over previous titles. The ending I got was extremely macabre this game doesn't mess around. Overall I'm glad I waited for the full release and plan on trying some more endings. Horror fans if you don't know these guys yet this is a good one to start with. 8.5/10\n- You will enjoy the game at the beginning, it's fun and entertaining...Until you start playing the harder and larger hospitals and you get plagued with bad pathing issues, bad AI, people getting stuck in rooms, people dieing but they idle in a death state and stay around forever and all kinds of glitches which kills the enjoyment and ruins the management aspects. I've had to stop playing this game until they patch it because right now you're just managing bugs and glitches and you will have to design hospitals to get around these bugs, so that means extra wide corridors and spacing items out so people don't get stuck. Which sucks.\n\nNeeded much more playtesting before being released.\n\n*This is from v1.01.*\n- Ignore all the copers who think because they beat Celeste they're a platforming master. This game is a rage precision platformer, it's supposed to be hard, but the best part is that it doesn't even have to be. That's why there is AN OPTION TO SET THE DIFFICULTY IN THE SETTINGS, and if you somehow are too proud to just tone it down a bit to get a better experience and instead decide to blame the game and its developer, then why are you even playing video games in the first place. They're supposed to be fun. This game can be a rage platformer, but it can also be a casual one. It depends on what you want.Will you snail has a great soundtrack, great level design, and super interesting story and lore. Is the game too hard? Change the difficulty. Do you not care about the story? Ignore the optional dialogue. It's that easy. This game is really really good, and don't let anyone convince you otherwise, especially people who can't deal with the fact that the rage game is hard\n- The British Forces give the Allies a bit of the German defensive capacities. It has the problem of adding too many buildings to a game that is, in its core, dynamic and based on movement and aggressiveness instead of turtling. The British units are diverse and interesting, bringing much to the table. \n\nThe DLC lacks a proper campaign for the Brits, unfortunately, even though Caen, Goodwood, Arnhem and Walcheren could have been done in some interesting missions. But, for a game focused on multiplayer, the Tommies are obligatory in everybody's library.\n- I backed this game back at the end of September 2013 and have finally played it through to completion. \n\nCandle is a beautifully unique game which takes elements from puzzle, platforming and point and click adventures. The puzzles, although sometimes frustratingly difficult, are all different and use different mechanics keeping the game engaging and fresh. Teku's Candle is such a interesting game mechanic that I really enjoyed getting to know and learn. As previously said, the game looks and sounds absolutely stunning. I don't think I have seen a game that looks this good before and that is attritubuted to every character and scene being hand drawn. Controls can be a bit finicky but not game breaking and you can easily adjust too. I would recommend getting this game because it provides a great whole experience.\n- I would describe this game as a 'befriending sim' with a very shallow veneer of farming/resource gathering/'witchy' activities. The farming/mining/fishing is nowhere near as fun or sophisticated as other games e.g. Stardew Valley. And there are no customisation options - even very shallow ones - to make the game experience your own, e.g. the layout of your farm and buildings can't be changed or decorated, there's no home decoration, no character customisation or clothing options. So the game feels very linear and daily tasks are repetitive and grind-y. There's also a dearth of special/seasonal occasions which adds to the repetition.\n\nAnd even though this game majors on the social/befriending angle, which is largely ok, it still doesn't feel quite right. You can get to be 'good friends' with a character and they still repeat dialogue asking if you've met their family members (of course you have) and/or your character asks them really basic getting-to-know-you type questions that previous cutscenes have already answered. The voice acting is great though.\n\nI think this game would have been a lot better had it been done as an all-out graphic novel/choices matter game, and dropped the farming etc. As it is, it's a jack of all trades and master of none.\n- Buy if you want an average sandbox game. Don't buy for the mediocre story, boss battles or repetitive missions.\n\n\nMGO: I want to like it, but it has so many problems.\n\n-until recently had no push-to-talk\n-peer-to-peer connections meaning lag depending on the host, and being sent back to lobby if the host leaves. CQC also will lag where you will grapple back and forth.\n-no text chat\netc.\n- This is a poor excuse for a Korean mobile port in a long line of them with the lack of sound, spelling errors, bad translations, ugly UI, log-in issues and so much more and it has P2E crypto/NFT garbage and P2W.\n\nNot even the small number of upskirts and jiggly boobs can save this one.\n- To be completely honest, throughout my entire playthrough, I was thinking on giving this game a \"Not Recommended\" but it really wouldn't have deserved it. This game is at the same time both very difficult to recommend as to not recommend. It is really a beatiful and extremely original game, with a pretty well told interesting story. However, the problem it has is that it doesn't really work as a puzzle game. Puzzle solutions don't make logical sense most of the time and you end up brute forcing your way through most of the game. This means trying every posibility until something works and moves the story foward, and this is just not good puzzle design. This also distracts you from the story being told, which is in itself not so easy to understand, it requirers you to be paying attention to details, so your brain has to be constantly switching between \"puzzle mode\" and \"story mode\". Anyway, you can tell a lot of love was put into this game, and that is why I ultimately recommend it.\n7.5/10-\n- Is Duskers a fun game? Yes. Would I recommend it? No, because of one simple reason:\n\nA lack of content with no mod support.\n\nDuskers is a little like No Man's Sky in the sense that the first few hours are filled with fun and wonder, but everything afterwards becomes a disappointment because the game turns out to be far more shallow than it initially seemed. As a player, I yearned to explore more of the randomly generated galaxy in Duskers because I wanted to see what other horrors, mods, and derelict types I would encounter in the empty universe - but in the end, it turned out that there was really very little else to see besides what you find in the first couple of hours. \n\nHere's a quick rundown of where the content was most lacking:\n\n--Enemy types: there's only 4 different enemies. FOUR. They also behave pretty much identically with the exception of the last one.  This was definitely the biggest interest-killer for me. \n\n--Derelict types end up mattering very little. Government A? Salvage C? Military B? It really doesn't change the layout in a particularly noticeable fashion, with the only differences being 1-2 extra ship defense turrets or something like that. \n\nI really, really wanted to give Duskers a thumbs up - I loved the aesthetic, I loved the atmosphere, and I loved the unique command line interface - but unfortunately, after a few hours, I came to realize that there's really just not enough actual content here, and that's heartbreaking for fans of this niche genre like myself.\n\n\n- Honestly I don't think I've ever cried so much over one game.  This is definitely one of the best narrative driven RPG maker games ever made - it has everything you could want.  It has beautiful art, beautiful music, wonderful narration, it's atmospheric, great characters, meaningful choices, a story of overcoming hardships similar to a real life instead of just a story, and the ending I got was beautiful! I have only played the game once but the game has a lot of different branching paths with choices really making a large difference in the game.  This game will always have a special place in my heart.\n- [H1] GUIDE TO THE PURCHASE OPTIONS [/H1]\nso heres how you can tell the difference between what your buying, because you don't wanna be like me, who often bought packs that did the same thing. \n\nHitman 3 standard edition - Just Hitman 3, so no Hitman 2 or 1. You get access to the newly added levels, as well as elusive targets and most of the escalations. This does not give you access to the 7 deadly sins levels.\n\nHitman 3 Deluxe edition - a bit scammy, not quite worth the money, but it comes with some music, 3 new skins and a couple of extra escalations. This won't give you any new levels. This does not give you access to the 7 deadly sins levels.\n\nHitman trilogy - Comes with nearly everything. If you want to buy hitman and access most of the levels, this is the one to go for. I believe the only things you do not get access to are the sniper edition levels, the patient zero campaign, the deluxe stuff, the 7 deadly sins levels and any extra skins. This is like the core of the game without any extra things.\n\nHitman trilogy premium add-ons - literally just hitman trilogy except it includes the features that aren't in hitman trilogy. You have to own the original Hitman trilogy in order to buy this one. The only thing it doesn't include is the 7 deadly sins. If you are stupid and can't comprehend what I just said; it doesn't include the base levels. Only the extra stuff\n\nHitman - 7 deadly sins pack - the new 7 deadly sins pack. It includes the 7 new levels that are a bit simular to escalations. Basically, there are still 3 stages in each sin, (they are sorted as targets, so every time you eliminate a target, its like a checkpoint. So you can really count it as just 1 stage with 3 targets.)  Its basically escalations but with a lot of effort put into them.\n\nHitman 3 access passes - these are basically dlc's that were put in hitman 2 and 1. If you already own these, you should automatically gain access to them during the carryover. There is one called 'hitman 3 access pass: hitman 2 gold', this basically means 'if you are new to the hitman trilogy, you can have access to the dlc in hitman 2 here'. \n\n\nhere are what the access passes do:\n\nHitman 2 gold edition - it gives you access to all hitman 2 levels, which is why its so expensive. It comes with all levels, including the sniper editions, the expansion pack (2 places, Maldives and New York) as well as some extra skins. Its pretty big if you ask me\n\nHitman 2 standard - gives you access to standard hitman 2 locations. This is basically the gold edition but without sniper edition, the expansion pack or extra skins. It gives you access to the base levels. Which is miami, columbia, mumbai, whittleton creek and the isle of sgail\n\nHitman 1 GOTY edition - gives you access to every level from hitman 1 but without campaigns\n\nHitman 1 GOTY upgrade - gives access to the hitman 1 campaigns, does not include the base levels.\n\n\nMost of these packs are worth the money. But most of them are on sale quite often. So if you think some of them aren't worth the money, you can always wait a month or two and get a massive sale on it.\n\nthank me later\n\n- The demo was a lot of fun and the early access launch game which is more of that  was a lot of fun big surprise!\n\nOverall I would really recommend this game if you loved or enjoyed games like Warstride Challenges, Neon White, Speedrunners From Hell and other games with a focus on very short concise levels that are made for speedrunning. I will say while it looks off in the trailers the gun controls pretty nicely in the game no complaints there for me with this style of game. \n\n\nWhat I liked\n\n-controls feel great and very fast, you always feel in control and everything including enemies are very visible and have extra outline to help highlight them when in hectic combat\n\n- most levels are just the right length to not feel like you complete them before you even start them but not tedious to retry to get a better ranking\n\n-much improved optimization and performance wise from the demo, even on my laptop not really made for gaming got a easy 100 fps if I put all settings on low\n\n-Ranking system is pretty cool, you get extra points if you kill enemies, head shot them for critical damage, if you never get hit etc and more and of course ranked on time. There is a separate ranking for total points so say for killing a lot of enemies and in a row and then a separate ranking just for times for levels\n\n- Enemy A.I seems improved form the demo and they try to roll out of the way of gunfire or go behind kinda cover from the environments at times.This isn't a big thing since your flying through levels super fast anyway but nice to see\n\n-Decent number of standard guns and they are fun to use without trivializing using telekinesis and vice versa\n\n-Some stages focus on a large arena to fight waves of enemies and others don't so feels like game has decent level variety/variety in obstacles in levels\n\n-okay variety of enemies to fight so far\n\n-kinda humorous the odd time and there are stupid items to pick up with telekinesis and use like a live rat, a toy hammer, giant tennis ball etc.\n\n- telekinesis feels very seamless fast and fun/easy to use in combat, chucking random objects at enemies its a lot of fun\n\n- most levels are open enough to allow multiple paths to get through levels and you can usually skip fighting some enemies if you want to only go for a faster time in most levels \n\n\n\nSome Suggestions/Issues I had\n\n-maybe I missed it but no instant retry button if I want to retry a level instantly but haven't died\n\n-boss difficulty kinda feels a bit all over the place although there is not much boss fights, first boss feels way too easy, second one was fun and maybe just right although maybe on the side of   too easy from not having enough health \n\n-the second last level in this launch early access version \"\"\"\"\"stealth\"\"\"\"\"\" feels far too long and far too hard and full of way too much elite enemies and then it even has a boss fight to do in it too in the level all in one go without ever stop moving! \n\n-just a note when I played the demo version before the last boss fight in that felt like it should have either been a level with just the enemies and then a second separate level with a arena for the  boss fight not both that you have to do in the one attempt in a bigger level just kinda tedious imo\n\n-music isn't bad here but it feels like there is very little music and the music that is there kinda blends together a lot\n\n-hopefully this game can develop a big following community and maybe get a level editor down the line!\n\n-feels like you go in the 2 second slow motion mode when getting a critical hit on a  enemy or breaking glass a good bit too much in levels.\n\n- would be nice down the line to get bonus challenge levels, shorter much more difficult ones like how NeonWhite and War stride Challenges have bonus levels \n\n- for replay value might be nice to have 3 unique goals for a level e.g beat the level in under 40 seconds, only kill a certain number of enemies, kill no enemies etc.This is kinda in the game but levels don't seem to have specific or unique extra goals its the same ones for every level.\n\n- not a complaint but maybe later add a grapple hook, grapple hooks are always fun in first person shooters!\n- I knew Journey is a great game,maybe one of the best video games in history,but...\n\nI didn't know why so many people moved by such a simple gameplay.\nI didn't know why people had a Journey-Fever,even players just bought PS3 only for this game.\nI didn't know how close a relationship could be in 100mins only.\nI didn't know how bad i wished to go back to the peak and stay with my friend i'll never meet again.\n\nNow I Know.\n\n“It is better to walk with a friend in the dark than alone in the light” – Helen Keller\n\nIt was an interesting experience for me, I had never played this game nor heard of it until recently. I went and looked at the store page, My Brother/Friend Ethan-Winters Just Told Me this game in the steam store now, so went ahead and bought it. After buying it, went and started up the game some day later. Went into the game, saw another model character that looks like mine, I thought it was an AI because I had thought it was a single player game. So I decided to play along with it, we went through the story, it progressed quite fast, mainly because we both did not really bother to check out other things. The more I played, the more I realized that the guy I was playing with was most definitely not an AI, it was a genuine player. As we went through the story, our cooperation got smoother, we no longer have a solo player attitude, we would signal to each other, wait for each other and walked, fly with each other. It was smoothing, relaxing, a truly unique experience. Even with the setbacks we had throughout our progression, we never gave up, we stuck together from the desert till the end, when one of us screwed up, we patiently waited for the other, chiming to the person where we are. I remember at the end, when i screwed up a jump and did not see the other player, I was genuinely scared, sad, I frantically searched for the person but to no avail. I was distraught, sad and disappointed but I continued onward. When I went up, there he was, chiming for me, assuring me that he had not left yet. I felt happy, comforted when I saw the person waiting for me and together we finished the story. I am not one to do reviews, but it was such a unique experience among my years of gaming that I had to share it. Thank you, punks for the experience, truly thank you. And thank you, for bothering to read my review.\n\ni'll never forget our journey kind stranger.\n\nThis wasn't a game, it was an experience. I highly recommend you do this.\n- [i]While the artwork and combat remain enjoyable, the story, writing, and pacing were a major letdown.[/i]  \n\n***\nMINOR SPOILERS BELOW. If you're going to play the game, play before reading.\n***\n\n[b]The mature storylines, hard-hitting decisions, beautiful worldbuilding, and tight writing that made the first two so immersive is not present in this game.[/b] (You'll notice immediately that the writing for the caravan in the capital is [i]particular[/i] trite, awkward to read, and uninteresting.)\n\nUnfortunately, it's not just the writing that's weak. [i]The pacing is off.[/i] Antecedents are confusing, characters you'd expect to speak don't, events that should have been foreshadowed come out of nowhere. More frustrating are the serious character continuity \"errors,\" and arcs that disappear, change, or go nowhere. [i]In short, the events, decisions, and conflict from the previous games do not appear or resolve in a way that was suggested by the previous two[/i].\n\n\nHere's one example. In Banner Saga 2, Fosolt is unexpectedly rescued by Bolverk. [i]\"I have a message for Alette from the dead varl king,\" [/i]he said. That's pretty intriuging! Maybe there's a mystery, an oracle, an item, or just cool information about the Varl and their strange king? Maybe there'll finally be context about the bridge decision!\n\n[i]No! He has nothing interesting to say or add, and then his storyline just gets dropped and forgotten.[/i]\n\nWell, Bolverk's been possessed by Bellower! Gosh, who knows what Bellower will say? In fact, I can't wait to find out what happens to Bellower's body! \n\nWell, actually, Bolver's [i]not[/i] possessed, not really, certainly not like it was implied last game, and Bellower's body -- [i]a primary focus of the first two games[/i] -- isn't mentioned [i]once[/i]\n\nOr how about how they casually mention that Eyvyn is not only the [i]head[/i] of the Valka order, but also that he's had periodic bursts of hereditary madness all along? That's... odd. And it's not presented as an well-thought out [i]reveal[/i] or anything. It's presented matter-of-factly, like they were trying to ret-con in a less interesting story, or were tone deaf.\n\nYou'll notice that all the characters are underutilized and have unfulfilled storylines/tensions. Hakon has hard choices to make; Canary's a little crazy; Yrsa is mysterious; Gil's in love with Alette, etc. Will these build into choices? Reveals? Dependent endings based on choices? Will there be discussions referencing the past? Reflections on travels? Hints of despair?\n\nNo. In mine, Gil was [i]murdered[/i] and no one even bothered to reference it. Canary's situation never comes to a head. You never have to choose between Varls and Humans. Murdering people doesn't make people threaten to leave. Ubin returns randomly as an uber Varl and he's... learned the horseborne's language? Travelled the southlands? In like, a month? In a way that doesn't advance the plot? It's just... weakly done.\n\n\nThere are [i]so many[/i] examples like this, where the stories don't quite fit correctly, where what you picked up on in the early games about the [i]mysteries[/i] and the [i]world[/i] and what made it a [i]vibrant[/i] place were forgotten about by the writers. [b]The result is that it the game plays out in unsatisfying ways, in tenseless scenarios made vapid by watered-down morality, an inability to leverage the situation in fun ways, and low-quality writing, paucity of choice-making, a lack of exploration, lack of plot twists, simplified overworld mechanics -- all culminating in an almost staggeringly one-dimensional and shallow ending.[/b]\n\nThe Banner Saga series was always an experience that was greater than the sum of its part. An [i]experience[/i]. Of being [i]riveted[/i] to the computer, checking the map, worrying over supplies, guessing at mysteries, having my breath taken away at each hill. Unfortunately, that's not the case in this game. \n\n\nGameplay-wise, it's also a bit of a letdown. Combat is fun-ish, but you can make invincible character combinations and the mechanics don't even try to deal with this. There's an interesting new reinforcement mechanic that's not used heavily, and never pushes you like you think the end of the world would. You never really have to split up your forces. There's no novelty. Like maybe using a hero in a battle makes them fatigued, so you have to switch them up? Maybe you can station them different places, making them unusable for combat? Maybe you need to choose eight for a secret mission caravan? Maybe dream sequences? No, nothing like that. \n\nThe overworld gameplay had some changes that never really felt significant. Moreover, quite a bit felt taken away. You can't rest, do training missions, no longer weigh food vs upgrades. One example of all thise tone deafness was Iver's march through the destroyed world was consistently at \"Great Morale!\"\n\nThere didn't seem to be many flavor choices (\"Do we hang the criminals or let them join us?\"), including much less on social themes (\"Should women fight, if it disturbs the traditionally-minded men?\" \"One clan's rowdy, what do we do?\" \"They threaten to leave if so and so isn't banished\"), and less delayed results and fewer significant decisions, including among the game's built-up tensions among the factions. \n\n\nThere's also some cases of development [i]feeling[/i] cheap. Remember opening Banner Saga 2, and feeling that it was [i]fresh[/i], and [i]upgraded[/i]? There's little to make you feel that way here. The artwork is okay, but the environments feel more generic, with less variety, and the surreal landscapes in the darkness aren't especially interesting to look at for long periods of time. Iver is voiced by Bolverk's voice actor, and they sound exactly the same. The new title system is a fun idea, but is visually integrated into the game's menu system with the finesse of a cheap mod. \n\nThere's a moment in the game where the screen goes black for scrolling text and voiceover narration explaining the upcoming mechanic. Um, a character can't explain that? It was similar how the many two second animations are used, not to supplement the story, but to [i]replace[/i] written portions, making you feel unsure about what's going on. And finally, the game's pretty short, without fun combat challenges or interesting newgame+ challenges. \n\n\nWhat's [i]particularly[/i] frustrating is that the game's release date was moved forward four months. I don't know the story why, but I do know that a few more months of polish and story embellishment might have delivered the beautiful, grippingly interactive story we were hoping for. Because this is a watered down version of the previous two in just about every way.\n\nThis negative review is for whatever processes lead to this mediocre finale.\n\n---\n\n[i]Here's a plot that would have made more sense. Zephyr arrives and speaks to you secretly. There's a god that's still alive! Neat, now we'll finally get more story on that. Yay, fun caravan mode, now we need to take longships somewhere interesting!\n\nBut uh-oh! There's a Sundr villain going there as well, with an army of dredge! But at least now we'll finally get more story about the Sundr! \n\nThe god reveals something interesting, talks about Juno, the sun, gives a means to protect the city and help Iver. But when you return to the city, now the king and rugga and the factions have devolved into fighting based on your choices. How are you going to handle this? Which of many possibilities will ascend to the throne? How will you defend the city? And what mystery lies beneath the mountain of the city...\n\nFor Iver's caravan, there should be pockets of dredge villages kept alive by Spellsingers. Now you need to decide to plunder them or not! More stuff to do! Maybe go to the remains of the Varl capital first? Fight warped Valka? Realize deceptions, machinations, corruption, hear stories? Find new characters, have old ones die?\n\nInstead there... wasn't a plot?[/i]\n- Great gameplay with baaad user experience. There are no tooltips or explanations as to what is going on at all, just kinda gotta figure it out. Otherwise the gameplay is smooth and there's a climb mode called spiral, slay the spire style, very fun. 5 different classes all able to level their decks and get new cards and abilities until lvl 30 I think, got my enchantress to 20 but still more to go. Story mode is more of a tutorial but still interesting.\n- Really need a report button to slap some senses into trolls in online matches.\nCan't even escape them at ranked. sigh\nGreat game nonetheless, 4/5\n- Volition ups the silly, and adds super powers, but loses a little something along the way.\n\nI loved Saint's Row: the Third, and by all rights should have loved IV as well, but I mostly just liked it. The set up was fun, and seemed to up the ante again, but then you get the presidency ripped away from you almost immediately (without even seeing the consequences of your first pushed legislation!). Placing the game in a virtual city for the most part with the only real characters being on your space ship, really kinda seemed to gut the game. Even when [spoiler]the world gets destroyed[/spoiler], a detached, \"meh\" was all I could muster. The humor is there, but it's mostly better in the DLC. The radio stations feel kind of underwhelming without DJs.\n\nFinally all the fun of collecting and customizing various interesting cars, and finding ways to climb or fall to interesting places with a stolen plane/parachute are gutted with the inclusion of super powers. Also, the super powers make gunplay, leveling any of your other stuff, and pretty much every mechanic carried over from Saints Row: the Third obsolete.\n\nIf you get this game, do yourself a favor and make sure you get all the DLC where most of the real fun is. Is it as good as the previous Saints Row? I don't think so, but I still recommend getting it and playing through it. It is a lot of fun, and I love the 50's break out scenario at the beginning.\n\nStacey's thoughts:\nStill awaiting DLC with Jane Austin and the D*ldo Bat. Can somebody make this, for, uhh, scientific purposes.\n- After playing the game for almost 10 hours which i know is not a lot but still i had a great time the story kept me hooked from start to finish and i was always excited to find out what was going to happen next. I loved the idea that you could choose to play as a ghost and never get detected or never kill anyone or just go for the high chaos im going to kill everyone playstyle and even know the ability to choose your playstyle is quite oftenly seen these days but back in 2012 it was quite inovative.\n\nGameplay:\nIt had great combat and stealth.(Not Suprising based on thre fact that your an assasin)\nStory was well how to put this \"A rollercoaster of emotion\" it keeps you hooked from start to finish and you will never want to stop playing until you finaly get to the end.\n\nReplay Value:\nNow this is a big one in my opinion because i like games that make you play for hours and hours and I would say that Dishonored has great replay value this is mainly due to the fact that there are a lot of different acheivements, ways to complete each mission, different magic paths and weapon paths that can only be be completed if you play the game again and if your not comftable with fully restarting you dont have to because once you finish the main storyline you unlock the option to play them over which is useful if you want to unlock some of the other acheivements for example Clean Hands to get this acheivement your not allowed to kill anyone in the whole story how you do this i have no idea but thats the reason this game has good replay value.\n\nDLC:\nEven though i do not own the DLC (i will be purchasing them soon) from my knowledge of the normal game and how great that was it would suprise me if the DLC was bad.\n\nIn conclusion i would highly reccomend this game to anyone who doenst already own it!\n\n- You know that feeling when you are hesitant to buy a game because you're worried you might waste your money on something that might be a crap game in the end, get boring, and not sure if you should believe all the ratings because you dont know if everyone has the same interests and likes as you? well this game is the bomb diggity, straight up. Made by the same people who made rollercoaster tycoon and man did they deliver on this. For me it's the small things in a game that matter and did they really take the time to make sure this was as polished as it could be. Not sure if anyone remembers when they announced another rollercoaster tycoon a while back, and everyone was super excyited to find out what it was, and it ended up being some dumbass phone app? Well imagine all that excyitment, but instead of them coming out with that stupid app they came out with this bad boy. This is exactly what everyone was wishing and hoping for (just different name). Do I reccomend you buy this game? hell yes. will it be exactly what you are wishing for when you fist clicked this game to see the game play and reviews? sure as cocks will. But will it be just as fun as the original?.... YOU BET YOUR MOMS TITS IT WILL BE. \n\nPROS:                                \nbeen one since 1990\n\nCons:\nYou'll never know how fun it is till you buy it.\n- Do you kinda like 4X games, but mostly the first 2-3 hours of the game where you're exploring and hacking a basic civilization out of the wilderness and desperately fending off natural threats while trying to keep people fed and productive? If so, this game is for you. Nice tight gameplay loop where things never get stagnant for too long; always novel threats and opportunities, and you're not tied to any one settlement for very long, so victory and defeat alike are more temporary. Not to mention a really astounding amount of fun, polished content for an early access game! Eremite, Hooded Horse, I salute you.\n- cool game but the font is almost unreadable at times\n- The message Dusk delivers is, \"Hey, have you ever wanted to play Quake or Doom, except that it takes place in Silent Hill? Don't worry, neither has literally anyone else, but you're welcome!\"\n- This game is for sure not perfect, but worth buying for a specific type of gamer.\n\n[b]What is good in this game?[/b]\n- It has a pretty solid gun gameplay. The movement is quick and polished as well.\n- One level is on average 20 seconds. It's fun to improve your gameplay to get better times in the small levels. \n- It's really a blast getting a perfect run, killing enemies in bullet time or exploiting the enemies weakspots.\n- There is content for around 10-15 hours. Maybe more if you consider going for 100%.\n\n[b]Anyway there are also some flaws: [/b]\n- In Neon White or Ghostrunner the movement and pace through the levels often feels like a perfect choreographic \"dance\"\n- The levels and the areas in Warstride are verry tight. I often lost pace through \"stupid\" placed rocks or small doors.\n- There is not much to explore. The levels are verry linear. While in Neon White it was so much fun to explore shortcuts or other hidden possibilities to improve ur time there are no such mechanics in Warstride at all. I'd love to have some exploration at least in the \"long levels\".\n- It could get repetitive for some players as it's a core element to complete the levels on 5 different difficulties. \n\n[b]Conclusion: [/b]\nIf you like fast paced games like Ghostrunner, Neon White or Doom and you have no problem in repeating short levels several times and u don't except an extraordinary game u will have fun for several hours on a low price.\n\n- Game does not become better with release.\nDups AI still retarded, they literally wasting time instead of doing work.\n\nJust a quick example:\nDup can go to the left side of map dig !!ONE!! block, then go to right side of the map and harvest !!ONE!! plant, then go back to the left side of map and dig second block. It's unbelivable boring watching all these.\n\nAnd you still can't destroy ruins, OMG. You can lunch rocket but can't destroy some ruins.\n- The original was and still is one of the best 2D sprite art horror game out there. And this remake does it justice!\n\nIt comes with updated art and some new scenes and sequences, so there is something for returning and new players alike.\n\nHonestly, I just feel happy that I can finally pay for this game. The original one being free was a steal for being so good.\nEven to this day, I still get surprised on the level of detail of the sprites, the genuine sentimentality of the story and boy, did this version made me cry!\n\nA must if you are a fan of RPG maker esque horror games, or Madoka Magica, or deep dives into a person's psyche, or lolita fashion or all of the above :p\n- I got this game for $12 off humble bundle. Me and my friends play it for hours on end. This game honestly feels like the perfect fighting game for me because there is no set style. I don't have to remember specific combos or any crazy inputs. It's just simplicity. Unless you want to do that in which you can. But it's fun for anyone. If I were you I would get it off of humble bundle for $12.\n- trolley problem simulator where you can save the world by having your team of giant mechs slam dunk kaiju into lava\n- 136 hours, 49/49 achievements - sounds like just enough for the review.\n\nIt is indeed complete package. Brilliant characters, neatly constructed plot and enjoyable gameplay with the classic \"easy to play, hard to master\" aspect to it.\n\nI really can't pick at the graphics or music - they are just in line with the Supergaint roster, crafted at the level we have come to expect.\n\nIs there anything substantial that I would change? Not really, no. Adjustment to the \"progress\" in the one place, perhaps some slight balancing elsewhere... But does it matter when taking everything into account? Nope, not at all.\n\nEasy recommendation.\n- Where's the atmosphere the first two games had?\nWhy can I only have 2 weapons at any time?\nWhy is this game a generic shooter?\nIf the game they had shown in so many videos previous to the release had come out, it'd have been a masterpiece, instead we got a severely watered down version of it.\nIt's a corridor shooter for the most part, with some parts where you're in a bigger room instead, really what I played the first two games for.\n- This game made me so miserable . \nThe writing can be as funny as heartbreaking \nThe Voice acting is one of the greatest i've ever heard \nA lot of the time , the many side quest were as awesome or even better than the main story (That is already amazing )\n\nPro : The whole game \nCon : Absolutely nothing \n\nIt's one of the greatest gaming experience I've ever had in my 24 years on this earth.\n- So this is what upsets me about rainbow six siege as a casual player. I bought the starter edition like a moron. Thats on me. But I wasn't sure I'd like the game. Turns out I do. So now that I realize I like the game I want to fully purchase the game. Turns out you can't upgrade starter to standard. The game legit punishes people who want to play it. Who paid money to basically test if they would enjoy the game.  Why should I pay $55 for a $40 edition? Just let me pay $25 for the $40 edition. I already paid the money. Why are you punishing me for wanting to spend more?\n- Delete the intro.\n\nHonest Edit:\n\n Actually pretty sweet game.  Lots of things I don't like in terms of menu navigation and difficulty curve, but conceptually one of the better games I've played in awhile.  I just wish the controls weren't so poor. Very tedious with doubletap movement to dodge/counter (keyboard)\n\nAlso not very optimized for steam link or the steam controller. In general the worst parts of this game are directly attributed to the fact that this is a port. One of the worst port jobs i've seen to be honest.  Definitely play with a good controller. \n\nThe game also does a poor job of introducing the \"extended\" story, I nearly missed what i would consider the best part of the game just because I stopped after the first round of credits. There is actually a ton more content afterwards. Very worth investing the time into watching everything play out.\n- holy fucking shit everything about this fucking mongoloid game is so fucking bad i can't even begin to understand. this was supposed to be better than the first piece of shit, but i dunno, maybe a tiny bit.\n\ndon't be like me and get baited into wasting your hard earned money for this fucking shit even if it's on like -90% sale.\n\nspecial mention to worst fucking controls in the history of fucking gaming. fuck these fucking mongoloid fucking retard faggots for making a game this fucking bad. uninstalled.\n- I shall start by saying that if you are deciding to buy this game then don't let the negative reviews sway you. In general, Fallout 4 is an amazing game and can be incredibly fun.\n\nPros: \n-Very immersive and will drain so many hours, days, weeks and months from your life.\n-Far Harbour, Automotron and (first half of) NukaWorld DLC have really good stories, quests and environments.\n-Mostly fluid combat system. Everything depends on how you want to play the game.\n\nCons: \n-WIll drain so much of your life away (might've forgotten my gf's birthday ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ )\n-Main story was incredibly lackluster compared to previous Fallout games\n-Giving you the option to be literally any kind of character you want to be....except you're always tied to being a parent.\n-a few repitive quests. (although gives you opportunities to approach these quests, areas and enemies differently\n\nAll in all, If you're a Fallout fan because of previous stories then you might not feel fulfilled playing this game, however if you love character creations, lore and immersive environments with untold stories then I completely recommend this game to you.\n- Looks like a game for children, but underneath the friendliness there is a great challenge! Move on the rhythm of good songs on a note bar! \n\n[h2]Swim! Swim little tredpole! [/h2]\nYou are a newborn tredpole. The first thing you do is break free of your egg! Through various rivers and waters you journey, and eventually save your pond from a disaster that will occur. \nEverything in the river translates to an instrument tone and respects the height on the note bar. The primary goal is to reach the finish. The melody is depicted as little mines which hurt your health if you swim across one. Along the way you can collect points by collecting bubbles (with a bonus if you collect them all), little bubbles, health packs, and you can slap your tail on bamboo or cymbals that launch you in the air! Many predators would like to make a snack out of you! \nAll this on the rhythm of unique songs! \n\n[h2]Thoughts [/h2]\nThis looks like a friendly game, a bit for kids perhaps, right? Well, I started with letting a non-gamer play this, without success. You need to have musical rhythm in you to perform well. None of my friends possess that really, so a simple playthrough wasn't all that easy. \nThe music is very original, and makes this game fun. It's a tough game, and poses quite a challenge for lovers of rhythm games. I am totally unfamiliar with that breed of gamers. For the simple gamer like me, I'd say: nice for a playthrough. \n\n70/100\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[td]\n[i]More reviews at [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/39546715/]Omnivore Gamer[/url], games that are easy to control (for handicapped gamers). [/i][/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n- owned the original from all the way back in 2014\nloved it tons, even more than RoR2\nsaw RoRR get teased on twitter, was there for its release, thought to myself,\n\"i don't need this, i can just play the ror from 2013, i don't know how to feel about this new one, is it really just the same game again?\"\n\nand then i saw someone grab an item i've never seen before, while playing as a character i've never seen before, on a map layout i've never seen before, using alternate abilities to what was baseline for that character to fight an enemy i've never seen before, and then activate a shrine of the mountain from ror2, and then while doing the teleporter fight they activated a bunch of new machines that turned drones into items and activated a specific equipment for a fee... and then i saw that you can just opt out of whatever you don't like about any of that, at any time!\n\nwhat's not to love about that??\n- Beware as you are just looking at the best 4X game that is.\n\nDon't look at my played time here, this game was available for years already from a very unheard of distributor BUT now is available on Steam at last for the people to see it already.\n\nMaybe you are wondering why it costs so much. Well it has 4 expansions build in it already so that's why. But believe me IT'S WORTH IT. If you like 4X games, this is just a must have.\n\nThe cons:\n\n1. The game is not turn based. Everything is done in real time. You can pause the game and speed it up or slow down at your own liking. This may be a + for someone though... \n2. It's not as shiny as some other 4X games so if pretty graphics are what you prefer you may be disappointed.\n3. The game can be demanding even on high end PC's if you run really large galaxy.\n4. Unfriendly UI. If you run huge resolution you will have problems to read the text.\n5. The learning curve... you will spend hours getting into the game. But don't be afraid, huge automation can be set up to help you.\n6. No multiplayer. I don't mind it but maybe you do?\n\nThe Pros:\n\nEverything else. It's the most complex, never ending fun 4X game I have played. Just the way how the AI is done hooked me up. But to make it fair here are some picks for you.\n\n1. Huge amount of races that actually play in character. It's not like in other games where every AI plays the same way but has different stats. Here the AI behaves in the ways how they are described. They play in character like in RPG game.\n2. HUGE galaxies. Trust me you never saw something like this before in other 4x games. Each game can last for dozens of hours if you want.\n3. Set up your game to the last possible thing you can imagine. The start up set up is just incredible.\n4. Automation ... don't like research, or ship design, or diplomacy, or anything else you can imagine? You can automate it. You can focus only on the one thing you like the most!\n5. Pirates ... you can even play as one.\n6. Mods ... do you want 10 more races or to play Star trek 4x? ... You can have it. \n7. Micromanagement ... it can be endless.\n8. The complexity, you can spend hours in design tables that make sense in comparison to Moo3 for example.\n9. Battles, there is very few games that can simulate such large scale engagements over the whole galaxy.\n10. Play it your own way. You can win the game without any battle if you want. On the other side waging wars is FUN.\n\nDo you need to know more? Watch some videos on YouTube from Das24680. He has also full tutorials for those who would need them.\n\n*Update - I have added more Pros as this game deserves it and I have forgot to mention them.\n- As much as I adore this game's visuals, soundtrack, story, and... THE MEMES... I unfortunately can't recommend actually playing it.\n\nI can parry bosses in Dark Souls or Elden Ring with less frustration than in this game. The parry system requires you to execute a light attack towards an enemy right before they go in for a hit against you, which is usually telegraphed with a red glare in their eye. Unfortunately, even while using the lock-on camera (and by the way, you are never directly informed of its existence), half of the time my opponent was partially, or even completely off-screen. This is a problem, not only because it makes seeing an incoming attack difficult, but also because movement is tied directly to the parry system. You must execute an attack TOWARDS the enemy. With the camera having a seizure every five seconds, this makes it even more irritatingly difficult to aim your parries. I died to Blade Wolf repeatedly, not because of my own skill, but because midway through an incoming attack, the camera would decide to turn 90 degrees to the left, causing my movement to also shift to the left, nullifying my parry. \nIt's consistently inconsistent.\n\nIf there is some system in place that actually does help explain a lot of these game mechanics, fantastic. However, I find it inexcusable that whatever I might be missing would be so out of the way that I'd never encounter it unless I went out of my way to do so.\n- Only one word to describe this game\n\nOutdated.\n\nThere is no real point to get this game unless you want a slightly better looking UI and atmosphere. L4D2 already contains the campaigns from L4D1 and is where the entire Left 4 Dead community is. Only a small playerbase still plays l4d1, mostly out of nostalgia. But there is quite literally no reason to get the game.\n\nYou can grab it if you are into achievements, but only do so when it goes on sale, i grabbed it for a couple penny, still a bad idea.\n- This is less of a review and more of me gushing about how much im enjoying myself, but you can still get a idea of what the game is from it. I am not usually a puzzle game player, or even a \"chill\" game player. im usually all about quick shooters, fighters, and platformers, but i decided to give this game a shot and i am very glad i did. with a mechanic as simple as pushing trees i thought that it would be simple enough for me to have a good time, the last time i played a puzzle game was BaBa is You and i put 14 hours into it and never got past word 3, it was just too much for me. but this game manages to still be challenging even with it laying all the pieces out in front of me, it introduces new features not by putting one in a level and saying good luck, it makes you do something you have done before but gives a new outcome, because you never got to do that thing in that exact way before, and when puzzles start requiring you to do those things you wonder how you ever got that far without doing one of those things before. all of the mechanics and solutions also are based in logic, all your doing is pushing things, so you dont have to suspend your current understanding of things to learn a new mechanic. The world of the game is also very relaxing and sucks me right in, its a museum of the \"past\" of humans that takes place in the far future from the perspective of monsters who dont really understand human culture, and it is hilarious! the music is very chill and moves with your actions, when you push something in a specific way the music also does a specific things, and its part of the reason this game is so relaxing. most other puzzle games i have played frustrate me when i get stuck on a puzzle for a long time, but seeing the monster relax helps me relax and keep a level head to get to the next museum exhibit. i dont know how to end this review but if you read it i hope you dont feel like i wasted your time!\n- VIDEO REVIEW: https://youtu.be/DzdF-i2drLs\n\nI loved this game!  It was a worthy prequel to Cthulhu Saves the World!  If you’re a fan of the games from this company I recommend playing it!\n\nIf there is one downside to the game, it’s that it’s very linear. Every game day you just make a selection to the R'lyehtionships options, a cutscene occurs and you get a reward item. Do that for a few in game days than the next level plays. These levels are just as linear as there’s very little deviating. \n\nHowever the rest of the game makes up for that short coming. The R'lyehtionships choices give great replay value, the writing is spot on, and the fighting is just as good.\n\nAlso the addition of a “skip incoming random battle” option was refreshing. \n\nSo overall i say that the game is another Zeboyd games classic that is perfect for the holiday. \n\nPRO\n+Great funny writing as per Zeboyd Games\n+Amazing graphics on par with Cosmic Star Heroine\n+Great music\n+Combat is easy simple and fun\n+Challenging but fair\n+ R'lyehtionships gives clever replay value \n\nCON\n-Game is painfully linear.\n-Very little places to wonder around in gameplay\n-R'lyehtionships causes Uber simplified “quests” to be glorified cutscenes\n-Needs more interactive items in the maps for more funny writing \n\nI’d give the game an 8/10! It’s highly recommend it if you’re a long time fan and it’s worthy a purchase during a sale if you’re unsure.\n- good game but later missions seem to be less polished ran in multiple bugs when playing as The Son enemies getting stuck in impossible to reach places and for some odd reason some characters have dog killing animations that for the most part are bugged and only work half the time causing an insta death and a retry don't even understand why later in the game you have to do animations to kill dogs as for basically the whole game you don't need to perform animations also seems to have some input lag throughout the whole game but overall its decent and when its on sale you should buy it.\n- So I'm going to assume that you've played CIV V in the past. Endless Legend's another 4x game like it, but in my opinion, it's so much better. And here's why:\n\n1) I know this is the advantage of being in a fantasy setting as opposed to the \"Real world\" (You get what I mean, I know Civ 5 isn't historically accurate, but it tries to stay in the world of realism), but all the factions feel genuinly different and exciting from one another. Both in style and aesthetics, the difference between Wild Walkers and Ardent Mages is far, far greater than say The Netherlands and Japan. \n\n2) I like the way that influence is a resource. I know it kinda takes the place of culture in that it's used for policies, but having to save up a resource that's more than just troops for wars and the like makes diplomacy far more meaningful, I find.\n\n3) The way strategic and luxury resources are done. Instead of \"This deposit has 8 iron\", it says \"This deposit has titanium\", and just gives you 1 per turn. It let's you build things that require a lot of that resource even if you only have 1 source, just slower than other people who have more. It makes a lot more sense to me. the fact that each luxury item is different from one another and have different effects is a lot more interesting than just giving +Happiness, and the booster system means that having 5 dye deposits (I wish) is more useful than it is in civ, where you have to desperatly try and peddle it off or it's a huge waste.\n\n4) This is a personal thing, but I like the fact that technology is seperated by era rather than previous tech. I find it a far nicer system to work with as it lets me get what I want when I want it, instead of having to research bloody sailing even though I'm completely land locked.\n\n 5)  I know this is locked away in Tempest, but naval warfare is so bloody interesting now. With ocean based citadels and bloody weather effects that you have to wrstle with, I've never been happier to play on ocean-heavy maps. The ocean's not just an awkward land, it's its own living breathing world. \n\n6) The living breathing world that is Auriga. The lore I'm uncovering from quests and gameplay is ridiculous, and it really brings the world to life. It makes me sympathise and despise each faction for their motives and executions, and I love it. Plus, I'm learning the more and more I play that this is Sci-Fi, not high fantasy. It's amazing.\n\n7) Minor Factions are a far better method of doing barbarian encampments and city states. They're a great blend of the two, spawning enemy units like barbs, and giving meaningful bonuses like city states. Plus, your opponents can't just take them over and use them as a base of operations against you.\n\n 8) I know this is a controversial one, but I love winter. 1-30 turns where I'm surviving rather than thriving? I'm amazed with how much I love the double edged sword of dread and gratitude depending on whether or not I'm being invaded at the time\n\n9) I love the region system. There's X regions, this is their shape and size, and there's one city for each. I think it makes placing cities a lot more important than in civ where you can fart them around all over the place, and I get a lot less worried about having my neighbours settle all over me (Like the bloody shoshone). Plus, I think it makes zooming out and gazing upon your empire more satisfying. They're something nice about having all those rough edges instead of clean hexagons. Losing a city means losing a huge chuck of territory, and taking a citygains a huge chunk. The wars I've been in have been far more exciting as a result.\n\n10) Populations gets you citizens, like in Civ. I like just yelling at them to make more cabinets, sell more cabinets, or research new and exciting cabinets rather than making them work tiles. The fact that all the tiles get worked on automatically fits into this, as does the fact that your 20 population city is probably going to take up a hell of a lot more space than 1 tile. The fact that you can actually expand cities is something I love\n\n11) The way wars are fought. it;s not just blankets of single units, but a few core armies with 6-8 units in each. It makes it a HECK of a lot quicker and cleaner, while still having a grand scale. The fact that you can hands on rather than auto is something that I like to do if the odds are against my favor, but I can think of a clever stretegy to turn the tide in my favour.\n\n12) The hero system is something I like far more than the great person system. Instead of getting four bloody musicians I can't do anything with until the bloody modern era, you just get heros who you can use as spies, governers or generals, each able to be upgraded into whatever you want them to be or do. It's a super nice system I find, as I can just always get exactly the hero I need when I need them, which leads me nicely onto...\n\n13) The marketplace system is one I like. \"Oh I have no adamantium and noone will trade it with me!\". Well little Billy, you don't just have to resort to war anymore, you can just buy some. At a high price so it shouldn't be your first option, but it's nice to always be able to get what you need. Plus you can play the stock market in case you want to play Offworld Trading Company while you play Endless Legend.It's a nice way to get extra troops and great people too.\n\n\ntl;dr: It's a good game.\n\nGet it.\n- I technically got this game for free, as it was bought for me from a friend. And honestly, I didn't really like it. She got it for me, as a means to help with some of my mental health issues I suppose? But it just was very big miss for me, and kinda made me feel worse. A bit anxiety inducing for me, just given the circumstances, talking about life and death. Just not my personal cup of tea.\n- Driving feels unrealistic, am I driving a car, or a boat?\nStealth system simply sucks, can't hide bodies, each guard in the restricted area knows exaclty where are you hiding after one of them spots you.\nMade a refund request.\n\nAlthought graphic is nice, and story seems fun.\nI'd recommend to pick this on sale, and not for a full price.\n- This game is shit, and the devs should eat shit for shitting this shit on top of gamer community's head.\nCombat?

Pity I can't get a refund AND throw dung at this whitewashed game, like people did to Deuscht.\n\nI hope you devs sit on it and rotate.\n\n- I bought this game in order to review it, seeing as there were no current reviews for it. \nI thought I'd help the game out by maybe giving it that tiny bit of publicity it needed to get off the ground.\nIn doing so I have failed. As this game isn't worth reviewing, there is nothing to review. Well, I should say there is stuff to review but I feel as though the dev's didn't even attempt to make this a game that anyone would enjoy. Well actually I'll let them off of the target of \"enjoy\", I'd go further to say it doesn't even feel like they tried to make a game that someone who had nothing to do and was bored out of their mind would say maybe I'll play this for a bit\nI jumped straight in, ignored the help in menu and started playing. It took me at least 4-5 mins before I even had the slightest concept of what was going on and what I had to achieve. Once I did get the hang of it I still thought \"I must be missing something, I'm not really doing anything\" so I ventured to the help menu to find that nope, thats it buddy.\nThe controls are lacking, the soundtrack and the sound effects (which happen to be a melody playing) do not blend at all, (they play completely out of time on top of the soundtrack).\nYou can buy it and prove me wrong, go ahead.

Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.\n- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.\n- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.\n- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.\n- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.\n- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).\n- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. \n\nFill the Ravioli shells.\n\n- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.\n- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.\n- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.\n- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.\n- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. \n\nForm the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.\n\n- Roll the dough into two sheets\n- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.\n- Fill with the ravioli mixture.\n- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.\n- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.\n\nCook the Ravioli.\n\n- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.\n- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.\n- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest \n- Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed plates\n\nServe it up.\nTop with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!\n- The best games Telltale has ever made, plus one that is very mediocre\n-Season One: 10/10 - A masterpiece, prepare to be hit right on the feelings and cry a lot\n-Season Two: 9/10 - Awesome, and very very sad.

And he really does! The level design is great and the areas are cool and unique and a real joy to explore! A really slick zelda-like souls-like-ish game. \nBut that's not all.\nThe gimmick of this game, and the thing that really sets it apart and makes it go above the rest, is the manual. The whole gimmick is that the game is written, mostly, in an unknown runic language, forcing the player to figure out game mechanics, progression and puzzles on their own. You have only one thing to help you: as you progress you collect pages of a manual, in the style of those old console games, which gives you again pseudo-cryptic hints, because it's also mostly in the other language.\nThe way the manual and the knowledge based progression flow into the design of the game is nothing short of genius. It's hard to gosh about just how amazing it is, because that would be spoiling it, but it's completely genius. \nGame's a masterpiece for me, a strange mesh of Hollow Knight  meets  Outer Wilds-based knowledge progression. \nDefinitely a must-buy, don't even worry about it going on a sale, it's an easy indie GOTY for me\n- [b] Target Audience: [/b] [I] Anyone with a Soul[/i]\n\n[b] Summary: [/b]  \n\nIt's a damn shame that this game isn't topping people's game of the year list this year, because Wandersong is one of the best story based experiences that I've played on Steam. A game that is beautiful woven from start to end, every element works together in harmony to make what will be a cult classic in my mind: and only a cult classic due to the fact that it should be a blockbuster, but won't get the recognition. The 3 man team took an upbeat story of a young bard on a whismical journey and \nmade someone who usually gravitates toward more depressing/out there stories and fall in love with the Bard, Miriam, and the vast cast of characters here. \n\nThe funny thing is, it's hard to quantify what makes Wandersong such a complete package, because everything works in harmony so well with everything else. Take the music for example: I actually struggled to specifically remember any individual track at first, and that's because the games tracks are so tied to the emotions that you feel during scenes. You are the music in how you play through your game, you experience this game how you want, and it's singing mechanic that alters the world aroudn you allows you to be the player you want to be while still staying in a relatively linear story line. The color and presentation is fantastic, the gameplay mechanics stay just long enough before changing up, it's hard to really think of anything that the game did wrong.\n\nLook, even those who may hate games with less “gameplay” will most likely be charmed by Wandersong's spell. It's a siren of sorts: except it'll make you crash into jagged rocks of love and happiness. Story elements feel earned. Everything has very specific detail. It's clear this was a labor of love, and it shows even in the scene select: where the splooshes by the team just make you smile. You will sit and wonder about your own life after playing certain sections, and the club scene is one of the best set pieces I've seen in character development. Honestly, I really struggle to think of negatives for the game: each thing has a purpose and is there for a specific reason, and executes it beautifully. \n\nIf you're reading this review, it's because you're considering buying the game.

[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/6861768/]Dragnix Curator [/url][/b]\n- An okay game that wastes your time.\n\n\nI played on the hardest difficulty. For me there was a pretty big difficulty spike somewhere in chapter 6 or 7. Apparently I had been skipping on the battles earlier on and was a bit too low level. No problem, I had just unlocked skill trees for the characters, so some XP spending made things manageable. I had to try the map a few times, but once I downed a few mobs and gained some levels, all was going well. The objective was to kill all the enemies by certain time, and that's what I aimed to do. Except, once I'd killed all the enemies, the objective changed and I would've needed to trudge to the other side of the map and kill the boss as well. Yeah, fuck that.\n\n\nThe combat works round-by-round in speed order. If your characters go faster than the enemies, you can simply spam AoE attacks and kill droves of them before they go. If enemies are faster, you're kind of screwed because they hit hard, you're on the defensive, have to spend turns healing and cannot attack that much. And levels seem to make a huge difference here. Combat seems sort of poorly balanced in this respect; maps are hard at the beginning, but by the end just a joke because you gained a few points of speed and are now overall faster and can spam AoE attack and kill enemies in droves.\n\nThe user interface and usability is pretty archaic. For example, to get out of a menu you have to explicitly click on the button that says \"back\" instead of just clicking a right mouse button or Esc or whatever.\n\nThe writing was quite funny at times. It also seemed of a mixed quality. A lot of times it seemed clearly aimed at 13-year olds.  (Especially cringey are the first pair of \"combat helpers\" you get.) I also did play the game for a lot longer at once than I usually do. I think there's some kind of magical simplicity about it, and it's fun to play.\n\nIt's just, in general, the one thing I dislike the most is doing again the exact same thing that I just did. That's the developers' way of saying \"fuck you\" to me, and so I don't want to play this game anymore. If you don't mind that, and the game looks like something you'd like, then I don't doubt you'll like it. Don't get it for 20 moneys though. 15, perhaps... 10 yeah, sure. Because reading the reviews, the one thing many agree on is the later you get the more garbage the combat gets. So, in essence, you only have the visual novel aspect. And if you're not 13 anymore, I don't know. Play something else perhaps.\n- very fun there is lots to do \nit runs well\nglitches are very funny\nable to download community made maps and mutators from workshop\ncan unlock different mutators as you play\nyour a goat\nyou do goat things\nyou can do non goat thing such as being a shopping cart or a microwave\nyou can also be a goat\n**Spoiler**\n[spoiler] Im a goat [/spoiler]\n\n GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!\n- Yeah sooooo I went 1k words past the max...had to pare this down...it's ok...I'm mentally stable...\n\nCrossCode is a top-notch indie in its genre. I'd mention it in the same breath as Celeste, Hades, and Outer Wilds. (guess I just did.) If you can at least enjoy both puzzles and real-time combat, this game is for you; it's not as much of a JRPG as it might look. The only real flaw I care to levy is that it isn’t incredible out of the gate; it’s merely good, and gets much better. I was going to summarize my reactions and add a \"what is the premise/gameplay loop\" section and have longer sections but I had to cut it all out so have _/5 ratings on the section titles instead. It's fine. I'm fine. Everything is fine.\n\nOk, review time.\n\nSTORY 4/5 NEATO\n\nThe story is great, and not quite what you might expect. It starts pretty light and cozy, with solid (and often meta) humor interspersed with cryptic moments. I like how casually the in-universe MMO is treated by the players. I enjoyed all the characters, including our mostly-mute but personable Lea. Once it ramps up, the story takes some exciting turns, too; the devs really know how to do drama without doing overdrama. I didn't relate too much to the story but I think it was told quite well. I like the portrayal of the antagonists for the most part, though I wish I could have felt their presence more often. The lore is also fascinating, if occasionally hard to grasp because the line between real and virtual is very thin due to the game’s particular premise. (The difference between real people and NPCs is sometimes unclear, for instance.) The ending was good, but I think the DLC epilogue wraps the game up far better.\n\nCOMBAT 5/5 WOWIE\n\nWhen you start out, combat feels almost hack-n-slashy. You can spam melee attacks and bullets for days, but you also have a charged projectile, a dodge-dash, and a shield. The elemental modes are absolutely the highlight due to the way enemies work, and the sort of limiter gauge they have forces strategy. Special moves are stylish and borderline absurd at higher levels. A huge skill tree controls them and much more; unlike some skill trees, this one requires choices, which is always a good sign. Oh and consumables are your main source of healing and buffs, and they aren't overpowered! Balancing win.\n\nThe enemies are really what make the combat fantastic. Almost every enemy has at least one gimmick and one visible weakness. The stun gauge mechanic is vital to all battles, forcing you to exploit those weaknesses to stun enemies and give you time to use your extra-long special moves. Bosses love to give you iterative micro-puzzles to fill their stun gauges, while minibosses are comfortably in-between. Bosses commonly have armor or invulnerability when not stunned, forcing even overleveled players to figure out the micro-puzzles to hit hard. (More great balancing.) Most weaknesses involve the element system, eventually encouraging you to swap elements multiple times mid-fight. The micro-puzzles will build on what you’ve been learning in a dungeon if it’s a dungeon fight. I'll mention that some normal enemies do feel like damage sponges at first, but you'll get used to this; the simple enemy design in the early game makes it seem worse than it is imo.\n\nPUZZLES 5/5 FUN COOL\n\nFor puzzles you've got your common environmental \"platforming\" puzzles, your specialized quest puzzles, your dynamic mini-puzzles in battles, and your iterative puzzling gauntlets in dungeons. Also almost everything is secretly part puzzle? Like, everything. They're an invasive species. They draw most of their complexity from the element system too. Each element has its own effects on certain objects and structures, and mainly you use charge shots to interact, though each attack has its own uses. Not much to say here; they're great puzzles. A couple may stump you for a while, but that's impossible to avoid, and I think CrossCode strikes a perfect challenge balance.\n\nQUESTS 5/5 WHEEEEEE\n\nWhile some quests conform to the typical hunting/gathering quests of MMOs, most boast some entirely unique content. Challenges range from unique bosses to puzzles to platforming to other familiar gimmicks that are secretly also puzzles. I won't spoil them. Quests generally use mechanics you have seen already in new, often very different, scenarios. NPCs are mostly there to be amusing or set up the gameplay, and that didn't bother me tbh.\n\nITEM MANAGEMENT 5/5 AAAAA\n\nItem and equipment acquisition? Engaging? WTF? Technically you get them like you do in any RPG. But, rare plants have high rare item drop rates, so if you know the platforming puzzle to reach em you don't have to waste much time. Enemies' drop rates rise with a high Combat Rank, which you get by killing many enemies in a row before the post-fight cooldown period ends and you get to heal to full and level up. This is tough until you're very comfortable with the area. Once you are, it's a whole new way of battling, using area knowledge to string together sequential fights. And what does the game do but give you a piece of upgradable equipment that grants the Combat Rating bonus to plants too?\n\nI actually cared about the equipment in the game too! *kisses Life Fiber Uniform* (yes they really make this reference) Equipment also matters more than level so the devs can control your power level better. Most times you can buy some basic equipment to explore, then return with items to trade to NPCs for stronger gear. Stronger gear has unique traits and you might prefer one over another, so it's nice that with trading you get to focus your resources on what you want. Sometimes you can trade some enemy drops for other ones, as I recall, which is a nice...uh, trade-off to get to make.\n\nQUALITY OF LIFE 5/5 HELP\n\nCONVENIENCE REIGNS in CrossCode. Text log like in visual novels? Check. Encyclopedia of story recaps, character summaries, CrossWorlds lore & terminology, etc.? Check. Enemy index? Check. Item drop rates? Check. Available trades? You beck. This is EXTREMELY helpful for an RPG, which otherwise would require a guide or plain luck to find rare item drops. Oh yeah also there's UI? I forgot about it cuz it's really good. Also the keyboard controls for swapping elements are a bit janky but I managed.\n\nAesthetics 3/5-5/5 SUBJECTIVITY WOOOOOO\n\nYeah if ya like what you see in the trailers and screenshots, that oughta be enough. I thought the art was average-good in the beginning, but like everything else the art improves as you go. They must’ve gone back and worked on old stuff, but not too much. The music is great. No complaints there. My one objective critique is, Lea has no depth perception -- the art makes similar-height platforms look identical. I ran into so many walls and stared at so many small flat gaps I thought I couldn't cross. I'm not a fool! It's the game's fault! But actually this time!\n\nA NEW HOME DLC 6/5 WTF OMG\n\nThe paid DLC is The Culmination of CrossCode. The epilogue is complex and fascinating and rewarding. The dungeon is an incredible all-elements send-off. I adore the new quests. And the art?? The environments, the enemies, the NPC portraits are all so pretty. Don't be fooled by the letters \"DLC\": this is not Discretionary Leisure Content. If you liked the base game, this is...Deluxe...eLite...C-content??? look these are not great letters to work with ok\n\nCONCDLUDSIONO\n\nWhat else to say? CrossCode good. Buy it. Do the thing. Also, look out for Project Terra, Radical Fish's next project. It translates their current style into a 3D environment with dynamic lighting. It’s pretty & it reduces that height perspective issue. There isn’t much info about it out yet, but keep your eyes out! (figuratively pls) I'm excited for what they'll come up with.\n\nHOLY **** I MADE IT AND WITH CHARACTERS TO SPARE YESSSS — ohnowai\n- Did you like the first two chapters?\nWell, here we have everything and tons of new and improved things, like the 2nd chapter did with regards to the first one (which was awesome, but quite simple gameplay-wise).\nA classical turn-based strategy game, now more polished than ever with wave-like combats and tons of units to start with, to upgrade and well, we don't even have real classes here - more correctly, each hero is a class on its own and has different abilities and such.\nThe story follows always the same one-way saga and you'll have to make lots of choices determining your fate, your battles and so on; the graphics are the most beautiful I've ever seen here and the soundtrack is quite amazing and atmospheric too.\nYou'll have also many features like arena combat, and a great history re-telling if you don't remember the first two chapters, plus a great tutorial to start with even if you're not new to the series and the genre.\nIt's quite fundamental if you're a little bit interested in this awesome story to play the other chapters - here in fact we'll start with all the old heroes, all the story right back from the caravan that reached Arberrang.\nWe're basically reviewing one of the best strategy tactical turn-based role-playing games of the last 5-10 years and I won't add more than this, it has already thousands of reviews and mine is quite useless I think. \nLots of endings, lots of characters to explore and promote, lots of weapons, accessories, modes.. we have everything. Recommended to anyone (maybe with a little discount).\n- They added \"Precision\" mode for the mouse under controls, which is pretty much raw mouse movement. YAY!\n\nAnyway, one of my favorite games of all time easily at this point. Incredible story, fun combat, and awesome world. A must play for sure, especially if you've never played it before on Play-Station (like me). It also has a New Game Plus mode that unlocks different NG+ only armor that are insane.\n\nI played at normal, and aside from the Valkyries the other bosses are a cakewalk. Maybe play on hard or hardest.\n- Pros \nReally good voice ending.\nCreepy and you are unsure of everything which makes this more interesting.\nDecent story\n\nCons\nEnding just fucks up everything.\n\n\n\"I don't want Pewdiepie making money off my game.\" Im sure you made more money off Pewdiepie for advertising this shi*ty game lol.\n- Probaly the best game ive ever told people to hold back on\n\nIts fun, its rude, it's the best Southpark Game ever made, but its only a 10 to 14 hour game. Its a satisfying 10 hours mind you, i dont think i have played a game in recent memory good enough to hold me the way this game has, the atmosphere and envoriment just puts you right in a long southpark episode, and youll love every minute of it.\n\nSadly, there are not enough minutes of it for $59.99, and thats why i sadly don't recomend this excelent game.\n\nAnd to clarify, its 10 hours if you just take your time enjoying the story, its plausible to 100% this game in under 20 hours, and thats if you are in no hurry, with no game guide.\n- Ib manages to do for me what so few horror games manage to accomplish, and that is to actually give a sense of unease and dread. Without going into spoilers, it's only a few minutes into the game that things start to tread the path of uncomfortable surrealism, with the art growing considerably more disturbing in how Ib interacts with it, and how the art interacts with her.\n\nWith all due respect to more conventional horror titles, say, Dead Space or The Evil Within, Ib maintains a feeling of dread and discomfort. Enemies can be evaded, yes, but there's a feeling of being stalked while trapped in a world you can't possibly fully understand. \n\nContrast Dead Space remake, where soon enough the horror gives way to cutting off an abomination's arm, then using telekinesis to impale it or another horror with said arm, then simply setting fire to the more mobile enemies.\n\nThis is not, I repeat, not to disrespect games in which reducing enemies to a smoldering heap of charred body parts is an acceptable tactic- there is a time and a place for the cathartic destruction of the nightmares that haunted our closets and lurked under our beds. Ib, however, leans firmly towards the horror and self-preservation of being in a hostile and unknown environment, where the only feasible option is to run, hide, and hope whatever nameless horror eventually loses track of you.\n\nAnd let's face it- some modern art galleries are creepy enough already, even in the daylight.\n\n- Been playing now for 56 hours and love it apart from one thing.... too many press conferences! Seems like every other minute I'm told I'm due to go into a press meeting... so, apart from that, I'm enjoying the game. Have to confess as a 60 year old woman, I do cheat... have much fun creating a team, buying loads of top players and winning every match... so satisfying! Anyway, can't cope with the action games and find the pace of this right up my street. Have been playing since the original Championship Manager games back in the 90s so would call myself a fairly seasoned player!\n- I had never played a Monster Hunter game before this, but World has definitely turned me into a fan. The fights are exhilarating, and I always feel like I'm making progress towards something- a new gear set, a cosmetic, an upgrade for the base, or even just filling out the monster guide. The environments are sprawling, beautiful, and full of opportunites to use the terrain against your foes. \n\nI have been playing the game entirely in co-op, with no issues after the first couple weeks. Playing story missions together is unintuitive, but only a minor inconvenience once you've figured it out. And story missions account for a very small amount of the content- this game is huge.\n- Most of the negative reviews cover my complaints already. So I won't rehash the ones I've already read. \n\nHere's my biggest complaints: \n\n- Jumpscares have never been compelling to me. Doubly so on VR. Are you trying to injure me in my computer room? Stop. \n\n- Guns are fun. Not having ammo for them is not fun. (The game is pretty generous with ammo but it also encourages tediously conservative behavior, if you just unload clips at shit you'll run out pretty fast) \n\n- \"Continuous Turning\" feels so bad. Like, how can I turn my headset and everything looks smooth as butter, but as soon as I use the look stick for turning suddenly it's all choppy and looks wrong? I'm familiar with some of the motion sickness issues people get with turning in VR games, but this isn't that... \n\n\nThough honestly it seems like they just leaned really into the whole horror thing, which is fine, but also just super not my thing. \n\nIf the mechanics and some design choices had been better I might have slogged through it anyway. \n\n\nGame's beautiful, though, so they got that going for them.\n- With approximately 55,000 reviews -- 96% of them positive -- at the time of my posting this, it is hard to know what more I can add to [i]It Take Two[/i]'s well-deserved acclaim.  As others have said, it is an excellent cooperative multiplayer game with very satisfying controls, varied levels, and superb production values in art and audio.\n\nAside from these things, what stood out to me was the game's decency.  It is *anti*-exploitative, quite deliberately excluding features like collectibles (let alone microtransactions) or character advancement that are predicated on Skinner box treatment of the player.  Rather than finding ways to [i]take[/i] more from the player (money, time, etc.), the developers have found ways to [i]give[/i] more to the player, with many small delights to be found.  In addition to not exploiting the player, the game doesn't exploit its characters -- only very occasionally playing the cheap tropes that the game's set-up would tend to invite.  The game's narrative may lack subtlety and surprise, but its straightforward positive message never feels preachy, perhaps because the scenario is so ridiculous.\n\nIt is rare to play a big-budget game (the credits go on FOREVER!) that seems to have as its goal that players will find a fun, full, satisfying experience and go away better than they came.\n- It's hard to review a game like this.\n\nAs a game in it's own right, if you've never played it before, it's a good game. Typical crazy Final Fantasy story (although it takes a bit to get into it), interesting characters, and simple but fun real-time turn-based combat. Final Fantasy games are known for their stories and characters, which are great in this member of the series.\n\nIf you've played the game before on PS1, then it's good for nostalgia. However, many people complain about it being a bad port. It has built-in cheats, in case you just want to be able to enjoy the story, characters, and side-quests. I played this years ago on PS1, and I really enjoyed my trip down memory lane with this game.\n\nIf you're an achievement hunter, this game is horrible. There are achievements that, unless you're literally following an online scripted step-by-step walkthrough, you will miss some random little thing, not know it, and then have to play the entire game over. Another achievement requires you to speed through the game in under 12 hours, which means you will grind through the game you already played, watching the same story you just watched, all over again, wasting six hours (that's how long it took me), just for the sake of one achievement... There's also another achievement to kill 10k enemies. when you can play the whole game and not even kill 1k enemies... You might think, \"oh they just want you to play the game through 10 times then\". No. It's 10k enemies in one playthrough. You run out of content, and have nothing to do, except grind battles, for literally dozens of hours. It's terrible.\n\nDespite my bitterness about the achievements, it's a really enjoyable game. Considering the FF series are mainly known for their stories, it lives up to its reputation. If you're an RPG fan, this is definitely on the list of \"must plays\".\n- I've read some of the negative reviews and name calling is petty so instead I'll just say a lot of those opinions are dumb.\n\nLook. This isn't Firewatch. This is a seven year old game that pissed off a lot of bros and continues (apparently, christ) to do so because it embraced not only being a walking simulator but a gay one at that. And yeah bro, 15 bucks seems steep for a game that you can finish in under an hour, but hell, maybe don't speed run? It's a walking simulator after all. Or maybe support indie game devs. *Or maybe* read the Steam tags that say \"short\" and \"walking simulator\" and then don't count that against the game. You don't review CS;GO and say \"not bad, but too much shooting\" right? RIGHT? \n\nLook. I've had some wine. And I've had some feelings. And Gone Home is a piece of video game history whether people want it to be or not. It's a game I wish I would have known about when it was first released. Hell I needed it five years earlier than that. \n\nIf you're pissed that Gone Home wasn't dramatic enough or that it's \"homosexual\" then maybe realize that this game wasn't made for you and that does not qualify it as bad. \n\nAnyway, that cat journal achievement was neat.\n- I'm 45, I've had good times and bad times.  I've fallen in love, grown up, gotten married, beaten alcoholism, \nhad a child, fought off depression, led my wife through her kidney failure, carried the death of loved ones, and come back from the brink.  I've weathered the storm of life like anyone else . . . I'm not special.  I'm not rich, but comfortable, and I've gathered quite a steam library as a hobby over the last 10 years.  Something I have rarely done, during my time with almost 4000 titles, is write a review.  Two, maybe three for 4000 games.  Think about that for a second.\n\nI'm 45.  I just cried playing a video game, something I can't ever remember doing.  I feel like my heart is going to burst.  It's joy, and sadness.  It's like a good memory with a parent who's long gone, bubbled up at random, making you laugh and ache at the same time.  It's bittersweet.\n\nThe music and visuals are subtle and flashy at the same time, they get under you and lift you up.  It's got spirit of the 60's, the heart of the 80's, and feels like every memorable video game trope from the 2000's, with the social softness of the 2020's.  It's huge and tiny at the same time, and thoughtfull and meditative together . . . it tells the story of leaving your comfort zone, and makes you comfortable.  It's heavy and light.  It's all of these and more.\n\nMy emotions are a flood.  I had to write a review, and let people know how I feel.  I can't describe it, I feel like I found my heart again, and I didn't even know it was lost.  Life was comfortable before 2:00pm today . . . now it's magical.  It's these small things that I forget, and remember, and then forget again . . . the birth of my son, the feeling of nervous sweetness on my first date with my wife, an unexpected comment from a random stranger about my eyes, finding an old photo of my dad that no one ever remembered taking --\n\n-- This game is like that sweet, fleeting memory.\n\nTL;DR:  45-year old man cries after finding his heart lost in a game, and writes a review while his wife asks him if he's okay.\n\n11/10, would purchase these feels again.\n- While i'm not far into it, so far it is great. All negative reviews are due to the stuttering. I have a 3070 and I googled a solution.\n\nWIth Nvidia GPUs go to Nvidia control panel and change the global shader cache size in 3d settings to unlimited. Also limit the fps of Elden Ring, I have it set to 60 fps. So far no problems on my end. Hope this helps somebody choosing to get the game.\nIf u have AMD GPUs I don't know specifics so please ask google sorry for not being able to help, but I know it is a similar process.\n\nNow 30hrs in the game is so good too\n\nNow done with the game it is amazing\n- Pros:\n\n+ Game mechanics that you would expect from a city builder\n\n+Built in modding tools\n\n+Beautiful Graphics\n\n+It's challanging (learning curve)\n\n+No lag, and I have a computer that doesn't meet the requirements\n\n+Lots of replayability\n\nCons:\n\n-takes over your life\n\n***\n\nSpecs that are below the minimum requirements:\n\n2.8ghz (3.0 is the minimum)\n\nAMD Radeon HD 8400 video card ( nVIDIA GeForce GTX 260, 512 MB  or ATI Radeon HD 5670, 512 MB is the minimum)\n\nEverything else is above the minimum required.\n- Civ 5, Heroes of Might and Magic had a baby together and that baby grew up and had a baby with Endless Space and this baby has now grown up and it is glorious in every level.\n\nIncredibly polished, incredibly neat, incredibly addictive and a game that stands out from the rest. If you like Empire-builders, this game is for you!\n\nIgnore the \"Early access\". This game is ready to be sold. I have only experienced one single bug in this game and the MP works like a clockwork. It's highly optimised, full of features and pretty to look at. I wish more Devs would make their games this way, it warms my heart!\n- [h1]Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Save scumming is a game-play mechanic and the game is balanced around the player being able to quick-save and reload whenever they want.\n[*] The game seems highly objective oriented, and I wish there was more optional treasures to collect, as I am a pirate.\n[*] While many guard situations appear to have a clear solution,  you can always just brute-force your way through or take another less contrived route, so the game doesn't devolve into a stealth puzzle game.\n[*] Post-game summary shows your route and enemy eliminations at hyper speed, and is always a fun watch at the end of a level.\n[/list]\nI really enjoy finally having a top-down style stealth game. Games such as Hard West and Divinity: Original Sin 2 also featured stealth elements but they were sorely lacking in favor of the turn based combat of the game. Furthermore, this game has pirates, making it an instant hit (for me).\n- I'm gonna be talking about the game in very broad strokes so don't worry about spoilers. \n\nI'm bananas about the Dead Space series. The experience of playing the original in 2009 or so left a massive impression on me and I think this is overall a pretty fantastic update. I've played the original [strike] trilogy [/strike] duology to death on every system, listened to stuff, looked at stuff, everything. So as someone who has Nicole's monologue burnt into the back of my eyelids, I was pretty sceptical Motive would be able to win me over with Dead Space 23. I was very pleasantly surprised, though. It's clear a lot of love and care went into refining Dead Space for the remake and in many ways I find these refinements make the setting, characters, and mysteries all a lot more compelling. \n\nOn the lead up to release there was an IGN series of short interviews with developers, artists, writers, etc working on the remake. It was really fascinating hearing about how they were approaching different aspects of the project, there's a lot of interesting insights about the aesthetic and thematic goals of the game in there that get me really craving a Dead Space 23 art book. If you're sceptical about Dead Space 23, I think they're worth a watch. It's really striking how thoughtful they've been in creating their take on Dead Space and I don't think their efforts deserve to go so easily overlooked. If you're really interested in the artistry of the series I'd also highly recommend The Art of Dead Space, it's a great book and an amazing collection of art that really lays bare the core identity of the series. It's been a great companion piece to Dead Space 23.  I think a lot of people have been comparing the choices and artistic aims of the original team and the new devs in bad faith, I really can't see anything but reverence for the source material here. I'd also say that the differences that are there are interesting and well worth exploring!\n\nI'm also glad Dead Space has room to breathe again, EA really pushed the extended universe the first time around and I'm glad to see that mistake hasn't been repeated. I'm not someone who's super into lore, I like finding extra information that re-contextualises things in cool ways but this extended universe stuff can get pretty silly. There were animated movies, books, tie-in games, a Wii rail shooter (which I enjoyed) and most of it just served to undermine the setting and the horror for me. That isn't to say the remake shies away from its roots because it absolutely doesn't, there's an entire New Game+ path that I think incorporates a direct reference to one of the extended universe novels. If you're a lorehead you'll definitely recognise familiar names in text logs, even very forgettable characters get some mentions in. I really love this about the remake, it reincorporates a lot of this disparate stuff into more of a coherent whole. \n\nI think my favourite addition is the AI director that manages encounters and atmospheric effects. Dead Space is a game that invokes hypervigilance, I think that's part of what makes the series so compelling. You're always alert, always listening and watching, always looking over your shoulder. It has an intensity that I feel is absolutely unmatched. With the AI director in the mix that feeling is sharper than ever. You can't rely on memory alone to get you through now. Yeah, you can still memorise spawns and there are still an abundance of scripted encounters but you can never safely bet you know what's coming and when. Sometimes the lights will flicker and steam will hiss from the pipes- nothing. But sometimes a pregnant and most of a divider will be waiting for you right by the shop. You can truly never assume you're safe, that feeling is no longer illusory as it was in Dead Space 2008. I think that's great. I also found that the director would spawn interesting combinations of enemy types which is cool, it went a long way to making the threat more unpredictable. \n\nI never really experienced any of the performance issues everyone else is talking about so I think my main issue with the game is very petty. I flat out do not like the redesign of the Soldier rig. They look like those guys who're really into Mandalorian themed tactical gear and Punisher stuff. So, yeah, not sure if that's an intentional update to reflect reality but, aesthetically speaking, I found it very jarring. \n\nI think this is a very solid foundation to build on to bring back the Dead Space series. I hope in the future there might be more challenge modes, higher difficulties, more unlockable suits. Most of all though I hope Motive, like their predecessors, take some pointers from the Resident Evil games. I'm a big fan of the records system in the recent Resident Evil titles. It contributes enormously to replayability and it's neat getting to examine all the models, animations, concept art, all the good stuff. As someone who likes crafts and fan projects, something like that would be indispensable. it's all work that very much deserves to be admired, too. Some of the detail on the necromorphs is ludicrous. A records system would also be a great excuse to do wild runs like beating the game without healing or opening the shop. Just give me a reason, Motive.\n\nThere are thousands of things about this remake that I could just keep gushing about. Maybe I'll update this review over time and do just that (I have). But I hope for now this review has gone some way to convincing you to try out Dead Space. \n\nTanya Clarke killed it as Nicole, too.\n- the game itself is pretty ok and fun for what it is, and runs great on deck. but man, F**K THE ALWAYS-ONLINE-DRM WHICH AT TIMES TAKES AGES TO CONNECT, GETTING THE GAME STUCK IN THE MENU WITH NOTHING TO DO!!\n\n>> Update after 20h played:\nI really enjoy playing the game. It is good, it is fun and runs great on the Steam Deck, which is especially important to me, as I tend to travel a lot as part of my job.\n\nThat being said, however, is core of the issue: The Always-On-DRM actually prevents me from playing this game on the go. Having this sort of DRM is, in my opinion, only predatory and inexcusable in any way. I get that the online-components of the game will not work when I am on the move, but I am mainly interested in the single player experience, from which I am also locked out. I am even locked out of the main menu without a stable internet collection, which is just ridiculous.\n- Okay so,\n\nFirst off, the Streaming of the game play yesterday did this title zero favours. Whoever made the decision to allow a copy of the game which was 400 builds behind to be live streamed made a mistake.\n\nThe character creation is a nice touch, makes you think and get involved with it characteristics of the nation you pick to play as. I like this and rarely see stuff like this in game.\n\nThe Steam page states 'SuperPower 3 is tailor-made for all the megalomaniacs out there who are convinced they can do a much better job at running the world than real politicians and military leaders across the globe'. That's a rather bold statement for a game that has 5 or 6 laws you can change for a whole country...., \n\nOverall the game in its current state is incredibly basic and lacks any depth in regards to the actual management and running of a country. No parliaments behind a leader etc, why? Even the excuse of the focus is around you and your characters decisions doesn't make much sense. It takes away the feeling of running a country, that which you are describing in the games description. Where are the ministers, the scandals that come with the running of a country?\n\nThe game isn't a write off, I personally feel it will be good in time but looks to be missing alot. Overall 5/10. Product refunded.\n- The playtime I have on Steam is nowhere close to the amount of time I've put into this game on Xbox.\n\nWhen I first heard of Tetris Effect back in 2018, I was so mesmerized by the visuals the game had. Everything looked amazing, and I really wanted to try and play it. Shame I didn't have a PS4.\n\nThe game had a multiplayer release on Xbox, and when I first heard about it, I bought a copy instantly, finally ready to experience the game on PC.\n\nI'm not exaggerating when I say that buying this game actually changed my life.\nWhen I bought this game I not only got to play one of my favorite games in a completely unique experience, but I managed to find an amazing community to boot. Since then, I've accomplished so much in the game, befriended lots of people, and managed to change several aspects of myself.\n\nThis game has been a perfect mixture of visual, auditory, and emotional presentation, and it's given me tons of inspiration for multiple projects.\n\nIf you're shrugging this game off as \"just Tetris\", please take a look at a playthrough. Calling this game \"just Tetris\" is a massive injustice to the creativity, effort, love, and time that the development team have put into this.\n\nI have been following this game for nearly a year now. I wouldn't have it any other way.\n- I have been a big fan of the Halo series since CE so I may be a bit biased but yea.\n\nPositives\n- Good campaign\n- Fun coop\n- Good story\n- Good mechanics\n- Graphics are good\n- Good price, honestly don't wouldn't even wait for it to go on sale\n\nCons\n- I have noticed a sound delay every now and again\n- A few graphical glitches every now and again, not really regular\n- The fact they exchanged the original Halo Reach XP and levelling system with \"seasons\" \n     - Can no longer just buy what you want, you need to play 4 million mp matches just to \n       unlock the helmet you want then repeat that for the matching chest piece in the next \n       season\n     - Can no longer get experience from the campaign (Edit: This has since been updated so \n       you can ear medals from campaign but you still can't directly earn xp) \n     - The maximum experience able to be collected is to low for the later levels. I think the max \n        should be lifted fro everyone, or slowly go up depending on what level you are\n- How long it takes to level up is just stupid. It was good for the first few levels then it feels like there is a massive jump in time.\n- A few audio glitches here and then. (For me anyway you need to be facing the sound to hear it, even if its over comms\n\nI love the game and would honestly recommend it but think a few things could be changed in my personal opinion.\n- ... and G*d said let there be Mushihimesama. An extremely accessible and satisfying bullet hell vertical shooter developed by Cave Interactive which debuted on the PS2 and has been ported to multiple systems.   The Steam version controls perfectly, plays almost perfectly and looks satisfactory given its age.\n\nThree modes; Novice (highly accessible for beginners), Normal, Arrange, Ver. 1.5 (dlc)\nThree sub modes for each mode; Original, Maniac, Ultra.\n\nMultiple scoring strategies and works with direct input and xinput controllers, \n\nFull compliment of Steam Features;\n[list]\n[*]Plenty of achievements\n[*]Cloud saving\n[*]Trading Cards \n[*]Leader-boards\n[*]Remote Play TV / Together.\n[/list]\n\nNot only is Mushihimesama a fantastic game to experience, instilling a let's do that again after every play-through, Mushihimesama bleeds Starship Trooper vibes.  A remarkable vertical shooter which all shooter fans must experience.\n- OBJECTION, YOUR HONOR!\n\nHow can it be a hate crime if my client loved doing it?\n- The Graphics of this game don't match the high price tag\n- The Steam version of this game has some serious problems, most notably the high chance of losing your entire account. The game's servers have sync issues with Steam, and thus are not reliable at saving your progress. I played for 8 hours only to lose all progress and the entire account, forcing a restart from scratch.\n\nIf you link your google account, this seems to provide a reliable way for the game to save your progress, but nothing ever tells you this. It's absolutely inexcusable that the Marvel Snap servers cannot link to a unique Steam account without needing to link a gmail.\n\nAside from these massive issues, the gameplay is quite fun. However, the UI is a straight mobile port and needs a total overhaul. It also demonstrates a lot of the annoyances of mobile games, such as constant rewards and notifications littered all over the UI pointing you to those rewards.\n\nIf you can look past some very serious issues, as stated above, the game is very enjoyable.\n- I wish there were a \"mixed\" option for recommending this game, as I think for a lot of people out there, this is a fantastic game, and it's definitely well made with a lot of love and attention to detail in many respects. I really like puzzles and problem solving, so part of my disappointment with The Witness is that I really thought I would enjoy the game. Myst was one of my favorite games growing up, and I was extremely excited to see a well-reviewed game in the Myst genre surface after far too long. \n\nThe problem for me was that The Witness is very much a game about the journey, and not the destination. It turns its head on the genre as it's less a game about solving puzzles within a set of rules, and more about discovering what those rules are. And for the most part, it does that well. Instead of the usual game conventions, rewards for solving hard puzzles weren't any kind of story unlock, more just to give you a harder puzzle. That approach was fun for awhile, but some story unlock would've been appreciated, especially because there is so much mystery and it's such an immersive world that was clearly built for a reason and has a fascinating backstory. \n\nSome of the mechanics also just seem arbitrary, or at the very least, not quite obvious enough. Sometimes perspective puzzles require you to either take a screenshot or jot down on pencil and paper the answer, then transfer it on screen. That seems like lazy game design and worst of all, takes you out of the immersive experience. It's possible I'm mostly tone deaf, as some of the sound puzzles seemed almost impossible to me, despite numerous listens. There's also just the repetitiveness of the \"pathfinding\" puzzles, which range from challenging (and satisfying) to punitive in their difficulty spikes. It's in these difficulty spikes where I think the core game mechanic of pathfinding lets you down, as it requires you to be much more of a planner than a \"hands on\" problem solver. In a game like this, I would think it would accommodate multiple approaches, but really there's a right way to approach this game, and a wrong way. Unfortunately for me, I think the way I approach puzzles (trial and error) is strongly discouraged, at times in punitive ways. \n\nThe philosophy from the audio/video portions will likely be appreciated by some, and for some come off as the worst kind of douchey-hipster nonsense. Had they been delivered in shorter pieces, I might've fallen into the former. But as rambling as some of them are, I found them more annoying than enjoyable unfortunately. \n\nI don't know, I'm really torn on this. It's a well made game, and while it seems so open and non-confined, I found the game to be far too linear in mechanics and how to approach problem solving. At times it actually made me feel like a lesser thinker because I have a different approach to puzzles than what the game designer prefers. What I'm sure is a really fun journey for some, left me disappointed with the destination. \n\nAm realizing this reads a lot like an apology for not liking this game, which I think it is. I really, really wanted to love The Witness, but in the end, not only was this game not for me, but I genuinely feel lesser for that fact because I feel like I should have loved it, and just didn't.\n- One of the most likable FPS game in recent years.\nGreat for free roaming and exploring and the combat is challenging enough to keep one on their toes.\n\nAnd, surprising, has a very good story to it.\n\nBest Far Cry to date.\n- Remember the way Monkey Island 2 ended? That weird mess that confused the hell outta everybody? Well, the first 15 minutes of this game manage to \"save\" it completely and suddenly, it all makes sense.\n\nAnd this is just one reason (out of many, many reasons I will experience as I play this game, I believe) you owe it to yourself to play RtMI. \nThank you, Ron!\n\nEDIT: 3+ hours in and I love it! The music is there, the humor is there, and it's the perfect combination of nostalgia and fresh. The puzzles so far are fun and the inclusion of a hint book as an inventory item that never gets in your way is rather clever. Oh, and I love the trivia book! Really tests your knowledge of the series! \n\nYou can clearly tell that this game is a labor of love. And the art style - love it or hate it - simply works when you see it in motion.\n\nEDIT 2: Have a drink whenever someone mentions \"The Secret of Monkey Island\". Now there's an idea for a party game that will get everyone drunk! :D\n- At a first glance I thought I would hate [b]Human Fall Flat[/b]. \n“Oh, this is another one of those wonky psychics ragdoll games that are obnoxiously hard to control,” I thought. \n...\nAfter playing it, I can now confidently say that my first impression was spot on. The only surprise was how much I enjoyed playing it. \n \n[h1][u]Positive:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]I can’t fully explain why but I found Human Fall Flat charming. The “human” is adorably simplistic and can complete daunting tasks despite only being able to jump and grab onto things. It reminds me of a very energetic toddler, especially when you raise your arms and jump - [b]it’s so cute[/b]. Something about an awkward “human” taking on challenges makes me feel warm inside [i](is it weird that I feel like I’m watching a baby grow up?)[/i]. \n[*]The levels gradually get larger and the puzzles more complex. I find that this works well with the awkward movements of your character, as you progressively learn how to better control him/her. It’s almost as if you start off as a clumsy baby, learning how to move and perform simple tasks, and end up as an awkward adult, still clumsy but expected to complete harder tasks. \n[*]I’m impressed at how many interactable objects are included in this game. Paired with a pretty good physics engine and you can really have a blast. Swing on a vine like Tarzan? Why not. Row a boat? Sure. Shoot yourself out of a catapult? No one’s stopping you.\n[/list]\n\n[h1][u]Neutral:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]It’s not always clear what you are expected to do, but I guess that’s kind of the point of Human Fall Flat? From what I could tell, you can get past the obstacles in whatever way you like. Sure, there’s the intended way, but if you want you can just climb over things and rush to the end of the level. Or you can just fool around to your heart’s content. It’s essentially one big playground with a goal at the end. \n[/list]\n\n[h1][u]Negative:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]It can be frustrating when things don’t go as you expect. Since your character has the structural rigidity of jelly, you’re constantly battling the floppiness of your character. My advice is: don’t expect to move with precision and you’ll have a good time. I also encountered a few bugs, like my arms or legs getting stuck in an object. Luckily there are many checkpoints and it’s relatively quick to reload.\n[/list]\n \n[h1][u]Conclusion:[/u][/h1]\n[h1]★★★✬☆ Surprisingly fun[/h1]\nI was honestly surprised at how much fun I had playing Human Fall Flat. I tend to avoid ragdoll/physics-y games - Getting Over It, for example, looks like an absolute nightmare to me - but I don’t regret playing Human Fall Flat at all. \nHuman Fall Flat is an absolute blast if you don’t take it too seriously or just like goofing around. I wouldn’t recommend it if you prefer serious games, as it’s very likely that you will just end up getting frustrated. The choice is entirely yours. \n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th][h1]If you enjoyed this review please follow me on my [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/26827738-%27b-Reviews/?appid=241930]curator page[/url] and [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/breviews]group[/url].

It has NO useful Steam integration whatsoever. It launches the game through Origin, and you can only invite friends through Origin. If you've already got Titanfall 2 on Origin, you may as well skip this. \n\nTHAT SAID\nTitanfall 2 is one of the greatest (if not [i]the[/i] greatest first person shooters of our generation. The game's four years old, I'm not sure I can say anything that hasn't been said before.  The story is short and sweet, and genuinely really really good. The multiplayer is the meat of this game, and it's fantastic. Movement is fast and fun, shooting feels great (I mean, these dudes made Modern Warfare, so), piloting a giant robot is sick as hell.\n\nI don't know what to tell you. If you play FPSs and you've never tried Titanfall 2, you owe it to yourself to buy this game.\n- \"It has guns, swords, sexy characters, cheesy dialogues, and a whole lot of action. What more do you want?\" somebody posted and is recommending this pile of poo. How about not some random boring braindead splatterfest like this crap? Apparently a good lot of people actually have a need filled with this random gore generator.

You do not need to have played the original to play or enjoy this game. Their stories are completely seperate.\n\nThe game itself is much less linear than its predecessor. The best way I can explain the feeling of going through the environments without referencing Grimrock itself is by saying it felt an awful lot like Myst to me, just with combat. Required puzzles for progression were challenging but not impossible, some of the secret challenges were much more difficult. I admit I used an online guide more than a few times, but it did nothing to diminish my enjoyment of the game. It is immersive, challenging, and satisfying. \n\nThe only drawback I can think of is the difficulty. It feels like you cannot win with any group composition, I suggest no more than 2 of any class or weapon/armor type user. I went with a warrior, two rogues(one range), and a mage, this way you as well makes you unlikely to complete a difficult fight or puzzle and be rewarded with something you cannot use. Combat itself can be challenging as I said, but you will rarely feel like you are simply incapable of winning. There are obvious ways to optimize the way you approach an encounter the second time if you die the first.\n\nBe prepared to immerse yourself, you must pay attention to your surroundings, read and remember notes you find, explore every nook and cranny you can find, and you will be rewarded. Good luck!\n\n- Classic Mortal Kombat with modern-day graphics & extra mechanics.\nA Fun Educational Game For learning more about the inner workings of the Human Body and Skeletal system.\nfamily friendly pg clean game for children!\n\nHere Is How To Fix The Crashing Problem! \n< Go to your library, click on MKX.\n> Locate the part that says \"DLC\", it should be right below the achievements.\n< You'll see Install pack 1 through 20 something.\n> Select all of them and they will begin to install manually.\n\nhope you enjoy playing.\nGood Luck🌹\n7.5/10\n- I'll make this quick.\n\nThis game has been amazing fun so far.\n\nLiving in a clan is definitely a unique thing for farming sims, and it even helps with the gameplay. You're not working for yourself in Roots of Pacha - you're working for the betterment of your tribe. The better you do, the better everyone does and visa versa. \n\nI love exploring to find new seeds, herbs, animals and materials... I actually find myself staying up until nearly 2am in game almost every day because of that. \n\nThe npcs seem to be an interesting bunch too, but I have to say that I've yet to see many events with them. This is something that I'm looking forward to though because the writing has been enjoyable so far too. \n\nIts my opinion that if you're an enjoyer of \"cozy\" games like Animal Crossing, Stardew Valley, Coral Island and  others like them, you'll likely enjoy Roots of Pacha as well. I've been telling my friends they should check it out.\n- I haven't played a game that manages to make me cry and fill me with courage this fiercely in a long while. You should definitely play this if you are looking for a good story. You are going to love it.\n- To be completely honest, throughout my entire playthrough, I was thinking on giving this game a \"Not Recommended\" but it really wouldn't have deserved it. This game is at the same time both very difficult to recommend as to not recommend. It is really a beatiful and extremely original game, with a pretty well told interesting story. However, the problem it has is that it doesn't really work as a puzzle game. Puzzle solutions don't make logical sense most of the time and you end up brute forcing your way through most of the game. This means trying every posibility until something works and moves the story foward, and this is just not good puzzle design. This also distracts you from the story being told, which is in itself not so easy to understand, it requirers you to be paying attention to details, so your brain has to be constantly switching between \"puzzle mode\" and \"story mode\". Anyway, you can tell a lot of love was put into this game, and that is why I ultimately recommend it.\n7.5/10-\n- probably the first game on steam with tags 'gore' and 'puzzle' :) \nand if gore and puzzles are your thing, you will enjoy this game..a lot :)\n- Was a bit turn off when I saw it was a stationary shooter, but the game is so fun I look past that and even began to enjoy the room scaling dodging mechanics (game can make you work up a sweat!).\n\nA must for anyone looking for a more intense arcade shooting experience. I cannot overstate how fun it is to build your weapons in VR, the crafting system works flawlessly and seemely without the need of menus or UIs getting in the way, props for the devs for how well the game integrates with VR controls.\n\nWhat I liked:\n- Varied enemies\n - Great VR controls\n- Gun crafting is addicting and allows for a lot of experimentation\n- Great Bosses\n\nWhat I had trouble with:\n- Makes you wish you could run around the rooms like the original game!\n- The reduced FOV of most VR headsets makes it quite difficult to keep track of enemies that come from multiple directions. Some rooms require so much head movement that I tend to get sick.\n- When a room spawns with multiple shield pylons and a healer bot, it gets extremely frustrating if you have slow moving projectile weapons.\n\nWishes:\n- More gun parts! (Maybe future DLC?)\n- majority of the negative reviews are from people who dont have controller and are to lazy to remap the controls\nit takes 5 minutes to remap and theres one too many buttons for the mouse\noveral gameplay 10/10 reminds me of when i was 7 playing dynasty warriors 4, i havent experienced any bugs unlike one piece, also you get to set the characters weapons to whatever you want thats awesome\nPORT WARRIORS OROCHI 2 AND 3\n- Overrated. \n\n\nFirst half of the game is amazing. You start out with nothing, enter a mine and slowly progress, get new tools, upgrade existing ones and collect resources for one of the progression types. Platforming and digging smart (so you don't lock yourself out of resources) is a huge part of the opening experience. \n\nLater in game you get a grappling hook and rocket shoes and that's when the game loses its identity. The the game shifts its focus towards puzzles and platforming while making you deal with hordes of annoying enemies. Mining no longer requires any attention and becomes more of a chore. Most tiles become impossible to break. Most enemies have gimmicks that make them a nuisance. Areas where you'll spend most time have mostly unbreakable tiles. Even if you find destructible ares, hook and rocket shoes ensure you don't have to think too much (unlike in first half of the game).\n- please don't give an ironic positive review for this \"game\". It truly deserves the tag of \"overwhelmingly negative\" reviews.\n- [h1] A BETTER MINECRAFT, AND I WILL TELL YOU WHY[/h1]\nwith terrain deformation and creation, crafting etc its only normal that the first comparison that comes to mind is with minecraft. But it is better than minecraft.\n\n[h1]The Gameplay[/h1]\nMinecraft has a glaring problem: [b]the gathering of resources.[/b]\nsure its fun to explore caves but to go and search for the material that you need get boring very fast. \n\nIn Astroneer you have a vacuum to literally [b]suck up the material that you need[/b], and in the advanced stages big buggies to mine faster and carry more, and then even auto-extractors.\nSure you need to go to specific planets to find a specific materials, but that just adds to the fun of exploration and space travel.\n\n\n[b]Then there's what to do with said minerals.[/b] \nIn minecraft you mine and mine and for what? to create a different colored house? seriously whats the point?\nWhile in astroneer there is a reason, to create vehicles, to create different structures to refine said materials, to go explore faster.\n\n\nIn other words, and i guess the key of this review: \n[spoiler] Astroneer feels like a feature complete minecraft.[/spoiler]\n\n\n[h1] The bad things with it [/h1]\n[b]-There's no soundtrack.[/b] i mean there is, but its some random notes pushed casually.\n\n[b]-the ending.[/b] \n[spoiler]There is no ending. you just collect the planet cores and put them onto the asteroid. barely a minute long cut scene, and credits roll. it doesn't unlock anything, it feels unfinished, all that build-up for nothing.[/spoiler]\n\n[b]-⚠️⚠️⚠️Anybody from your steam list can join your server and create havoc!!⚠️⚠️⚠️[/b]\nNo way to make the server private. \nNo way to kick people.\nNO SOUND THAT ANYBODY EVEN JOINED!!\nits a disaster waiting to happen!! please change this at all costs!!!\n- I really, really wanted to like this game.\n\nI preface this review by saying that Guacamelee 1 is in my top 10 games of all time. I've been a gamer for 33 years. Sotn, Chrono Trigger, and FFVII are my go-tos. G-Melee 1 is a charming and original romp through a metroidvania style genre.\n\nGuacamelee 2 fails so ridiculously hard, it actually makes me sad when I think about it. The puzzles are uninspired, the abilities don't really feel enjoyable, and the platforming elements are just unforgivingly tight for the sake of it. I had all the \"schools\" maxed out before the end, it didnt make me feel any more powerful. I didn't have that super saiyan mode like in GM 1.\n\nThe final bossfight is a 3/10 compared to the first game where it is at BARE MINIMUM 9/10.\n\nI wish I could rank this game higher because I adore the original. However, this became a slog several hours before I could finish it. I would not recommend this to anyone, ever. It's light on the humor and story, it requires you to be invested in the previous game. The mechanics aren't new and they threw in some unnecessary tight, like razor thin, platforming into the game.\n- imagine a AAA-RPG game in 2021 w/o game breaking bugs.\n\nonly problem i have with this game is the monetization aka MTX, you can buy Gald, boost items, straight up level ups etc, i personally do not care if a game has those buyable options or not HOWEVER when you constantly get it shoved in your face it's suuuuper annoying, start up the game, ! symbol on the main menu, leading to... yes the steam store, if this would be the only encounter i'd still be fine with it but it isn't, rest on bonfires and you have yet another icon with the ! symbol trying to get you to buy any of the boosters or outfits or whatnot.\n\ngenerally speaking this game is fantastic, soundtrack, graphics, VAs, cutscenes etc. however the MTX ads in the game that remind me more of the \"hey click this\" approach of mobile games is horrible, should have kept it in the main menu but keep it out of my actual gameplay.\n- Most stable game I ever played?\nPlayed multiplayer with 3 ppl living across the world from me, \nnever desynch, never a lag, never any issue at all except some very very minor stuff.\n\nMasterful really, well done.\nGREAT GAME TOO!\n- When I show new games to one of my friends she always asks if it is possible to pee in the game and sadly I usually must tell her that it isnt possible because there is so few games where this special detail is being paid attention to. But this here my dude! I tried to show her the game yesterday so I got her setup on the valve index and start the game all good, but we couldn’t move at all... We tried everything! We tried physically move in our vr room to see the boards that had text written on them because we spawned behind them which I found a little weird as well. On the board it said eat the hamburger to start the game or eat the poo to guit. I saw a box on the street and I remembered by seeing the trailer there was a box where inside there was a burger so immediately we worked hard to try and reach the burger so we could start the game. It was too far away for us to try and actually in real life walk to it so we had to just accept defeat. She didn’t get to see her first vr game where it would be possible to urinate. I saw a update post a few minutes ago where you were saying something about movemnet in the game that you have to grip and throw arms around or something? This I guess we didn’t try since usually moving is one of the triggers to teleport or just the stick like in any controller. Today we will try again and hopefully succeed in our task to urinate in a vr game! You could be making history today my friend. And for all the bad reviews for this game I want to just say a couple things: cmon dude. Its one guy whos making this game! It is cheap and early access... those already tell you a lot about the game and you should not expect a triple a title and the experience of the century. I went through a video game making school or whatever which took 3 years so it was not 2 weeks online course I just quit after the first week so I actually know a lot what it takes to make games and with this I can tell there has been some hours used to it, but again it’s only one dude. My game didn’t work either, but it might have been because we didn’t know how to play. I’m not complaining for 4 dollars, I’m not a hobo ;)\n\nEDIT: And there it is! A day after my review and a 170mb update with new features and a fix for not been able to play at all :) I wasn't able to walk earlier either, but I suppose yo may not be able to in the \"mainmenu\". Gotta go try the update once my friend visits again!\n- WTF, this isn’t gaming! Where are my lootboxes and micro transactions?!\n\nMy main thought after I beat GRIS was, \"I don't really understand anything that just happened, but it sure was pretty.\"\n\nI was absolutely amazed how a game with zero actual dialogue could move me to tears, just on strenght of its visuals and music. In general, the whole theme of dealing with grief/depression spoke to me in a way that I didn't expect.  It's one of those games you play to \"feel\" more than for the gameplay itself.\n\nI have PTSD from dealing with my wife getting a boyfriend, and this game made me cry several times while playing it. Especially during the scene where you're swimming away from the eel. That symbolism to me perfectly captures the feeling of trauma recovery. I'd spent time finding the little lights throughout that section of the game and activating the turtle which ultimately saved me from my own darkness and helplessness.\n\nIt felt like hope. It was such a good representation of how the coping skills I'd learned and the hard work I'd put in were finally seeming to pay off. It's when you're at your weakest that you learn how strong you actually are. I cried like a baby during and after that scene. It made me realize how much I've actually overcome, and how grateful I am to be free.\n\nGris truly is a beautiful game and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a slow paced experience. The only bit of criticism I have for the game is it certainly gives \"not like the other girls\" vibes at times, but I think this is quite easy to get over.\n\nIn conclusion: the visuals are stunning,  the music is beautiful and knows exactly when to kick in, the platforming elements are fantastic, and it’s story and themes are spectacular without a single word. Truly a must-play.\n\n10/10\n- Full disclosure: I'm not a racing guy. I'm not a car guy, even. My extent of car knowledge begins and ends at \"vroom-vroom go that way.\"\n\nBut that's all you need to know for this game. I can tune the holy bejeezus out of a million sliders that mean absolutely nothing to me, or I can just equip a premade setting by someone who does and suddenly the vroom-vrooms are *better*. Not sure when to brake or start a turn? Easy, there's a friendly line. Follow the line, make less vroom-vrooms when it's red, everything's gravy. Don't have the reaction time to follow the line? You can slow the game down until it's at a pace where you can. Incredible.\n\nYou can be as serious as you want with it. Me, I'm taking my van that's dolled up to look like the Mystery Machine and ramping it off a volcano.\n- 1 week before release i played the demo, it was a 20 minutes demo that was very underwhelming, but i still thought i should give the game a chance to see if it gets better later on.\n\nIt doesn't.\n\nSo the first thing i read about this game in the embed of the steam link was \"a fresh take on the jrpg genre\", and its probably the biggest problem of the game. It is really the most basic, mediocre turn base combat you can find.\n\nTurn base combat, rock paper scissor elemental types plus physical, materia base skills with few spots (i had only 4 skills activated),  no gear, no party. Does that sound like a fresh take to you?\n\nSo if the gameplay is so barebones it means is at least hard right? Well no, it is basic and easy. The start is easy, in the mid part they blow up the HP of enemies so you understand you should buy new skills, and once you do it the game is easy again. Mob enemies are generally harder than bosses because you are 1vs3 most of the time, while in bosses you can just debuff it and make it slow, while you have 2 turns to spam healings and hitting. There also some questionable decisions on the minor mechanics of the combat system but i don't think they matter (see some paragraphs below)\n\nNow here is what is really the \"fresh take\": the setting being cyberpunk. Everything is written with tech terminology. The mana is called data, block and delay turn is called cache, melee combat is called hack? some of the terms don't even make sense of what they actually do. Also because we obviously live in a technological society we have people called \"V-sync\" or \"Nullpointer\", expresions like \"Digits!\" or \"Oh my grind!\", you know, normal behaviour if you ask me.\n\nThe story is pretty standard for a futuristic setting, it wasn't bad but also it wasn't good, pretty normal.\n\nThe artstyle is cool, the music is generally cool, which i think its why most people would don't mind the boring gameplay and will just play for the story, which is also present in the game itself because you have options to either skip every random encounter (yeah we have those here) or to insta win every battle when you want it.\n\nSo if you want to try this game because of the \"fresh take in the jrpg genre\" you will be disappointed, if you have played jrpgs before there is nothing new in this game, you have already played it before.\n- Remember when Doom 2016 released the multiplayer beta test first, and we rightfully worried the game would be a flop? Thankfully, the campaign instead blew us away.\n\nI enjoyed my first run through 2016, but only moderately so. In the original Dooms, if you never stop moving, enemies truly can never hit you. With 2016, however, enemies lead their shots if you move predictably. Also, if you leave line of sight, the demons will fire several more predict shots, in case you re-engage from the same vantage point.\n\nI failed to adapt initially. Instead, I blamed the game, claiming it felt unfair compared to the originals.\n\nThen, I stumbled upon Clockner's playthrough of Doom. He showed me a skill ceiling I never dreamed possible. Next came ByteMe's speedrun performance at QuakeCon 2019. I noticed when the demons charged their shots, he would at times hold still and bait for them to aim before dodging at the last second.\n\nThe excuses were off. Doom has transformed after 25 years. The enemies are now more intelligent (yet not overly so). I too needed to evolve.\n\nAs I took on my Ultra Nightmare run (over 3-4 months), I developed a deep knowledge of every level, and in the process, became fond of every inch, as if the entire UAC and Hell were my homes. UN felt like such an accomplishment. After that, I tried to take on an all runes/weapons/challenges mastered run (no grinding). I failed the first two times. With Eternal around a day or two away, I just completed this challenge on my third try. Personally, I leave satisfied with nothing left.\n\nI initially had gripes with 2016, only to learn the developers were one step ahead. When a team/game proves me wrong, I am loyal forever.\n\nDoom 2016 will now be uninstalled from my machine, never again to be reinstalled. May your thirst for blood never quench. And may we never need you again.\n\nTo me, Doom 2016 is also Eternal 🙏.\n- I had to purchase Scarlet Hollow after witnessing the excitement of Episode 4 through my friends. I immediately binged the first three episodes the following day and found myself and in rather different spot compared to their playthrough. The choices you make in SH are actually impactful - which is (unfortunately) quite refreshing for the genre! I've since run through several different routes to explore more of the story (and collect those achievements!). While you have the ability to skip through previously seen text, lines within replayed conversations are shaped by your selected traits, choices, and previously selected dialogue; you won't be skipping that many lines before seeing new content. Similarly, characters may be painted in an entirely different light based on choices you've made. The cast and writing truly nails the small town feel of SH (gossip and all). \n\nMake sure you eat the takeaway container in the fridge. Thank me later.\n- It's an asset flip. I know that's a bit obvious, but just in case you were in doubt, there you go.\n\nFull of bugs, rushed, empty, poor sound/animation/ai/overall design quality, completely broken english, barely functioning UI, you get the picture, it's a cash grab.\n- As a Spider-Man fan, this game is a real treat. It was fantastic 4 years ago on release for the PS4, and it's even more fantastic now that it's finally on PC. If you're a Spidey fan, especially one who deeply appreciates the mythos and the message is represents, then this game is 100% for you. The writing, visuals, audio and gameplay are all wonderful, through and through. It's a true labour of love, Insomniac did an incredible job. Bring on the Miles Morales port!\n- A very good recursive Sokoban. Highly recommended and see more details in this review:\n[quote zholobov]A very good recursive Sokoban.

After landing on the planet you find a strange device that helps you get back on board and survive until help arrives.\n\nGreat game, get it on sale, because it is a bit short. I like games like Portal 2, The Talos Principle, and there is no point to compare this games, because they are completly different, even if they have few common things like solving riddles and story with fresh look at some philosophical questions. Point is that every one of them including The Swapper is good at what it do, and every one of them is unique. For me it is pleasure to play this game beacause of it atmospheric well done design, riddles and questioning the meaning of existence.\n- Doublefine: How did Psychonauts flop? Why did nobody buy our enjoyable artistic platformer?\nUs: You didn’t market it. Heck, I legit thought it was a horror game when I got it as a kid.\nDoublefine: Well, either way, now that it’s a cult classic – we made a sequel.\nUs: Awesome, when is that coming out anyway?\nDoublefine: It’s already out. We just didn’t market it again.\n- [h1]The Good[/h1]\n- Cop System.\n- Best progression in a need for speed game in years.\n- Genuinely fun and engaging, builds on the foundation of nfs2015 while taking the good mechanics from payback to make a compelling game. If the need for speed hype was still around people would stop asking for most wanted again because want it or not this is it, even if it falls short on a few cases.\n- Feel of \"speed\".\n- Insanely beautiful, runs super well, amazing lighting. Looks good on both day and night.\n- Day and night have different purposes in the game, and the fact you can choose is pretty cool as well. You can sweat if you want or if you want just races you can stay in the day.\n- Visual customization with community decals, let's go!\n- Online entirely optional, is kind of the same as nfs2015 instead of payback having the singleplayer map but instead allowing free roam drivers which is pretty cool\n- Car profiles like we have in forza, no more taking a racing car into the offroad! They actually perform as they should!\n- Good map\n- Crossplay\n- Character customization\n\n[h1]The Bad[/h1]\n- Cop System. It has a lot of rough edges that will piss you off. Yes it's the difficulty players wanted but also too much rubberbanding, \"rhino incoming\" taking half your screen not actually letting you see the rhino, game basically requiring you to abuse ramps because there's no proper way to actually deal with cops, etc.\n- Story is short and shitty. Payback as mid as it was did the \"corrupt cop\" storyline better\n- Progression system is taken back by the included powerful starter cars which came from the deluxe edition. It's fine since it's included but I hate how good features are destroyed with certain executive decisions\n- No post-release support, as it's the case with EA games\n- Need origin to play\n- Lots of bugs\n\n[h1]Neutral[/h1]\n- Overall teenager aesthetic. I like the neon style, but the overall teenager stuff and spanish characters (which are here because of the la casa de papel trend) just don't click with me. I just cringe all over the marketing material and how the characters engage\n- 21:9 support is fine not considering the map which doesn't scale to 21:9 unfortunately\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nThis is it boys. Need for speed is back!\n- An interesting experience for RPGMaker vidya enthusiasts.\n\nBefore you pick up this title, be sure to download and play the demo, as the demo is the (free) first episode of the series, this game being the second episode.\n\nA Psychological Thriller, as stated in the description, is probably the best way to describe this series, an adventure through bizzare yet oddly pretty settings.\n\nThe first episode is quite a fun, humorous adventure, but still manages to be gripping and gut-wrenching in some areas. Difficult for me to describe in words, but it's free, so there's no reason not to play it.\n\nThe second episode strays from the fun, humorous side of things and focuses more on story, an unexpected yet completely welcome change of tone. If you enjoyed the first and got to like the characters, the second episode is well worth the price.\n\nFeel free to pick it up if it seems interesting to you.\n- First off, just want to say this isn't a Metroidvania. This is a Zelda clone. And a good one!\n\nI bought this game because I heard it really put stress on you. You have limited time to complete the game and NPCs will begin dying if you aren't fast enough. Pretty crazy, right? Well, I do have a few gripes with that, but let me point out the good stuff first:\n+ Amazing combat. You have access to both guns and swords, but most of your damage will likely come from melee weapons since they have the ability to do an extremely-easy-to-pull-off PARRY! Parrying an enemy stuns it and gives your next attack against it a massive damage multiplier. All enemies, all bosses, and most projectiles are parryable, so this is what combat ends up revolving around. Even though I call it easy, you still get that cool feeling when you walk into an ambush and clear it without taking a hit, so it never gets dull as you go through the game.\n\n+ Good dungeon design. Since this game takes after Zelda, it's not shy about inserting a few puzzles into its dungeons. The overworld as well has quite a few surprising secrets and side quests that you won't be expecting when you play for the first time.\n\n+ Sequence breaks. This is mostly for New Game+ (or New Game Extra, a separate mode where you have access to major exploration items from the start, but not your whole endgame inventory), but it was interesting to find out how many secret paths and shortcuts there were, and how tightly they were managed. The devs thought of everything!\n\nSo now for the bad stuff.\n- Underwhelming story. Guess how much is really explained over the course of this story. If you guessed \"all of it\", you would be completely wrong and here's your dunce hat. Unsighted ends up spending so much of its time on the protagonist's relationships that it fails to answer several of the more important questions concerning the game's backstory. Why was there was a war? Who started it? Where are the humans now? Why are they so disorganized? Why do they seem to have no chain of command whatsoever? How did the automatons ever win anything at all at any point when they seem so extremely outclassed? I guess it doesn't matter. Look, there's two robot-girls kissing.\n\n- Fake pressure. I heard there was going to be pressure before I started the game, so I decided to go DEFCON 1 from the get-go and rush everything. I ended up completing the game in 10 in-game days and I felt pretty good about it. Zero NPC deaths! Zero! I'm a super awesome amazing hero, right? Well, credits roll and... the only achievement I get is the one for beating the game. No one really cares and apparently you're meant to play through multiple times anyway. So... why did I ever care? Why is this mechanic even in the game? All it did was make me shy away from general exploration and side quests since all of those things are less important than, ya know, saving the world. You can call that interesting, but when it has no payoff, it ends up being frustrating.\n\n- No post-game. Did I mention, if you bumrush the game and finish with just hours left on everyone's timers, you don't get to do any extra no-timer exploring afterwards? No, the game's over. Load the save and you get set back to where you were before fighting the final boss. If you want to do any actual exploring, that's what \"Explorer\" mode is for. You know, that mode that makes you feel like you're cheating?\n\nBasically, Unsighted is another game filled with missed opportunities. I recommend this game because the core gameplay and level design is very well done and very well executed, but you should probably know this before you start:\n\nThe only pressure here is the one you imagine. Since the game does nothing to acknowledge your successes, just play it at your own pace and don't be shy about using Explorer. Shame on the devs for hailing the agony of defeat, but not the thrill of victory.\n- The only marginally interesting or entertaining part of this game is it's history.\n\nJanuary 15, 2015: It's sold under the name of H1Z1. It was marketed as an open world zombie survival game, akin to DayZ. I bought it for 20$. The game does not run.\n\nAfter a time, they release a new gamemode; King of the Kill. It's a battle royale mode, made specifically because PLAYERUNKNOWN made a hugely successful battle royale mod for the game but then split off to make his own game (PUBG).\n\nFebruary 5, 2016: KOTK is doing well, so they split it off from the game, both of them costing 20$. They silently abandon the original game, only doing small feature updates and adding nothing but bugs. H1Z1 (The survival game.) is renamed to H1Z1 Just Survive.  KOTK is renamed H1Z1: King of the Kill. Not long after they rename H1Z1 Just Survive to simply Just Survive (Which sounds like a terrible 3$ app game.) and rename H1Z1 King of the Kill to just H1Z1. (H1Z1 Battle Royale on consoles.) Development of the original survival game, \"Just Survive\", is still mostly halted.\n\nOctober 24, 2018: Just Survive, the survival game i paid for, is shut down. The game is removed from my, and everyone else's steam library, with no refund. KOTK, or H1Z1, or H1Z1 Battle Royale...or...whatever the crap they named it, is shut down as well, and re-published and renamed as a different game, Z1 Battle Royale, obviously done to alienate the game from it's wretched history.\n\nThe kicker? It's free. Also, it's still called H1Z1 Battle Royale on consoles, and when Z1 BR is run, the window is named H1Z1. \n\nThey made a game said it was like DayZ. It didn't even work. Then they simply deleted it from my library with no refund. Z1 BR is dead, it garners about 3 active players. They actually, legitimately built a fake game and then deleted it for money.\n\nUtterly disgusting development team. When everyone said the original game was going down in flames due to terrible updates, horrible balancing fix attempts that only worsened the balance, and endless amounts of bugs spilling into the game, i sat there, with hope. This is what i got.\n\nThey said the original H1Z1 was originally going to be made free. I was fine, 20$ for instant beta access to a DayZ game was fine. What they didn't say is that it was a blatant lie and they would toss the game in the trash in favor of another random game they made using the original games assets (I told you. They're terrible. Too lazy to even make new assets.) simply because Fortnite was getting popular.\n\nAnd after all that?\n\nThe game sucks balls.\n\nDon't [strike]buy[/strike] download this game.\n- Cook a fish; cook a pig; cook a chicken; cook anything you want. Now place a banana on your enemy's stove, and cook their ship. Culinary simulator with cool cosmetics.\n- its a very stressful game and rly hard but the fact that u can lose all ur progress because of a mistake is on another level of insane but in the end if u r determined u will finish it and the feeling when u finish it after all the time is very good i never felt this good in my life about finishing a game or a puzzle its a rly good game i recommend\n- For a company as big as Amazon, this game is extremely sub par. It feels as though it's in Early Access and some of the recent patch notes are very worrying for the game's future\n\nPros:\n- Stunning gfx. Especially for an MMO, the lighting in particular is amazing\n- Sound track is great and ambience adds personality to the zones\n- Some really cool zones to explore, feels as though you can get lost when you start\n- Controls/Keybinds are already really good imo, I only changed a few\n- Tutorial/Starter Quest chains do a great job of introducing you to the game without being too slow\n- Combat (when it works) Is really fun. Lots of action based fights\n- Wars are a really cool mechanic, they are ultimately flawed but are still a lot of fun\n\nCons:\n- Game is extremely shallow. It is borderline addicting for the first few levels, this soon dies off. When (If) You reach lvl 60, you ask yourself what do you do now?\n- As beautiful as the game is, a lot of it is copy and pasted. Literally. There are zones, towns, dungeons that are almost identical. Ruins immersion\n- Quests are extremely repetitive and boring. They consist of kill mobs, loot mobs, loot chests and that’s about it. No diversity\n- Combat can be laggy, you weapon swap and it doesn’t register sometimes. Wars can be a PowerPoint Presentation at times\n- Guild UI is awful. There is no guild bank, treasury ledger so you cannot monitor who donates money for wars etc. Makes running a guild a nightmare\n- There are countless exploits and duplications that have been abused upsetting economies, player numbers and the general integrity of the game\n- Server population has been decimated since launch leading to many dead servers. They’re merging already\n- There are some very worrying patch notes/future releases that are changing fundamental mechanics of the game. In some cases nerfs which punish players who didn’t rush to level cap\n- Watermark is a stupid progression system for gear. It forces you to run daily elite zone farm chains which get extremely repetitive\n\nIf this was a small indie dev company, I could give them the benefit of the doubt. However this is frickin’ Amazon. This product is totally unacceptable and needs to go back in the oven.\n\n- it's a shame but i honestly cannot recommend this game if you are a disabled person, i wasn't that far into the game when my character started panicking apon seeing a disabled person [person with leg braces] and then gets a \"no good answer\" bit of dialog and all the options are saying something wrong or saying nothing, trying to go with the least bad option aside from saying nothing since i know as a disabled person myself [i'm a wheelchair user] it can be pretty upsetting getting people just randomly stare at me and at least when they say something slightly wrong they are engaging with me as a person, my character then proceeds to talk abt what an \"inspiration\" it is 2 c a disabled person living their life,,, not exaggerating when i say i let my head hit the desk, closed the game and uninstalled, i understand that this is probably put in the game to be a teachable moment for the able bodied audience but ironically in trying to educate about us disabled people they then made the assumption that no disabled people would be playing their game as there is no option to make your character disabled or even to make them remotely aware of disability and ended up just making the experience awful for the disabled gamers they seem to be trying to help\n- [h1]Sum-Up[/h1]\n[h3]In-depth analysis further down.[/h3]\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th]🟩 [b]Pros[/b][/th]\n[th]🟥 [b]Cons[/b][/th]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]\n- A vast, detailed and impressive recreation of Hogwarts and its neighboring regions, packed to the brim with locations to discover, collectibles and activities to clear.

Rowling, at a time far before Harry & friends were even born. You’ll play as a fifth year student in the titular magics academy, admitted this late because of unspecified ‘special circumstances’. The virtual rendition of Rowling’s works is nothing short of exceptional, with not only Hogwarts itself, but also its environs (like the town of Hogsmeade or the dangerous Forbidden Forest), all recreated faithfully and down to the most minute details. Of course, some things will differ from movies and books, with the game being set in the 1800s. \n\nThe main story follows the classic ‘manifest destiny’ archetype, where your custom-made character will discover hidden potential that ties them to a greater purpose. Despite some genuinely memorable characters and some interesting side- and main-quests, the overall narrative can’t help but fall a little flat and stale, especially towards the ending phases. Nonetheless, many enjoyable adventures await you. Notably, there are no romance or love/hate dichotomies in the relationships you have with side-characters, as your choices will always end up in pretty much the same results during questlines.\n\n[h3]Exploration, Collectibles & Secrets[/h3]\nThe world is vast and visually magnificent, peppered to no-end with points of interest that often hold collectibles, currency or other utilities. Initially on foot, and later on with the iconic enchanted brooms and even flying magical creatures, you’ll be able to explore at leisure and clear the enormous amount of side-activities. A good portion of these, however, will prove inaccessible until you gain the right spells or abilities, in a sort-of ‘metroidvania’ fashion that promotes meaningful backtracking. Fast travel and an item-highlighting spell prove invaluable in saving time while exploring. Collectibles are mostly cosmetic, enabling the customization of both your wizard and your own private room once you unlock it, to suit various styles. \n\nMost dungeons and locations have additional puzzles or hidden paths that often lead to collectibles or extra resources; exploration feels rewarding, with a genuine sense of mystery surrounding each new point of interest you’ll find. Despite that, most dungeons and locations play out in the same way, and become repetitive in the long haul.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2933385898\n\n[h3]Combat System & Bosses[/h3]\nMagical battles use spells as sole means of offense and defense. Usually against multiple enemies at once, sometimes supported by allied NPCs, you’ll have to time your protection spell right in order to deflect incoming attacks, or dodge-roll away in case of unblockable ones. Enemies are varied and range from magical creatures to dark wizards and goblin soldiers, to name a few. Some of them may be weak to specific charms, others have shields you can break by using specific spell categories (damage, utility, movement) or other special abilities, like immunity to certain effects. \n\nCombat feels engaging, well-paced and is more than a little gory for this universe’s standards, death will be far more common than in the movies or books. The way you can combine spell effects to your advantage and use the environment further adds to the base system, while the amount of passive upgrades with item traits and spell-related talents you can gain progressively add another layer of depth. In late-game however you’ll become overpowered between potions, passive traits, talents and endgame spells - so much that supposedly fearsome dark wizards will prove little more than a nuisance due to power creep.\n\n[h3]Quests, Minigames & Challenges[/h3]\nQuests usually involve retrieving something, talking to a specific NPC, solving a treasure hunt based on visual clues, getting the solution to logic-based puzzles and more, depending on the case. While some side-quests are unique and memorable, most will be fetch chores or dry open-world shenanigans that you’ll have to repeat over and over in the same fashion. Less, but more meaningful and unique quests would have been better than this bloat, for sure. \n\nChallenges are paramount in unlocking unique bonuses like increased inventory capacity, many cosmetics, and even unique passive upgrades to equip in gear pieces. They often require you to slay X of a specific enemy, finish X of the same activity, and such “long-term” goals. Some of them are a massive grind and will only give you the 25th pair of gloves you don’t need, or other cosmetics that aren’t worth the effort.\n- \"Welp we've been working on this game for a few years now and it doesn't look like we are actually going to be able to fix anything so we're just going to release it so we can say we made a game.\"\n- Great game! \nLooking foward for the next chapters of the game!\nI love the spritework, its amazing!\nEven the music is very catchy and memorable \nFor an Early Access game, this game is very charsimatic and has tons of personality!\n\nIts just a shame that it was short in my opinion, i know you are going to add more stuff obviously, but i was hoping to get much more out of it because i loved it alot xD.\n\nPirate Software, I can't stress enough how much my excitement for this game is,  the demo back in 2017 already left me intrigued, but now im excited to see how this all plays out!\n- Please, bare with me here...I NEVER write reviews for anything (this is probably the third review I have ever written), but I feel like I need to write this one for so many reasons!!!  I grew up playing the Telltale/Lucas Arts Series: Monkey Island. After discovering and playing those, I figured out that I have an infinite amount of love for Point and Click adventure games. After finishing that series, I really only played the other games made by either Lucas Arts or Telltale (Mostly because I thought they were the only creators of Point and Click games...until about a year ago, when I discovered there's an entire genre/world of Point and Click).  Of course, I must also note: The Curse of Monkey Island will always be my fav, as it was the first Point and Click I ever played. Ok...NOW...with all of that being said, I recently discovered WADJET EYE GAMES and I am SO happy I did. I would recommend EVERY.SINGLE,GAME they sell. I have played all of their MAC/iOS compatible Point and Clicks, and I have yet to be (even slightly) disappointed. I had very high expectations going in as the Monkey Island games, Day of the Tentacle, Full Throttle, Grim Fandago, etc. are some of the best games in the history of Point and Click; however, all of the games I have played from Wadjet Eye have been amazing. They have actually been so amazing that I can 100% say Wadjet Eye is at the top of my list, right there with the Telltale/Lucas Arts games. I 100% recommend purchasing and playing every game made by Wadjet Eye to anyone who likes (even those who kinda sorta like) Point and Click games.\n- [h1]One of the few multiplayer games that reminds me that people can be amazing[/h1]\n\nI've been playing games for a long time, I've seen some sh*t. I've seen people crumble, I've lost friends, I've watched people eat each other even when they are winning. When people are supposed to be working together and yet they would rather treat their ally like trash because they refuse to take the blame for their own wrongdoing.\n\nSquad is a game in which I have seen true potential. A group of 40 individuals work together to plan, execute, and accomplish masterful plans to outsmart their enemy. I've seen teams rally from the depths of defeat and flip unwinable games into incredible victories. Heros emerging from the storm of mortars landing upon their bunker, to squad leaders risking their own lives to save those of their squad.\n\nSquad is not a game for the light hearted. To enjoy squad to the fulllest, you must communicate, work together, and form a bond with the soldiers at your side. You are a team, you are a unit, and you will never win alone. Be it a medic patching the wounds of your comrades, a logistics driver supplying your team with the supplies they need at the front line, or a squad leader putting the responsibility of 8 individuals on your shoulders, each person is a vital component of the team.\n\nFor this reason, Squad has now become my most played game on steam. The depth, the people, the comraderie, it's an amazing experience that no other game captures. I encourage you all to try it out on a free weekend as I originally did, I have been playing it ever since.\n\nI'll see you on the front line.\n- Deathloop is definitely not your average video game.\n\nYou'll either love it or hate it.\n\nThe first few hours are the weakest. You, as a new player, don't know what to do, what's important and you never keep what you find. Only after completing several mission objectives you get the ability to collect residuum and actually infuse your found items for later use in later loops or after you die. That's why it's always better to just go straight to the objectives and not explore the map at all, otherwise it's just gonna be a big time waste.\n\nAfter you acquire the ability to make permanent items (character and weapon trinkets) which you'll be able to use in future runs and collect some crucial weapons (like silent gun) and abilities ([in-game slabs] like Shift that allows you to teleport short distances) - then the game fully opens up. \n\nReal fun begins after you learn all maps and shortcuts and how to toy with your enemies (but it takes quite a lot of time to get there).\n\nStealth is very easy, the enemy AI is dumb at best. The more trinkets and slabs you get - the more variety in gameplay opens up. \n\nAction is very smooth, Abilities are strong and versatile, that's where this game shines to be honest. \n\nThere are 4 different areas and all of them change depending of the time of the day (morning, noon, afternoon and evening). Depending of the time of the day - some areas become accessible, some become closed, The enemies and items also change their locations and sometimes you'll be able to encounter bosses (in-game they are called visionaries). They are not hard to kill, but it's quite hard to get to them. That's the fun part of this whole game. The more you replay all areas, the more information you'll acquire about visionaries and their behaviour. It's possible to deal with them all without killing a single other enemy.\n\nBut with all that comes the not so fun part - exploration and doing the same thing over and over and over again. It's gonna be hard at first, every area is very detailed and it's really easy to miss a code written on a desk or a wall, A lot of sniffing around is required for clues and multiple times per map. It definitely makes repetition your new best friend.\n\nThere are a lot of puzzles and challenges. If you are not shooting dumb NPCs - you're definitely trying to crack a solution to a puzzle. Sometimes you'll need to visit several maps on the exact time of day at which events occur and find the exact required item or piece of information in order to solve a puzzle. Yeah. It's a big hassle, but that's how this game is and how it functions. If you like puzzles, you'll enjoy Deathloop. But be prepared to use a guide or two for some of them and a lot of patience.\n\nDuring some objectives it's very easy to make mistakes and fail. Several challenges require you to be pixel perfect in execution. Didn't notice that mine placed on a generator? Too bad, you'll gonna have to restart or try in another loop.\n\nI disliked that once you find a new weapon, you have to take it with you and drop one of your 3 weapons. You will never be able to use the dropped one for the rest of the loop. Considering that you'll always find a new toy to play with - your loadout will always be half-baked. It's actually extremely annoying, the same can be said about your slab abilities too (only after you find them all, then the ability upgrades will go straight into your inventory after finishing a level).\n\nAnd of course, there is Julianna. She is your \"buddy\" the whole game and she talks to you at the start of every level and well... she is always trying to kill you. It's fun when she invades and disrupts your chill Groundhogday experience. You can even let other real players invade you as Julianna. Fun, if you like to fill yourself with some adrenaline. Either you kill her, or she kills you and you'll have to start over the whole loop ^^\n\nFunny, but Colt reminded me of Draymond Green from Golden State Warriors. In some instances he looks exactly like him haha.\n\nThere are some AI bugs and the game starts to stutter the longer you play. Kinda strage, but it was for me. Occasionally framerates can go from smooth to choppy quite fast.\n\nDeathloop is a decent game overall. Idea is good, but works much better in movies, because there you don't have to sit through the same routines every single time and you get to the next big reveal a lot quicker. \n\nI think Julianna was a bit underused. Imagine how awesome this game could be if Deahtloop worked similar to The Lost Vikings where you control 3 characters at the same time. She could have had different abilities, different strengths. A duo trying to break the loop! Pretty cool, eh? Anyway, That's just my 2 cents.\n- The story of this game is interesting and well written, but it doesn't fully make up for the game's flaws. Here are the problems I saw with the game.\n\n1. There are a wide variety of guns available, but very few combinations of those guns are viable. The shotguns are rarely viable for combat with gun wielding enemies, since advancing far enough forward to make shotgun damage effective inevitably puts you in the line of fire of enough of your enemies to prove lethal. Other weapons like sniper rifles and pistols have critically low DPS and a low maximum ammo cap, making them almost universally not viable. Additionally this game likes to spring ambushes on the player in a way that takes away any advantage gained from long range optics. The special pneumatic weapons in the game also suffer from a low ammo cap. This leaves you with assault rifles, which the game seems to have been made for.\n\n2. In encounters with bestial enemies it is frequently impossible to avoid taking damage. The enemies sprint at you in packs which even sustained automatic shotgun fire cannot fully stop. Some of the boss enemies are even worse in this department. In normal mode with the larger health pool and regeneration over time this wouldn't be such a problem. But in ranger mode this makes certain obstacles unbeatable. You might have a boss which takes your entire ammo pool from both guns to kill, and which gets a guaranteed hit on you once every thirty seconds. If you go into that boss fight hurt and with no healing items, then you'll be met with mathematically guaranteed failure. The simple fix for this is to give the player a dodge function to avoid taking an instance of damage.\n\n3. This story has a few decisions to make, but mostly it is on rails. This isn't always a problem in a game, but it is when your character gets repeatedly taken unawares by things you as the player have already figured out. You as the player may sense that Artyom is being tricked, is about to be ambushed, or is going to let the bad guy get away through poor decision making. You just have to frustratedly walk into the cut scene and let it happen anyways. Its fine for this to happen at least once. But by the fourth or fifth instance it becomes infuriating to play as the character who just gets tricked and captured all the time.\n- From my og demo feedback, not much changed sadly:\n\nOh boy....\n\nI will start with the most glaring issue:\n-It's friggin IMPOSSIBLE to find an online match\n\nNow some other stuff that I found odd or bad:\n-The camera.... oh god.... I get it, it's supposed to \"limit\" the playing area (specially for local gameplay) but it punishes people in first place... that's friggin dumb in a RACING game, also also if you go under other track sometimes you can't see sh*t (the going under other track piece seems to be fixed in the final release)\n\n-The car randomly drives itself ???? (maybe it's the antenna thingy I chose at car selection.... would be good a tooltip or SOMETHING so I know wtf is that about)\n\n-NO CONTROL REBINDING OPTIONS..... in 2023 \n\n-If you \"die\" near a checkpoint, though luck pal you WILL miss the next section too cause you won't respawn in time... that's.... just unfun and dumb.\n\n-The \"shortcut\" option definetly does not work, I intentionally crafted a track with cuts and the game will kill you if you try to do those..... good job devs. (This seems to be fixed or working properly in final release)\n\n-Since I couldn't find an online match EVER, I played only in local lobby or vs AI, now here comes the issue, the \"placing\" round locks everyone to the same \"screen\", there is no zoom, you can get trolled by another player preventing you to move to a place to connect track or hazards, rendering your placement turn void and useless, I don't know if this is intentional or just a downside of playing on local mode, you may have free cam in multi, but alas I couldn't try that. BTW.... WHY THERE IS NO ZOOM OPTION\n\nThe good:\n-The games runs smooth as butter, with everything maxed on my midend rig, good one devs\n\n-The cars seem to be varied and with some gimmicks, alas you have NO TOOLTIPS or info what that possible gimmick may be..... why ?\n\n-The track pieces, hazards and weapons are quite varied and some weird shennanigans are ensured to happen, feels like a Trackmania troll track being build in real time 10/10\n\nThe \"mehhh\":\n\n-The weapons/items some of them are mindbogglingly hard to understand wtf they do, there is a grey metallic ball even that seems to do nothing or I haven't figured out how to use it... again... a tool tip maybe ? a section about weapons/items in the main menu mayhaps ?\n\nAnd that's that, sorry if my writing seems a bit aggresive, I just was kinda hyped about the game and it feels a bit of a let down so far. But, IT HAS POTENTIAL.\n\nSadly, another case of developer with TONS of feedback delivering an undercooked mess. Stay away from it.\n- I am a day one player who quit the game within a few days. After coming back after almost 2 years, I am shocked and surprised. The overall improvement is great, quests are not bothering you. Story and atmosphere is hooking you up and the overall experience is good. Leveling up is easy and also you are not struggling as in most MMOs.\n\nDespite the past of the game, I think it is worth trying.\n- For the past 4 years I couldn't get myself to finish a single game without having to force myself to do it(and even then I failed). I couldn't enjoy SP games no matter how good the gameplay or the story was. I kept buying games hoping to find that one game that would do the trick. This was FF XV for me. Despite of all my friends advising me against buying it because it was just going to be another game that would sit around in my library, I decided to give it a try.\n\nIt actually felt like I went back in time to when I could play SP games for hours without getting bored after an hour or two.\n\nI admit I skipped most sidequests and I'll try going back to them sooner or later, although it may not be the best game out there in terms of content(you can finish the game on easy skipping most secondary quests in about 20-25 hours) or story development, playing through it felt like a new experience. In fact, even after finishing the game there's still plenty of things to do and in my opinion, even playing it through again just to spend more time with Noctis and his friends is worth it.\n\nThe story is not mindblowing, the combat system is really fun but far from flawless, most sidequests aren't well written but at its core, at least for me, FF XV has something to it that other games lack. I can't say it magically restored my old passion for gaming but it has given me a reason to at least try to get into it again.\n\nIf you haven't played it yet I sincerely envy you, I would love to experience it all over again from the start, it has been a memorable journey to say the least and I hope that you are willing to give it a try. ^^\n- Mori's 3-Part Review:\n1. Bare minimum information and recommendations to improve your playthrough\n2. Background information on me and my playthrough\n3. More extensive non-spoiler reactions\n \nPart 1: Recommendations for You\nIf you're like me and you try to get all the extra scene dialogue, then please, if you take nothing else from this, give yourself time to play this game yourself. There is actually so much content here, I really want you all to take your time to experience it as you go. The game is just too long to binge in a reasonably short amount of time, and if you do binge, you're going to lose a lot.\n \nMy recommendations:\n1. Give yourself time to play the game. Let it sink in, and take notes- it'll be rewarded. The game is literally too dense and too long to binge reasonably if you like 100%ing.\n \n2. Get invested in the characters and pay attention to them, not just the (admittedly stellar) mysteries.\n \n3. Explore the game, its mechanics, and its dialogue yourself. Don't be afraid to restart a Somnium several times; the more options you pick, the more meaningful information you get.\n \n4. If you're a puzzle lover then try to solve the game yourself. You're going to have a blast if you manage it, and the game has tons of built-in hint systems to make it even easier, fairer, and more fun.\n \n5. Try to go in knowing at little as you can. The marketing has already done a great job. Focus on finishing the game and bringing it all together.\n \n6. On PC, force anti-aliasing on using your graphics card to make the game prettier. Game ran and controlled smoothly with few bugs.\n \n7. You don't need AI1 to play AI2, but I think AI2 does spoil AI1, though you could still enjoy them in reverse order.\n \n7. If you're sensitive to horny then just read less background dialogue in Ryuki side. Gore is pretty toned down, and there isn't any single huge CW.\n \nYou can stop reading now if you don't want your playthrough tainted by my reactions/expectations effected.\n \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nPart 2: Who am I, and how do I play?\nI'm an Uchikoshi fanatic. I've played all his English-translated games, and visual novels are my favorite genre of game. I've played a lot of visuals novels, but Uchizawa's are my favorites. I usually try to 100% complete all the scenes and see all the bonus dialogue. I've also played a lot of other genres of game, and I do like fun gameplay, but the most important things to me tend to be:\n \nA. An interesting story is absolutely what gets me invested\nB. Bunches of novel ideas like unique plot points I haven't seen before, philosophical ideas, or puzzles\nC. Characters that I at least don't actively hate; I can like a game for the above two, but characters still matter\nD. Deep personal connection, usually formed by connections to real people or how a game shaped my life\n \nThose are the ways I rate my top games. For the last 8 years, my top 2 favorite games have been the same:\n \nMy top favorite game of all time is Remember11. I love the plot, the ideas, the twists, the characters, and it's what got me truly invested in Uchikoshi. It's very much a mystery game first with an unravelling mystery and themes I love to explore.\n \nMy second favorite game is Virtue's Last Reward. I love the interactive moral dilemmas. VLR's use of the Prisoner's Dilemma jumpstarted my interested in Philosophy which led me to major in Philosophy. I don't like the characters as much save for a few, but it's still very important to me.\n \nNow, let me tell you how I've played AINI: I've basically been playing non-stop since June 13th.\n \nTake this with a grain of salt because I've been documenting as I play (the average main story playtime seems to be 20-35 hours, with 100% likely taking 50+), but right now, I have 97 hours of playtime. I have not gotten all the dialogue, achievements, or fully explored the abundance of extra mechanics. Instead, I have a 616-page reaction document full of constant laughs, cries, screams, passing out, and most of all love.\n \nPart 3: My Review\nThe R11 #1 and VLR #2 holy duology held true for 8 years. Also, AI1 isn't one of my favorite standalone games; it has huge personal connection for me because of the community and the AI1 ARG, but it wasn't my favorite as a game.\n \nI gave all that background because I want you to take me seriously when I say this:\nAI2 is my new favorite game. The #1 spot has been Easily dethroned.\n \nThe themes, twists, characters, ideas, gameplay, visuals, voice acting, fair mystery, presentation, mechanics, and comedy all of it resonates together perfectly. I don't even tend to value gameplay or visuals, but at many times, this game is fun to play while looking genuinely beautiful and cinematic.\n \nThe story reads like a proper Uchikoshi + Nakazawa return to form. The mystery is fair, interesting, meaningful, and complex told satisfyingly. There are many deep ideas, concepts, and themes utilized in thought-provoking ways.\n \nGameplay-wise, there are tons of mechanics that are utilized to make each Somnium unique; they all feel designed by love, fair, and reflective of the character through gorgeous symbolism. They blow the first game completely out of the water. Each one is its own experience to explore and a visual delight. There are also tons of mechanics for you to discover that make AI2 a fun game to play.\n \nThe animations, voices, and directing are cinematic; this game is actually breathtaking a lot of the time. It's backed up by great and charming character writing- despite the fact Mizuki is my favorite AI1 character with 0 contest, I grew to like much of the AI2 cast the same amount.\n \nAI2 is a story about halves and splitting, but also love and coming together- please, see it through until it's whole. I hope and believe you will all fall in love with AI2 like me; AI2 is all I've ever wanted. AI2 is my dream game come true; it's a gorgeous love letter to all Uchikoshi fans who love Zero Escape's puzzles, Infinity's mysteries, and AI's characters and humor.\n- Looks like a game for children, but underneath the friendliness there is a great challenge! Move on the rhythm of good songs on a note bar! \n\n[h2]Swim! Swim little tredpole! [/h2]\nYou are a newborn tredpole. The first thing you do is break free of your egg! Through various rivers and waters you journey, and eventually save your pond from a disaster that will occur. \nEverything in the river translates to an instrument tone and respects the height on the note bar. The primary goal is to reach the finish. The melody is depicted as little mines which hurt your health if you swim across one. Along the way you can collect points by collecting bubbles (with a bonus if you collect them all), little bubbles, health packs, and you can slap your tail on bamboo or cymbals that launch you in the air! Many predators would like to make a snack out of you! \nAll this on the rhythm of unique songs! \n\n[h2]Thoughts [/h2]\nThis looks like a friendly game, a bit for kids perhaps, right? Well, I started with letting a non-gamer play this, without success. You need to have musical rhythm in you to perform well. None of my friends possess that really, so a simple playthrough wasn't all that easy. \nThe music is very original, and makes this game fun. It's a tough game, and poses quite a challenge for lovers of rhythm games. I am totally unfamiliar with that breed of gamers. For the simple gamer like me, I'd say: nice for a playthrough. \n\n70/100\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[td]\n[i]More reviews at [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/39546715/]Omnivore Gamer[/url], games that are easy to control (for handicapped gamers). [/i][/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n- I normally hate \"retro\" platformers, I never liked Mega Man, only Mega Man X, didn't care much for Shovel Knight but loved Hollow Knight, things like that. The Messenger IS a platformer, even though the second part of the game makes it less linear, and I loved it.\n\nDevs could take a lot of notes here - checkpoints are frequent, boss fights are short and creative and you don't have to go through 2 easy phases to retry a hard 3rd phase, most rooms and even most trick rooms have multiple ways to approach them given your fairly simple moveset. You never have to do anything pixel-perfect to get through but doing things well is massively rewarding. It constantly surprised you with new things but doesn't overstay anything, and completely foreign mechanics introduced are not punishing (Skylands, for example).\n\nA lot of people comment on how great the writing is, and well... it is great. It's sparse but fantastic throughout, with more personality in what amounts to a few pages than most games can give with 10 times as many words (and lore pickups).\n\nFor reference, I completed it with all the challenge collectibles in 14.5 hours, but did not get all achievements nor go through NG+. It is well paced and hard to put down, but easy enough to play in chunks, and I felt like I was learning new tricks up through the end of the game.\n\nDo the thing!\n- This is such a great game. It's a well put together survival game with many things to do. Whether you want to just build a sandbox wilderness empire or try to escape, it's entirely fun no matter what. I've tried to actually complete the game, but I always end up building a massive epic fortress complete with my very own beefalo farm. The only thing that I personally don't like about this game is the stumble-upon style of actually completing the quests (they're not really quests, but I can't think of anything else to call them). Other than that, this game is a beautiful masterpiece. Very artistic, creative and fun. I definitely recommend it to anyone who loves survival games of any sort.\n- I've been waiting since the likes of Planescape Torment and Baldurs Gate 2 for a game to match their sheer perfection, many games came quite close, but Divinity Original Sin just manages to hit so many nails on the head its not funny. It looks great and still plays fine on my aging PC, it has a great storyline, it's two protagonists have some great interactions and dialogue. The voice acting is spot on and it has the most sublime OST.\n\nThe combat is turn-based but do not let this put you off, there are so many choices in combat with the interaction of spells with each other and the environment, that the game just begs you to experiment with different tactics.\n\nThis game just oozes pure class, it was a labour of love for Larian and it shows in every tiny detail of the game.\nIf you like RPG games (or even just pure quality games), you need to play this game, it is the benchmark I will use in comparing other games in future.\n\nWell done Larian.\n- A solid \"Get Va11HallA instead, unless this is on sale. Otherwise, maybe.\".\n\nCoffee Talk: Fantasy Coffee-brewing Action, is a day-by-day visual novel with slight coffee-brewing mechanics on the side. Its storyline is broken up into several days, of which customers visit your coffee shop and talk. The first few days are rather short: no longer than a few minutes, but as the story advances the days become more packed with story. The game as a whole is rather short, less than 3 hours to complete the main storyline. Overall, generally a well rounded game, but not $15. On the other hand, it compares rather poorly to Va11halla, a game with a nigh identical format, but has more characters, story, and charm. If you liked Va11halla, and really can't wait for N1RVAnnA, then get it on sale. Otherwise, just get Va11halla. But I'm still recommending it because steam doesn't allow maybes, and there's very little competition for this niche of VN.\n- Do I really have to write this review? I am just one in thousands of people who wrote a positive reveiw for Garry's Mod. Chances are, this review will never convince someone to buy Garry's Mod. It'll just be lost in the 100,000 positive reviews out there. Well, here I go anyway.\n\n\"Where do I start?\" This is the question asked by anyone playing Gmod for their first time. It's also my question that I ask about this review I am writing. Hmm...\n\n_The gameplay...the gameplay...hmm... Well, there's singleplayer sandbox. You can do...uh, whatever you want really. Just addon a few addons, and you can be entertained for hours. Battle NPCs, make cool scenes for cool screenshots, explore maps, be a superhero (spiderman addon!), and much, much, much, much- you get my point, right? Almost all content is user-generated. Make your own content! Multiplayer. In Multiplayer Gmod you can roleplay. I'm talking normal RP (DarkRP), Military RP, Star Wars RP, etc, etc. In multiplayer Gmod, you can battle, prophunt (yay), hide 'n seek, and much, much, more.\n\n_Graphics? I'll rate the graphics...drumroll please... 7/10. This game is and older game. Came out in 2006. I guess the graphics are good for 2006, and people enjoy the game and don't complain much about the graphics, but I'm not gonna lie, they are outdated and look old. It's not 2006 anymore.\n\n_Hear the bullets flying. The zombies growling. The people chatting. The boxes jumping... The sound in this game is great! Every sound is loud and clear, and there are a varitey of sounds.\n\n_Play this game. Play it again. Play it some more. Play some now, and play some later. Play it over and over. Play it as long as you want.\n\n_My Personal opinion. Get this game. Now. Get Gmod on sale or not. I'm not gonna stop playing it for a while and I'm already at 50+ hours of playtime. I love this game! WAIT! Before you go and buy this, then you wonder why there are all the missing maps and errors in most games, get Counter Strike: Source, so ALL the textures are supported. You need it to play MOST multiplayer games.\n\n\nGameplay: 9/10\nGraphics: 7/10\nStory: N/A\nSound: 8/10\nReplayability: 10/10\n\nOverall 8.5\n\nEven though, this is one positive review on Garry's Mod, out of the thousands of positive reviews that have been submitted Garry's Mod, I hope this one convinces you to buy... Gmod\n\n-Star_Hawk_\n- The British Forces give the Allies a bit of the German defensive capacities. It has the problem of adding too many buildings to a game that is, in its core, dynamic and based on movement and aggressiveness instead of turtling. The British units are diverse and interesting, bringing much to the table. \n\nThe DLC lacks a proper campaign for the Brits, unfortunately, even though Caen, Goodwood, Arnhem and Walcheren could have been done in some interesting missions. But, for a game focused on multiplayer, the Tommies are obligatory in everybody's library.\n- In a world where \"enhanced edition\" has started to be synonymous with \"will run on modern hardware if you shell out $20\" it's absolutely refreshing to see Larian deliver this masterpiece free of charge to owners of the original. You start out with an already fantastic game that's received numerous game of the year and editor's choice awards. Then you spend a year polishing that game, and adding new features. The result is brilliant Enhanced Edtion of an already fantastic game.\n\nNew features for EE:\n[list]\n[*] Fully voice acted - Every line of dialog now has voice acting. The voice acting is really good too\n[*] Dual wield - Rogues now look more iconic with the ability to dual wield\n[*] Grenades - You can craft and throw various sorts of grenades. \n[*] Tactician Mode - A new  challenging mode where encounters are redesigned to be harder by adding new spells and enemies into the mix. Classic mode still available obviously.\n[*] Split screen co-op \n[*] Controller support\n[*] Updated graphics - The UI is totally reworked, the graphics are updated, and spells have new effects\n[*] Updates to the story  - The story, esepcially the ending, was rewritten a bit to clear up some confusing aspects\n[/list]\n\nI'm sure there's more, but really these ought to be reason enough to play this game.\n- I'm severely disappointed whenever a game points at the stands and intends to hit a home run, and then instead smashes the pitcher out after the bat flies out of their hands.\n\nIt looks wonderful, it's relentlessly and uncompromisingly unique, and it plays like complete hell.\n\nUnreasonable difficulty, bordering on sadism, a unique idea let down by just-so-imprecise hitboxes and the feeling of being far too weak to take on anything.\n\nI haven't enjoyed this game, I can't recommend it to anyone else, if you buy it and find favour with it then bully for you, but I'll never understand how.\n- I have been playing BF games since back in 2003, when you had to go and buy them from the game shop down the town center. They came on a CD/DVD. BF2 & Special Forces were fantastic games.\n\nI bought this game about 1 month or so ago now, was really looking forward to it, until I played in a match with more hackers than there were normal players!!!!\n\nEvery single game on a DICE server has a hacker or 2 or more on it!! You go to the EA forums and post about it and they advise to use the in-game reporting method - so you do that, and yet, after 1 month, the same hackers are STILL PLAYING the game. So you go back to the forum, post about it again, and EA shut down your post and mark their spam post as the solution to your post, even though they haven't answered anything properly - They then tell you they do not allow posts about anti-cheats or cheating on teh AHQ FOrum - Really? Is that because you know you are useless at stopping it EA??\n\nIt's for this reason alone I give this game a thumbs down, if it wasn't for all the hackers and EA's lack of care about getting ird of them it would be a good game!\n- I hold this game in as high esteem as games such as Undertale and Oneshot.\nIt would be a mistake to dismiss this game, as I once did.\n\nThis game made me really care about it. It's one of those games where the writing, music, graphics, and gameplay all work together to give life to the characters within it. Even though the setting takes place in a small area (comprising of 2 buildings, 3 caves, and a bake stand), it still feels like an entire world that had a past from before you started playing and a future that unfolds after you stop playing. Every part of the game serves towards this purpose. The developer took the time and effort to make sure every small, nuanced detail felt right. Whether it's a quirky little animation, the presence (or absence) of circumstance-fitting music, or the sound effects that make every footstep and enemy strike sound just right, this game does a phenomenal job making sure that every contributes an immersive experience. You’re not interacting with a piece of software, you’re interacting with a world.\n\nHowever, this game, as is all games, is not perfect. The combat can be a bit unintuitive owing to the fact that enemies can attack you while you are selecting your move, but you will PROBABLY get used to this and after that, boy, does it become quite an exciting experience. In addition, this game has many mentions of death. While this sounds terrible on paper, the game does manage to pull out some interesting game choices out of it. Unless you have trouble discerning fiction from reality (or are uncomfortable with the mention of death), you should be fine. All other flaws I won't elaborate on because they're subjective nitpicks (ex. didn't like a word choice; thought a certain sprite looked weird; thought that the music overplayed the \"spooky\" instruments that one time in the game).\n\nIf you're looking for a game that will make you invested in a new experience, you might have just found it.\n\n- Lemme give it to y'all straight, who are on the fence;\n\n- Yes, the game is very much worth it at full price.\n\n- One of the first games in a long while, that has kept me up until 5 A.M. in the morning, because of how lost I get myself into it.\n\n- Doesn't do dumb jump scares, save for a VERY FEW TIMES, and each one counted.\n\n- The game is maybe one of the best zombie based games out there, so long as you do enjoy it with action.\n\n- Parkour in the game is AMAZING. Sometimes I like just playing the game, so I can run\naround, across roof tops, and attacking zombies while talking to friends.\n\n- Co-op in story mode. Freaking amazing. No dumb lobby. Just click 'Join game' and bam,\nyou'll be thrown a few feet away from a friend without them sometimes even noticing you joined!\n\n- Single play and Co-op have a huge impact; co-op feels fun, slightly safer, and adds a lot in the form of friendly rivals! Single player feels way more tense and everything you do counts, making you second guess some choices, for fear or death. Night time in either mode is fun as heck, though four co-op makes it pretty easy.\n\n- Night and Day feel almost like two different modes. In the day, zombies shuffle around, falling off rooftops, being dumb, easy to avoid and kill. Night time? Get those UV Flares ready, and be ready to flee if they catch sight of you.\n\n- Even after beating the story, I keep coming back for more, as it's super fun.\n\n- Took me around 30 hours to do the story, which also included only HALF of the side missions. Still got a little over 50% left to go, and looking forward to it!\n\nTL;DR - Get the game, find friends to play with, enjoy the hell out of one of the few games worth it at full price.\n- Two main things first up: -\n\n1)  The advertising is wrong.  This is isometric 3D for nearly the whole game, not 2D.\n2)  Do have an X-Box controller if you buy this game.  The game is far more difficult and less enjoyable if you don't.\n\n   The game shows you don't need a complex plot to make a great game.  Evil Wizard has attacked castle and kidnapped four princesses.  Your job (and that of up to three of your mates) is to go out there, beat up the bad guys, and rescue the princesses.  The game is effectively \"Double Dragon Medieval\".  You don't get to use the scenery as weapons but you do have archery, magic, fast or heavy melee options, jumping, attacks combos, different weapons, and pets that give you bonuses.  The game is reasonably fast paced - two to three massed minion attacks, mini boss, two to three more massed minion attacks, big boss.\n\n    The key game mechanic is experience points with which you can build strength (melee attacks do more damage), power (magic does more damage and recharges quicker), defence (enemy attacks do less damage), and speed (move quicker and srchery does more damage).  This means the more you play, the tougher your character gets, and the easier the enemies become.  It's quite fun playing from the start with high level characters who easily demolish the starting opposition.\n\n   The game's graphics are bright and colourful, the different soundtracks for each stage are bouncy and fun.  The enemies change regularly so the games doesn't become too monotonous but there are few foes that cannot be beaten with melee combos and dodge (that said there are a small number of mini bosses and big bosses from whom you need to keep your distance and a decent magic attack becomes essential).\n\n    Any negatives ?\n\n    1) The dev's humour is basic and scatological.  If you have a strong aversion to poo jokes this will be a negative.\n    2)  Minor spoiler - Some of the bad guys look like angry golliwogs.  Coupled with the knights' outfits that aren't too dissimilar  from the KKK this has caused accusations of racism.  Of course the KKK costumes are reminiscent of medieval knights which is the more likely inspiration for the game.  One of the princesses is definitely black.  Personally I'm not sure.  Compared with \"Birth of a Nation\" the game is \"Sesame Street\" but only an idiot wouldn't have recognised that someone would have been upset by the imagery.  Personally I can live with it and still enjoy it as a medieval Double Dragon but I give you warning in case you won't.\n\nS.x.\n\n\n- Gone are the days of mindless building and fun. Power grids? Taxes? Intense accounting and counter-intuitive path building. A pre-built zoo for tutorials. I actually felt MORE stressed after playing this game. If you're looking for something to flex that brain, perfect. If you're looking to release the cougars and create chaos, you can do that in sandbox I guess. You could also just not connect power grids correctly. Works like a charm. Honestly who thinks of these things\n- Don't believe the hype.\n\nAbsolutely limited appeal and not Rouge-Lite/Like, shouldn't even be remotely labelled as such. Cult management and the building of your cult is very rudimentary and a massive missed opportunity. No strategy or tactics in combat (little to no variation in creatures) and ultra repetitive. Little to no option and interaction with followers of any substance besides the simple 101's. \n\nSo many better options out there (cheaper as well) that can offer you more and robust challenge (rim world, for eg).\n\nIf you must purchase, only do so at a extremely discounted rate. You'll regret it otherwise.\n\nCute graphics will only get you so far.\n\nDon't believe the hype.\n\n【グループB】\n- Look, I love Magic. It's my favorite game of all time. I met my wife through MTG. I'll be playing it until the day I die.\n\nBut if you're new to the game, and not established on Arena, don't pick it up. It's horrendously difficult to build a collection in this game, doubly so if you're not a fan of playing draft. While they have made incredibly minor adjustments that have been generally positive, the economy on this platform is impossible to do well in. The sheer number of games you have to play to amass any kind of respectable, and more importantly, functional collection of cards is not worth it for just a casual player.\n\nOf course, you can circumvent the grind with money, but that of course is the literal definition of Pay 2 Win. It's a mobile game economy through and through.\n- I had the privilege of playing a game that provided an immersive and emotional experience set during the Great Patriotic War. This game, which I highly recommend. From the moment you start playing, it's evident that the developers spared no effort in recreating the atmosphere of the era. \nOne aspect that truly impressed me was the game's narrative. The storylines, filled with genuine human drama.\nI also must commend the game's sound design.\n- TL;DR: This game didn't receive a similar love and praise than Undertale because potato. Play it.\n\n------\n\nIf you're reading this, I already like you and I already think you have a good taste in videogames.\n\nOneShot is one of those little surprises you might have heard of but always keep pushing onto your backlog, assuming other games should have more priority. Eventually I decided to try it out and it took just a few minutes to regret all those delays.\n\nIt is extremely hard to give you some useful information about OneShot without spoiling the heck out of it. You start the game in a dark, small bedroom where the main character (Niko) simply wakes up. That's it. By simply walking around and interacting with elements you soon get some clue of the mechanics that will be present through the whole game and how to progress. \n\nAnd you will also see why this game is special. \n\nWhat the game attempts is probably not new to you. It has constant elements of surprise but many other titles (Undertale as the easiest example) have done so too. When the idea is saturated, it gets harder to eventually fulfill its purpose and, well, surprise the player. \n\nOneShot is the game that will surprise you no matter what. \n\nThrough a simplistic but engaging plot, amazing and memorable soundtrack, and interesting dialogues you'll get yourself into a journey you won't regret. I wish I could give you more details but like many other reviews here, I feel like I would ruin the experience for you. The best I can do is to assure you that you will easily feel like us: that this title is an incredible gem and that you will feel bad for giving it a chance so late.\n- Where to start.... in short entire game is boring and very slow paced for no aparent reason.\n\nAI: AI performs only very basic functions and does not upgrade buildings and does the opposite of whats beneficial for your empire. AI does not do very well when engaging in displomacy.\n\nUI: You will spend most of your time trying to manage/hover around very CLUMSY and absolutely disgusting UI. Other 4x games offer far superior UI and make is easier to manage your asset on the field e.g. Sword of the stars II, Star Ruler 2, Distant world, Endless Legends, Endless Space etc.\n\nGFX: Graphics are not the top notch what you would expect from a modern 4x game but they are on far with Endless Legends. GFX leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nAlien Races: I dont need to say much but like Planets most of the races are COPY / PASTE. Nothing unique or special about each. \n\nMP: Multiplayer has a mind of its own and in most cases wont let you join public games unless its a private game.\n\nStellaris bring nothing new to 4x Genre in 2016!.\n Right now everyone is almost beta testing for the developers so we can find bugs, report them  and help them fix their game. Why not let players do beta before before release? But then there is  a question of sale and refund. \n\nBut overall this game does offer amazing soundtrack.\n- Persona 5 ain't shit\nPokemon ain't shit\nFinal Fantasy ain't shit.\n\nStar Ocean 2's been the shit, will always be the shit, and with this remaster - IS THE BEST REMASTER FOR A JRPG OF ALL TIME. THE GOAT FROM SPACE RETURNS!\n\nAlso is it just me or is Precis extra horny on main? I don't recall her being this forward on the PS1, but hey - cool game that doesn't shy away from the old stuff on the hunt for ESG Blackrock points.\n\nTEN OUTTA TEN\n- > go into time trial\n> classic f1 cars\n> 2004 ferrari\n> put on headphones\n> play with that gorgeous v10 as soundtrack\n> best day ever\n\nalso career mode is great\n- *Sigh* This game was just tiring. I wouldn't come to say it was a complete rip off of Paper's Please, but it was a very similar game but just worse. Mainly to the point that I played, at most, 10 minutes, I saw multiple repeats of the same messages, and the only updates were legislation, unlike in Papers, Please where you got new rules and new tools almost every day. I won't completely judge the game since I haven't played it the entire way through, but it's just not very good. Plain and simple.\n- POTENTIAL SPOILERS \n\n\n\nSome guy came to me asking for mercy, gave me $20 and gave me a digital watch and asked me to let him in for the love of god, I arrested him.\n\nI let a prostitute get enslaved because I felt like it.\n\nI've ruined more marraiges than Monopoly.\n\nI've made a deal with a group of terrorists.\n\nI put poison on a random dudes passport and got him killed, along with another soldier.\n\nI got shot in the face in front of my own family.\n\nI'm only 3 hours into the game.\n\n\n\n10/10 \"It's okay\", \"Like Skyrim with guns\"\n\nDid I mention I killed Biker from Hotline Miami?\n- \"You've played for 1000 hours. Would you recommend this game to other players?\"\n- Let's say you capture a prisoner after a bloody raid on your colony. Do you want to:\n\n1. Let them go in the hopes of improving relations with the attackers? YOU CAN DO THAT.\n\n2. Heal them and have colonists talk to them about how great your colony is until they join? YOU CAN DO THAT.\n\n3. Have a colonist with a high medical skill remove their liver to transplant into an alcoholic colonist? YOU CAN DO THAT.\n\n4. Have a colonist with a low medical skill remove their organs just for practice? YOU CAN DO THAT.\n\n5. Eat them because you forgot to stock up on food for the winter? YOU CAN DO THAT.\n\nReally, what else do you need in a game?\n- First of all - Subnautica is a good game. Very atmospheric, very scary and overall a really overwhelming experience. At first. \nThis might be the only negative review in this month, but I think some of you might appreciate a different view than \"omg this game is just awesome\". Which it kinda is, but in some points it maybe isnt.\n\nThis first section of the review doesnt contain any major spoilers for the story, just a comment on the overall progress through the game stages.\nAt the time of writing this review, I played the game for ~ 35 hours, I have advanced quite a bit. The first few hours were fantastic, I was looking for new things to explore, the blueprints for all the stuff that I need and every new thing felt like I made a progress. But then at a certain point nothing new happend. It seemed to me like I had all resources I could ever need (even the blue crystals), I had all the vehicles you could build, all the upgrades I needed.\nAnd then there was no challenge anymore. You build your submarines, your bases and the game gets too easy, its not a challenge anymore. Don't continue reading after this point, if you havent played the game yet.\n\n[spoiler] The big strength of this game is the immersion in the seemingly endless underwater worlds. But at a certain point this immersion breaks (at least it did for me).\nNone of the monsters can really harm you, not even the biggest ones are a real threat. Just hop into you seamoth and out-speed everything. If there is a leviathan, just hug the walls or strave, they cant catch you. And if they do, just step out, repair your ship and continue. None of the threats is really dangerous. You really need to have bad luck to die. And if you do ... nothing happens. You just respawn.\nAt first the map seems endless, since you cant move fast. But once you get the seamoth, the map is very finite. Sure, there are deeper levels you cant access with the moth, but everything on the surface is within reach. Its the same with the deeper levels and the prawnsuit.\nSurvival is hard at first, since you constantly need to get water and food. Once you can plant you own food, you have unlimited supply and the survival aspect becomes just an annoyence.\n\nAnother thing that bothers me is the amount of resources you need to build stuff. In the later part of the game you need to build a giant structure. But the necessary resources are just like \"get 3 wooden planks, 2 nails and a hammer\". And with these resources you build the statue of liberty.\n\nMy last point is about the storyline. After something like 15 hours into the game there was a major stall for me - I had no clue where to go, to me it seemed like I searched everything I had access to at that time. I searched for 10 hours and found nothing. I went to the Islands twice to check if I missed anything, but no. I dont know, maybe I just had bad luck and something didnt trigger right, I missed a hint somewhere or something. It eventually went on, but on that point I already had the big submarine, the prawnsuit and everything. The story felt like I just need to run from A to B and back, there was no challenge anymore. \n [/spoiler]\n\nSo anyways. If you made it this far in the review, thanks for reading. If you disagree with me, thats totally fine for me. I don't want to ruin the game for anyone, maybe the points that bother me dont mean much to you.\nI know that my critique is pretty harsh. There are many positive aspects in this game. If you can really dive into this game and fully roleplay it, submerge in its story and ignore some flaws, this is a fantastic game.\nBut maybe some of you are like me, so some of my mentioned points could bother you too.\nThanks for reading, I hope I didnt butcher the English language too badly, feel free to comment, if you like.\n- Hi, I think there's been a mistake, when I open the programme it tells me that there's no game at all. Somehow, I still managed to find myself entertained for 4 hrs with beautiful graphics, intelligent puzzles and brilliant, soulful music.\nI'm only not asking for a refund because some mysterious voice requested me not to. (He sounded.. Russian)\nWould be happy if this could be fixed soon.\n- I hated Undertale.\n\nIt was, pretty clearly, a game about sexy skeletons. I did not care about sexy skeletons. I refused to play a game about sexy skeletons.\n\nThen my friend made me listen to the soundtrack, and I decided I could deal with a few hours of sexy skeletons if I got to listen to the best video game music I had ever heard while doing it. \n\nI played Undertale. It's not a game about sexy skeletons. It's a game about choices, maybe, or morality, or curiosity. It's a game about pushing the limits. It's a game about experiences, about \"what would happen if I did this?\", about storytelling so intricate and complex and raw that it shouldn't be able to fit into seven hours of bullet hell and pixel graphics. But, somehow, it does. Every choice you make has an impact. Every object you check has a story. The soundtrack, the witty yet profound writing, the simple pixel graphics, and even the menu screens and bullet patterns themselves all intertwine in order to tell a story that only you decide the ending of.\n\nAlso, the skeletons aren't even sexy.\n\nMy advice to you: Go in as blind as you can. Don't read walkthroughs. Don't watch playthroughs. Don't prepare yourself. Don't even look at overviews. Hell, don't even read the Steam page description. Just buy the game (and give some well-earned money to a little white dog), and, as it were, climb the mountain yourself. Don't let anyone backseat. Don't listen to people who tell you there's a right way to play.\n\nAnd when you think you've reached the end, just think--what other choices could you have made?\n\nSo, yes. I hated Undertale.\n\nAnd then I played it.\n- There's a lot to like about Control, and I'm glad I played it. It's unfortunate how often I found myself thinking, \"they shouldn't have bothered\". The environments and level design are quite good, and I liked poking around and finding lore. I can't avoid mentioning the destruction physics and graphics, which were beautiful, impressive, and made me feel like I was actually destroying the world around me. The story and characterization are decent, with par for the course voice acting for a video game. The game is a fine length with plenty of levels and missions. Overall, Control is a solid game that's worth trying.\n\nThe gunplay is another story. While levitating, dashing, launching, seizing, shielding, and the other combat powers you have at your disposal felt effective and even enjoyable at times (especially launch), the guns never felt right in any of their incarnations. The visual effects of the service weapons as they shapeshift are a nice touch, though many of them feel either inaccurate or unable to rise to the task, damage-wise. For magic guns they felt very much like something was missing, and could have used some more work. For a game with so much of its duration devoted to combat, it doesn't feel like gunplay got its fair share.\n\nWith such anemic gunplay, I was surprised to see a skill tree, crafting, and randomized mods complete with a rarity system. This is where \"they shouldn't have bothered\" comes in. The skill tree is utterly boring, being mostly +X% to a stat with the occasional ability upgrade that could have been a quest reward. With an expensive reset cost and the fact that you'll be able to nearly max out everything, the skill tree doesn't exactly play into buildcrafting. Then again, neither do the mods. \n\nWhen I say \"randomized mods\", I mean in the style of an MMO. Each mod has a random stat and then a random buff to that stat within a range, depending on its rarity. These things are everywhere, trip over a box and you'll find three. I feel that this system makes little sense for this game. Especially with the DLC mods, there are so many different effects that you'll find it difficult to create a specific \"build\" and will probably stick to the core stats like damage, hp, energy, etc. It's a thin veneer of progression that wouldn't be out of place in a multiplayer game, RPG, or MMO.\n\nSo say you want to engage with the mod system and flesh out a \"build\". Well, the jukebox has you covered. After you've farmed up or crafted some coins (tickets), you can pay to enter a repeatable mission and earn some random mods. This is the exact same mission every time you play it. It's not even changed procedurally or set in different areas of the game. It's the exact same level, the same objectives, the same enemies, the same boss, etc., every single time you play it. This mission is designed to be farmed. It's not the only farming you're encouraged to do, either. What's worse, as you play, your tiny inventory quickly fills up and you'll find yourself stopping after each mission (or in the middle of a mission) to do inventory management. Compare mods, equip mods, delete mods, farm mods, fill up your inventory... it's not an engaging system. They simply shouldn't have bothered.\n\nControl is at its best when it's being a single player game, with environments and worldbuilding that suck you in, with exploration and lore, and with the missions and duties of being the director. Control is at its worst when it thinks it's a multiplayer game, with boring skill trees, mods, crafting, and inventory management. It's so needless and mars what would otherwise be a perfectly serviceable game (save the service weapons).\n- Remember when you first played Thumper, and you were expecting a rhythm game but got so much more?\nOr when you played Thomas Was Alone, and you somehow fell in love with characters who were literally monochromatic rectangles?\nOr when you got to the final level of Journey, and you nearly cried of amazement at the emotional EXPLOSION AND RELEASE?\nAll those feelings? That is Sayonara Wild Hearts.\n- Overall its a great hunting game. The base game is good enough on its own to give you an enjoyable experience hunting several varieties of animals. \n\nI feel that some of the best content is in the DLC's. I dont mind the price tag for maps are they are just a large and some of them have a truly diverse animal population. \n\nThe Weapon Packs have some items that really should have been available in the base game (.22 rifle).\nTripod stands, Tents and ATV's are also DLC items that i feel should have been included in the base game. \n\nThe cost for these packs are not huge, and I have bought them, but they really do impact your play in a meaningful way so it is hard not feel like they were left out on purpose. \n\nBeing a former hunter in real life I would say that the realism of it is pretty good. Lung shots and heart shots drop animals quickly and using the right ammo along with good aim greatly influences this. A poor shot will leave you tracking this wounded animal across the map till you sneak up on it again or just give up. \n\nThey have a system called Tru Racks (sumthn like that) that simulates different qualities of animals. So you end up with little bucks, average bucks, and monster bucks. Weight and coloration plays a part in this too. In short every animal has a trophy of some kind and they are varied by what must be some sort of RNG. \n\nAll that having been said, this game can devolve into a shooting gallery were you kill everything on sight as there in no real incentive not to. You get money and experience for every kill you claim and wiping out a heard of deer with your DLC M1 Garand on your DLC Tripod Stand becomes the quickest way to bypass the grind.\n\n It feels like the game starts as a \"hunting sim\" and becomes a \"poaching sim\" once you realize the progression system is going to take a long time to do...\"ethically?\".\n\n\nAgain, this is a game i would recommend, but it is just that, a game. \n\n\n- 2023...\n\n2 years...\n\n2 Languages...\n\nEDIT:\n\nTLDR: Game is too simple, better get Factorio or Riftbreaker\n\n\nPlayed again after ~1 year, nothing has changed in the basic QoL or coding system.\n\n\n- It still uses an older builder system than Factorio did 10 years ago: you actually have to craft the base material manually every time before you can build the building, instead of it being done automatically by a simple click on the building in the build menu.\n\n- If you have crafting orders set, new items added to your inventory will not be read by the current crafting orders and keeps on produce stuff your already own...\n\n- Items don't have their own output for transport lines, but instead require this stupid additional output... (I think the developer couldn't create a better output than this simple one)\n\n\n20 minutes and that's enough for me for now, I'm not putting in any more effort for EA project\n- I shall start by saying that if you are deciding to buy this game then don't let the negative reviews sway you. In general, Fallout 4 is an amazing game and can be incredibly fun.\n\nPros: \n-Very immersive and will drain so many hours, days, weeks and months from your life.\n-Far Harbour, Automotron and (first half of) NukaWorld DLC have really good stories, quests and environments.\n-Mostly fluid combat system. Everything depends on how you want to play the game.\n\nCons: \n-WIll drain so much of your life away (might've forgotten my gf's birthday ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ )\n-Main story was incredibly lackluster compared to previous Fallout games\n-Giving you the option to be literally any kind of character you want to be....except you're always tied to being a parent.\n-a few repitive quests. (although gives you opportunities to approach these quests, areas and enemies differently\n\nAll in all, If you're a Fallout fan because of previous stories then you might not feel fulfilled playing this game, however if you love character creations, lore and immersive environments with untold stories then I completely recommend this game to you.\n- theres 2 options with this game, either you play the original without mods wich is still a very good game\nor you have the untitled goose, matt from wii sports, sans undertale, and barack obama fight on top of a mcdonalds\n\n10/10 game\n- We need a 60fps patch ASAP. Having 30fps content on PC in [current year] is not acceptable.\n\nOther than that the game is pretty solid! It looks great, it plays great, the story was good imo, the characters are interesting and the amount of solo content is decent.\n\nHowever, the gear system is not as elaborate as in Mk11 and the microtransations are NOT a welcome sight. Denuvo also has to go. If Harada agreed that the addition of Denuvo in Tekken 7 was a mistake, so should NetherRealm.\nI also don't like that 2 characters that are going to be in the Kombat Pass are already in the game (Ermac and Quan Chi). Just give us these characters and come up with other ones for the KP. This is super greedy and lazy.\nIt's even worse than Sektor and Cyrax in MK11, at least you didn't let us play them, period. this time you decide to not make them playable (even thought they work for the AI) AND sell them at a later date? That's awful.\n\nThe game is good but needs improvement and shouldn't ship with performance issues, 30fps content, microtransactions, Denuvo and greedy DLC tactics. I would put a \"meh\" review if I could because of the negatives but for that reason I have to say \"no\".\n- A dude looked at you funny? Punch him. Some guy is chilling by the river? Kick him in. A girl has a cute outfit on? Divekick her from across the street. Bought pizza at a food truck? Uppercut the staff. Violence is never the answer; It is in fact the question, and the answer is YES.\n- [h2] Visual Novel Reviews [/h2]\n\n[b] TLDR [/b] Two scenes, no customization, no choices, character development needs work, but the Extremely short story delivered (If you know what I mean) a whopping 38 minutes of game play for me. \n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [th]Question[/th]\n        [th]Answer[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Buy Again[/td]\n        [td]No, I wouldn't.

This is the second game that this developer has released, so I am not disappointed that I spent 5$ dollars on a game that they created, but I will say that I will think Long and Hard (No Pun Intended) before purchasing another game from this studio.\n- Yeah sooooo I went 1k words past the max...had to pare this down...it's ok...I'm mentally stable...\n\nCrossCode is a top-notch indie in its genre. I'd mention it in the same breath as Celeste, Hades, and Outer Wilds. (guess I just did.) If you can at least enjoy both puzzles and real-time combat, this game is for you; it's not as much of a JRPG as it might look. The only real flaw I care to levy is that it isn’t incredible out of the gate; it’s merely good, and gets much better. I was going to summarize my reactions and add a \"what is the premise/gameplay loop\" section and have longer sections but I had to cut it all out so have _/5 ratings on the section titles instead. It's fine. I'm fine. Everything is fine.\n\nOk, review time.\n\nSTORY 4/5 NEATO\n\nThe story is great, and not quite what you might expect. It starts pretty light and cozy, with solid (and often meta) humor interspersed with cryptic moments. I like how casually the in-universe MMO is treated by the players. I enjoyed all the characters, including our mostly-mute but personable Lea. Once it ramps up, the story takes some exciting turns, too; the devs really know how to do drama without doing overdrama. I didn't relate too much to the story but I think it was told quite well. I like the portrayal of the antagonists for the most part, though I wish I could have felt their presence more often. The lore is also fascinating, if occasionally hard to grasp because the line between real and virtual is very thin due to the game’s particular premise. (The difference between real people and NPCs is sometimes unclear, for instance.) The ending was good, but I think the DLC epilogue wraps the game up far better.\n\nCOMBAT 5/5 WOWIE\n\nWhen you start out, combat feels almost hack-n-slashy. You can spam melee attacks and bullets for days, but you also have a charged projectile, a dodge-dash, and a shield. The elemental modes are absolutely the highlight due to the way enemies work, and the sort of limiter gauge they have forces strategy. Special moves are stylish and borderline absurd at higher levels. A huge skill tree controls them and much more; unlike some skill trees, this one requires choices, which is always a good sign. Oh and consumables are your main source of healing and buffs, and they aren't overpowered! Balancing win.\n\nThe enemies are really what make the combat fantastic. Almost every enemy has at least one gimmick and one visible weakness. The stun gauge mechanic is vital to all battles, forcing you to exploit those weaknesses to stun enemies and give you time to use your extra-long special moves. Bosses love to give you iterative micro-puzzles to fill their stun gauges, while minibosses are comfortably in-between. Bosses commonly have armor or invulnerability when not stunned, forcing even overleveled players to figure out the micro-puzzles to hit hard. (More great balancing.) Most weaknesses involve the element system, eventually encouraging you to swap elements multiple times mid-fight. The micro-puzzles will build on what you’ve been learning in a dungeon if it’s a dungeon fight. I'll mention that some normal enemies do feel like damage sponges at first, but you'll get used to this; the simple enemy design in the early game makes it seem worse than it is imo.\n\nPUZZLES 5/5 FUN COOL\n\nFor puzzles you've got your common environmental \"platforming\" puzzles, your specialized quest puzzles, your dynamic mini-puzzles in battles, and your iterative puzzling gauntlets in dungeons. Also almost everything is secretly part puzzle? Like, everything. They're an invasive species. They draw most of their complexity from the element system too. Each element has its own effects on certain objects and structures, and mainly you use charge shots to interact, though each attack has its own uses. Not much to say here; they're great puzzles. A couple may stump you for a while, but that's impossible to avoid, and I think CrossCode strikes a perfect challenge balance.\n\nQUESTS 5/5 WHEEEEEE\n\nWhile some quests conform to the typical hunting/gathering quests of MMOs, most boast some entirely unique content. Challenges range from unique bosses to puzzles to platforming to other familiar gimmicks that are secretly also puzzles. I won't spoil them. Quests generally use mechanics you have seen already in new, often very different, scenarios. NPCs are mostly there to be amusing or set up the gameplay, and that didn't bother me tbh.\n\nITEM MANAGEMENT 5/5 AAAAA\n\nItem and equipment acquisition? Engaging? WTF? Technically you get them like you do in any RPG. But, rare plants have high rare item drop rates, so if you know the platforming puzzle to reach em you don't have to waste much time. Enemies' drop rates rise with a high Combat Rank, which you get by killing many enemies in a row before the post-fight cooldown period ends and you get to heal to full and level up. This is tough until you're very comfortable with the area. Once you are, it's a whole new way of battling, using area knowledge to string together sequential fights. And what does the game do but give you a piece of upgradable equipment that grants the Combat Rating bonus to plants too?\n\nI actually cared about the equipment in the game too! *kisses Life Fiber Uniform* (yes they really make this reference) Equipment also matters more than level so the devs can control your power level better. Most times you can buy some basic equipment to explore, then return with items to trade to NPCs for stronger gear. Stronger gear has unique traits and you might prefer one over another, so it's nice that with trading you get to focus your resources on what you want. Sometimes you can trade some enemy drops for other ones, as I recall, which is a nice...uh, trade-off to get to make.\n\nQUALITY OF LIFE 5/5 HELP\n\nCONVENIENCE REIGNS in CrossCode. Text log like in visual novels? Check. Encyclopedia of story recaps, character summaries, CrossWorlds lore & terminology, etc.? Check. Enemy index? Check. Item drop rates? Check. Available trades? You beck. This is EXTREMELY helpful for an RPG, which otherwise would require a guide or plain luck to find rare item drops. Oh yeah also there's UI? I forgot about it cuz it's really good. Also the keyboard controls for swapping elements are a bit janky but I managed.\n\nAesthetics 3/5-5/5 SUBJECTIVITY WOOOOOO\n\nYeah if ya like what you see in the trailers and screenshots, that oughta be enough. I thought the art was average-good in the beginning, but like everything else the art improves as you go. They must’ve gone back and worked on old stuff, but not too much. The music is great. No complaints there. My one objective critique is, Lea has no depth perception -- the art makes similar-height platforms look identical. I ran into so many walls and stared at so many small flat gaps I thought I couldn't cross. I'm not a fool! It's the game's fault! But actually this time!\n\nA NEW HOME DLC 6/5 WTF OMG\n\nThe paid DLC is The Culmination of CrossCode. The epilogue is complex and fascinating and rewarding. The dungeon is an incredible all-elements send-off. I adore the new quests. And the art?? The environments, the enemies, the NPC portraits are all so pretty. Don't be fooled by the letters \"DLC\": this is not Discretionary Leisure Content. If you liked the base game, this is...Deluxe...eLite...C-content??? look these are not great letters to work with ok\n\nCONCDLUDSIONO\n\nWhat else to say? CrossCode good. Buy it. Do the thing. Also, look out for Project Terra, Radical Fish's next project. It translates their current style into a 3D environment with dynamic lighting. It’s pretty & it reduces that height perspective issue. There isn’t much info about it out yet, but keep your eyes out! (figuratively pls) I'm excited for what they'll come up with.\n\nHOLY **** I MADE IT AND WITH CHARACTERS TO SPARE YESSSS — ohnowai\n- This is trash, I mean if you eat shit for breakfast I'm sure you'll like it.  You have to pay to have access to graphics better than the PS2's, also your stuff gets deleted every week. All there is to do is punch a couple zombies.  Don't get this game.\n- I have it on the Epic store but the amount of stuttering it has made it unplayable so I gave up. I got the Humble choice for $6 to get a steam key and try it on here because I have a few games on steam that run well but run poorly on other platforms like the awful Windows store or the below average Epic launcher, but it's unfortunately the same deal on here for this game. It has done it on two entirely different computer setups for me so that tells me that they didn't bother to spend enough time testing enough different pc setup combinations when it was in development, and my pc setup isn't rare by any means. The look and functioning of the UI and menu's shows that it is a obvious direct console port which would explain their lack of attention to the pc version.\n\nEven giving it a fair shot based on content, it's pretty much just a modified version of Borderlands 2. The amount of dialogue is unbearable. No one in the game EVER shuts up, and every single last word they say is cringe. It's like a kid in fifth grade who laughs at fart jokes wrote the entire script. In addition to everyone never shutting up, the main boss randomly has page-long speeches over the radio just to make sure you get the message that they want you to feel entirely uncomfortable at this game's bottomless amount of cringe.\n\nThe gameplay is identical to BL2, with the only real new noticeable features being that some guns have two functions that you can toggle on and off with the C key and of course the new playable characters. However even without the stuttering ruining the game for me, it's my opinion that BL3's negatives, mainly the insane amount of neverending dialogue and how unbelievably cringe it is, overshadow its positives.\n- It's a R@PE SIMULATOR. Games like this should not be played. I was tempted to play, and will do so for a few hours in future, may be a demon has possessed me...or may be I just don't waste my money that I have spent on it. But really, you should not encourage these games. Who have not bought this game, plz don't buy.\n- **DAY 1 REVIEW**\n!!There is no game here yet!! \nCan't get into a server (they aren't full usually empty) \nOnce you manage to make it in you cant gather any resources\nThe game has a harder time running than starfield\nYou can jump and sometimes not get rubber banned back\nThe game looks nothing like the screenshots displayed on the store \n\n\nI will update once they make substantial updates and there is something to talk about\n- ---{Gameplay}--- \n☑ Try not to get addicted\n☐ Very good\n☐ Good\n☐ Nothing special\n☐ Ehh\n☐ Bad\n☐ Just dont\n\n---{Graphics}---\n☐ Masterpiece\n☑ Beautiful\n☐ Good\n☐ Decent\n☐ Will do\n☐ Bad\n☐ Awful\n☐ Paint.exe\n\n---{Audio}--- \n☐ Eargasm\n☑ Very good\n☐ Good\n☐ Decent\n☐ Not too bad\n☐ Bad\n☐ Earrape\n\n---{Audience}--- \n☐ Kids\n☐ Teens\n☐ Adults\n☑ Everyone\n\n---{PC Requirements}--- \n☐ Check if you can run paint\n☑ Potato\n☐ Decent\n☐ Fast\n☐ Rich boi\n☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{Story}--- \n☑ Doesn't have \n☐ Something isnt nothing I guess\n☐ Not greatly told\n☐ Average\n☐ Good\n☐ Lovely\n☐ Will make you cry or smile alot\n\n---{Difficulity}--- \n☐ Just press a bunch of buttons\n☐ Easy\n☐ Significant brain usage \n☐ Easy to learn / Hard to master\n☐ Not so easy\n☑ Difficult\n☐ Dark Souls\n\n---{Grind}--- \n☐ Nothing\n☐ Only if you care about leaderboards/ranks\n☐ Isnt necessary to progress\n☐ A bit grindy sometimes\n☐ Average grind level\n☐ A bit grindy\n☑ Insanity\n\n---{Game Time}--- \n☐ Long enough for a cup of tea\n☐ Short\n☐ Average\n☐ Long\n☐ Depends on you\n☑ Endless\n\n---{Price}--- \n☑ Just buy it\n☐ Worth the price\n☐ Wait for sale\n☐ Maybe if you have some spare money left\n☐ Not recommended\n☐ Dont throw money into a rubbish bin\n\n---{Bugs/Glitches}--- \n☐ Never had any\n☑ Minor bugs/glitches\n☐ Few bugs/glitches \n☐ Can get annoying\n☐ Ruining the game\n☐ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs/glitches\n- THERE IS ONLINE CO-OP with REMOTE PLAY!  Im not sure why that guy put misinformation in the beginning of his review.\n\nIf you have 3 friends, only one of you needs to buy this and invite them through remote play and you will have a BLAST. First session we played 3 hours straight and laughed so hard we gave ourselves a headache.\n\nAlot of love went into making this game and a lot of hidden easter eggs nodding to other games. If you need something to play with your group of friends during quarantine, this is the game!\n- As i previously stated, i was going to play through metro fully and i have done so, so here is my update to this review. \nThis game is not the best selling triple A game in the world and it may have some bugs (like a table that wasnt solid or the objects in that room lol) however it is a decent game. the story is decent and the characters voices are way off but they sorta make up for it with their personalities. \n\nExploration in this game is by far one of the most interesting in my opinion and the way your character acts in the enviroment makes it more interesting aswell, for example wiping your visor when it gets dirty (wasnt that helpful for me in my play through but it was a nice touch) and your visor taking damage in combat adds to the immersive feel of this wasteland/paradise almost. Scavenging weapons and parts and combining them to make better equipment is quite intriguing and quick to do if you can find the parts. \n\nat the end of the day my final review of this is its a good game i would play it again even if it is a bit clunky sometimes (atleast it was for me lmao)\n\n\n\n\n\nOh and hopefully my punctuation is good enough so no one passes out this time lmao\n- Finished pillars of eternity 1 as a priest of berath, pledging my soul to the god of cycles, life and death. Promising to release the thousands of captured souls back to the wheel of reincarnation at the end of the game.\n\nStarted pillars of eternity 2, only to find out I was murdered after the events of the first game by a god who was believed to have been slain during the saints war. \n\nMy soul then comes face to face with the god I have devoted my life to, the god of life, death, and reincarnation.\n\nAfter a brief discussion about how I kept my promise at the end of the first game, my favoured god revealed to me he wants me to come back to life and serve him once again, and slay the being that killed me.\n\nI refused. It is only right that my soul is allowed to be reborn and return to the cycle, as I have worshipped this diety my whole life.\n\nMy god agreed. I was reborn as a wolf and the credits of Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire started to roll.\n\nPretty short game but 10/10\n- I'm gonna be talking about the game in very broad strokes so don't worry about spoilers. \n\nI'm bananas about the Dead Space series. The experience of playing the original in 2009 or so left a massive impression on me and I think this is overall a pretty fantastic update. I've played the original [strike] trilogy [/strike] duology to death on every system, listened to stuff, looked at stuff, everything. So as someone who has Nicole's monologue burnt into the back of my eyelids, I was pretty sceptical Motive would be able to win me over with Dead Space 23. I was very pleasantly surprised, though. It's clear a lot of love and care went into refining Dead Space for the remake and in many ways I find these refinements make the setting, characters, and mysteries all a lot more compelling. \n\nOn the lead up to release there was an IGN series of short interviews with developers, artists, writers, etc working on the remake. It was really fascinating hearing about how they were approaching different aspects of the project, there's a lot of interesting insights about the aesthetic and thematic goals of the game in there that get me really craving a Dead Space 23 art book. If you're sceptical about Dead Space 23, I think they're worth a watch. It's really striking how thoughtful they've been in creating their take on Dead Space and I don't think their efforts deserve to go so easily overlooked. If you're really interested in the artistry of the series I'd also highly recommend The Art of Dead Space, it's a great book and an amazing collection of art that really lays bare the core identity of the series. It's been a great companion piece to Dead Space 23.  I think a lot of people have been comparing the choices and artistic aims of the original team and the new devs in bad faith, I really can't see anything but reverence for the source material here. I'd also say that the differences that are there are interesting and well worth exploring!\n\nI'm also glad Dead Space has room to breathe again, EA really pushed the extended universe the first time around and I'm glad to see that mistake hasn't been repeated. I'm not someone who's super into lore, I like finding extra information that re-contextualises things in cool ways but this extended universe stuff can get pretty silly. There were animated movies, books, tie-in games, a Wii rail shooter (which I enjoyed) and most of it just served to undermine the setting and the horror for me. That isn't to say the remake shies away from its roots because it absolutely doesn't, there's an entire New Game+ path that I think incorporates a direct reference to one of the extended universe novels. If you're a lorehead you'll definitely recognise familiar names in text logs, even very forgettable characters get some mentions in. I really love this about the remake, it reincorporates a lot of this disparate stuff into more of a coherent whole. \n\nI think my favourite addition is the AI director that manages encounters and atmospheric effects. Dead Space is a game that invokes hypervigilance, I think that's part of what makes the series so compelling. You're always alert, always listening and watching, always looking over your shoulder. It has an intensity that I feel is absolutely unmatched. With the AI director in the mix that feeling is sharper than ever. You can't rely on memory alone to get you through now. Yeah, you can still memorise spawns and there are still an abundance of scripted encounters but you can never safely bet you know what's coming and when. Sometimes the lights will flicker and steam will hiss from the pipes- nothing. But sometimes a pregnant and most of a divider will be waiting for you right by the shop. You can truly never assume you're safe, that feeling is no longer illusory as it was in Dead Space 2008. I think that's great. I also found that the director would spawn interesting combinations of enemy types which is cool, it went a long way to making the threat more unpredictable. \n\nI never really experienced any of the performance issues everyone else is talking about so I think my main issue with the game is very petty. I flat out do not like the redesign of the Soldier rig. They look like those guys who're really into Mandalorian themed tactical gear and Punisher stuff. So, yeah, not sure if that's an intentional update to reflect reality but, aesthetically speaking, I found it very jarring. \n\nI think this is a very solid foundation to build on to bring back the Dead Space series. I hope in the future there might be more challenge modes, higher difficulties, more unlockable suits. Most of all though I hope Motive, like their predecessors, take some pointers from the Resident Evil games. I'm a big fan of the records system in the recent Resident Evil titles. It contributes enormously to replayability and it's neat getting to examine all the models, animations, concept art, all the good stuff. As someone who likes crafts and fan projects, something like that would be indispensable. it's all work that very much deserves to be admired, too. Some of the detail on the necromorphs is ludicrous. A records system would also be a great excuse to do wild runs like beating the game without healing or opening the shop. Just give me a reason, Motive.\n\nThere are thousands of things about this remake that I could just keep gushing about. Maybe I'll update this review over time and do just that (I have). But I hope for now this review has gone some way to convincing you to try out Dead Space. \n\nTanya Clarke killed it as Nicole, too.\n- Such a neat concept!  Clear the table under so many \"strokes\".  Where it really shines, however, is all of the surreal bits you can add into your game like giant balls, conveyor belts, or balls that split when hit.  The game always has many challenges to complete that will require you to use the indicated table/ball/modifier and meet its requirements on your run (like make 3 long shots in a single run or pot multiple balls in a single shot).  Complete enough of these challenges and you'll unlock the next feature, but the game gives you a lot of freedom in which modifers you'll use in your run to increase your odds of completing the given challenge.\n- Most of the negative reviews cover my complaints already. So I won't rehash the ones I've already read. \n\nHere's my biggest complaints: \n\n- Jumpscares have never been compelling to me. Doubly so on VR. Are you trying to injure me in my computer room? Stop. \n\n- Guns are fun. Not having ammo for them is not fun. (The game is pretty generous with ammo but it also encourages tediously conservative behavior, if you just unload clips at shit you'll run out pretty fast) \n\n- \"Continuous Turning\" feels so bad. Like, how can I turn my headset and everything looks smooth as butter, but as soon as I use the look stick for turning suddenly it's all choppy and looks wrong? I'm familiar with some of the motion sickness issues people get with turning in VR games, but this isn't that... \n\n\nThough honestly it seems like they just leaned really into the whole horror thing, which is fine, but also just super not my thing. \n\nIf the mechanics and some design choices had been better I might have slogged through it anyway. \n\n\nGame's beautiful, though, so they got that going for them.\n- This game vs. HOI3:\n---------------------\n\nAdvantages:\n\n1.) The production system is more interesting and engaging, and far more balanced than the old IC system of HOI3. \n2.) The unit creation system is far more in depth and interesting, featuring many different brigade types and support companies, allowing you to change your divisions however you would like. \n3.) This game is far more stable than HOI3.\n4.) This game is updated regularly and has bugfixes regularly too, with content being added free along with every DLC. \n5.) The modding community of HOI4 is far larger with excellent mods such as Kaiserreich, Millenium Dawn, Red World, and Endseig.\n6.) HOI4 muliplayer is actually playable without making you want to shoot yourself.\n7.) China is no longer something Japan can take within 2 months.\n8.) An actual peace conference system and ideologies that actually impact the game.\n9.) Far easier to get into than HOI3.\n10.) Less railroading and the AI wont spaz if you do something ahistorical.\n11.) Planes are no longer as cancer as they used to be.\n12.) Far less micromanagement if you choose not to want to micro.\n13.) A better tutorial (still not a great one though.)\n\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n1.) The research system is bare bones in comparison to HOI3.\n2.) The War in the Pacific is basically nonexistant and naval warfare is awful (to be improved with next patch, being released eventually:tm:)\n3.) People dont really join the war in HOI4 unless theyre directly attacked, making continents like South America completely useless due to the fact that none of the countries there ever do anything but still build up their military, contributing lag.\n4.) Due to the game's engine, it can only use a single one of your processing cores, meaning regardless of your computer quality the game will run kinda slowly.\n5.) Speaking of slowly, the game is poorly optimized and frame loss is extremely common, especially 1942 onwards, when majors can have upwards of 300+ divisions. \n6.) The AI is often braindead, doing hilariously incompetent things such as charging endlessly into your lines, removing all its troops from your front, leaving major areas completely undefended, and completely ignoring the aerial aspect of the war.\n7.) Specific AI are even more braindead than the rest, specifically island nations, or nations that otherwise need to use navies and airforces more. Yes, the Japanese, American, and British AI are some of the worst in the game. In a WW2 game. \n8.) Your allies are completely useless and often you will find yourself doing all the fighting yourself, or even being hindered by your own allies. Playing as Germany the Italians likely wont place a single division in North Africa. In D-Day, you will either be the only one contributing anything or your allies will contribute so much that the supply is ruined and your troops all die of attrition. As the USSR you will recieve 0 lend lease, and as China you will get absolutely no support from the west. \n9.) HOI3 is a lot cheaper than HOI4\n\n\nOther things which I feel are worth mentioning but arent really advantages or disadvantages:\n\n1.) HOI4 contains a lot more alt-history options, which while not for everyone, are fun to try out. \n2.) The focus-tree system is something completely different from anything in HOI3.\n3.) The game has a less in-depth OOB(Order of Battle), which while to some people is nice because theyre bad with OOB, others dislike. Specifically this game lacks corps. \n4.) The battle-planning system of HOI4, while easier to use than the one in HOI3, is still flawwed. In HOI3 it did absolutely nothing, but in this game it is a core part of playing. Unless you want to mircomanage every single division, like you did in HOI3, you will use this system. \n5.) While simpler, the game still possesses a learning curve.\n\n------------------------\n\nOverall: \n\nHOI4 is a far less grounded and historical experience than HOI3. Is this a good or bad thing? That depends on your perspective. HOI4 obviously has significant advantages over HOI3 in certain areas but many consider HOI3 to be an overall better game. Personally I recommend HOI3 if you want a more micro-intensive, historical experience, and HOI4 if you want to just sit back and relax for a couple hours murdering millions of people. \n\nPersonally I would suggest either game, but thats just me.\n- Refunded.\n\nFeels like they released the wrong game files - half the game seems to be broken or missing...\nBasic functions such as zooming in and out, no tutorial, huge amounts of buttons that don't have any impact. Good idea, terrible execution.\n- Only originally bought this to support the artist, since I'm a huge fan of his pixel art work. It's amazing, and there's a tonne of eye candy to fill your eyeballs with. However, I can't recommend this to everyone as after the first few hours it's become a bit of a chore.\n\n- The game is a \"clicker\" type with rpg/upgrade elements. It's too slow to play in the background/absent mindedly but not fast enough to keep your attention fully.\n- Each round/attempt at a boss takes way too goddamn long. \n- Barely any interaction with the world. You build tower defense style, and equip new items, but beyond that you don't have any special abilities, no \"oh shit\" once per loop power, no ability to target specific enemies, nothing. Just watch everything play out and hope your little guy doesn't get pulped.\n- Crafting/Supplying is sort of hidden away and if you don't know about dismantling you'll never grind out all the items you need to build new stuff.\n- Lore/Journal entries are hidden away and require resources to unlock using a little button on the bottom of the screen that's easy to miss. I only found it 20 hours in. The writing is cringey and obviously done by someone who probably enjoys Adam Sandler films.\n- The card system is a neat idea, but jesus christ there's too much garbage shuffling. Imagine playing MtG with a deck of 100 cards and 90 of them are lands, and everytime you get a new hand you reshuffle the whole deck so all you get is more lands. Oblivion (destroys a tile) rarely, if ever, pops up. \n- Character skills are kinda bad? You might get a good one every level (which again, takes forever) but half the time it'll be useless \"leave 10% of food/resources at camp\" when you're not doing a resource grind run.\n- So much trash equipment you have to sort through and breaks game flow.\n\nAnd the biggest \"don't recommend\" from me would be the issue with how combining tiles works. If you put two tiles beside each other they sometimes change the tiles to something else. Example - put a Vampire Mansion beside a Village and you get a town full of ghouls that after 3 loops around the map turns into an upgraded town. But you still get trash equipment from the quests it gives, and putting a Vampire Mansion beside any other type of town doesn't change that town at all. So there's no reason to experiment, and it really limits the gameplay. You'd think they'd focus on that aspect gameplay wise, especially with experimentation to get the most bonuses out of all your tiles... but no. There's a small list of things that interact with each other, and that's it.\n\nI still highly recommend it since the game is cheap, the art is amazing and the artist/indie devs should get support. But I think it's a good 2-3 major updates, expansions or fan modding away from getting really, really amazing.\n- This game is shit, and the devs should eat shit for shitting this shit on top of gamer community's head.\nCombat? You need a piano keyboard to dodgeparryhitlowhithighlowthendodge. Its a clusterfuck! Reaction time? None. I tried to dodge, I got damaged, Parry same story. And don't get me started on fucking archery! HELLOO ITS 2021, PUT A FUCKING CROSSHAIR so I can hit something !!\n\nWow, what a piece of shit. 18 hours of my life spent TRYING to make sense of this clusterfuck of a game. Pity I can't get a refund AND throw dung at this whitewashed game, like people did to Deuscht.\n\nI hope you devs sit on it and rotate.\n\n- Coming from Monster Hunter World, I didn't like it for the following reasons:\n\n- WAY more anime than World. I could overlook the weird anime stuff from World because it was more subtle, but in Rise it is so in your face at all times. Matter of taste, but for me it made the game insufferable\n\n- tiny maps. I know that this is a return to old-school maps, made for portable. But coming from World it seems like a massive downgrade\n\n- graphics and ambience downgraded. Again, I know that this is because it's designed for Switch, but it doesn't change the fact that it feels like a huge step backwards\n\n- grapple zip thing. It's flashy and fast, but I felt that it takes a lot away from the methodical feel of the game. Makes the game feel more arcade\n\nMost of my complaints are based on taste, but for anyone without much MH experience before World, it's going to feel like a step back.\n- You had me at creating adventure log, well actually no, at the starting song perhaps. How many years have I been waiting for full fledge, non portable DQ since DQVIII in PS2 ?\n\nThis PC port is a great one, neat and very beautiful. I was playing at 4k/~30fps and since my GPU is not fast enough I switched to 1440p/~50-60fps instead. I wish more and more JRPGs to do PC concurrent launch like this one. A day later I switched back to 4k and change internal resolution to 80% then it was pretty much perfect.\n\n- You can choose default A/B button.\n- You can choose resolution and 30/60 FPS mode. There is a way to unlock 60+ FPS for gaming monitors, google it.\n- You can invert cameras both ways.\n- You can choose classic battle mode.\n- You can press L3 and enjoy the view.\n- Load time is non-existence with SSD.\n- Ultra Widescreen is NOT supported. Waiting for mods at the moment.\n- Keyboard and Mouse is fine but playing with controller is wayy better.\n- Fully customisable keys / controllers.\n- Story synopsys at game loading screen.\n- Silent Protagonist.\n- Full voice cutscenes.\n- Auto-run button.\n- You can jump.\n- Pros \nReally good voice ending.\nCreepy and you are unsure of everything which makes this more interesting.\nDecent story\n\nCons\nEnding just fucks up everything.\n\n\n\"I don't want Pewdiepie making money off my game.\" Im sure you made more money off Pewdiepie for advertising this shi*ty game lol.\n- (This is a spoilerfree Review)\nI recommend not to search any character or even the name of the game to avoid spoilers.\n\nBasic:\nDanganronpa Trigger Happy Havoc is a murder-mystery game with a focus on deep Story.\nThere are 3 main games and 1 spin-off game. This is the First one to start with.\nYou can expect about 40 to 50 hours in this game (depending on how fast you can read and think)\nI recommend reading all dialogue and not skipping any cutscenes.\nThe overall gameplay is simple and hard at the same time, but I bet everybody could play it.\n\nStory: (Spoilerfree/no spoiler)\nThe game is about a bunch of Students who were being dragged into a Killing Game.\nThe only way to escape is by killing another Student and getting away with it.\nYou'll learn more about it while playing, there are a bunch of unsolved questions in the beginning.\n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay is mostly divided into 2 different Parts: typical visual novel gameplay\n(freetime use and social interaction) and the Class Trials. In these class trials\nyou have to solve some Minigames but mostly try to discover the Murderer (or imposter if you played Among us).\nThe class trials are definitely the best Part of the game and you can be hyped about each of them.\nBefore each class trial you have to do some Investigation about the Murder and during that time you can\ntheorize who it was and how they've done it.\n\nCharacters:\nThe characters in this Game are as different as they can be. I bet you'll have different favourite ones.\nAll I can say is that you'll learn to love each and everyone on their own way.\n\nBuy Recommendation:\nDo I recommend everybody to buy this Game? No. If you are getting bored because you mostly \nonly play Shooters and MOBA's, I dont think you will enjoy this Game even if I did. But to everybody else\nwho enjoys mystery games like Ace Attorney or even mystery/detective shows I highly recommend buying this game\nand try it out. You'll enjoy it!\n\nAs I said try to avoid any spoilers. So dont look in the Steam Workshops etc.\nThank you for reading!\n- EDIT: I nominated this game for game of the year (2023)\n\nLong ago I had heard about this game and how detailed and intricate it could be, and how you could spend hours upon hours building the massive empire of dwarves only for it to all come crashing down in some spectacular but unforeseen way.  Then I got into Rimworld briefly and thought it was ok, but it tended toward chaos a bit too much for my liking.  THEN I heard this game was coming to steam and I eagerly awaited it.\n\nIt's not necessarily that I was too good to play a game with mostly ascii/character graphics (I used to play them a lot back in the 1980s).  I was more intimidated by the depth of the game and not knowing if there was a wiki for it (there is) or how I'd find help if I needed it (I'm sure there's a ton of communities JUST for this game).  I expected that when it came to Steam, it'd be beefed up and worth the wait.\n\nWell it finally arrived and I think I'm STILL a bit intimidated by the sheer amount of options you have... mostly because it's not just me that I have to worry about, but a whole community of dwarves.  In the case of something like minecraft, I could dig a whole intricate tunnel and if stuff starts to go bad, I just high-tail it out of there and recover until I can go back and finish it.  In Dwarf Fortress though, if stuff starts to go bad, you can't just leave.  You are encouraged to deal with the adversity and push onward in the name of greatness... or something.\n\nIn a way it's like role playing, except you don't have to roll character sheets and you don't really control any of the characters directly.  You make decisions about where to mine, what trees to chop down, what to build, what to trade, what to plant, and for every thing there is a season (turn turn turn).  You're forced to deal with death, birth, attacks, sickness, madness, and a ton of other things that I have no idea are coming.  \n\nI keep thinking \"I could do better\" and I start a new game, but then I start to realize that no matter what I do, I'm never gonna have a perfect game, or a game where everything goes exactly according to plan.  I am eventually going to have to buckle down and stick to one game save to see it through.\n\nIf you're like me and starting something new holds a lot more interest than continuing an existing project (ADHD?) you may have difficulty with this game.  At the same time you may become so engrossed in it that you lose track of time and suddenly it's 6am and you wonder why you stayed up all night digging holes.  I'm starting to feel a bit of the madness myself.  (it's almost 4:30am as I write this)\n\nIn any case, it's probably not for everyone, but I'd say if you're unsure, find the non-steam version and try that, and if you can grok what's going on and it interests you, definitely buy this and support the developers... OR buy this and try to stay under the 2 hour refund  limit while you learn the basics (Good luck with that, it'll be 6 hours before you know what happened).  I believe this game is worth the money though (full price).  If you were going to wait for a sale you'd be waiting a long time anyway.  \n\nTL;DR If this looks interesting to you, don't wait! Buy now.  If you aren't sure, do a bit of research and come back and buy it.\n- The classic just keeps getting better year after year.\n\nFor those new to the series, this is strictly a management sim.  No action aside from the outstanding baseball extravaganza your imagination cooks up from the play-by-play (if you so choose). (EDIT! There IS action now!  There is a 3D mode to put a little bit of animation to your imagination)  Guide your team over decades as a GM, manage your team pitch-by-pitch, or do both.  It's entirely up to you. \n\nIf you're like me and in every baseball game you've ever played you've found yourself saying \"but wouldn't it be great if it had (X) in it?\"  Well this is your dream game.  Whatever your X was, every time, since Triple Play Baseball on NES, this game has it.  And more.  It has literally everything in it that baseball has in it.  It is an outstanding work and is infinitely enjoyable for a baseball fan.  The only negative I can think of is that I imagine the learning curve is fairly steep (although I've been playing the series for 11 years now so I forget how it was to pick up).  \n\nA must have for any baseball fan.  10/10 (year, after year, after year)\n- Upon further play, the game wasn't super luck based, it just doesn't do a great job explaining core mechanics that are crucial to gameplay. It has a more hands off, let the player discover how this works type of playstyle, but a simple line of dialogue alluding to these features would have been nice. That said, the story is really gripping, the gameplay (once learned) is fun, and overall, I definitely think it's worth $20.\n- The fact that this VN used to be the highest rated game that hasn't been released outside Japan until, well, it was released outside Japan says it all. A must-buy position for every VN enthusiast and an insteresting position for any other player. Criminally underplayed (~55% of purchased copies haven't been started yet), true hidden gem. Consider buying it when on sale.\n- Do you like baseball?\n\nI didn't. I really didn't. I liked a lot of different sports but I always thought baseball was boring, archaic and more an excuse to sit outside, drink beer and gawk at the occasional on-field event.\n\nBut then, for whatever reason -- I didn't have much else going on -- I started to watch baseball, because it was always on, pretty much every day, and it started to wrap itself around my brain in a pleasing way. Baseball is low-intensity matched with extreme peaks and valleys of emotion. \n\nMore importantly -- Baseball is a long continuous set of calculations based on the manipulation of variables in series after series of problems. Every at-bat, every pitch, every inning, every game is a test of odds and outcomes based on the pitcher, the batter, the fielders, the field, the weather, past results obscuring present values... Baseball is a worthwhile flux.\n\nSo - OOTP 17. This is the most advanced and ridiculously satisfying way to run your own personal baseball simulations. So maybe I should rephrase - Do you like Baseball as a concept? Because you will love OOTP.\n\n(Also this year they added little moving pawns to the broadcast view, so it's starting to get satisfyingly similar to half-watching an actual baseball game.)\n\nFor those already owning OOTP 16 and mulling an upgrade I would say - the engine runs much faster this year on x64, some under the hood stuff has been nicely tweaked, bells and whistles (the pawns) aren't nothing, and of course, I feel pretty good about supporting this developer, given their track record.\n- You probably have to be a dedicated wargamer to remember Fields of Glory, a turn-based strategy series that covered almost every era of ancient warfare. The historical scope was deep and wide, but the rules and features were shallow and anorexic... just saying. The game needed an overhaul. The graphics needed a facelift, and the gameplay and ruleset needed growth hormones. This game addresses those issues definitively.\n\nIt was a matter of bringing the game over to the Battle Academy engine, Which in my opinion is one of the most robust tbs platforms out there. It handles WW2 games, fantasy games like Hell, Sci-Fi with Sanctus Reach, and historical wargames Pike and Shot and Sengoku Jidai. I'm assuming that, like the old FoG, this game will eventually have a slew of historical skins DLC. Everything will be overpriced and never go on sale, but if you're a fan of any of the games above like me, you'll bite the hook... like me.\n\nThe mechanics and rules of the game work almost the exact same way as Pike and Shot and Sengoku Jidai, not the old FoG. It's lazy but it works. If you've played either, you won't need the tutorial. You'd also recognize the soft pastel, almost cartoony maps. The game looks much better than previous games. The rigid, boxey blob models are gone, replaced by units that shuffle nervously, taunt their foes, and continue swinging at each other in between turns. It's a Slitherine tbs that actually feels alive and breathing.    \n\nIt's a straight up, left-click only tbs. You'll have a command unit with a command range, units outside of which will suffer a penalty. Units have zones of control. Once engaged in melee, units won't disengage, but will continue fighting each turn until one breaks. Victorious units may compulsively pursue routed foes, even disappearing off the map, never to be seen again...Units gain advantages and suffer penalties based on terrain and morale. Units get buffs for adjacent allies, and penalties if those allies are routed. There are bonuses for flanking, charging, and fighting on the high ground. There is no experience gain, no upgrades or leveling, and no rpg elements.\n\nAll the elements you'd expect from a good tbs are here, implemented in an approachable, almost casual way that you can enjoy without having to put down your drink or jazz cigarette. Turn based tacticians should approve. 8/10\n- \nWell, after almost a year of not playing this game, I must say, the devs did fix most of my issues. *Most*. Creative mode is fun, but you still need to collect stuff to make things, which is incredibly tedious. On top of that, the character dialogue is still really annoying and you need a NASA computer to play at a stable framerate, but hey, you can actually play without getting your ass beat. I'd like to up my ranking to an 8/10. Very fun, but I highly recommend playing with others. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOG REVIEW (outdated):\nThis game has potential, but unfortunately having fun with it is impossible if you aren't a hardcore survivalist.\n\nCritical Issue #1:\nThe main characters won't stop talking. Everytime you eat or hold the torch they say an unfunny one-liner that makes me want to gouge my eyes out with forks. Even Robin Ayou from Subnautica: Below Zero talked less, and the original game had a silent protaganist. Having characters that have constant dialogue that always repeats is just so annoying to the point where I had to turn off the volume. If the main characters were silent but atleast talked with each other, then I could see potential in that. But they just talk and talk and talk and none of it means anything.\n\nCritical Issue #2:\nThe enemies are way too hard to battle. To make better gear, you need to take on enemies that are so difficult to battle. Maybe you could say I'm just not good at battling enemies in survival games, but I was able to easily battle monsters in Terraria, Minecraft, Subnautica and Raft just fine. When your in-game monsters are too hard to defeat without gear that requires you to battle even MORE monsters, it is not fun, repetitive, and frustrating.\n\nCritical Issue #3:\nThe story is in the background. The fact that the story doesn't impact the game as much as it should is probably the worst aspect of any piece of media out there. The game sends you an a goose chase to find the  main story and it is infuriating. The story itself is all over the place. First it just seems like you need to make yourself grow bigger, but then it goes completely off the rails and into this scientist bunker with a robot that gives you quests, but you can ignore him and continue playing. I don't know if they finished the story, but so far it is not good.\n\nSomewhat Critical Issue:\nThere is no setting to dial back the graphics without lowering the resolution to look like Terraria. I can't see, and it is dumb and brings the whole beautiful vibe of being small down, ironically.\n\nMinor Issues:\nThe music is bland, and although I love electronic/synth music, this is just not it. The fact that you can't have bugs as pets or mounts, or even herd them is extremely upsetting. The farming sucks ass, it gives you 4 items of what you grew every 2 in-game days, when you can just find that item in more abundance at the place where it is located. Under the pond... JESUS CHRIST, the graphics are so bad. The wavy filter looks so bad, and you can see the entire underwater area crystal f**king clear, even though other smaller bodies of water have some kind of murkiness to it. Minor issues like this hold back the game.\n\nAlthough this is still in early access, it feels as if they wasted a lot of potential already. For such a unique world and concept, it never really exploits the amazing and obvious things that it can accomplish. Why not grow your own personal army of ants? Oh sorry, you can pick up eggs but they hatch and they aren't friendly. Why not create a raft made of weed stems and lilypads? Oh sorry, you can just build a base that looks like a boat. Although there are much worse steam games out there, and ones that I have hated more than this, this was sort of a slap to the face. It's not god-awful, and there are a lot of good things about it like the cartoony bug designs and the beautiful graphics, but honestly, it's a 6/10 bordering on a 7, and although many others have enjoyed this, being the super critical demogorgon that I am, this didn't exactly \"ground\" me.\n- I cannot help myself but to notice that this game has a failed Kickstarter campaign behind - which is why I was especially surprised and happy at the same time to find out it has been released no matter the odds. \n\nTo keep it short and simple: \"Think outside of the box\" is this game's motto. And it actually gives you an ability to rotate this box. \nCreator put a lot of effort in it. To say that this game is \"short\" is something I cannot do. While it is somewhere around 5 hours long - all those hours are filled to the brim with creativity, surprises, charming voice-over; it does not get repetitive and neither it gets overcomplicated. It is a great mix of involvement through thinking and relaxation. \n\nDefinitely worth it's money.\n- As much as I was hyped for a different twist on farming sims, this just falls flat. The whole generation system [i]sounds[/i] good on paper but is just unused. You would almost be more hard pressed to actually age enough to need a second generation than not. Sure you can just opt in to moving along, but I just feel wrong killing off my character like that. As such the whole selling point is just, not a part of the game unless you really seek it out. \n\nSo this just leaves the normal farming sim aspects. Which uh... dont work too well either in my opinion. This game is focused less on skill, leveling, or tool quality despite having far more rpg aspects than most other games of this type. You have entire stat systems behind each charecter, buffs, multiple tool levels and materials. Yet none of it is used. What is used is weird cryptic proverbs that dictate item quality. \n\nWhat I mean is, did you catch that fish normally? Just walking along the river and thought to cast your line? Shame. Dont you know trout can only be caught well on the fourth day of the spring during rain while accompanied by a pet and under the influence of a charm buff? Im not exaggerating too much here either. Crops, fish, fruits, plants, and ore all have up to [b]four[/b] requirements. One per star. Some can be easy, like be skilled in said action, fishing/harvesting etc. But most will be odd things like harvest on the sixth day. Only fish during these hours. Be under a certain buff. Have a certain animal following you. Its all just... odd. \n\nWhats worse is its punishing. You want to just, idk, play the game your way? You want to enjoy this sandbox game at your leisure? Well I hope you are ready to be punished for it. You have to either memorise each and every requirement for hundreds of items. Or, just have a wiki page open at all times. Which just takes away the fun. Cant go fishing today, its not foggy. Cant harvest your grown crops right now, its not druida day. This game has you jumping through hoops, playing on [i]its[/i] time rather than your own. Its a relaxing farming sim, but played like an accountant looking at spreadsheets. \n\nIn essence, if you enjoy micromanaging each moment of your day down to the minute detail, go for it. You will love this game. But if you are looking for a laid back, head empty sim game, look anywhere else. This game will open palm slap you for wanting to play it laid back and to your own beat. I just feel this [u]FARMING SIM[/u] is not at all tailored for the crowd of people who play farming sims.\n- I hated this game.\n\nHowever, it is undeniably brilliant. To try and explain how it is brilliant would cheapen the experience. I would put this game in the same category as The Stanley Parable, The Beginner's Guide, Dear Esther, and everything Freebird Games ever created. These are games that should be experienced by everyone.\n\nI was gifted this by my wonderful husband. I'm sure he meant well because he knows I like horror games. I'm going to choose to believe that anyway. What followed was five hours of paranoia, frustration, and more of a feeling that the game was playing me.\n\nThanks honey.\n- Really grimy visceral horror game, Puppet Combo always scares me even as a life long genre fan. SOOTH is very challenging, but also very rewarding. Love the retro aesthetic and uncompromising brutal demeanor of it all, massive respect to the developer. This gameplay style isn't my favorite, took me a few attempts to get through Nun Massacre, I prefer The Glass Staircase/Murderhouse ect. But SOOTH is well executed enough that I was able to get into it. I did encounter some pretty gamebreaking bugs but reloading saves/brute force I was able to get past them. A lot of jank in this game could definitely use some more polish. Jumping into the vent on the lower bunker level was insanely annoying. It's not perfect but honestly I wouldn't want it to be that's part of the charm. Just the amount of mental/emotional strain the player goes through during a Puppet Combo game is hilarious I love it lol. The puzzles are also a huge improvement over previous titles. The ending I got was extremely macabre this game doesn't mess around. Overall I'm glad I waited for the full release and plan on trying some more endings. Horror fans if you don't know these guys yet this is a good one to start with. 8.5/10\n- You will enjoy the game at the beginning, it's fun and entertaining...Until you start playing the harder and larger hospitals and you get plagued with bad pathing issues, bad AI, people getting stuck in rooms, people dieing but they idle in a death state and stay around forever and all kinds of glitches which kills the enjoyment and ruins the management aspects. I've had to stop playing this game until they patch it because right now you're just managing bugs and glitches and you will have to design hospitals to get around these bugs, so that means extra wide corridors and spacing items out so people don't get stuck. Which sucks.\n\nNeeded much more playtesting before being released.\n\n*This is from v1.01.*\n- Ignore all the copers who think because they beat Celeste they're a platforming master. This game is a rage precision platformer, it's supposed to be hard, but the best part is that it doesn't even have to be. That's why there is AN OPTION TO SET THE DIFFICULTY IN THE SETTINGS, and if you somehow are too proud to just tone it down a bit to get a better experience and instead decide to blame the game and its developer, then why are you even playing video games in the first place. They're supposed to be fun. This game can be a rage platformer, but it can also be a casual one. It depends on what you want.Will you snail has a great soundtrack, great level design, and super interesting story and lore. Is the game too hard? Change the difficulty. Do you not care about the story? Ignore the optional dialogue. It's that easy. This game is really really good, and don't let anyone convince you otherwise, especially people who can't deal with the fact that the rage game is hard\n- The British Forces give the Allies a bit of the German defensive capacities. It has the problem of adding too many buildings to a game that is, in its core, dynamic and based on movement and aggressiveness instead of turtling. The British units are diverse and interesting, bringing much to the table. \n\nThe DLC lacks a proper campaign for the Brits, unfortunately, even though Caen, Goodwood, Arnhem and Walcheren could have been done in some interesting missions. But, for a game focused on multiplayer, the Tommies are obligatory in everybody's library.\n- I backed this game back at the end of September 2013 and have finally played it through to completion. \n\nCandle is a beautifully unique game which takes elements from puzzle, platforming and point and click adventures. The puzzles, although sometimes frustratingly difficult, are all different and use different mechanics keeping the game engaging and fresh. Teku's Candle is such a interesting game mechanic that I really enjoyed getting to know and learn. As previously said, the game looks and sounds absolutely stunning. I don't think I have seen a game that looks this good before and that is attritubuted to every character and scene being hand drawn. Controls can be a bit finicky but not game breaking and you can easily adjust too. I would recommend getting this game because it provides a great whole experience.\n- I would describe this game as a 'befriending sim' with a very shallow veneer of farming/resource gathering/'witchy' activities. The farming/mining/fishing is nowhere near as fun or sophisticated as other games e.g. Stardew Valley. And there are no customisation options - even very shallow ones - to make the game experience your own, e.g. the layout of your farm and buildings can't be changed or decorated, there's no home decoration, no character customisation or clothing options. So the game feels very linear and daily tasks are repetitive and grind-y. There's also a dearth of special/seasonal occasions which adds to the repetition.\n\nAnd even though this game majors on the social/befriending angle, which is largely ok, it still doesn't feel quite right. You can get to be 'good friends' with a character and they still repeat dialogue asking if you've met their family members (of course you have) and/or your character asks them really basic getting-to-know-you type questions that previous cutscenes have already answered. The voice acting is great though.\n\nI think this game would have been a lot better had it been done as an all-out graphic novel/choices matter game, and dropped the farming etc. As it is, it's a jack of all trades and master of none.\n- Buy if you want an average sandbox game. Don't buy for the mediocre story, boss battles or repetitive missions.\n\n\nMGO: I want to like it, but it has so many problems.\n\n-until recently had no push-to-talk\n-peer-to-peer connections meaning lag depending on the host, and being sent back to lobby if the host leaves. CQC also will lag where you will grapple back and forth.\n-no text chat\netc.\n- This is a poor excuse for a Korean mobile port in a long line of them with the lack of sound, spelling errors, bad translations, ugly UI, log-in issues and so much more and it has P2E crypto/NFT garbage and P2W.\n\nNot even the small number of upskirts and jiggly boobs can save this one.\n- To be completely honest, throughout my entire playthrough, I was thinking on giving this game a \"Not Recommended\" but it really wouldn't have deserved it. This game is at the same time both very difficult to recommend as to not recommend. It is really a beatiful and extremely original game, with a pretty well told interesting story. However, the problem it has is that it doesn't really work as a puzzle game. Puzzle solutions don't make logical sense most of the time and you end up brute forcing your way through most of the game. This means trying every posibility until something works and moves the story foward, and this is just not good puzzle design. This also distracts you from the story being told, which is in itself not so easy to understand, it requirers you to be paying attention to details, so your brain has to be constantly switching between \"puzzle mode\" and \"story mode\". Anyway, you can tell a lot of love was put into this game, and that is why I ultimately recommend it.\n7.5/10-\n- Is Duskers a fun game? Yes. Would I recommend it? No, because of one simple reason:\n\nA lack of content with no mod support.\n\nDuskers is a little like No Man's Sky in the sense that the first few hours are filled with fun and wonder, but everything afterwards becomes a disappointment because the game turns out to be far more shallow than it initially seemed. As a player, I yearned to explore more of the randomly generated galaxy in Duskers because I wanted to see what other horrors, mods, and derelict types I would encounter in the empty universe - but in the end, it turned out that there was really very little else to see besides what you find in the first couple of hours. \n\nHere's a quick rundown of where the content was most lacking:\n\n--Enemy types: there's only 4 different enemies. FOUR. They also behave pretty much identically with the exception of the last one.  This was definitely the biggest interest-killer for me. \n\n--Derelict types end up mattering very little. Government A? Salvage C? Military B? It really doesn't change the layout in a particularly noticeable fashion, with the only differences being 1-2 extra ship defense turrets or something like that. \n\nI really, really wanted to give Duskers a thumbs up - I loved the aesthetic, I loved the atmosphere, and I loved the unique command line interface - but unfortunately, after a few hours, I came to realize that there's really just not enough actual content here, and that's heartbreaking for fans of this niche genre like myself.\n\n\n- Honestly I don't think I've ever cried so much over one game.  This is definitely one of the best narrative driven RPG maker games ever made - it has everything you could want.  It has beautiful art, beautiful music, wonderful narration, it's atmospheric, great characters, meaningful choices, a story of overcoming hardships similar to a real life instead of just a story, and the ending I got was beautiful! I have only played the game once but the game has a lot of different branching paths with choices really making a large difference in the game.  This game will always have a special place in my heart.\n- [H1] GUIDE TO THE PURCHASE OPTIONS [/H1]\nso heres how you can tell the difference between what your buying, because you don't wanna be like me, who often bought packs that did the same thing. \n\nHitman 3 standard edition - Just Hitman 3, so no Hitman 2 or 1. You get access to the newly added levels, as well as elusive targets and most of the escalations. This does not give you access to the 7 deadly sins levels.\n\nHitman 3 Deluxe edition - a bit scammy, not quite worth the money, but it comes with some music, 3 new skins and a couple of extra escalations. This won't give you any new levels. This does not give you access to the 7 deadly sins levels.\n\nHitman trilogy - Comes with nearly everything. If you want to buy hitman and access most of the levels, this is the one to go for. I believe the only things you do not get access to are the sniper edition levels, the patient zero campaign, the deluxe stuff, the 7 deadly sins levels and any extra skins. This is like the core of the game without any extra things.\n\nHitman trilogy premium add-ons - literally just hitman trilogy except it includes the features that aren't in hitman trilogy. You have to own the original Hitman trilogy in order to buy this one. The only thing it doesn't include is the 7 deadly sins. If you are stupid and can't comprehend what I just said; it doesn't include the base levels. Only the extra stuff\n\nHitman - 7 deadly sins pack - the new 7 deadly sins pack. It includes the 7 new levels that are a bit simular to escalations. Basically, there are still 3 stages in each sin, (they are sorted as targets, so every time you eliminate a target, its like a checkpoint. So you can really count it as just 1 stage with 3 targets.)  Its basically escalations but with a lot of effort put into them.\n\nHitman 3 access passes - these are basically dlc's that were put in hitman 2 and 1. If you already own these, you should automatically gain access to them during the carryover. There is one called 'hitman 3 access pass: hitman 2 gold', this basically means 'if you are new to the hitman trilogy, you can have access to the dlc in hitman 2 here'. \n\n\nhere are what the access passes do:\n\nHitman 2 gold edition - it gives you access to all hitman 2 levels, which is why its so expensive. It comes with all levels, including the sniper editions, the expansion pack (2 places, Maldives and New York) as well as some extra skins. Its pretty big if you ask me\n\nHitman 2 standard - gives you access to standard hitman 2 locations. This is basically the gold edition but without sniper edition, the expansion pack or extra skins. It gives you access to the base levels. Which is miami, columbia, mumbai, whittleton creek and the isle of sgail\n\nHitman 1 GOTY edition - gives you access to every level from hitman 1 but without campaigns\n\nHitman 1 GOTY upgrade - gives access to the hitman 1 campaigns, does not include the base levels.\n\n\nMost of these packs are worth the money. But most of them are on sale quite often. So if you think some of them aren't worth the money, you can always wait a month or two and get a massive sale on it.\n\nthank me later\n\n- The demo was a lot of fun and the early access launch game which is more of that  was a lot of fun big surprise!\n\nOverall I would really recommend this game if you loved or enjoyed games like Warstride Challenges, Neon White, Speedrunners From Hell and other games with a focus on very short concise levels that are made for speedrunning. I will say while it looks off in the trailers the gun controls pretty nicely in the game no complaints there for me with this style of game. \n\n\nWhat I liked\n\n-controls feel great and very fast, you always feel in control and everything including enemies are very visible and have extra outline to help highlight them when in hectic combat\n\n- most levels are just the right length to not feel like you complete them before you even start them but not tedious to retry to get a better ranking\n\n-much improved optimization and performance wise from the demo, even on my laptop not really made for gaming got a easy 100 fps if I put all settings on low\n\n-Ranking system is pretty cool, you get extra points if you kill enemies, head shot them for critical damage, if you never get hit etc and more and of course ranked on time. There is a separate ranking for total points so say for killing a lot of enemies and in a row and then a separate ranking just for times for levels\n\n- Enemy A.I seems improved form the demo and they try to roll out of the way of gunfire or go behind kinda cover from the environments at times.This isn't a big thing since your flying through levels super fast anyway but nice to see\n\n-Decent number of standard guns and they are fun to use without trivializing using telekinesis and vice versa\n\n-Some stages focus on a large arena to fight waves of enemies and others don't so feels like game has decent level variety/variety in obstacles in levels\n\n-okay variety of enemies to fight so far\n\n-kinda humorous the odd time and there are stupid items to pick up with telekinesis and use like a live rat, a toy hammer, giant tennis ball etc.\n\n- telekinesis feels very seamless fast and fun/easy to use in combat, chucking random objects at enemies its a lot of fun\n\n- most levels are open enough to allow multiple paths to get through levels and you can usually skip fighting some enemies if you want to only go for a faster time in most levels \n\n\n\nSome Suggestions/Issues I had\n\n-maybe I missed it but no instant retry button if I want to retry a level instantly but haven't died\n\n-boss difficulty kinda feels a bit all over the place although there is not much boss fights, first boss feels way too easy, second one was fun and maybe just right although maybe on the side of   too easy from not having enough health \n\n-the second last level in this launch early access version \"\"\"\"\"stealth\"\"\"\"\"\" feels far too long and far too hard and full of way too much elite enemies and then it even has a boss fight to do in it too in the level all in one go without ever stop moving! \n\n-just a note when I played the demo version before the last boss fight in that felt like it should have either been a level with just the enemies and then a second separate level with a arena for the  boss fight not both that you have to do in the one attempt in a bigger level just kinda tedious imo\n\n-music isn't bad here but it feels like there is very little music and the music that is there kinda blends together a lot\n\n-hopefully this game can develop a big following community and maybe get a level editor down the line!\n\n-feels like you go in the 2 second slow motion mode when getting a critical hit on a  enemy or breaking glass a good bit too much in levels.\n\n- would be nice down the line to get bonus challenge levels, shorter much more difficult ones like how NeonWhite and War stride Challenges have bonus levels \n\n- for replay value might be nice to have 3 unique goals for a level e.g beat the level in under 40 seconds, only kill a certain number of enemies, kill no enemies etc.This is kinda in the game but levels don't seem to have specific or unique extra goals its the same ones for every level.\n\n- not a complaint but maybe later add a grapple hook, grapple hooks are always fun in first person shooters!\n- I knew Journey is a great game,maybe one of the best video games in history,but...\n\nI didn't know why so many people moved by such a simple gameplay.\nI didn't know why people had a Journey-Fever,even players just bought PS3 only for this game.\nI didn't know how close a relationship could be in 100mins only.\nI didn't know how bad i wished to go back to the peak and stay with my friend i'll never meet again.\n\nNow I Know.\n\n“It is better to walk with a friend in the dark than alone in the light” – Helen Keller\n\nIt was an interesting experience for me, I had never played this game nor heard of it until recently. I went and looked at the store page, My Brother/Friend Ethan-Winters Just Told Me this game in the steam store now, so went ahead and bought it. After buying it, went and started up the game some day later. Went into the game, saw another model character that looks like mine, I thought it was an AI because I had thought it was a single player game. So I decided to play along with it, we went through the story, it progressed quite fast, mainly because we both did not really bother to check out other things. The more I played, the more I realized that the guy I was playing with was most definitely not an AI, it was a genuine player. As we went through the story, our cooperation got smoother, we no longer have a solo player attitude, we would signal to each other, wait for each other and walked, fly with each other. It was smoothing, relaxing, a truly unique experience. Even with the setbacks we had throughout our progression, we never gave up, we stuck together from the desert till the end, when one of us screwed up, we patiently waited for the other, chiming to the person where we are. I remember at the end, when i screwed up a jump and did not see the other player, I was genuinely scared, sad, I frantically searched for the person but to no avail. I was distraught, sad and disappointed but I continued onward. When I went up, there he was, chiming for me, assuring me that he had not left yet. I felt happy, comforted when I saw the person waiting for me and together we finished the story. I am not one to do reviews, but it was such a unique experience among my years of gaming that I had to share it. Thank you, punks for the experience, truly thank you. And thank you, for bothering to read my review.\n\ni'll never forget our journey kind stranger.\n\nThis wasn't a game, it was an experience. I highly recommend you do this.\n- [i]While the artwork and combat remain enjoyable, the story, writing, and pacing were a major letdown.[/i]  \n\n***\nMINOR SPOILERS BELOW. If you're going to play the game, play before reading.\n***\n\n[b]The mature storylines, hard-hitting decisions, beautiful worldbuilding, and tight writing that made the first two so immersive is not present in this game.[/b] (You'll notice immediately that the writing for the caravan in the capital is [i]particular[/i] trite, awkward to read, and uninteresting.)\n\nUnfortunately, it's not just the writing that's weak. [i]The pacing is off.[/i] Antecedents are confusing, characters you'd expect to speak don't, events that should have been foreshadowed come out of nowhere. More frustrating are the serious character continuity \"errors,\" and arcs that disappear, change, or go nowhere. [i]In short, the events, decisions, and conflict from the previous games do not appear or resolve in a way that was suggested by the previous two[/i].\n\n\nHere's one example. In Banner Saga 2, Fosolt is unexpectedly rescued by Bolverk. [i]\"I have a message for Alette from the dead varl king,\" [/i]he said. That's pretty intriuging! Maybe there's a mystery, an oracle, an item, or just cool information about the Varl and their strange king? Maybe there'll finally be context about the bridge decision!\n\n[i]No! He has nothing interesting to say or add, and then his storyline just gets dropped and forgotten.[/i]\n\nWell, Bolverk's been possessed by Bellower! Gosh, who knows what Bellower will say? In fact, I can't wait to find out what happens to Bellower's body! \n\nWell, actually, Bolver's [i]not[/i] possessed, not really, certainly not like it was implied last game, and Bellower's body -- [i]a primary focus of the first two games[/i] -- isn't mentioned [i]once[/i]\n\nOr how about how they casually mention that Eyvyn is not only the [i]head[/i] of the Valka order, but also that he's had periodic bursts of hereditary madness all along? That's... odd. And it's not presented as an well-thought out [i]reveal[/i] or anything. It's presented matter-of-factly, like they were trying to ret-con in a less interesting story, or were tone deaf.\n\nYou'll notice that all the characters are underutilized and have unfulfilled storylines/tensions. Hakon has hard choices to make; Canary's a little crazy; Yrsa is mysterious; Gil's in love with Alette, etc. Will these build into choices? Reveals? Dependent endings based on choices? Will there be discussions referencing the past? Reflections on travels? Hints of despair?\n\nNo. In mine, Gil was [i]murdered[/i] and no one even bothered to reference it. Canary's situation never comes to a head. You never have to choose between Varls and Humans. Murdering people doesn't make people threaten to leave. Ubin returns randomly as an uber Varl and he's... learned the horseborne's language? Travelled the southlands? In like, a month? In a way that doesn't advance the plot? It's just... weakly done.\n\n\nThere are [i]so many[/i] examples like this, where the stories don't quite fit correctly, where what you picked up on in the early games about the [i]mysteries[/i] and the [i]world[/i] and what made it a [i]vibrant[/i] place were forgotten about by the writers. [b]The result is that it the game plays out in unsatisfying ways, in tenseless scenarios made vapid by watered-down morality, an inability to leverage the situation in fun ways, and low-quality writing, paucity of choice-making, a lack of exploration, lack of plot twists, simplified overworld mechanics -- all culminating in an almost staggeringly one-dimensional and shallow ending.[/b]\n\nThe Banner Saga series was always an experience that was greater than the sum of its part. An [i]experience[/i]. Of being [i]riveted[/i] to the computer, checking the map, worrying over supplies, guessing at mysteries, having my breath taken away at each hill. Unfortunately, that's not the case in this game. \n\n\nGameplay-wise, it's also a bit of a letdown. Combat is fun-ish, but you can make invincible character combinations and the mechanics don't even try to deal with this. There's an interesting new reinforcement mechanic that's not used heavily, and never pushes you like you think the end of the world would. You never really have to split up your forces. There's no novelty. Like maybe using a hero in a battle makes them fatigued, so you have to switch them up? Maybe you can station them different places, making them unusable for combat? Maybe you need to choose eight for a secret mission caravan? Maybe dream sequences? No, nothing like that. \n\nThe overworld gameplay had some changes that never really felt significant. Moreover, quite a bit felt taken away. You can't rest, do training missions, no longer weigh food vs upgrades. One example of all thise tone deafness was Iver's march through the destroyed world was consistently at \"Great Morale!\"\n\nThere didn't seem to be many flavor choices (\"Do we hang the criminals or let them join us?\"), including much less on social themes (\"Should women fight, if it disturbs the traditionally-minded men?\" \"One clan's rowdy, what do we do?\" \"They threaten to leave if so and so isn't banished\"), and less delayed results and fewer significant decisions, including among the game's built-up tensions among the factions. \n\n\nThere's also some cases of development [i]feeling[/i] cheap. Remember opening Banner Saga 2, and feeling that it was [i]fresh[/i], and [i]upgraded[/i]? There's little to make you feel that way here. The artwork is okay, but the environments feel more generic, with less variety, and the surreal landscapes in the darkness aren't especially interesting to look at for long periods of time. Iver is voiced by Bolverk's voice actor, and they sound exactly the same. The new title system is a fun idea, but is visually integrated into the game's menu system with the finesse of a cheap mod. \n\nThere's a moment in the game where the screen goes black for scrolling text and voiceover narration explaining the upcoming mechanic. Um, a character can't explain that? It was similar how the many two second animations are used, not to supplement the story, but to [i]replace[/i] written portions, making you feel unsure about what's going on. And finally, the game's pretty short, without fun combat challenges or interesting newgame+ challenges. \n\n\nWhat's [i]particularly[/i] frustrating is that the game's release date was moved forward four months. I don't know the story why, but I do know that a few more months of polish and story embellishment might have delivered the beautiful, grippingly interactive story we were hoping for. Because this is a watered down version of the previous two in just about every way.\n\nThis negative review is for whatever processes lead to this mediocre finale.\n\n---\n\n[i]Here's a plot that would have made more sense. Zephyr arrives and speaks to you secretly. There's a god that's still alive! Neat, now we'll finally get more story on that. Yay, fun caravan mode, now we need to take longships somewhere interesting!\n\nBut uh-oh! There's a Sundr villain going there as well, with an army of dredge! But at least now we'll finally get more story about the Sundr! \n\nThe god reveals something interesting, talks about Juno, the sun, gives a means to protect the city and help Iver. But when you return to the city, now the king and rugga and the factions have devolved into fighting based on your choices. How are you going to handle this? Which of many possibilities will ascend to the throne? How will you defend the city? And what mystery lies beneath the mountain of the city...\n\nFor Iver's caravan, there should be pockets of dredge villages kept alive by Spellsingers. Now you need to decide to plunder them or not! More stuff to do! Maybe go to the remains of the Varl capital first? Fight warped Valka? Realize deceptions, machinations, corruption, hear stories? Find new characters, have old ones die?\n\nInstead there... wasn't a plot?[/i]\n- Great gameplay with baaad user experience. There are no tooltips or explanations as to what is going on at all, just kinda gotta figure it out. Otherwise the gameplay is smooth and there's a climb mode called spiral, slay the spire style, very fun. 5 different classes all able to level their decks and get new cards and abilities until lvl 30 I think, got my enchantress to 20 but still more to go. Story mode is more of a tutorial but still interesting.\n- Really need a report button to slap some senses into trolls in online matches.\nCan't even escape them at ranked. sigh\nGreat game nonetheless, 4/5\n- Volition ups the silly, and adds super powers, but loses a little something along the way.\n\nI loved Saint's Row: the Third, and by all rights should have loved IV as well, but I mostly just liked it. The set up was fun, and seemed to up the ante again, but then you get the presidency ripped away from you almost immediately (without even seeing the consequences of your first pushed legislation!). Placing the game in a virtual city for the most part with the only real characters being on your space ship, really kinda seemed to gut the game. Even when [spoiler]the world gets destroyed[/spoiler], a detached, \"meh\" was all I could muster. The humor is there, but it's mostly better in the DLC. The radio stations feel kind of underwhelming without DJs.\n\nFinally all the fun of collecting and customizing various interesting cars, and finding ways to climb or fall to interesting places with a stolen plane/parachute are gutted with the inclusion of super powers. Also, the super powers make gunplay, leveling any of your other stuff, and pretty much every mechanic carried over from Saints Row: the Third obsolete.\n\nIf you get this game, do yourself a favor and make sure you get all the DLC where most of the real fun is. Is it as good as the previous Saints Row? I don't think so, but I still recommend getting it and playing through it. It is a lot of fun, and I love the 50's break out scenario at the beginning.\n\nStacey's thoughts:\nStill awaiting DLC with Jane Austin and the D*ldo Bat. Can somebody make this, for, uhh, scientific purposes.\n- After playing the game for almost 10 hours which i know is not a lot but still i had a great time the story kept me hooked from start to finish and i was always excited to find out what was going to happen next. I loved the idea that you could choose to play as a ghost and never get detected or never kill anyone or just go for the high chaos im going to kill everyone playstyle and even know the ability to choose your playstyle is quite oftenly seen these days but back in 2012 it was quite inovative.\n\nGameplay:\nIt had great combat and stealth.(Not Suprising based on thre fact that your an assasin)\nStory was well how to put this \"A rollercoaster of emotion\" it keeps you hooked from start to finish and you will never want to stop playing until you finaly get to the end.\n\nReplay Value:\nNow this is a big one in my opinion because i like games that make you play for hours and hours and I would say that Dishonored has great replay value this is mainly due to the fact that there are a lot of different acheivements, ways to complete each mission, different magic paths and weapon paths that can only be be completed if you play the game again and if your not comftable with fully restarting you dont have to because once you finish the main storyline you unlock the option to play them over which is useful if you want to unlock some of the other acheivements for example Clean Hands to get this acheivement your not allowed to kill anyone in the whole story how you do this i have no idea but thats the reason this game has good replay value.\n\nDLC:\nEven though i do not own the DLC (i will be purchasing them soon) from my knowledge of the normal game and how great that was it would suprise me if the DLC was bad.\n\nIn conclusion i would highly reccomend this game to anyone who doenst already own it!\n\n- You know that feeling when you are hesitant to buy a game because you're worried you might waste your money on something that might be a crap game in the end, get boring, and not sure if you should believe all the ratings because you dont know if everyone has the same interests and likes as you? well this game is the bomb diggity, straight up. Made by the same people who made rollercoaster tycoon and man did they deliver on this. For me it's the small things in a game that matter and did they really take the time to make sure this was as polished as it could be. Not sure if anyone remembers when they announced another rollercoaster tycoon a while back, and everyone was super excyited to find out what it was, and it ended up being some dumbass phone app? Well imagine all that excyitment, but instead of them coming out with that stupid app they came out with this bad boy. This is exactly what everyone was wishing and hoping for (just different name). Do I reccomend you buy this game? hell yes. will it be exactly what you are wishing for when you fist clicked this game to see the game play and reviews? sure as cocks will. But will it be just as fun as the original?.... YOU BET YOUR MOMS TITS IT WILL BE. \n\nPROS:                                \nbeen one since 1990\n\nCons:\nYou'll never know how fun it is till you buy it.\n- Do you kinda like 4X games, but mostly the first 2-3 hours of the game where you're exploring and hacking a basic civilization out of the wilderness and desperately fending off natural threats while trying to keep people fed and productive? If so, this game is for you. Nice tight gameplay loop where things never get stagnant for too long; always novel threats and opportunities, and you're not tied to any one settlement for very long, so victory and defeat alike are more temporary. Not to mention a really astounding amount of fun, polished content for an early access game! Eremite, Hooded Horse, I salute you.\n- cool game but the font is almost unreadable at times\n- The message Dusk delivers is, \"Hey, have you ever wanted to play Quake or Doom, except that it takes place in Silent Hill? Don't worry, neither has literally anyone else, but you're welcome!\"\n- This game is for sure not perfect, but worth buying for a specific type of gamer.\n\n[b]What is good in this game?[/b]\n- It has a pretty solid gun gameplay. The movement is quick and polished as well.\n- One level is on average 20 seconds. It's fun to improve your gameplay to get better times in the small levels. \n- It's really a blast getting a perfect run, killing enemies in bullet time or exploiting the enemies weakspots.\n- There is content for around 10-15 hours. Maybe more if you consider going for 100%.\n\n[b]Anyway there are also some flaws: [/b]\n- In Neon White or Ghostrunner the movement and pace through the levels often feels like a perfect choreographic \"dance\"\n- The levels and the areas in Warstride are verry tight. I often lost pace through \"stupid\" placed rocks or small doors.\n- There is not much to explore. The levels are verry linear. While in Neon White it was so much fun to explore shortcuts or other hidden possibilities to improve ur time there are no such mechanics in Warstride at all. I'd love to have some exploration at least in the \"long levels\".\n- It could get repetitive for some players as it's a core element to complete the levels on 5 different difficulties. \n\n[b]Conclusion: [/b]\nIf you like fast paced games like Ghostrunner, Neon White or Doom and you have no problem in repeating short levels several times and u don't except an extraordinary game u will have fun for several hours on a low price.\n\n- Game does not become better with release.\nDups AI still retarded, they literally wasting time instead of doing work.\n\nJust a quick example:\nDup can go to the left side of map dig !!ONE!! block, then go to right side of the map and harvest !!ONE!! plant, then go back to the left side of map and dig second block. It's unbelivable boring watching all these.\n\nAnd you still can't destroy ruins, OMG. You can lunch rocket but can't destroy some ruins.\n- The original was and still is one of the best 2D sprite art horror game out there. And this remake does it justice!\n\nIt comes with updated art and some new scenes and sequences, so there is something for returning and new players alike.\n\nHonestly, I just feel happy that I can finally pay for this game. The original one being free was a steal for being so good.\nEven to this day, I still get surprised on the level of detail of the sprites, the genuine sentimentality of the story and boy, did this version made me cry!\n\nA must if you are a fan of RPG maker esque horror games, or Madoka Magica, or deep dives into a person's psyche, or lolita fashion or all of the above :p\n- I got this game for $12 off humble bundle. Me and my friends play it for hours on end. This game honestly feels like the perfect fighting game for me because there is no set style. I don't have to remember specific combos or any crazy inputs. It's just simplicity. Unless you want to do that in which you can. But it's fun for anyone. If I were you I would get it off of humble bundle for $12.\n- trolley problem simulator where you can save the world by having your team of giant mechs slam dunk kaiju into lava\n- 136 hours, 49/49 achievements - sounds like just enough for the review.\n\nIt is indeed complete package. Brilliant characters, neatly constructed plot and enjoyable gameplay with the classic \"easy to play, hard to master\" aspect to it.\n\nI really can't pick at the graphics or music - they are just in line with the Supergaint roster, crafted at the level we have come to expect.\n\nIs there anything substantial that I would change? Not really, no. Adjustment to the \"progress\" in the one place, perhaps some slight balancing elsewhere... But does it matter when taking everything into account? Nope, not at all.\n\nEasy recommendation.\n- Where's the atmosphere the first two games had?\nWhy can I only have 2 weapons at any time?\nWhy is this game a generic shooter?\nIf the game they had shown in so many videos previous to the release had come out, it'd have been a masterpiece, instead we got a severely watered down version of it.\nIt's a corridor shooter for the most part, with some parts where you're in a bigger room instead, really what I played the first two games for.\n- This game made me so miserable . \nThe writing can be as funny as heartbreaking \nThe Voice acting is one of the greatest i've ever heard \nA lot of the time , the many side quest were as awesome or even better than the main story (That is already amazing )\n\nPro : The whole game \nCon : Absolutely nothing \n\nIt's one of the greatest gaming experience I've ever had in my 24 years on this earth.\n- So this is what upsets me about rainbow six siege as a casual player. I bought the starter edition like a moron. Thats on me. But I wasn't sure I'd like the game. Turns out I do. So now that I realize I like the game I want to fully purchase the game. Turns out you can't upgrade starter to standard. The game legit punishes people who want to play it. Who paid money to basically test if they would enjoy the game.  Why should I pay $55 for a $40 edition? Just let me pay $25 for the $40 edition. I already paid the money. Why are you punishing me for wanting to spend more?\n- Delete the intro.\n\nHonest Edit:\n\n Actually pretty sweet game.  Lots of things I don't like in terms of menu navigation and difficulty curve, but conceptually one of the better games I've played in awhile.  I just wish the controls weren't so poor. Very tedious with doubletap movement to dodge/counter (keyboard)\n\nAlso not very optimized for steam link or the steam controller. In general the worst parts of this game are directly attributed to the fact that this is a port. One of the worst port jobs i've seen to be honest.  Definitely play with a good controller. \n\nThe game also does a poor job of introducing the \"extended\" story, I nearly missed what i would consider the best part of the game just because I stopped after the first round of credits. There is actually a ton more content afterwards. Very worth investing the time into watching everything play out.\n- holy fucking shit everything about this fucking mongoloid game is so fucking bad i can't even begin to understand. this was supposed to be better than the first piece of shit, but i dunno, maybe a tiny bit.\n\ndon't be like me and get baited into wasting your hard earned money for this fucking shit even if it's on like -90% sale.\n\nspecial mention to worst fucking controls in the history of fucking gaming. fuck these fucking mongoloid fucking retard faggots for making a game this fucking bad. uninstalled.\n- I shall start by saying that if you are deciding to buy this game then don't let the negative reviews sway you. In general, Fallout 4 is an amazing game and can be incredibly fun.\n\nPros: \n-Very immersive and will drain so many hours, days, weeks and months from your life.\n-Far Harbour, Automotron and (first half of) NukaWorld DLC have really good stories, quests and environments.\n-Mostly fluid combat system. Everything depends on how you want to play the game.\n\nCons: \n-WIll drain so much of your life away (might've forgotten my gf's birthday ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ )\n-Main story was incredibly lackluster compared to previous Fallout games\n-Giving you the option to be literally any kind of character you want to be....except you're always tied to being a parent.\n-a few repitive quests. (although gives you opportunities to approach these quests, areas and enemies differently\n\nAll in all, If you're a Fallout fan because of previous stories then you might not feel fulfilled playing this game, however if you love character creations, lore and immersive environments with untold stories then I completely recommend this game to you.\n- Looks like a game for children, but underneath the friendliness there is a great challenge! Move on the rhythm of good songs on a note bar! \n\n[h2]Swim! Swim little tredpole! [/h2]\nYou are a newborn tredpole. The first thing you do is break free of your egg! Through various rivers and waters you journey, and eventually save your pond from a disaster that will occur. \nEverything in the river translates to an instrument tone and respects the height on the note bar. The primary goal is to reach the finish. The melody is depicted as little mines which hurt your health if you swim across one. Along the way you can collect points by collecting bubbles (with a bonus if you collect them all), little bubbles, health packs, and you can slap your tail on bamboo or cymbals that launch you in the air! Many predators would like to make a snack out of you! \nAll this on the rhythm of unique songs! \n\n[h2]Thoughts [/h2]\nThis looks like a friendly game, a bit for kids perhaps, right? Well, I started with letting a non-gamer play this, without success. You need to have musical rhythm in you to perform well. None of my friends possess that really, so a simple playthrough wasn't all that easy. \nThe music is very original, and makes this game fun. It's a tough game, and poses quite a challenge for lovers of rhythm games. I am totally unfamiliar with that breed of gamers. For the simple gamer like me, I'd say: nice for a playthrough. \n\n70/100\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[td]\n[i]More reviews at [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/39546715/]Omnivore Gamer[/url], games that are easy to control (for handicapped gamers). [/i][/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n- owned the original from all the way back in 2014\nloved it tons, even more than RoR2\nsaw RoRR get teased on twitter, was there for its release, thought to myself,\n\"i don't need this, i can just play the ror from 2013, i don't know how to feel about this new one, is it really just the same game again?\"\n\nand then i saw someone grab an item i've never seen before, while playing as a character i've never seen before, on a map layout i've never seen before, using alternate abilities to what was baseline for that character to fight an enemy i've never seen before, and then activate a shrine of the mountain from ror2, and then while doing the teleporter fight they activated a bunch of new machines that turned drones into items and activated a specific equipment for a fee... and then i saw that you can just opt out of whatever you don't like about any of that, at any time!\n\nwhat's not to love about that??\n- Beware as you are just looking at the best 4X game that is.\n\nDon't look at my played time here, this game was available for years already from a very unheard of distributor BUT now is available on Steam at last for the people to see it already.\n\nMaybe you are wondering why it costs so much. Well it has 4 expansions build in it already so that's why. But believe me IT'S WORTH IT. If you like 4X games, this is just a must have.\n\nThe cons:\n\n1. The game is not turn based. Everything is done in real time. You can pause the game and speed it up or slow down at your own liking. This may be a + for someone though... \n2. It's not as shiny as some other 4X games so if pretty graphics are what you prefer you may be disappointed.\n3. The game can be demanding even on high end PC's if you run really large galaxy.\n4. Unfriendly UI. If you run huge resolution you will have problems to read the text.\n5. The learning curve... you will spend hours getting into the game. But don't be afraid, huge automation can be set up to help you.\n6. No multiplayer. I don't mind it but maybe you do?\n\nThe Pros:\n\nEverything else. It's the most complex, never ending fun 4X game I have played. Just the way how the AI is done hooked me up. But to make it fair here are some picks for you.\n\n1. Huge amount of races that actually play in character. It's not like in other games where every AI plays the same way but has different stats. Here the AI behaves in the ways how they are described. They play in character like in RPG game.\n2. HUGE galaxies. Trust me you never saw something like this before in other 4x games. Each game can last for dozens of hours if you want.\n3. Set up your game to the last possible thing you can imagine. The start up set up is just incredible.\n4. Automation ... don't like research, or ship design, or diplomacy, or anything else you can imagine? You can automate it. You can focus only on the one thing you like the most!\n5. Pirates ... you can even play as one.\n6. Mods ... do you want 10 more races or to play Star trek 4x? ... You can have it. \n7. Micromanagement ... it can be endless.\n8. The complexity, you can spend hours in design tables that make sense in comparison to Moo3 for example.\n9. Battles, there is very few games that can simulate such large scale engagements over the whole galaxy.\n10. Play it your own way. You can win the game without any battle if you want. On the other side waging wars is FUN.\n\nDo you need to know more? Watch some videos on YouTube from Das24680. He has also full tutorials for those who would need them.\n\n*Update - I have added more Pros as this game deserves it and I have forgot to mention them.\n- As much as I adore this game's visuals, soundtrack, story, and... THE MEMES... I unfortunately can't recommend actually playing it.\n\nI can parry bosses in Dark Souls or Elden Ring with less frustration than in this game. The parry system requires you to execute a light attack towards an enemy right before they go in for a hit against you, which is usually telegraphed with a red glare in their eye. Unfortunately, even while using the lock-on camera (and by the way, you are never directly informed of its existence), half of the time my opponent was partially, or even completely off-screen. This is a problem, not only because it makes seeing an incoming attack difficult, but also because movement is tied directly to the parry system. You must execute an attack TOWARDS the enemy. With the camera having a seizure every five seconds, this makes it even more irritatingly difficult to aim your parries. I died to Blade Wolf repeatedly, not because of my own skill, but because midway through an incoming attack, the camera would decide to turn 90 degrees to the left, causing my movement to also shift to the left, nullifying my parry. \nIt's consistently inconsistent.\n\nIf there is some system in place that actually does help explain a lot of these game mechanics, fantastic. However, I find it inexcusable that whatever I might be missing would be so out of the way that I'd never encounter it unless I went out of my way to do so.\n- Only one word to describe this game\n\nOutdated.\n\nThere is no real point to get this game unless you want a slightly better looking UI and atmosphere. L4D2 already contains the campaigns from L4D1 and is where the entire Left 4 Dead community is. Only a small playerbase still plays l4d1, mostly out of nostalgia. But there is quite literally no reason to get the game.\n\nYou can grab it if you are into achievements, but only do so when it goes on sale, i grabbed it for a couple penny, still a bad idea.\n- This is less of a review and more of me gushing about how much im enjoying myself, but you can still get a idea of what the game is from it. I am not usually a puzzle game player, or even a \"chill\" game player. im usually all about quick shooters, fighters, and platformers, but i decided to give this game a shot and i am very glad i did. with a mechanic as simple as pushing trees i thought that it would be simple enough for me to have a good time, the last time i played a puzzle game was BaBa is You and i put 14 hours into it and never got past word 3, it was just too much for me. but this game manages to still be challenging even with it laying all the pieces out in front of me, it introduces new features not by putting one in a level and saying good luck, it makes you do something you have done before but gives a new outcome, because you never got to do that thing in that exact way before, and when puzzles start requiring you to do those things you wonder how you ever got that far without doing one of those things before. all of the mechanics and solutions also are based in logic, all your doing is pushing things, so you dont have to suspend your current understanding of things to learn a new mechanic. The world of the game is also very relaxing and sucks me right in, its a museum of the \"past\" of humans that takes place in the far future from the perspective of monsters who dont really understand human culture, and it is hilarious! the music is very chill and moves with your actions, when you push something in a specific way the music also does a specific things, and its part of the reason this game is so relaxing. most other puzzle games i have played frustrate me when i get stuck on a puzzle for a long time, but seeing the monster relax helps me relax and keep a level head to get to the next museum exhibit. i dont know how to end this review but if you read it i hope you dont feel like i wasted your time!\n- VIDEO REVIEW: https://youtu.be/DzdF-i2drLs\n\nI loved this game!  It was a worthy prequel to Cthulhu Saves the World!  If you’re a fan of the games from this company I recommend playing it!\n\nIf there is one downside to the game, it’s that it’s very linear. Every game day you just make a selection to the R'lyehtionships options, a cutscene occurs and you get a reward item. Do that for a few in game days than the next level plays. These levels are just as linear as there’s very little deviating. \n\nHowever the rest of the game makes up for that short coming. The R'lyehtionships choices give great replay value, the writing is spot on, and the fighting is just as good.\n\nAlso the addition of a “skip incoming random battle” option was refreshing. \n\nSo overall i say that the game is another Zeboyd games classic that is perfect for the holiday. \n\nPRO\n+Great funny writing as per Zeboyd Games\n+Amazing graphics on par with Cosmic Star Heroine\n+Great music\n+Combat is easy simple and fun\n+Challenging but fair\n+ R'lyehtionships gives clever replay value \n\nCON\n-Game is painfully linear.\n-Very little places to wonder around in gameplay\n-R'lyehtionships causes Uber simplified “quests” to be glorified cutscenes\n-Needs more interactive items in the maps for more funny writing \n\nI’d give the game an 8/10! It’s highly recommend it if you’re a long time fan and it’s worthy a purchase during a sale if you’re unsure.\n- good game but later missions seem to be less polished ran in multiple bugs when playing as The Son enemies getting stuck in impossible to reach places and for some odd reason some characters have dog killing animations that for the most part are bugged and only work half the time causing an insta death and a retry don't even understand why later in the game you have to do animations to kill dogs as for basically the whole game you don't need to perform animations also seems to have some input lag throughout the whole game but overall its decent and when its on sale you should buy it.\n- So I'm going to assume that you've played CIV V in the past. Endless Legend's another 4x game like it, but in my opinion, it's so much better. And here's why:\n\n1) I know this is the advantage of being in a fantasy setting as opposed to the \"Real world\" (You get what I mean, I know Civ 5 isn't historically accurate, but it tries to stay in the world of realism), but all the factions feel genuinly different and exciting from one another. Both in style and aesthetics, the difference between Wild Walkers and Ardent Mages is far, far greater than say The Netherlands and Japan. \n\n2) I like the way that influence is a resource. I know it kinda takes the place of culture in that it's used for policies, but having to save up a resource that's more than just troops for wars and the like makes diplomacy far more meaningful, I find.\n\n3) The way strategic and luxury resources are done. Instead of \"This deposit has 8 iron\", it says \"This deposit has titanium\", and just gives you 1 per turn. It let's you build things that require a lot of that resource even if you only have 1 source, just slower than other people who have more. It makes a lot more sense to me. the fact that each luxury item is different from one another and have different effects is a lot more interesting than just giving +Happiness, and the booster system means that having 5 dye deposits (I wish) is more useful than it is in civ, where you have to desperatly try and peddle it off or it's a huge waste.\n\n4) This is a personal thing, but I like the fact that technology is seperated by era rather than previous tech. I find it a far nicer system to work with as it lets me get what I want when I want it, instead of having to research bloody sailing even though I'm completely land locked.\n\n 5)  I know this is locked away in Tempest, but naval warfare is so bloody interesting now. With ocean based citadels and bloody weather effects that you have to wrstle with, I've never been happier to play on ocean-heavy maps. The ocean's not just an awkward land, it's its own living breathing world. \n\n6) The living breathing world that is Auriga. The lore I'm uncovering from quests and gameplay is ridiculous, and it really brings the world to life. It makes me sympathise and despise each faction for their motives and executions, and I love it. Plus, I'm learning the more and more I play that this is Sci-Fi, not high fantasy. It's amazing.\n\n7) Minor Factions are a far better method of doing barbarian encampments and city states. They're a great blend of the two, spawning enemy units like barbs, and giving meaningful bonuses like city states. Plus, your opponents can't just take them over and use them as a base of operations against you.\n\n 8) I know this is a controversial one, but I love winter. 1-30 turns where I'm surviving rather than thriving? I'm amazed with how much I love the double edged sword of dread and gratitude depending on whether or not I'm being invaded at the time\n\n9) I love the region system. There's X regions, this is their shape and size, and there's one city for each. I think it makes placing cities a lot more important than in civ where you can fart them around all over the place, and I get a lot less worried about having my neighbours settle all over me (Like the bloody shoshone). Plus, I think it makes zooming out and gazing upon your empire more satisfying. They're something nice about having all those rough edges instead of clean hexagons. Losing a city means losing a huge chuck of territory, and taking a citygains a huge chunk. The wars I've been in have been far more exciting as a result.\n\n10) Populations gets you citizens, like in Civ. I like just yelling at them to make more cabinets, sell more cabinets, or research new and exciting cabinets rather than making them work tiles. The fact that all the tiles get worked on automatically fits into this, as does the fact that your 20 population city is probably going to take up a hell of a lot more space than 1 tile. The fact that you can actually expand cities is something I love\n\n11) The way wars are fought. it;s not just blankets of single units, but a few core armies with 6-8 units in each. It makes it a HECK of a lot quicker and cleaner, while still having a grand scale. The fact that you can hands on rather than auto is something that I like to do if the odds are against my favor, but I can think of a clever stretegy to turn the tide in my favour.\n\n12) The hero system is something I like far more than the great person system. Instead of getting four bloody musicians I can't do anything with until the bloody modern era, you just get heros who you can use as spies, governers or generals, each able to be upgraded into whatever you want them to be or do. It's a super nice system I find, as I can just always get exactly the hero I need when I need them, which leads me nicely onto...\n\n13) The marketplace system is one I like. \"Oh I have no adamantium and noone will trade it with me!\". Well little Billy, you don't just have to resort to war anymore, you can just buy some. At a high price so it shouldn't be your first option, but it's nice to always be able to get what you need. Plus you can play the stock market in case you want to play Offworld Trading Company while you play Endless Legend.It's a nice way to get extra troops and great people too.\n\n\ntl;dr: It's a good game.\n\nGet it.\n- I technically got this game for free, as it was bought for me from a friend. And honestly, I didn't really like it. She got it for me, as a means to help with some of my mental health issues I suppose? But it just was very big miss for me, and kinda made me feel worse. A bit anxiety inducing for me, just given the circumstances, talking about life and death. Just not my personal cup of tea.\n- Driving feels unrealistic, am I driving a car, or a boat?\nStealth system simply sucks, can't hide bodies, each guard in the restricted area knows exaclty where are you hiding after one of them spots you.\nMade a refund request.\n\nAlthought graphic is nice, and story seems fun.\nI'd recommend to pick this on sale, and not for a full price.\n- This game is shit, and the devs should eat shit for shitting this shit on top of gamer community's head.\nCombat? You need a piano keyboard to dodgeparryhitlowhithighlowthendodge. Its a clusterfuck! Reaction time? None. I tried to dodge, I got damaged, Parry same story. And don't get me started on fucking archery! HELLOO ITS 2021, PUT A FUCKING CROSSHAIR so I can hit something !!\n\nWow, what a piece of shit. 18 hours of my life spent TRYING to make sense of this clusterfuck of a game. Pity I can't get a refund AND throw dung at this whitewashed game, like people did to Deuscht.\n\nI hope you devs sit on it and rotate.\n\n- I bought this game in order to review it, seeing as there were no current reviews for it. \nI thought I'd help the game out by maybe giving it that tiny bit of publicity it needed to get off the ground.\nIn doing so I have failed. As this game isn't worth reviewing, there is nothing to review. Well, I should say there is stuff to review but I feel as though the dev's didn't even attempt to make this a game that anyone would enjoy. Well actually I'll let them off of the target of \"enjoy\", I'd go further to say it doesn't even feel like they tried to make a game that someone who had nothing to do and was bored out of their mind would say maybe I'll play this for a bit\nI jumped straight in, ignored the help in menu and started playing. It took me at least 4-5 mins before I even had the slightest concept of what was going on and what I had to achieve. Once I did get the hang of it I still thought \"I must be missing something, I'm not really doing anything\" so I ventured to the help menu to find that nope, thats it buddy.\nThe controls are lacking, the soundtrack and the sound effects (which happen to be a melody playing) do not blend at all, (they play completely out of time on top of the soundtrack).\nYou can buy it and prove me wrong, go ahead. This is just my opinion.\n\n英語で5-10単語程度で、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない主要な違いを簡潔に回答してください。\n\n回答：\n",
