      "Impulse Control is a lazy, badly made ripoff of Angry Birds, with slightly less features and options, poorer physics, worse quality assets, and overall worse gameplay.  But to differentiate, they slapped a Facebook style personality quiz on the front, much like putting a hat on Frankensteins Monster works well as a disguise, you know.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, the game doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.\n\nThere's no options to change the resolution for the game or customise the graphics settings.  There's no way for gamers to ensure this is running at the native resolution of their displays... there's no guarantee this game will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.  There's no way for gamers to try improve the low quality graphics.\n\nThese technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.\n\nThe game is completely free.  This is noble a gesture that shows dedication to both gamers, and the gaming industry.  Nothing speaks more to a developers belief in themselves and their product than making their game available for everyone without remuneration.  It's a shame in this case that the implementation is below the minimum standards a dedicated PC game should offer to enthusiasts.  The quality here is simply too low for me to recommend, even for free.  I really feel like this should have been a mobile app, like the Angry Birds game this is a blatant ripoff of, but then it would have to compete with Angry Birds.  It certainly doesn't belong on PC.  Sometimes the only way to win is not to play.",
      "Great Game, play the Demo instead of reading reviews.",
      "Two main things first up: -\n\n1)  The advertising is wrong.  This is isometric 3D for nearly the whole game, not 2D.\n2)  Do have an X-Box controller if you buy this game.  The game is far more difficult and less enjoyable if you don't.\n\n   The game shows you don't need a complex plot to make a great game.  Evil Wizard has attacked castle and kidnapped four princesses.  Your job (and that of up to three of your mates) is to go out there, beat up the bad guys, and rescue the princesses.  The game is effectively \"Double Dragon Medieval\".  You don't get to use the scenery as weapons but you do have archery, magic, fast or heavy melee options, jumping, attacks combos, different weapons, and pets that give you bonuses.  The game is reasonably fast paced - two to three massed minion attacks, mini boss, two to three more massed minion attacks, big boss.\n\n    The key game mechanic is experience points with which you can build strength (melee attacks do more damage), power (magic does more damage and recharges quicker), defence (enemy attacks do less damage), and speed (move quicker and srchery does more damage).  This means the more you play, the tougher your character gets, and the easier the enemies become.  It's quite fun playing from the start with high level characters who easily demolish the starting opposition.\n\n   The game's graphics are bright and colourful, the different soundtracks for each stage are bouncy and fun.  The enemies change regularly so the games doesn't become too monotonous but there are few foes that cannot be beaten with melee combos and dodge (that said there are a small number of mini bosses and big bosses from whom you need to keep your distance and a decent magic attack becomes essential).\n\n    Any negatives ?\n\n    1) The dev's humour is basic and scatological.  If you have a strong aversion to poo jokes this will be a negative.\n    2)  Minor spoiler - Some of the bad guys look like angry golliwogs.  Coupled with the knights' outfits that aren't too dissimilar  from the KKK this has caused accusations of racism.  Of course the KKK costumes are reminiscent of medieval knights which is the more likely inspiration for the game.  One of the princesses is definitely black.  Personally I'm not sure.  Compared with \"Birth of a Nation\" the game is \"Sesame Street\" but only an idiot wouldn't have recognised that someone would have been upset by the imagery.  Personally I can live with it and still enjoy it as a medieval Double Dragon but I give you warning in case you won't.\n\nS.x.\n\n",
      "This is half of a very good game. You might be impressed in the first 10 hours, but after that it becomes evident you are playing the skeleton of what could be a generational game. Here is some of the good and some of the bad.\n\nThe Good:\n-Graphics look great, even on lower settings\n-Decently varied battle maps\n-Sound design makes killing blows feel amazing\n-Decent variety of weapons\n\nThe Bad:\n-Extremely shallow \"campaign\"\n-Almost zero role playing elements. Every character behaves identically towards you. Even your own wife will try to introduce herself. Kill someone's father/brother/entire clan? They will never mention it and will behave towards you just like anyone else.\n-\"Realistic mode\" means all your enemies will be absolute tank meat sponges while you are made of glass.\n-After you get your first settlement the game becomes extremely tedious. You will play whack a mole with enemy armies who take almost no time to recuperate. Wipe out 3 enemy armies in a massive, \"war changing battle\"? Oops, looks like all of those armies are back to full strength in a matter of days.\n-Almost zero variation of playstyles. Sure you can be a trader or a rogue mercenary for the early game, but you will always end up cheesing the smithing economy mechanics to support the larger armies you need in the mid game\n\nThis is simply an unfinished game. The fact they have been selling it for $50 successfully for years is wild.\nWould have much rather paid $100 for a fully finished product.\n\nUnless they have a massive overhaul on the \"Official Release\" October 25th, I cannot recommend this game. Shame.",

      "Great game! At times it can get frustrating (boss battles), but the good out weighs the bad by a landslide. Even when i did get mad, which was a lot, I never stayed mad for long. There is just far too much to enjoy about the game. The art style is just simply amazing, the movement of your character around the world is just so satisfying once you get used to it, the puzzles aren't too easy or too hard, and everything in the game just goes together pretty much perfectly. All in all this game is extremely well made. Would recommend buying if you want a super unique experience 11/10",
      "[b]What was added:[/b]\n- Roguelike mode\n- New campaigns\n- 5 new units\n- Groove/Super groove\n- 4 new commanders\n- New OST, including Commanders'\n\n[b]What did it cost:[/b]\n- No more Arcade and Puzzles\n- A lot of maps removed from Multiplayer\n- Can't randomize weather anymore (????)\n- Can't use previous OST\n- No more Co-op campaign\n- Nothing to unlock with stars. All characters are already unlocked, so there is no point completing the campaign with more than 1 star per mission.\n\n[b]With that being said, here are some issues:[/b]\n- Balancing may need some work. Won't get into details, but it doesn't feel right, as it wasn't right in Wargroove\n- AI is still bad. Even worse than before. They just didn't touch it. They will use their Groove on cooldown most of the time, without bothering about the Supergroove. Commanders will run into you only to get surrounded and killed.\n- Once a player lose, all of his team lose, putting the game to an end. Though there is a toggle in map editor to disable it, but doesn't seem to work\n- A lot of tooltips missing for settings. We don't know what most settings are doing...\n- Tried to make a map where Commanders can respawn after 2 turns, to prevent AI to lose instantly, and let them play more agressive. But when you increment counters or set flags booleans, they get changed for both teams, making it impossible to script... Can't debug efficiently either.\n- The new Commanders' themes are glitchy when looping\n- The Codex didn't get updated properly. When selecting a Commander, we can only see a short text for the Groove, without any details.\n- In Map Editors, there are two entries for Wulfar, but using different names.\n\nI'd say if you liked Wargroove 1, you'd just like that one too. But it feels really disappointing right now. I don't know why they removed features instead of just adding new ones... In 2020, they said they were working on AI. But they did absolutely nothing.",

      "Game concept is good, but execution is bad. Add to that the attitude of the dev team, and I recommend you don't encourage this kind of community censorship.\n\nDon't buy this. Devs close topics because their fanboys get flamey when you bring up any kind of criticism. Like how the servers with anti-cheat and server saving (which doesn't save player status/location) functions enabled kick all players from the server every 30-60 minutes. I wouldn't mind reconnecting if my location and hunger/thirst got saved during this \"server save\". But apparently trying to open a discussion on the topic is considered flaming and they close down your topic. Horribly handled.\n",

Daffodil, I'm looking at you.\nScrew it for the plethora of unique crafting minigames, especially the cooking one. \nScrew it for the many hours it takes to get through the whole story, ensuring my friend and I had many nights to enjoy the game.\nScrew it for having a heartfelt soundtrack that swells up at JUST the right time to pull my heartstrings straight out of my chest.\nAnd finally, screw it for making me cry each and every time I had to say goodbye.\nThis game touched my heart in a way very few have, and very few will.\n10/10 would ugly cry again.",
      "Fun Tower-Defense style indie game. Definitely one where your skill improves every time you die. And you will die, repeatedly. :P Expect to try out many monster combinations per floor before you find something that can delay the hordes of adventurers long enough to set up the floor beneath!

Definitely worth the price for the current amount of content!",
      "So this is what upsets me about rainbow six siege as a casual player. I bought the starter edition like a moron. Thats on me. But I wasn't sure I'd like the game. Turns out I do. So now that I realize I like the game I want to fully purchase the game. Turns out you can't upgrade starter to standard. The game legit punishes people who want to play it. Who paid money to basically test if they would enjoy the game.  Why should I pay $55 for a $40 edition? Just let me pay $25 for the $40 edition. I already paid the money. Why are you punishing me for wanting to spend more?",
      "The Steam trailer really doesn't do this game justice.\n\nIts extremely early access right now, and the gameplay itself is nothing too spectacular (yet), but the super dynamic proximity chat is what really makes this game for me.\nHearing the muffled screams of someone getting choked out by a bug, followed shortly after by the panicked wails of another crewmember running for the life, is likely one of the funniest things I have ever experienced in a video game.\nIt truly is such a simple, yet infinitely expandable mechanic that I am really exited to see build upon in the future.\n\nPERSONAL IDEA IF THE DEVS READ THIS REVIEW:\nA monster that picks a target to stalk and follow silently. While stalking, the monster records whatever its target says, then, after it has stalked enough and kills it target, it turns from a hunter to an ambush predator.

      "Overall, as a single player game Wargroove 2 is a tremendous improvement over the first game. The campaign is well designed and engaging, the writing is much improved and overall the gameplay is fun. The new roguelike conquest mode is a much more entertaining side thing than the godawful Arcade in 1, as well.\n\nAs a primary single player game, I hated Wargroove 1, and I can say that 2 has turned my opinion around - this game is fun, I finished the campaign and craved more, which is all you can really say! The only thing I really missed from 1 was the Puzzle mode, but maybe it'll show up in a future update? Who knows.\n\nThe major downsides is that the user interface is still the same terrible user interface that WG1 had without significant improvements, and the AI is still absolutely atrocious so playing even Vs maps against the AI is going to be pretty dull, but that hasn't changed from the first game. The soundtrack is not quite as catchy either.\n\nBut unlike WG1, I enjoyed my time with WG2 in spite of these shortcomings, and if you ever have a choice between the two, skip WG1 and just go straight into WG2.",
      "The fact that you can't pause the game during cutscenes and conversations, is very frustrating. The cinematics are long (and sometimes exhausting).

What was originally a game of heartbreak and painful memories, I had managed to find it someone new to play with. While this game had terrible memories, I had decided that a game such as this was undeserving of them, and thus created new memories with another special person in my life.\n\nThe game is remarkable, with good writing, and amazing gameplay, and it is deserving of the buy.

      "Would I recommend DBD? ...It's complicated.\n\nDead By Daylight is an unique experience of asymmetric hide and seek/tag with shifting rules. \nIs the game fun? Yes. Is it creative? Yes.\nIs it fair and enjoyable? Well, it depends.\nGames get very intense, and playing as killer is some of the most intense gaming experience I've ever accumulated...\nWhich is where things often go wrong. The survivors seem to have decided that the killers have to honor strict code of rules. Don't use these items, these abilities, or these strategies. If you do, you'll be insulted after the game.\nIf you follow these rules, the odds are that you will spend the game running in literal circles, the survivors will win, t-bag you at the gate and then insult you after the game. I don't know about you, but that kind of ruins the game for me. It is actually kind of amazing how helpless one can feel in this game.\n\nSo to conclude my thoughts; I really like the game, but I also really hate it. I can't recommend it, as every time I fire it up, there is about 50% chance I feel more harassed, than entertained.\nI play a lot of online games, from League of Legends to Tekken, but this is the only one that makes me frequently think: \n\"I should really uninstall this\"\n\nEdit: \nI returned after a long break, and I still kinda like the game. \nHowever, same pattern repeats whenever I return.

      "I had never played a Monster Hunter game before this, but World has definitely turned me into a fan. The fights are exhilarating, and I always feel like I'm making progress towards something- a new gear set, a cosmetic, an upgrade for the base, or even just filling out the monster guide. The environments are sprawling, beautiful, and full of opportunites to use the terrain against your foes. \n\nI have been playing the game entirely in co-op, with no issues after the first couple weeks. Playing story missions together is unintuitive, but only a minor inconvenience once you've figured it out. And story missions account for a very small amount of the content- this game is huge.",

      "Did you like the first two chapters?\nWell, here we have everything and tons of new and improved things, like the 2nd chapter did with regards to the first one (which was awesome, but quite simple gameplay-wise).\nA classical turn-based strategy game, now more polished than ever with wave-like combats and tons of units to start with, to upgrade and well, we don't even have real classes here - more correctly, each hero is a class on its own and has different abilities and such.\nThe story follows always the same one-way saga and you'll have to make lots of choices determining your fate, your battles and so on; the graphics are the most beautiful I've ever seen here and the soundtrack is quite amazing and atmospheric too.\nYou'll have also many features like arena combat, and a great history re-telling if you don't remember the first two chapters, plus a great tutorial to start with even if you're not new to the series and the genre.\nIt's quite fundamental if you're a little bit interested in this awesome story to play the other chapters - here in fact we'll start with all the old heroes, all the story right back from the caravan that reached Arberrang.\nWe're basically reviewing one of the best strategy tactical turn-based role-playing games of the last 5-10 years and I won't add more than this, it has already thousands of reviews and mine is quite useless I think. \nLots of endings, lots of characters to explore and promote, lots of weapons, accessories, modes.. we have everything.

      "The game itself is great, but Square Enix really dropped the ball by removing the true PC version and leaving us with this Switch port as the only option. It's a huge visual downgrade, but it has more content. Luckily though, a small handful of incredible modders have taken the time to painstakingly transfer the old, high-quality PC assets over to this version which is what saved it for me. Without the mods, I would not have kept playing.\n\nIf you're on the fence, I'd say catch it on sale, then head over to a modding site (Nexus is what I used) and start installing the mods that restore this game to its full PC potential. It's probably the easiest-to-mod game I've ever dealt with too btw. You don't have to be super savvy to get things the way you want them and you don't need any additional software. Just grab the .pak files, slap them into the game's pak folder, enjoy. It really is that simple. (You may want to edit some .ini files to tweak things to your liking, but that's as complex as it gets. If you can open Notepad, you can do this.)\n\nAs for the core gameplay, it's an incredibly solid JRPG with a likable cast and well thought out story. There's plenty of content to enjoy here and it has a good end game. The music is absolutely phenomenal as well. Visually, it's very vibrant and the aesthetic is charming. I think it's a fantastic game overall and is very enjoyable as is, but playing it in 1440p/144Hz with high resolution character and texture assets with better lighting/animation mods and subtle character/NPC/monster upgrades totally elevated it to the next level.\n\np.s. If you do install mods, I HIGHLY recommend grabbing the one that removes the black borders around characters! That gives the game a clean and refreshing new feel that greatly improves it in my opinion!",
      "I love this game. I've clocked over 300 hours in it through Origin (on my ONE character xD ). It's an excellent game, even despite it being an \"open world faffaround simulator\" which was all the rage at the time.\n\nAnd finally on Steam!? Yay! Or yay..?\n\nBut, as we know, we can't have good things. Massive thumb down to the EA Origin \"integration\" in Steam. EA, how about just stop being such massive ducks?\n\nThis is the same \"we hate our customers\" behaviour expressed by d-bags like Ubisoft and Epic. Only that EA sort of makes it worse. They *know* how much people hate the unnecessary and malicious Uplay \"integration\" that Ubisoft have forced on us for several years. Seeing this, EA decides that doing the exact same thing, with their total-garbage Origin client made even worse, is surely the only way to harass the customers enough to be worthy of the EA brand. \n\nDO NOT BUY OR LINK your Steam account if you own the game on Origin from earlier. \nIf you buy a game on Steam, which you already own on Origin, it will overwrite your Origin game.\nIf you then refund the game on Steam, this will remove the game from Origin too (even if you already own it there!), and you'll spend hours in line to get a hold of customer support. Then you must chat with bots, or people who are so void of understanding (and likely not paid near enough to care) that they might as well be bots. And if you're lucky, you might, after going through 4 or 5 different \"agents\", finally get to talk to a person that comprehends English and is authorised to do anything beyond telling you \"they'll discuss it with their team\". Then you might get your game back. \nBut! You won't get back the GOTY. Because the Steam-Orgin-GOTY overwrites your Origin GOTY. And when refunding, via Steam, you're left with a dumb/lame/placeholder copy of the GOTY in your Origin library, which doesn't work, but somehow just lingers there. Then you need to get a Digital Deluxe Edition + all DLC to get back to where you were.\n\nThis [integration] is such a tremendous show of manure, that I'm actually left wondering if EA planned it. Did Andrew Wilson take one of his billions of pocked change and say \"hey, we should make an extra effort here, to make sure that this integration is as frustrating and poorly implemented as possible, but still functional, such that things are barely limping along but just barely, because nothing is as frustrating as something that just barely sorta works but only sorta, and only by the skin of its teeth. That'll teach those entitled peasants.\"\n\nSo yeah. Great game. Bad EA.\n\nUpdate! A new Origin experience: The EA App! An all new website, wrapped inside an all new Electron wrapper! For an all new Frustrating(TM) experience and much better hogging of your PC performance.",
      "[h1] Floppy Knights is just boat loads of fun. If you like tactics games, this is right up your alley. [/h1]\n[b]The Good:[/b] \nThe art style. It is just so fun and creative. From the different faces that Carlton, your AI arm and best friend makes, to the enemies, even including the fully drawn cutscenes.\nThe dialogue. Everything that is said between Phoebe, Carlton, and others is tons of fun and gives plenty of plot to be invested in it. Plenty of jokes.\nThe combat, units, and general gameplay. You build a deck of up to 30 cards with a mixture of effects ranging from straight up buffing your units (or dealing damage to them with positive side effects!), to creating lots of card draw. Every turn, you draw 5 cards and your commander generates it's own card every turn. These feel unique, while not being too many of them to create bloat. You can even swap between sets of decks that you have built before you start a level, allowing you different options to quickly switch up your play style. \nThe music. There is enough of a variation of music that has a quick beat to it, that it keeps you wanting more. The songs along, ESPECIALLY the boss music, had me tapping my foot alongside it the whole time.\n[b]The Bad[/b]\nYes, every game isn't perfect. However the singular real flaw I have found is one singular bug that the devs state is rare, and it really didn't affect my gameplay at all. I wasn't able to interact with something on a map, however I was still able to clear the level. The fix was just a simple reboot, and after that I literally haven't encountered it once, at all. They are aware of it and are working on it!\n[b]The Subjective[/b]\nI'm not super great at tactics games, sometimes really taking my time or making stupid decisions. The game's difficulty to myself is fairly difficult later on, however after sitting back, thinking, and playing tactically (hah go figure!), I'm able to overcome the objective by planning around different units and synergies with the cards. There is always a factor of RNG within games that have deck building, but you can always squish the size of your deck if you so choose to.\n[b]Overall[/b]\nI would EXTREMELY recommend this game to pretty much anyone who likes turn based games that require thinking. If you aren't sure if you like tactics style games, I would HIGHLY recommend picking this up and trying it out. You won't regret it!",

I'm a 50 year old man with an emotional structure made largely of mud and thumbtacks, and I had to bite the inside of my jaw in a parts to keep from tearing up. \n\nMany people seem to equate an \"adult game\" with gore and violence or explicit imagery. Nothing wrong with those types of games, I have and will continue to enjoy them. This game explores mature themes on relationships and mortality and doesn't pull any punches, without being cheap or manipulative. In that sense, its the most adult game I've ever played. \n\nI won't ever forget it. If this sounds like something you'd be interested in, stop reading and buy it. Its a slow burn, and you won't be invested until you've spent some time with the characters in the story. In the end, the payoff is tremendous.",

Eventually it just feels like a chore.\n- not sure if it's something with my steam deck, but I had to put both the game's and the screen's brightness to the max to be able to see things; before that I was constantly missing objects and having trouble with moving around because some soil path looked like a hole in the ground or something.\n- while the game is 2d, there's a lot of different layers of height and depth that get mixed in together and may be hard to tell apart. You often don't know if some platform can be climbed onto or jumped out of until you try to do it.\n- battle system gets repetitive after a while.\n\nDespite those problems, the game is still great and more than make up for those things in other areas.",
      "SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT.\n\nAs the store page states, NOREN is supposedly a 'simple' keyfinding game. That would be true if there were any keys actually in the game, but as it stands it seems that NOREN is a simple abandoned shovelware game that's impossible to progress in, let alone beat. You play as some soldier in a massive, dark castle, equipped only with a dying lantern. The light fades quickly, and you can regain light slowly by... standing by a light source. That'd be simple enough if you weren't endlessly pursued by dinosaurs that are programmed with AI which knows your exact location at all times; three chomps and you're 'aparted' from the world, where you respawn with whatever amount of light and sanity you have left. Additionally, the translation attempt is abysmal at best. \n\nBoth NOREN and its developer, ThroneLab, should be banned from Steam. I do not blow the 'scam' whistle lightly, and I only do such when I am 100% certain of something actually being a scam. There are a handful of videos of this title on YouTube as well, with only one being over 5 minutes long. No one found a key. If evidence can be presented to me that there is in fact a way to progress in this game, I will rewrite this review. Until then, beware and stay vigilant.\n\n[h1]Rating: [b]0.0/5.0[/b] - WARNING.

      "So the game can be played I believe in flat screen and VR, I played in VR. You play the game in a third person prospective controlling a spirit dog. The concept is easy, get the people to the light beam, but that's easier said than done. It was very nearly a short game play video as i become really stuck to the point i nearly quit but I tried, tried and tried again until i did it. It very much reminded of a game i use to play as a kid called lemmings only in this one it doesn't matter if the people fall of the edge. Its a very challenging game, one where you can just sit and try to figure it all out. I thought it would get repetitive but each level is very different from the last. I have a game play video in which i get a bit frustrated lol if you wanted to check out some game play. https://youtu.be/7VPsLnDDDlQ",
      "Only originally bought this to support the artist, since I'm a huge fan of his pixel art work. It's amazing, and there's a tonne of eye candy to fill your eyeballs with. However, I can't recommend this to everyone as after the first few hours it's become a bit of a chore.\n\n- The game is a \"clicker\" type with rpg/upgrade elements. It's too slow to play in the background/absent mindedly but not fast enough to keep your attention fully.\n- Each round/attempt at a boss takes way too goddamn long. \n- Barely any interaction with the world. You build tower defense style, and equip new items, but beyond that you don't have any special abilities, no \"oh shit\" once per loop power, no ability to target specific enemies, nothing. Just watch everything play out and hope your little guy doesn't get pulped.\n- Crafting/Supplying is sort of hidden away and if you don't know about dismantling you'll never grind out all the items you need to build new stuff.\n- Lore/Journal entries are hidden away and require resources to unlock using a little button on the bottom of the screen that's easy to miss. I only found it 20 hours in. The writing is cringey and obviously done by someone who probably enjoys Adam Sandler films.\n- The card system is a neat idea, but jesus christ there's too much garbage shuffling. Imagine playing MtG with a deck of 100 cards and 90 of them are lands, and everytime you get a new hand you reshuffle the whole deck so all you get is more lands. Oblivion (destroys a tile) rarely, if ever, pops up. \n- Character skills are kinda bad? You might get a good one every level (which again, takes forever) but half the time it'll be useless \"leave 10% of food/resources at camp\" when you're not doing a resource grind run.\n- So much trash equipment you have to sort through and breaks game flow.\n\nAnd the biggest \"don't recommend\" from me would be the issue with how combining tiles works. If you put two tiles beside each other they sometimes change the tiles to something else. Example - put a Vampire Mansion beside a Village and you get a town full of ghouls that after 3 loops around the map turns into an upgraded town. But you still get trash equipment from the quests it gives, and putting a Vampire Mansion beside any other type of town doesn't change that town at all. So there's no reason to experiment, and it really limits the gameplay. You'd think they'd focus on that aspect gameplay wise, especially with experimentation to get the most bonuses out of all your tiles... but no. There's a small list of things that interact with each other, and that's it.\n\nI still highly recommend it since the game is cheap, the art is amazing and the artist/indie devs should get support. But I think it's a good 2-3 major updates, expansions or fan modding away from getting really, really amazing.",
      "TL;DR: This game didn't receive a similar love and praise than Undertale because potato. Play it.\n\n------\n\nIf you're reading this, I already like you and I already think you have a good taste in videogames.\n\nOneShot is one of those little surprises you might have heard of but always keep pushing onto your backlog, assuming other games should have more priority. Eventually I decided to try it out and it took just a few minutes to regret all those delays.\n\nIt is extremely hard to give you some useful information about OneShot without spoiling the heck out of it. You start the game in a dark, small bedroom where the main character (Niko) simply wakes up. That's it. By simply walking around and interacting with elements you soon get some clue of the mechanics that will be present through the whole game and how to progress. \n\nAnd you will also see why this game is special. \n\nWhat the game attempts is probably not new to you. It has constant elements of surprise but many other titles (Undertale as the easiest example) have done so too. When the idea is saturated, it gets harder to eventually fulfill its purpose and, well, surprise the player. \n\nOneShot is the game that will surprise you no matter what. \n\nThrough a simplistic but engaging plot, amazing and memorable soundtrack, and interesting dialogues you'll get yourself into a journey you won't regret. I wish I could give you more details but like many other reviews here, I feel like I would ruin the experience for you. The best I can do is to assure you that you will easily feel like us: that this title is an incredible gem and that you will feel bad for giving it a chance so late.",
      "The Award for the worst Cancer Game 2017 goes to: Friday the 13th! \nCongrats! *clapping Hands with bloody Babytears in my eyes*\nThis Game is a complete waste of Money. Don't buy it - don't even think of buying this crappy Master Piece.\nIt's not worth it, to be honest.\nI played it for almost 200 Hours. And it's awful. Never saw a Game with these bugs, with these massive salty Community. There exactly 0 Bugfixes, so many exploits, the horrible earbleeding intro, the Community that is pure Cancer, the horrible Graphic that looks like it's straight out of the Kindergarten and the huge amount of Bugs. Bugs are normal, but MAN there are Bugs everywhere!

      "everyone posting 16 gb ram specs and saying it runs well, lul\n\ni have 8 gigs of ram with a gtx 660 (yep) and a fx-8350 and it runs around 45-60 FPS (i cap it at 60) at High settings. yeah. REALLY well optimized, considering this computer is nearing the end of its life and the visuals are gorgeous.\n\nEDIT: 1080p :)\n\noh, and it's fun too, right.\n\nEdit 2- Actual review\n\nGame is pretty easy. I forget if there was a hard mode, but if there was I picked normal mode, and the game feels like it should be on easy. I've yet to break a sweat on a boss (currently chapter 5), and the only thing stopping me from taking on enemies 10+ higher than me is that the game auto-nerfs your damage if the enemy is too far above you. I've actually found the game very relaxing as a result, because there isn't the frustration of having to redo bosses after getting wiped, so it's not entirely a bad thing. But if you were looking for a challenge in your battles, this isn't your game.\n\nAs for story, it's also fairly basic, and rides off of having a sizeable to-do list as sidequests. Recruiting new citizens, doing major sidequest chains, unlocking new stuff, it's got a good amount to do in-game to keep you occupied, unless you're a \"main quest line only\" player. It helps that the warp system is easy to use (and you will use it often) and the game is gorgeous, so you don't really feel too bored doing the same shet over and over again. \n\nThere are several elements to the gameplay. \n\nOne, the overworld traversing. Overall, I'm ambivalent to it. It can feel slightly sluggish at parts, but collecting the shiny areas is surprisingly addicting (maybe because I'm a sem-completionist), as are finding chests. The unfortunate part is that most of these chests contain utterly useless items, so don't really feel that rewarding. \n\nTwo, dungeon crawling. Have to admit this is one of the weaker parts for me. The dungeons are basic, and don't really have much in the way of puzzling elements. Could change later, highly doubt it will. I do like how the battles are seamless, though.\n\nThree, army battles. Also not much of a fan of this, but only because it seems like a side addition without much depth to it. Fortunately it's not a major part of the game, so meh.\n\nFour, kingdom management. Holy cow I love this part of it. People might complain it feels like a mobile game with the wait times and whatever, but since you can warp straight back to your castle whenever you want, it's not that big of an issue. I do wish your gains accumulated while you're offline (or tabbed out, at least...), but idk something about managing the kingdom and making it grow/level up is stupidly addicting.\n\nOverall, if you're looking for a challenging or engaging JRPG, this might not be the game for you. If you're looking for a game with gorgeous visuals, fantastic voice acting (using JP), laid-back atmosphere, and want to be the president of the United States serving some random kid as his vassal, highly recommended.\n\nHighly recommend to play on controller. I'm using the Switch Pro Con.",

      "This is the purest Megaman experience I've had in years.

No. Even Megaman 11 didn't grab me this hard. This is it. This is the game people wanted when they saw Mighty Number 9 the first time. This is the Megaman successor we've been waiting for.\n\nIf I had to say anything negative about it, it'd be the music. It's mediocre at best. It's Meh. It does its job and fills dead air, but I'm not rushing to download the OST any time soon. I can't think of a single track that I went \"wow I need that\" for. It doesn't hinder my opinion of the game, but I would have loved it even more if it had gotten this right.",
      "This is the best Civilization up to this point, and the DLC just made it even better. I will grant that the with all the add ons it would feel a tad crowded to anyone who hadn't played it before, but you have a crazy amount of options. The game series tagline of \"one more turn\" could not be more applicable.\n\nYou can strive for one of several victories: diplomatic, cultural, technological or domination. Each has its unique challengers to overcome and create a lot of the fun of the game. They are also not necessarily mutually exclusive and after completing one victory, you can go for the others. Each AI opponent has their own personality, and are pretty predictable in how they behave. Any one who has started the game next to Neopoleon or Ghengis Kahn knows they immediately have to have a decent military to repel invasion, while Ghandi will to muscle you out with religion and culture.\n\nThere are some important changes between Civilization IV and V. One of the most notable is that wars are plausible again as you dont constantly lose health in enemy territory and cities are easier to conquer. Additionally, culture doesn't automatically take over neighbor's cities anymore. \n\nThis game is easily worth the money. I'm not entirely sure how it stacks up to Civilization VI, but any game that I log 200+ hours on over a period of years and still haven't come close to doing everything is doing something right. A great game from a great series.",

      "*puts on hipster cap* Well I have played this before, and let me tell you it is quite the experience.\n\nYume Nikki is a bare-bones surreal game created with RPGMaker. You play as a young girl (Madotsuki, according to the fandom) who refuses to step outside of her bedroom. Besides the dreadfully boring video games in her room, all she can do to entertain herself is to sleep, entering into her dream world. The \"goal\" of the game is to explore her dreams, collecting the various effects and bringing them back to the main nexus.\n\nLittle is known about the creator, and even less is known about the game's story. Yume Nikki lives very much by the philosophy of \"Show, Don't Tell\". There is no dialogue, music is limited to short sound bytes on loop, and the graphics look like something out of the 16-bit era. Despite all of this, Yume Nikki still managed to gather an almost cult-like following; the amount of fan work and theories created for Yume Nikki is truly astounding.\n\nPlenty of games try to capture the beauty and wonder of our dreams, but the reality is they can also be ugly and painful experiences, dredging up our deepest subconscious fears and desires. Yume Nikki refuses to shy away from the dark and the strange, understanding that this what gives our dreams meaning. Like any abstract art piece, it is impossible to place a singular meaning on anything in Yume Nikki. Everyone will interpret and relate to its events differently, and perhaps this is the crux of what let Yume Nikki gather its cult following.\n\nIts greatest strength is also its greatest weakness. The complete lack of direction is not exactly user friendly. This game does not hold your hand. There is no map, so the only way to figure out where to go is to get hopelessly lost many times as you explore the strange worlds behind each nexus door. It will be tempting to simply look up a guide, and I must admit I was guilty of watching a play-through myself for some parts. Indeed, completing the game without looking anything up is an achievement in itself.  However, the game was meant to be played, not watched. The joy (and sometimes terror) of discovery makes the experience worth experiencing. After you've given the game a proper playing, THEN you should look up all the stuff you inevitably missed. Cough cough [spoiler]Uboa[/spoiler] cough cough.\n\nWith that in mind, I humbly offer some advice to make your experience a bit more palatable. Feel free to ignore this if you wish to remain completely spoiler-free.\n\n1) Know the controls! They are not explained very well in the game.\n\nArrow keys: Movement\nZ: Accept; interact with objects (also Enter, Spacebar)\nX: Cancel; open the game menu (also C, V, B, N, Insert)\n1: Use an effect’s ability\n3: Cancel an effect’s ability\n5: Drop an effect on the ground (only in the Nexus)\n9: Pinch yourself to wake up and return to the real world. This one is especially important to remember, as sometimes you may find yourself in a dead-end zone leaving this as your only means of escape.\n\n2) Each time you wake up, make sure to use the desk In the real world to save your progress.\n\n3) Be thorough. Many of the dream worlds are expansive, with few landmarks. However, many of them also warp at each end, meaning if you walk in a straight line you will eventually return to where you started. You can use this to your advantage while mapping out the more expansive zones. Take note of interesting landmarks that you can use for future exploration. It might be helpful to keep some scratch paper handy if you have a bad memory like me.\n\n4) Interact with everything. If you see anything that looks strange or out of place, give it a poke. There are few enemies in the game, and nothing can actually kill you. Sometimes that creepy object might be the ticket to transport you into a new area. Also, try using different effects in different situations. You may find they have useful properties.\n\n5) Search for the bicycle effect first, it will make exploration much easier as it greatly increases your movement speed. You can find the bike effect in [spoiler]the zone behind the right door at the bottom-most side of the nexus[/spoiler]. I will leave locating it to you.\n\n\nWell, what are you waiting for? Give this game a try, you have nothing to lose! Except, maybe your sanity. Eh, you didn't really need that anyway.",
      "Wylde Flowers is a magical farming simulation. The spoken dialogue is wonderful and touches on difficult subjects, such as grief, estrangement from family members, and gender identity. The characters are diverse, have complex personalities and are really funny.\n\nThis game could be considered as Stardew Valley's even gayer little sibling. On a more serious note, it can be friendlier than Stardew Valley for first time or younger gamers, because of its simplicity, tightly told storyline (it is not an \"endless game\" as Stardew can be) and guided playthrough.\n\nIn my opinion, the game could be improved on a few fronts: character customization is one of them, and the fact that Tara, the main character, wears the same dress-leather jacket-chelsea boots millenial outfit during all seasons (including to bed, while sleeping over the covers) icks me profoundly. \n\nFinally, the pace of the game is a bit confusing to me, in the sense that it can be difficult to balance the storytelling aspect of the game with the more concrete tasks.\n\nAltogether, Wylde Flowers is a beautifully conceived game, filled with positivity, magic, a good soundtrack, and charming visuals.\n\n\n",

The mix of Slay the Spire-style deck-building with elements of the ship combat from FTL: Faster Than Light is an absolutely fascinating mix, and the \"single-axis\" movement system adds a whole extra layer that I've never seen in anything except the Mega Man: Battle Network series.\n\nI bought the full game within the first hour of being available. After having played for nearly 4 hours at the time of writing, my opinion hasn't changed in the slightest. I already love what's available and so far I feel like I've barely scratched the surface.\n\nI can't wait to see what awaits in the future for this awesome title.\n\nEDIT: As a small addition, I will say: I beat my very first run, which is set to the lowest difficulty (Normal). I jumped up to Hard to try to unlock a new ship, and I haven't been able to beat a run since then. It's probably just that I'm bad, all things considered, but be aware that the changes made with difficulty increases are probably more impactful than they may seem.\n\nAlso I wanna say to the devs: thank you for launching the game with mod support and working on making it easier! But also please look into getting Steam Workshop support if you can!",

      "i would recomend it because the physics are great, the game has 8 or 9 level packs (i dont know if there will be a 9th because there are 7 at the time of this review) the units are diverse, there are a lot of secret units to find and i dont know for the final boss because the most expensive unit artimis isnt a good final boss like the dark pesant in the alphas but i hope that the games final boss unit is actually hard to kill and requires more than 7 archers because that wasnt hard or anything hopefully they will make the most expensive unit actually overpowered and unballanced because that would be a great final boss, the sandbox mode is great i like the custom campains , the custom units arent out yet so i cant say anything about that over all this game is worth the money and if its near a sale time like a few days away from a sale then get it on sale if not then just get it you wont regret it and if it lage turn off all the graphics settings",
      "It's responsive, quick and smooth, the Arrange and Matsuri modes are a treat, and it sounds/looks wonderful. Finally, a better shmup than Crimzon Clover is on Steam! Highly, highly recommended.",
      "To be honest, this game is a bit of an acquired taste. At first I didn't get it: Few options to customize your army, at the beginning of a battle every unit has its predetermined place on the map, there's an unforgiving time limit to reach your objectives and the graphics could be much better. The first encounters with an entrenched enemy ended in a bloodbath for my units, despite overall superiority in numbers and total command of the air. And when I learned that you don't necessarily keep your veteran units after a successful battle but sometimes have to start the next scenario with new ones, I came close to deleting the game.\n\nLuckily, I  didn't. Like any decent strategy-game, UOCII takes some time to learn. The game's mechanics and its reliance on logistics are the main differences to most others I've played. The first lesson: Your success depends heavily on understanding both your own and the enemy's supply network. Finding his vulnerable spots while protecting your own is elementary. Once you figured out where to strike and with which units, your chances improve dramatically. The AI is quite good and will help you find your own weak spots soon enough – a single forgotten enemy in your rear can easily stop the most impressive offensive, if it decides to block the one railway line supporting all your units and your HQ. +-To make things more interesting, the game relies on Headquarters, which you have to move around together with your regular units. These HQ can and must be improved over time to learn additional “skills” like bridge-building, special orders, emergency supply etc. During a battle, they must be kept within range of your units to be effective, giving the game a bit of an role-playing-aspect: One or several generals moving around, each commanding a part of your force, never too close to the firing line, all the while learning new skills and helping your units to do a limited number of special tricks. Nice flavour.\n\nI could write a lot more, but to sum it up: UOCII is a really rewarding strategy-game with some new and interesting features I haven't found anywhere else. It's not perfect – more options to customize or to place units would be welcome and the difficulty in some of the later DLCs is quite brutal -  but all in all it's very much worth its price. Still enjoy it after several years and look forward to the next DLC (Africa) :-)",
      "HOW?? WHY?? WHY IS THIS GAME SO GOOD?? IT HAS NO REASON TO BE THIS GOOD WTF?\nThe trailers or advertisements will not even give anything close to a sense on how good this story, build up, characters and mechanics (did I mention the story?) really is.\n\nShu Takumi and Yasumasa Kitagawa, you've done it again, from Ace Attorney to this. I can 100% say if you haven't played this game, you are definitely missing out.\n\n10/10!!!",
      "Upon further play, the game wasn't super luck based, it just doesn't do a great job explaining core mechanics that are crucial to gameplay. It has a more hands off, let the player discover how this works type of playstyle, but a simple line of dialogue alluding to these features would have been nice. That said, the story is really gripping, the gameplay (once learned) is fun, and overall, I definitely think it's worth $20.",
      "This game isn't for me, as it turned out it is too fast-paced for me to enjoy. But I really do want to recommend it. The game works fine, and the controls are solid, by that I mean you do feel in control, even though I only played a little I died a lot, but it never felt unfair. You get to do a lot of customization, and it is fun, but I just don't have the right temper for games where you die a lot. 7/10.",
      "I definitely would not recommend this. The aesthetic of it might appeal to some people, which is what initially drew me in, but the visual awe wears off after seeing the same scene too many times. The game is best played with paper and pencil in hand so that you waste as little time as possible wandering around in a straight line. \n\nThis game survives off of the mysterious nature of its content in the sense that if people knew how small the experience was, they would not buy it. I was thoroughly let down by this game, especially since its promotional material hyped me up for an exploration game with a unique method of interacting with the world. \n\nThe main feature that sets the game apart from other titles, the use of the telephone to access parts of the static world, becomes little more than a password screen used to pick up where you left off or were booted out of your game by a short time limit. After the first two or three times I used the game's core feature, I was tired of it and wished there was a way to play the game that was faster or had more depth.\n\nFor anyone who has played or seen any amount of gameplay from Yume Nikki, you will realise that this game's design begs the audience to compare the two. However, the most useful comparison to draw between the two is by using the game that Madotsuki can play in her room as an example. In Madotsuki's game, \"Nasu,\" is a joyless game about catching fruit. It is repetitive, intentionally annoying, has no bearing on your progression/success, and is meant to urge you toward doing something else. Unfortunately, this is a suitable comparison, as it succeeded in making me feel like Madotsuki in real life and I want to turn off the game and do almost anything else in record time.\n\nI truly wanted to like this game, but I cannot justify spending $5 for this experience when I played better flash games all the way back in middle school for free.",

I once engaged in a conversation with a developer at SI about FM, and football in general. After some talking about premier league, and me slightly confused, I eventually understood that this developer thought that Tottenham Hotspurs were located in Liverpool. So I posed him the following question: \"Then why do they call any matches between Tottenham and Arsenal the 'North London Derby'?\" to which he responded that he did not know, but he assured me that Tottenham F.C was located in Liverpool. I had to resort to showing him the borough of Tottenham in London for him to understand that Tottenham Hotspurs is not lovated in Liverpool, but in fact in London.\n\nThis will be the last edition of this game series I will ever purchase. In a football management simulator such as this, letting SI and their employees (including the one that responded to this review) tell you various aspects of football, is like having a pervert preach to you about the virtues of sexual absitence. They know nothing, and since the core game has not progressed the slightest in 10 years, it would be a fair assumption that they do not care neither.\n\nFuck SI, Fuck their beloved \"devs\" and fuck Charlton Heston while you're at it.",

      "Stress: The videogame.\n\nBut in all seriousness, Isaac is an awesome roguelike game with infinite replayability. It's tough at first but as you get better at the game you will appreciate it more and more for the unique experience it provides. Every run feels different and even after getting close to 2k hours of playtime I still discover new things.\n\nAll DLC, and especially the latest of them - Repentance - introduce a ton of new content on top of the already existing one.\nThere are 34 characters in total, over 600 steam achievements and 3 save files to choose from.\n\nOn top of that, the game features a community workshop with countless great mods that add Quality of Life improvements and new features for every taste.\n\nIf you enjoy roguelikes or are looking for a game with great replay value then I can wholeheartedly recommend Isaac to you.",

      "The game is a masterpiece, just like the first one. After finishing PoE 1, I immediately started with the second one and I was treated to another marvel of a game. Here are some of my thoughts:\n\nThe Good:\n-Very good main story but the side content is what made this game great\n-Interesting and deep characters, both new ones and some returning from the first game, including companions\n-The story picks up after the events of the first game and is a direct continuation of the first game (just like with Baldur’s Gate 1 and 2)\n-If you still have the savegame-files from the first game, your decisions and consequences from the first game will carry over\n-There is so much lore, if you are into reading and listening to stories\n-A lot of voice-acting\n-A lot of pets you can collect and the equipped one has a small benefit to your party\n-Interesting races and sub-races, each with its own boons and downsides\n-Interesting classes and sub-classes, including the possibility of multi-classes\n-You can retrain your characters\n-You can make a new character to join your party at any time at tavern\n-Item and weapon diversity (including pistols)\n-You have the option to play the game as either turn-based (like divinity original sin) or real time (with game pause, just like Baldur’s Gate)\n-You can sail the seas as a pirate and attack any ship you meet without consequence. The ships on the map will respawn endlessly so you will never run out, which makes them a real great source of income.\n-Besides the ship you are given at the beginning, there are a few others you can buy. Each has its own benefits\n-Ship, crew and sailing require some management, but if you like this sort of stuff you can get real invested in it \n-Exploring the map by ship, if you are into that kind of stuff\n-When engaging other ships, you have a choice between boarding or naval combat\n-Endurance is no longer a thing so you only need to manage your Health during fights. You will like this if you were not a big fan of the Endurance vs Health system from the first game\n-The resting system has improved. Besides taverns, now you can rest anywhere you want as long as you have food\n-No inventory management is necessary. Your inventory is infinite so just pick everything up because sooner or later you might need things like explosives, potions, tools etc.\n-Choice matters, and boy are there a lot of different paths you can choose from\n-Romance options\n-Bounties are fun and offer good experience and money\n-DLCs are a bit shorter than the one from the first game, but they are just as good (will not describe them to avoid spoilers)\n\nThe Bad:\n-Loading screens are too long and too many\n-Just like in the first game, I reached max level at about 2/3 of the game(max level 20) so any experience gathered beyond that was pointless. By the end of the game could have easily reached level 30 if that was a thing\n-Naval combat is scripted, so it might not be as spectacular as you might imagine\n-Exploring islands on foot isn’t so much fun\n-The idea of factions might not be to everyone’s liking\n-After playing for a few hours, the game performance seems to decrease and my pc struggled with running it. Maybe the game has an optimization problem but it’s possibly that this one is on me and the game is fine. This might not be the case for other users.\n\nAdvice:\n-In the beginning of the game, try to reach Neketaka asap and do as many quests there as you can before heading out on your ship exploring the seas\n-Pick everything up. Your inventory space is infinite and you will end up needing diverse items like explosives, traps, tools etc.\n-Always have tools with you: hammer and chisel, prybar, lockpicks, grappling hook. You will really need them from time to time\n-Plundering other ships is a great source of experience, resources and money but be careful not to burn yourself out if you do it for too long\n-If you get stuck on a quest, just do some online research\n-Invest money in your ship and crew as soon as you can\n-Always have a tank and healer in the party\n-Make sure to diversify the skills of your party. It’s always good to have someone with Mechanics, Religion, Athletics or Diplomacy most of all\n-Enchant your items\n-When you get the white/grey colored legendary items, make sure to bind them to the character you equip them on and do the mini-quests inscribed on them to unlock new powers and features\n-Use summons, as they are great for distracting enemies. They can take a lot of hits and also dish it out\n\nMy game experience:\nI played on the classic (normal) difficulty, just like I do with every new game I start, and found the game not very hard but fun. I played the game in real time, because turn-based takes too long. As soon as I got my first ship working, I sailed to Neketaka, found the last companions I knew I wanted on my permanent team (Maia and Pallegina) and just quested away in the city until I had enough money and levels under my belt to start exploring the seas and attack other ships. I never did the scripted naval combat because I was having too much fun boarding the ships and watch my characters fight. My party consisted of my Watcher (Moon Godlike, Chanter, specced in summoning), Eder (because he’s a beast of a tank and has some fun interactions with others), Xoti (gotta have a healer, she’s also fun to have around), Maia Rua (very good ranged DPS and she comes with a pet cause she’s a ranger) and Pallegina, who is an excellent off-tank and support character. Once I took to the seas, I made my fortune by plundering ships, equipped my ship and characters with the best money could buy and then just catered to the different existing factions in the Deadfire, while not loosing sight of my main mission.\n\nI had a great time playing Pillars of Eternity 1 and 2. I consider they offer some great replay value and are great fun if you are into this style of RPG games. If you are a fan of games like the Baldur’s Gate, Icewind Dale, Diablo, Dragon Age, Neverwinter Nights and Divinity Original Sin series, you must try PoE 1 and 2.\nI really hope they make Pillars of Eternity 3.\n",
      "Visually-speaking, this is possibly the highest quality otome I've ever played. Characters blink, their mouths move when they speak, and even backgrounds have some animated aspects, such as water movement, crackling fires and other neat little touches. The art is top-notch and, in my opinion, the game's strongest point.\n\nAnother aspect that makes Bustafellows a standout is the heroine. Teuta has much more presence than a lot of other protagonists in the genre because she has a face, voice and strong personality. She's her own character and not one of those 'we're going to make MC as bland as humanly possible for self-insertion purposes' heroines, which I very much appreciated.\n\nThe Steam version is a bit clunky compared to the console release, and at times it suffered from some pacing issues, but all the characters and their interactions were enjoyable. The main story was great; I really loved the group dynamic they established in the common route, and while Shu and Crow were definitely my favorites, there was nobody I really disliked as a love interest. They each had an interesting story behind them and unique dynamic with Teuta.\n\nThe final stories that attempt to wrap everything up were the only part of the game that just really didn't do it for me. I can't go into much detail without spoilers, but the best I can describe it is everything comes at you too fast, parts of it felt out of nowhere, and for me it was a downer. Not awful enough to ruin the game, and some of the ideas were good, but I feel like they were executed poorly.\n\nAll in all, Bustafellows is one of the better otome games out there. It's not perfect, but its strengths shine brighter than its flaws, and I'm dearly hoping Bustafelllows Season 2 gets localized so I can see more of its wonderful art and characters.",
      "[h1]SMOOTH RIDING WITH A FEW BUMPY ROADS[/h1]\n\nFirst off, I am going to get this out of the way. If you are planning to buy this game and wondering which version to get, ask yourself this. If you are a minimalist, standard is fine. If you want the expansions, get ultimate. Deluxe on the other hand I think is worth skipping entirely. If $99.99 is too much for you for Ultimate, just wait for a sale. Ultimate is definitely my choice for recommendation. The amount of content you get is impressive and worth the price of admission. \n\nForza Horizon 4 is a car collector's dream, with a roster of over 700 cars (with Ultimate). And also a racing enthusiasts dream playground with a decently sized map with tons of racing variety and events to play around with. I have tons of racing games on Steam personally, and none have held my interest as much as Forza Horizon 4. It's a shame though that this came so late to Steam. But even still, I got my money's worth with over 120 hours of playtime at the time of writing this. \n\nIs Forza Horizon 4 perfect though? Sadly, it is not. The Steam version is hampered with some unfortunate bugs. People may experience random crashes, which while not happening often after the last few updates, still do happen, as this game is a few versions behind the Microsoft store's own version. Something I don't know if will ever be fully fixed. Also online racing can be hit or miss with issues. Those issues usually lie in the wait times sadly, so it might be offputting for those looking to race with others. Luckily there is more than enough content without having to do online races to keep most people happy. \n\n I'm still giving this a recommend regardless of that issue, just because more often than not, the game does run smoothly. \n\nIf you happen to just get the standard version of the game you get access to the main map which is a caricatured version of Great Britain, which includes many race events ranging from your standard street races, dirt tracks and even full blown off road events. There are also other events which include speed traps, drifting, massive jumps, promotional events (like racing the Halo Warthog, racing against trains, and more), and some cool little story events like racing for Top Gear, or even opening your own businesses. There's plenty of content for sure. If you decide to get the expansions, you get other maps, including Fortune Island, which is, well, an Island, complete with both low and high altitude locations, lots of off roading, some impressive night time visuals (Aurora Borealis anyone?), and more. You also get the Lego Speed Champions map which is a fun and impressively designed map based on the Lego toys which features it's own variety of fun and unique settings, including a beach riddled with pirate ships, a haunted lighthouse, a stunt arena, and more. Also it gets it's own radio station that plays just 1 song on loop. If you guessed that song is \"Everything is Awesome\", you'd be right, Both expansions also come with a unique way of progression and their own vehicles to collect. Fortune Island will have you progress to unlock a variety of treasure hunts, that each unlock 1 million credits, and the Lego expansion has you doing different tasks to collect studs which can be used to build your house and also collect new cars. Both expansions will also include a majority of the types of events you will be used to in the base game, with their own unique flair. \n\nWith 700 cars luckily there is enough variety for anyone. But for those looking for more, you can custom tune each vehicle to your own liking, with a variety of parts and overhauls, including full blown engine swaps. For those who are not gear heads, the community has you covered and you can even download custom tunes from others. Forza Horizon 4 is one of the most generous racing games I have ever played with the sheer amount of cars they dump on you. You can win cars from events. You can win cars from wheelspins. you can win cars from leveling up. You can win cars from performing certain tasks. You can win cars from barn finds, which are like little treasure hunts. You can also buy cars from both an auto show, or take your chances at an in game auction house, which is also a great way to make money, to well, buy more cars. Basically, Horizon does not let you down with the cars. It's like Pokemon for car lovers. And once you have that dream car, don't forget to give it that unique look. Most cars can have some visual parts swapped out, ranging from spoilers to bumpers and more, and you can add custom designs to the paint jobs too. Want to race around in Jurassic Park Jeep? Want to race around in the Bandit 1 from Smokey and the Bandit? Forza has you covered. And if you just want to look at the cars in all their glory, Forza also has a nice little feature called Forzavista which allows to do things with your car like opening and closing doors, and for some vehicles you can open up trunks and hoods and look inside at the engines. If you get the James Bond pack, you can even look at those nifty little gadgets like the machine guns mounted to some of the Bond vehicles. Pretty neat stuff. \n\nAt the end of the day, is Forza Horizon 4 worth it? I'd say yes.",
      "Know your History: \n\nMany of you will already know this, but this game has ties much deeper than you think. It's no secret that Bethesda's Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim had extended it's life through an extensive modding community. For decades, literally, ENBs, shaders, textures, companions, and even story-lines added THOUSANDS of hours to an already sizable game. One story-line mod was called \"The Forgotten City\".  Over the next few years since it's release, the mod had acquired awards such as the 2016 Australian Writers' Guild Award, Zero Period Top 5 Quest Mods of 2015, and others. It was an astounding mod that threw the dragon born into a deeply profound, well written, and engaging story. It was a staple for my personal mod list for years. I've played the Skyrim version countless times, but as soon as I saw this release I immediately bought this and booted it up. \nObviously this is nothing like the mod, both visually or engine wise, but the spirit of the game is still there. It's more defined, expanded, and developed. It deserves every award and accolade it's received. When I walked into the opening scene and fell down the tunnel I couldn't help but shake my head and smile as a wave of nostalgia mixed with new expectations flooded my mind:\n\n\"My god, they've done it.\" \n\nHere's to you, Modern Storyteller, all the best and more to come!",

      "The story of this game is interesting and well written, but it doesn't fully make up for the game's flaws. Here are the problems I saw with the game.\n\n1. There are a wide variety of guns available, but very few combinations of those guns are viable. The shotguns are rarely viable for combat with gun wielding enemies, since advancing far enough forward to make shotgun damage effective inevitably puts you in the line of fire of enough of your enemies to prove lethal. Other weapons like sniper rifles and pistols have critically low DPS and a low maximum ammo cap, making them almost universally not viable. Additionally this game likes to spring ambushes on the player in a way that takes away any advantage gained from long range optics. The special pneumatic weapons in the game also suffer from a low ammo cap. This leaves you with assault rifles, which the game seems to have been made for.\n\n2. In encounters with bestial enemies it is frequently impossible to avoid taking damage. The enemies sprint at you in packs which even sustained automatic shotgun fire cannot fully stop. Some of the boss enemies are even worse in this department. In normal mode with the larger health pool and regeneration over time this wouldn't be such a problem. But in ranger mode this makes certain obstacles unbeatable. You might have a boss which takes your entire ammo pool from both guns to kill, and which gets a guaranteed hit on you once every thirty seconds. If you go into that boss fight hurt and with no healing items, then you'll be met with mathematically guaranteed failure. The simple fix for this is to give the player a dodge function to avoid taking an instance of damage.\n\n3. This story has a few decisions to make, but mostly it is on rails. This isn't always a problem in a game, but it is when your character gets repeatedly taken unawares by things you as the player have already figured out. You as the player may sense that Artyom is being tricked, is about to be ambushed, or is going to let the bad guy get away through poor decision making. You just have to frustratedly walk into the cut scene and let it happen anyways. Its fine for this to happen at least once. But by the fourth or fifth instance it becomes infuriating to play as the character who just gets tricked and captured all the time.",

      "Something I've been needing to get off my chest, despite how much maxis and EA go on about how much they care for the LGBTQ community, it's clear to me that they don't. First if they did they wouldn't be pushing the community the whey and as hard as they have. When things get pushed like they are, hateful people just harden there harts more, and just become infuriated. The sympathetic the become hatful towards it. The more something gets pushed, after awhile the more it gets hatted. A better approach would be, (if they really did care,) would be to put what they are talking about into a FREE pack, and get people whom make amazing custom content to contribute to it. If there is enough nice stuff in the pack people will download it, and talk people whom are on the fence to download it, and maybe to come over, and might start to get the people on the other side to at least get on the fence. That whey the LGBTQ community would get there representation, and acceptance would be pushed in a whey that won't burn people out.\n\n\nAnother resin why they should do it like this, and is part of why people are getting mad, is that they bought this game a certain whey, paid a lot for it and it's DLC, now they are changing, it and braking it to do so. Changing the experience against there will. Evan something you love like chocolate, or bacon, or anything will become something you hate if it's shoved down your throat ageist you will. If you want people to take it just offer it, most of the time people will take it. And if they don't just make it just make it more appealing. IE instead of braking the main game to add something even the LGBTQ community can't enjoy with a broken game. Make a free pack, and to tempt more people to get the pack, just add more nice CAS and build mode stuff. And maybe update the pack and add more stuff to it every once in awhile.\n\n\nI just had to say this for two resins, one companies being this careless or ignorant is just killing the public sentiment for LGBTQ and similar groups. And two, they are just killing interest in what they are selling, it will cut the Sims 4's life short, and will cut the Sims 5's life much, much sorter. \nIt's good to give options, as long as they are options. Or you are just like Hennery Ford, “The people can have the model T in any color! so long as it's black.”\n",
      "It's more of a mixed recommendation but the positives outweigh the negatives if you're a returning fan.\n\nEverything in the game that's an adaptation of the original FF7, I love.  It gave me major nostalgia vibes to walk through a gorgeously rendered versions of FF7's environments.  The combat is much more engaging - no more watching a tv show on the side while I button-mash another random encounter.  Many of the big story moments still hit and I found even more to love in the characters based on their performances going beyond text boxes and blocky animations.  Even the music is just top-notch.  The OST will be a mainstay in my playlist for years.  It feels like I'm seeing the old game with fresh eyes and remembering why it made such an impact.\n\nThat said, the new content feels like a filler arc in a beloved anime.  Your character falls into a random hole like 3-4 times, spends 2 hours fighting random baddies, and then walks out like \"right, so back to that thing I was doing.\"  I don't even know if a new player could understand wtf is happening with Sephiroth because he's never really introduced and certain essential events are never explained.  It tries to take some clever left-turns on the plot so returning players have new surprises to enjoy but it often feels pretentious and pointless.  The ending gave me flashbacks to Peter Jackson's Hobbit trilogy because of how unnecessarily forced it was and the sudden cartoon levels of action.\n\nI'm tentatively enthusiastic for the sequel but there's a few troubling signs I hope don't become a trend.",
      "Not For Broadcast is a good game... but it has some issues.\n\nThe story is really captivating; though the game does switch between humour and a serious story quite often, both are excellently done. Advance (the political party who ends up getting into power and becomes authoritarian) actually only gets into power in the first part of the game (the tutorial broadcast). You actually get to see the descent into authoritarianism and dystopia, which basically no other game (at least, any game I've ever played) has actually done, and not really any other forms of media either. You also get to influence some events in game [spoiler](for example, one of the ads you can play is an advertisement for a children's toy, and later there is an... incident... involving the toy, and (if you played the ad), the presenters of National Nightly News (Jeremy and Megan) state in a segment regarding the incident that they should never have advertised the toy.[/spoiler] It's a really minor thing, because you can just choose [i]not[/i] to play the ad, but I really love that detail), and having a noticeable impact on anything is really enjoyable.\n\nThe gameplay is mostly good. You basically just have to be on your toes, switching to different cameras every now and again, being ready to censor things, and being ready to go to the adverts. All basic tasks, but since you're doing most of them together, it relies on you being attentive and reactive. The only part of the gameplay I would criticize is the signal interference section. It's easy, and doesn't even really distract you, as you just have to move a slider up and down with a slight bit of delay. It's just not a fun part of the game.\n\nMy biggest gripe with the game has to be the lag; something which I know I'm not alone in experiencing. Online, it suggests closing down performance heavy tasks, such as web browsers, but I know for a fact that I had a few webpages up when I was playing the free prologue (the first broadcast, which gives a pretty good idea of what the game is), and experienced no issues at all. I really don't know what the coding differences between the paid version and the prologue of the game are, but that doesn't seem like it should be a difference. Generally the lag was irritating, but not something that hinders you in any way, but there is one level where you're advised to switch screens because naked protesters may pop up to protest Advance's policies. Visual lag, in this case, really isn't good. I also just got a windows pop up saying that the game was frozen, and so I had to close it down... not great.\n\nOverall; the gameplay is good, with really the exception of the interference task, and the story is excellent, but the technical issues are just... really, really irritating. I would recommend the game, but I would warn you that the technical issues do end up being quite irritating.\n\nOverall; the game is good, but the technical issues can be annoying.",

      "I am generally not a big fan of card games, because luck is most often the deciding factor in them, and so it is also here. But there are many solid mechanics that lessen the randomness and make it enjoyable. You can plan builds and be tactical with your card purchases, so you get a strong deck that can beat the boss. \n\nOf course it is also a rougelike, you will die. But that's part of it, you can have a strategy and get better with every run. It is also addicting in a good way. There are no in game purchases, or other such garbage that is common in so many other card games.\n\nThis is one of the best games that went through Early Access, and the developers made good updates, introducing two new characters with new cards and gameplay mechanics and also further balancing the game. They are currently working on a fourth character. They also interact really well with the players, featuring artwork and being active in the discussions.\n\nThere is much to love with this game, I saw myself coming back time and time again. \nI recommend it for everyone =)",
      "This game is for sure not perfect, but worth buying for a specific type of gamer.\n\n[b]What is good in this game?[/b]\n- It has a pretty solid gun gameplay. The movement is quick and polished as well.\n- One level is on average 20 seconds. It's fun to improve your gameplay to get better times in the small levels. \n- It's really a blast getting a perfect run, killing enemies in bullet time or exploiting the enemies weakspots.\n- There is content for around 10-15 hours. Maybe more if you consider going for 100%.\n\n[b]Anyway there are also some flaws: [/b]\n- In Neon White or Ghostrunner the movement and pace through the levels often feels like a perfect choreographic \"dance\"\n- The levels and the areas in Warstride are verry tight. I often lost pace through \"stupid\" placed rocks or small doors.\n- There is not much to explore. The levels are verry linear. While in Neon White it was so much fun to explore shortcuts or other hidden possibilities to improve ur time there are no such mechanics in Warstride at all. I'd love to have some exploration at least in the \"long levels\".\n- It could get repetitive for some players as it's a core element to complete the levels on 5 different difficulties. \n\n[b]Conclusion: [/b]\nIf you like fast paced games like Ghostrunner, Neon White or Doom and you have no problem in repeating short levels several times and u don't except an extraordinary game u will have fun for several hours on a low price.\n",
      "[h1][b]★★★★☆[/b][/h1]\nSuper Time Force Ultra (STFU...) hits all the stereotypical tropes of an indie game. Fourth wall breaking humor, bright pastel colors, a synth soundtrack and of course retro graphics. Granted, this game came out in 2014, but today, frequent gamers might be sick of this. Despite that, the game certainly is still worth checking out. Behind the bad, immature humor lies a very apparant, unique and interesting game mechanic: the ability to rewind time and to run next to your former self.\n\nThe humor really turned me off the first time I booted this game up. It's too much in your face and it tries really hard to be funny. On top of that, it also tends to be really profane. There is a character that you can control that literally is a turd that has an ability to fart. One of the levels takes place within a sewer where you have to fight poop and ride it down pipes. Humor like this makes it feel like you're playing a game made by a 13 year old.\n\nThe gameplay, on ther other hand, is suprisingly refreshing and fun. Not only can you rewind time, you will also see your former selves run next to you and do the same damage as before. The whole game is build around this 'cloning' mechanic, as levels have to be finished within a certain time limit that can only be beaten with cooperation with yourself. For example, it can take forever to take a boss out by yourself, but by rewinding (to any moment you like) you can use more firepower to kill the boss faster. As you can imagine, this can create scenes where you fight of enemies along [i]many[/i] other characters you have controlled. It's the good kind of chaotic, as it never feels random to what happens in the game. My only real problem with it are the controls that don't always seem to registrate well. For instance, when you run of a slope, your character tend to be in the air just a couple of pixels high, which means it cannot jump. I ran off so many platforms because of this, but it is not a severe problem.\n\nThe game is not particulairy hard. You can rewind lots of times and by doing so, the level gets easier and easier. The dev also included a kind of trial mode, aside from the diverse story levels. Some of these levels are a little annoying, but ultimately I had fun with it in short sessions. The achievements are also not hard to unlock. It mostly involves collecting orbs and characters.\n\nFor the standard 13 bucks, this is not a bad deal! That is, if you go for all the achievements. When it is on sale, I would say this is a safe buy.",
      "Okay so first and foremost the reason why I'm giving this a thumbs up is simple. The game does what it set out to do perfectly. Because of that I have no complaints about it's style.\n\nHOWEVER.\n\nI personally do not like the game. It is my own personal hangup. But I can understand why other people will enjoy it.\n\nThe game is fast paced, level by level FPS with challenges. Almost every single one of them is timed if not all of them are timed. It's similar to Doom or Killing Floor. Only there are no cusomizations implemented at time of play. \n\nThe game is challenging and offers you many different faucets on those challenges. It has different gun types for different enemies, different strategies and all of them complicated and challenging. But that's the point right?\n\nRegardless, the game was pretty fun and if you're looking for a level by level challenge system set to a similar style of Doom then you might just enjoy this game.\n\nIf this wasn't enough for you then please check out the video on my YouTube Channel for a more precise in depth explanation (link below).\n\nThanks for reading and I hope I helped some of you out there to spend your money wisely.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXiok7bhPdY",
      "Looks like a game for children, but underneath the friendliness there is a great challenge! Move on the rhythm of good songs on a note bar! \n\n[h2]Swim! Swim little tredpole!

Through various rivers and waters you journey, and eventually save your pond from a disaster that will occur. \nEverything in the river translates to an instrument tone and respects the height on the note bar.

      "Absolutely Don't understand all the negative reviews for this game. \n\nFirst off: this game is a RogueLite in that death is permanent, be prepared for this. Death is a part of the game and you are NOT losing progress by dying.. it's death mechanic is very much like Rogue Legacy in that you keep progress that carries on to your next character when you begin again. Dying also isn't like you lost more than 45 minutes of your time. Every single game in this genre will have plenty of deaths involved before you FINALLY get that first win (in most cases). Some people are going to need to spend some time grinding levels, dying and repeat until they have enough sticker slots open to overpower things. Keep that in mind going into it. You retain your level and any big upgrades you acquire when you die so you are NOT starting from scratch every single time like you would in most rogue likes. \n\nI normally wouldn't review a game so early but I saw the negative reviews pouring in and felt I needed to add some counters to it. \n\nThe second thing: the art/music/atmosphere is absolutely brilliant for a game in this genre where most games of this nature tend to be relatively grim. As with most roguelike/lites its procedurally generated so the map, enemies and what have you will be different each time. \n\nThird: the forced timer before you have to fight the boss is a bit jarring at first as i've never played a game of this type where I have limited time to actually get there.. but it's kind of brilliant really because it adds a completely different layer to the game in that you have to manage your time very well. What do you think you have time to do before the inevitable? Do you want to run around and grind exp killing trash mobs? Or do you think that time could be better spent knocking some dungeons out (time halts when in dungeons so take your time in these) and getting some gear and arguably more exp than you would just wandering the map. Also, you absolutely have plenty of time to explore the map as there are shrines (you have to find them but the map isn't huge), that you can pay a special currency to add another day of time to the clock. If you see a review complaining about the timer and they have less than an hour in the game... take that with a grain of salt. \n\nFour: The combat is pretty simple but well done. There is a surprising amount of depth to it as well when you start buying and finding more powerful weapons (toys) that can do a variety of things and synergize pretty well together. Enemy variety is pretty good so far, each time you level up it adds more enemy variety to encounter around the map. \n\nFive: dungeons are fairly simple and a good mix of mini puzzles and fun combat encounters. \n\nIf you enjoy roguelike/lite games DEFINITELY give this a spot in your library to see what it has to offer. So far I'd put it 8-9/10 but I don't quite have the amount of time necessary to feel comfortable ranking it against other rogue games. I may edit this once I get to a point to see how much replayability it has but until then I'm eager to keep sending swords into a meat grinder and just adding to my power each time. Please look at how much time people have in a game before rating their reviews and taking their word. .5 hours is not enough time to really warrant a helpful review... nor is 6 in my case but I really don't want this game to be DoA\n\nEdit: Just beat Mormo for the second time.. trust me when i say you can make the timer go on infinitely. I Don't want to spoil anything BUT head to dungeons and kill as many enemies as you can to save up gold and another currency, and make a good loop around each area of the map and you'll find all sorts of neat things. As for bugs, I've had none and I'm at 13 hours of steady play. Don't waste time killing EVERY enemy that's in the open areas cause that will eat too much of your time, but focus on finding dungeons and the hidden npc encounters. I had my timer extended to approx. 8 days in game time and I also found a way to permanently increase the amount of time I have on subsequent runs. Give it a chance, learn how the game works before being upset about the timer.",
      "It is a total eyegasm with a captivating story/lore. If you're even a tiny bit interested in anything f*cked-up and mysterious (SCP-like), buy this.\n\nFrom the gameplay perspective, it is simply good. Nothing mind-blowing, but good nonetheless.\n\nI've completed the game with a couple of sidequests (there are more for me) in about 13 hours, and there are two story DLC + the Expeditions mode, so I anticipate at least another 10+ hours of gameplay. Which is great for the price.\n\nUpdate: I've put in ~10 more hours to complete the Foundation DLC. It is a good DLC, and brings a few more hours of joy living in this world. It also has some sick areas (like that dark cave with the TV). The overall design is a bit more dull, but I enjoyed the story.",
      "I got this game on a whim because I once played this series like... a decade ago. DW3/4 to be specific. And even though I know full well that this sort of game is basically meant for consoles, I managed to play it just fine once I adjusted the key bindings to stuff that worked well for me. Anyway... game.\n\nIf, like me, you have played these games before, you pretty much know what you are in for. If you have never played any of these games, I'm not quite sure what else is quite like it. Basically it's a fighting game, except it is on large battlefield maps where you murder thousands of random and a handful of named NPC's while following objectives in order to complete each level. If that sounds repetitive... well it can certainly be that. It's the ultimate hack and slash-fest game, and if you get bored with murdering insane numbers of enemies, then chances are this game is not for you.\n\nThe game is based upon the Three Kingdoms era of Ancient China (184-280, roughly), and, despite the absurd outfits and personalities of many of the characters in the game, it is actually fairly consistent with what is known about the period. Or rather, it is consistent with the famous novel 'Romance of the Three Kingdoms' by Luo Guanzhong, which is basically a work of historical fiction that takes real events and bends them a bit according to the whims and views of the author. Which, of course, means that certain characters (particularly Shu-Han characters like Xuande/Liu Bei) are depicted as noble honorable sorts fighting for justice while others (like Mengde/Cao Cao) are depicted as villanous and driven by ambition. I don't want to dig too deep into this because there most likely are entire books written about how Luo Guanzhong messed around with the characters, but the depictions he made are pretty much what are found in this and all previous DW games. The nice thing though is that if you read between the lines (or maybe it's just because I am very familiar with the source material this game is based off of), you can see the flaws in the author's bias in the game as well. Namely that Liu Bei was a massive hypocrite every bit as ambitious as his rivals, and that Cao Cao, while not exactly the nicest guy around, wasn't the hellspawn other characters (like Liu Bei) called him.\n\nAnyway, the game follows the story decently well, though some creative license and trimming down obviously has happened. I still liked how the game depicted things most of the time. Perhaps my favorite was Lu Bu's campaign which, while maintaining the massive \"OMG ITS LU BU\" hype that all DW games have had, reveals exactly why the real Lu Bu got himself executed in chapter 19 of a 120 chapter book: that he was dumb as a brick, betrayed people constantly, and never listened to anyone's advice. While the old DW games I played did have storylines for him, they didn't take the historical route that this game's (default) story path takes. The same goes for the numerous character deaths shown, though many of these are made more dramatic than they actually were.\n\nAlso, while the playable character cast has increased to the point of total insanity (including some that may not have even existed or actually fought on battlefields), I did like that, in the time between DW4 and this, they added a number of characters that rounded out the cast further by including some of the other lesser-known strategists (Chen Gong, Lu Su) and characters who rose to prominence in the later parts of the story (Deng Ai, the sons of Guan Yu/Zhang Fei, as well as the entire Jin faction who were the ultimate winners of this whole mess). I thought that was a nice treat since these sorts had been badly neglected in past games, where everything seemed to stop at the year 234 (when Kongming/Zhuge Liang died), which was roughly the chronological halfway point of the entire story.\n\nOk, I better stop and just finish this up.\n\nIn short, It's a DW game. That means that on the one hand, the combat gets repetitive, many of the characters are very hard to take seriously, and many of the story events are overdramatized to the point of being kind of ridiculous. On the other hand, there is a MASSIVE amount of content (and all those DLC's for this \"Complete Edition\" are purely cosmetic), big battles are kind of fun, and one can even argue that the storyline's inherent cheesiness may actually be more a positive than a negative.\n\nIf you have never played one of these games before, this is the one i'd look at because (to my knowledge) it's the newest one and has an insane amount of content even compared to its predecessors. If you have played these and liked them before... why not? If you didn't like these games however, then most likely this will do nothing to change your opinion.\n\nFor all it's goofiness and repetition, DW is still entertaining enough for me to waste sizeable amounts of time with it. Hooray and stuff.",
      "Very fun game if you are looking for a cozy relaxing farming sim. if you had a hard time with the fishing mechanic in stardew valley then you will have an easier time with this game, ontop of that there are lots of cute little rhythm games to play and the animal raising is alot more in depth then stardew. just a little note of warning to new players, the game doesn't make this very clear but you shouldn't spend too much time gardening in your first year. Automatic watering systems aren't available until later on and if you are like me you will think making the biggest profit possible year one is a great idea but I accidentally ended up upgrading/unlocking everything except irrigation in my first year and now do not have much to spend my currency on. Other then finishing catching every fish, maybe decorating my farm/the village and getting the rare coloured animals theres not much else to do in the game for late game content. It feels like there is the intention of possibly adding more content later on? either way if you decide to play, for your first play through I really recommend exploring first and getting to know the villagers before you start large scale farming.",
      "Have you ever asked yourself, \"Man, why doesn't someone make a cooperative fantasy RPG with all the nifty RPG-ism's that I love, like skills and talents and crafting and that I can play at my own pace with my friend and we can decide how we complete quests and treat people in the world and if we disagree then there was a mechanic in place that supported that and NPC characters we could hire and have join our adventures and instead of mindlessly blasting through hundreds of monsters like every other action RPG out there, we could fight in some nail-biting tactical, turn-based combat with spells and abilities that would affect the environment and turn the tide of the battle and the whole thing is wrapped up in a fantastic looking package with great looking characters and animations and some genuinely good and at times humorous writing?\"\n\nGuess what? It's your lucky day.",
      "[h1]He did it again[/h1]\n\nI don't know how this guy does it but he nailed it again. Maybe it's not as good as To the Moon but it's still very good.\n\nFinding Paradise plays very similarly to To the Moon. You basically walk around collecting a person's memories and going through his life. You experience every important step and decision in his life. The purpose of that is to grant dying man a last wish and make him happy. But something unexpected happens as always and you start figuring out what is happening.\n\nThe story again is very good and hits you right in the feels. There's some mystery and new gameplay mechanics. Now we have a small mini-game each time we unlock a memory. It's not hard so it won't distract you from the story.\nThe whole story is funny and sad at the same time. There are lots of well written dialogues.\nI didn't like the ending sequence, i thought it was tedious and almost broke the enjoyment. Please don't do that in the next game, leave it as it should be.\n\nAnother thing i dislike is graphics engine. I don't like this pixelated retro graphics. It's ugly. But what i don't like even more is not being able to adjust the resolution. It's 2019 (ok the game was released in 2017) how a game released in that year doesn't have resolution options? No, just no. I won't accept that and i don't think there's any justification for that. Just stop with this retro crap already. Running the game in 280x200 or whatever the resolution doesn't make it cool.\n\nFortunately this game is all about the story and story is perfect and makes up for all the annoying things. This guy should make a movie or something.\n\nOh almost forgot. Music. Another outstanding aspect of this game. The guy's a genius.\n\nOverall a very good game if you want an amazing story. It's around 5 hours and that's in my opinion is enough to tell a great story.\n\n[b]Pros[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Amazing story\n[*]Amazing soundtrack\n[*]Great writing and character desing\n[/list]\n[b]Cons[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Retro style to the degree of nokia 3310 resolution\n[*]Ending sequence wasn't very fun\n[/list]\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/32930811-Kosmos%27s-Cosmic-reviews/?appid=704030][h1]Follow my curator page for more[/h1][/url]",
      "Update 09/10/16\nSo they have added 'last man standing' mode which is great. The only issue is now that the controls are too difficult. If they fix this issue it would be a really fun party game and worth porting to consoles.\n\nPros:\n-Good visuals\n-Fun power ups\n-Awesome 4 player local play\n-In general the game is very fun and I believe with a few tweaks the game would be great. If they had done an early access build it would probably have been a great game on full release but there are still a few things that I and the people I played with don't like.\n\nCons:\nNOW FIXED (THEY ADDED LAST MAN STANDING' MODE) -Scoring system *the scoring system is based on how many you kill, we all thought the game would be better if you had lives instead and had to stay alive, when we played this game it was a case of constant kamakaze and not caring because it doesn't matter if you die* REPEAT THIS HAS BEEN FIXED\n-Controls *this type of game obviously can't be played with keyboard and mouse so this is only reviewed using Xbox 360 controller and it still isn't perfect, none of us felt that  had full control of the vehicle*\n\nVerdict:\nFor now I will give it a thumbs up as if they allow you to select scoring system based on kills or based on deaths we would play this a lot. And I think they could easily improve the controls. I hope the devs don't just leave this game to rot as it is a great idea for a local co-op game",
      "this game is fire\n\nedit: actual review\n\na few weeks ago, i picked up dicey dungeons and that was a lot of fun; my first introduction to dice games\n\nafterwards, i saw some streamers playing slice and dice so i picked that up, and that was fun too - just not on steam unfortunately\n\nwell, this game is slay the spire + dice + cards. but what really sets it apart is the whole tug of war between corruption and purification. each character is very unique and i really can't recommend this enough, even with only just a few hours played.\n\ni just beat the game on difficulty 0 with the first character after playing the first 5 a few times.",
      "Launch controversy aside, what this game should have been called for the longest time is 'Early Access'. Around the time of the Beyond update is when I'd say would have been the true 'launch'. \n\nI didn't get this when it first came out, but even when I did it was a fragmented mess of a game. Now, finally, with the Beyond and Synthesis updates there's a solid game here that's almost (but not quite) like what Sean Murray promised way back at the beginning.\n\nPerformance on PC has dramatically improved with the switch over to the Vulkan API, and it finally supports Ultrawide and various other PC-specific options. The game itself provides a significant amount of variety, offering a combination of Elite-lite and 'Minecraft in Space' mechanics. There's plenty to see and do, and the exploration aspect is enjoyable - if a little bland. The planetary biomes and overall game could still do with further diversity, but there's plenty here to get to your teeth into.\n\nHello Games show no sign of slowing down their support for the game either, having just recently released a bizarre in-game music synthesizer of all things, and going by the evidence of their progress to date I can only see the game improving further as time moves on.\n\nEDIT - 24/09/2020 \"Origins\" Patch: well, you can ignore the previous comments about diversity being a bit on the low side. They already added things like living ships, derelicts, space creatures and robots since I made this review, and with the Origins patch the variety of experience on offer is on such a scale now that I don't think I'm going to be lacking for things to do for some time. Also, impressively, the game runs even better than it did when I originally posted this - and the rejigged UI looks fantastic on Ultrawide. \n\nBrilliant work by the team at Hello Games. I can't think of any game I've played (and I've been indulging since the late 80's) where I've ever gone from \"I can't stand this\" to \"this is one of my favourite games\". It's taken a while to get here, but No Man's Sky is definitely one of the greats.",
      "a very interesting FPS multiplayer and co-op, It would be better if it was still in development like early access because it needs some work. shorter spawn times, vehicles , larger and more varied maps, what this game has that no other FPS has is realistic weapons. you will not find another game that models modern military grade firearms more realisticily in terms of what they sound like ,recoil, look, feel ( to the extent that a pc game can offer) they are amazing and I would buy this game for 8 bucks just for that alone. But it does need work , this game could be a great title to rival Battlefield and COD franchises ( maybe not Advanced Warfare) it may not surpass those titles but it could give them a better run for the money.",
      "Uncharted 4: A Thief's End:\n\nThe ambitious end to a long running franchise, Uncharted 4: A Thief's End is a very fascinating game.\nThe gunplay is enjoyable, the puzzles are decent and the humor is pretty good, there are some hilarious character interactions.\n\nThe story though, isn't very deep but I liked the darker approach and the flashbacks, it's interesting enough to keep you playing, and it really makes you care for the characters.\n\nExploration works decently, but it could've been better, there are documents you can read or find collectibles. The open area in Madagascar was one of the best parts of the game in my opinion, the car handles very well and the driving feels phenomenal.\n\nLastly, climbing is a very big part of the game, and even though the climbing mechanics are very smooth, I really had to force myself to enjoy it some times, and I wish there was less of it.\n\nThe action sequences are easily the best thing about this game, some jaw-dropping set-pieces keep you on the edge of your seat.\n\nUncharted 4 is the definition of a \"Movie Videogame\".\nIt's absolutely gorgeous, the cinematography is outstanding, the performances are fantastic and the soundtrack fits well, but gameplay-wise it's just... exhausting, not because of the controls or the gunplay, but because of the hand-holding and the linearity.\n\nUncharted the Lost Legacy:\n\nUncharted the Lost Legacy is proof that Uncharted can great even without Nathan Drake. The Lost Legacy is essentially just more Uncharted 4, it's something like a stand-alone expansion, and a good one at that.\n\nHonestly, I am surprised, I enjoyed this more than I expected. Even though the gameplay is more of the same, there's less climbing, and the fact that the game is relatively short is mostly a positive.\n\nThe game rarely feels repetitive, every puzzle is different from each other, and there is also an open area in the middle of the game where you can explore, which was implemented very well.\n\nAs for Chloe and Nadine, they make a pretty nice duo, where's Chloe is likeable and a goofball, Nadine is the opposite, she's aggressive and focuses on her mission. I liked their chemistry and I think both characters work very well together.\n\nAnd now for the negatives, the story isn't necessarily bad, it's just very generic and there are no stakes. Also, in my personal opinion, the biggest flaw the game has is that there are barely any highlights in it, almost no action except from the last chapter, which is a complete letdown considering how the action is literally the best part about this series.\n\nOverall it's very solid, and for its size it's definitely worth checking out, a great stand-alone expansion.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThank you Sony! Both games runs surprisingly well and overall very fun games. Uncharted 2 is still my favorite tho, but i'm happy to see Uncharted 4 and the Lost Legacy finally on PC, Uncharted 1,2,3 when?",

      "This game is more than just a driving simulator.

      "A criminally underrated game, I have seldom seen a developer take their original hit which was already almost perfect, and actually manage to improve on it in every way shape and form. You do not need to have played the original to play or enjoy this game. Their stories are completely seperate.\n\nThe game itself is much less linear than its predecessor. The best way I can explain the feeling of going through the environments without referencing Grimrock itself is by saying it felt an awful lot like Myst to me, just with combat. Required puzzles for progression were challenging but not impossible, some of the secret challenges were much more difficult. I admit I used an online guide more than a few times, but it did nothing to diminish my enjoyment of the game. It is immersive, challenging, and satisfying. \n\nThe only drawback I can think of is the difficulty. It feels like you cannot win with any group composition, I suggest no more than 2 of any class or weapon/armor type user. I went with a warrior, two rogues(one range), and a mage, this way you as well makes you unlikely to complete a difficult fight or puzzle and be rewarded with something you cannot use. Combat itself can be challenging as I said, but you will rarely feel like you are simply incapable of winning. There are obvious ways to optimize the way you approach an encounter the second time if you die the first.\n\nBe prepared to immerse yourself, you must pay attention to your surroundings, read and remember notes you find, explore every nook and cranny you can find, and you will be rewarded.

Death is a part of the game and you are NOT losing progress by dying.. it's death mechanic is very much like Rogue Legacy in that you keep progress that carries on to your next character when you begin again. Dying also isn't like you lost more than 45 minutes of your time. Every single game in this genre will have plenty of deaths involved before you FINALLY get that first win (in most cases). Some people are going to need to spend some time grinding levels, dying and repeat until they have enough sticker slots open to overpower things. Keep that in mind going into it. You retain your level and any big upgrades you acquire when you die so you are NOT starting from scratch every single time like you would in most rogue likes. \n\nI normally wouldn't review a game so early but I saw the negative reviews pouring in and felt I needed to add some counters to it. \n\nThe second thing: the art/music/atmosphere is absolutely brilliant for a game in this genre where most games of this nature tend to be relatively grim. As with most roguelike/lites its procedurally generated so the map, enemies and what have you will be different each time. \n\nThird: the forced timer before you have to fight the boss is a bit jarring at first as i've never played a game of this type where I have limited time to actually get there.. but it's kind of brilliant really because it adds a completely different layer to the game in that you have to manage your time very well. What do you think you have time to do before the inevitable? Do you want to run around and grind exp killing trash mobs? Or do you think that time could be better spent knocking some dungeons out (time halts when in dungeons so take your time in these) and getting some gear and arguably more exp than you would just wandering the map. Also, you absolutely have plenty of time to explore the map as there are shrines (you have to find them but the map isn't huge), that you can pay a special currency to add another day of time to the clock. If you see a review complaining about the timer and they have less than an hour in the game... take that with a grain of salt. \n\nFour: The combat is pretty simple but well done. There is a surprising amount of depth to it as well when you start buying and finding more powerful weapons (toys) that can do a variety of things and synergize pretty well together. Enemy variety is pretty good so far, each time you level up it adds more enemy variety to encounter around the map. \n\nFive: dungeons are fairly simple and a good mix of mini puzzles and fun combat encounters. \n\nIf you enjoy roguelike/lite games DEFINITELY give this a spot in your library to see what it has to offer. So far I'd put it 8-9/10 but I don't quite have the amount of time necessary to feel comfortable ranking it against other rogue games. I may edit this once I get to a point to see how much replayability it has but until then I'm eager to keep sending swords into a meat grinder and just adding to my power each time. Please look at how much time people have in a game before rating their reviews and taking their word. .5 hours is not enough time to really warrant a helpful review... nor is 6 in my case but I really don't want this game to be DoA\n\nEdit: Just beat Mormo for the second time.. trust me when i say you can make the timer go on infinitely. I Don't want to spoil anything BUT head to dungeons and kill as many enemies as you can to save up gold and another currency, and make a good loop around each area of the map and you'll find all sorts of neat things. As for bugs, I've had none and I'm at 13 hours of steady play. Don't waste time killing EVERY enemy that's in the open areas cause that will eat too much of your time, but focus on finding dungeons and the hidden npc encounters. I had my timer extended to approx. 8 days in game time and I also found a way to permanently increase the amount of time I have on subsequent runs. Give it a chance, learn how the game works before being upset about the timer.",
      "After around an hour and a half of bad spawns, scarce resources, and short-lived ventures into the more inhabited areas of the map, I ran into the first friendly player I had met in Rust. I had initially spotted him pretty far away, but I paid no real notice to him as he had a rock equipped. Eventually he got close enough for us to clearly see each other and, upon the realization that neither of us were hostile, we both pulled out torches as a mutual sign of peace (or the highest possible level of non-aggression that can exist in Rust). I dropped my old hatchet for him as I had just finished crafting one with metal, and he gave me some food as a sign of good faith. After nearly 30 minutes of searching and scavenging, we had pooled enough resources to craft us each some minimally decent gear. We knew that if we wanted to progress any further we would need to mine boulders, and a lot of them. I used what remaining materials we had to put together a 9mm handgun and several bullets, though I reminded him it was only in case we really needed it. I had decided earlier during my many unwanted experiences with bullets to the face that I would try my hardest not to run around slaughtering every newly spawned player that I came across. A few minutes out from camp we had encountered a player with a hunting bow. I had been running with my hatchet out, so I quickly took out the handgun in my inventory and pointed it in his direction, attempting to scare him away. When the player was far enough away we continued up a road towards a few stones. The area was surrounded by trees so I opted to stand guard with the handgun while my friend mined. Just as we were moving on to the next boulder, I heard the gunfire start. I turned around to see a player with an assault rifle gunning down my friend, and before I could land any shots on him he had already begun shooting me. It was at that moment that I remembered I hadn't even crafted a sleeping bag for the camp, as that was one of the objectives of the trip we were taking. I typed into the chat, thanking the friend I had made for all of his help and asking the player who had killed us if we had been intruding in his area or something along those lines. He simply wrote \"Sorry guys :D\" This is the single problem that I have with games like this. Why does it have to be \"shoot-on-sight?\" That player had obviously taken us by surprise and was better equipped than us. Even if he had a justifiable reason for approaching two very poorly equipped players (which he really didn't considering we were in the middle of the woods and he had pretty much all of the gear you could need in this game) he could have easily told us to cooperate by either putting away our weapons or just leaving the area. But of course, he comes around, sees some players trying to gather enough supplies to get to a stable point in the game, and decides to go out of his way to approach us and use unecessary ammo for a hatchet and a handgun with four bullets. Then, to add even more of an insult, he adds an apology at the end, as if he had no choice but to shoot two unexpecting, half-naked, unprepared players. \n\nAll in all, though, I do see a lot of potential in this game, and the good in the community does shine through every once in a while. I just wish that people would realize that they don't need to go around killing players who haven't had the chance to experience the game. People like that are the single reason why so many players on steam feel that they wasted money on what would otherwise be a great experience.",

      "I normally hate \"retro\" platformers, I never liked Mega Man, only Mega Man X, didn't care much for Shovel Knight but loved Hollow Knight, things like that. The Messenger IS a platformer, even though the second part of the game makes it less linear, and I loved it.\n\nDevs could take a lot of notes here - checkpoints are frequent, boss fights are short and creative and you don't have to go through 2 easy phases to retry a hard 3rd phase, most rooms and even most trick rooms have multiple ways to approach them given your fairly simple moveset. You never have to do anything pixel-perfect to get through but doing things well is massively rewarding. It constantly surprised you with new things but doesn't overstay anything, and completely foreign mechanics introduced are not punishing (Skylands, for example).\n\nA lot of people comment on how great the writing is, and well... it is great. It's sparse but fantastic throughout, with more personality in what amounts to a few pages than most games can give with 10 times as many words (and lore pickups).\n\nFor reference, I completed it with all the challenge collectibles in 14.5 hours, but did not get all achievements nor go through NG+. It is well paced and hard to put down, but easy enough to play in chunks, and I felt like I was learning new tricks up through the end of the game.\n\nDo the thing!",
      "Don't buy this game if you are planning a full co-op playthrough with a friend.\n\nAt first we thought only story progress wasn't shared which was fine as we'd both get to experience the missions regardless. However it turns out that all unlocks tied to completing each area such as new guns, cars and basically all the things you'd want to progress in are locked for the person who isn't hosting. This means your partner is stuck with the level 1 unlocks from start to finish unless they go back and do everything in their game as well.\n\nCompletely pointless and took us until clearing one of the lieutenants for us to realise this, bought this a while back too so not gonna be able to get a refund. Worst implemented co-op I have seen in a long time.",
      "In a world where \"enhanced edition\" has started to be synonymous with \"will run on modern hardware if you shell out $20\" it's absolutely refreshing to see Larian deliver this masterpiece free of charge to owners of the original. You start out with an already fantastic game that's received numerous game of the year and editor's choice awards. Then you spend a year polishing that game, and adding new features. The result is brilliant Enhanced Edtion of an already fantastic game.\n\nNew features for EE:\n[list]\n[*] Fully voice acted - Every line of dialog now has voice acting. The voice acting is really good too\n[*] Dual wield - Rogues now look more iconic with the ability to dual wield\n[*] Grenades - You can craft and throw various sorts of grenades. \n[*] Tactician Mode - A new  challenging mode where encounters are redesigned to be harder by adding new spells and enemies into the mix. Classic mode still available obviously.\n[*] Split screen co-op \n[*] Controller support\n[*] Updated graphics - The UI is totally reworked, the graphics are updated, and spells have new effects\n[*] Updates to the story  - The story, esepcially the ending, was rewritten a bit to clear up some confusing aspects\n[/list]\n\nI'm sure there's more, but really these ought to be reason enough to play this game.",
      "This game has such a HUGE potential like Stardew Valley in its early days!!\nCollecting stuff, helping people by crafting potions its so rewarding and lovely pls dear developers keep working on it. I BEG YOU! :D\nSure it has some bug right now but even on day one they managed to get some fast fixes and tried their best to make it work for everyone. \nThe controls were a bit tricky in the beginning (used Playstation 5 Controller) but its just a matter of time, its just not the normal controls like in other games.\nThe music was pretty nice and chill and also the animations were super cute, i love watching little Rubrum built his sandcastles over and over again. >3< \n\nOverall a good game, but could become even more better in the future, keep going guys!!",
      "I have mixed feelings about this game. It could have been very very good but has been let down by some very shoddy quality issues. This would not in itself have been a problem BUT given its AAA high price tag, to be honest, the consumer deserves better in terms of finish and execution. To name a few of the irritations:\n1.) AI characters shooting through walls.\n2.) Poorly realised inventory system (You can't compare stats of your secondary weapon with inventory items)\n3.) Camera does not follow actions during combat\n4.) Right click items in inventory and you do not always get the correct sub menus.\n5.) Mouse & Keyboard use was definitely an afterthought in terms of design\n6.) The frustrating click to confirm attribute/perk/talent spend.\n7.) UI does not always detail consumed action points to move to a location during combat\n\nAs I said lots of irritations that normally, in an indie game such as this, you would expect... but NOT when the publisher charges AAA prices.\n\nEz\n",
      "very well made cant stop playing. only complaint is keyboard set up and i get that the game says play with controller but thats not an option for me but the keys are all over the place r select upgrade e to reroll f to chat with npc r to enter their shop its like that for everything and you cant change the keybinds for UI stuff i wish it was just e to interact its all over the place and i find my self still miss typing things. if you buy the game use a controller \n",
      "It has poor simulation of hand skeleton, so you can't use all fingers, benefits of Index Knuckles controller or VR gloves, etc. And, scenario doesn't allow you to do anything, actually, except one straightforward way. Some things are elaborated, but mostly it isn't worth time or money. But I'm rating it as professional developer for VR, sexual content itself is not matter nor interested for me. My advice for game developer is to add more hand tracking features and more scenarios - in this case it can be something better.",

      "This game may actually be my favorite 2D Zelda game of all time.\n\nI knew going into it that the music by Lena Rain (who did Celeste's music) would be great. It is. I knew the game would be wholesome and adorable since it's by the designer from Wandersong. And it is. What I didn't expect was just how fun and interesting the paint-based gameplay would be. The puzzles constantly make you feel super smart, and the abilities you gain are all super fun to play with. When I first heard about the idea, I didn't think there would be all that many interesting puzzles and mechanics based on painting, but wow was I wrong. The puzzles and mechanics never get old, and there are an absolute ton of creative ideas being introduced all the way to the end of the game.\n\nAnd I certainly didn't predict how incredibly deep and personal the story and overall theme would be. The characters, writing, and plot of this game are astoundingly well done, and they turn a fantastic cozy 2D Zelda game into a truly unique and wonderful experience.\n\nI guess what I'm saying is, Chicory does for 2D Zelda games what Celeste did for platformers. It takes the base concept, turns the gameplay, music, and charm up to 11, and interweaves incredibly deep and emotional threads into every aspect of the game.\n\nI cannot recommend Chicory enough. I did back it on Kickstarter, which is how I got an advanced copy, but the game is better than I ever dreamed it could be. If you like cozy games about discussing feelings and helping people, or you like 2D Zelda games with innovative puzzles and hundreds of collectibles, or you just want to draw butts on everyone you meet, you need to get Chicory.",

      "Please, bare with me here...I NEVER write reviews for anything (this is probably the third review I have ever written), but I feel like I need to write this one for so many reasons!!!  I grew up playing the Telltale/Lucas Arts Series: Monkey Island. After discovering and playing those, I figured out that I have an infinite amount of love for Point and Click adventure games. After finishing that series, I really only played the other games made by either Lucas Arts or Telltale (Mostly because I thought they were the only creators of Point and Click games...until about a year ago, when I discovered there's an entire genre/world of Point and Click).  Of course, I must also note: The Curse of Monkey Island will always be my fav, as it was the first Point and Click I ever played. Ok...NOW...with all of that being said, I recently discovered WADJET EYE GAMES and I am SO happy I did. I would recommend EVERY.SINGLE,GAME they sell. I have played all of their MAC/iOS compatible Point and Clicks, and I have yet to be (even slightly) disappointed. I had very high expectations going in as the Monkey Island games, Day of the Tentacle, Full Throttle, Grim Fandago, etc. are some of the best games in the history of Point and Click; however, all of the games I have played from Wadjet Eye have been amazing. They have actually been so amazing that I can 100% say Wadjet Eye is at the top of my list, right there with the Telltale/Lucas Arts games. I 100% recommend purchasing and playing every game made by Wadjet Eye to anyone who likes (even those who kinda sorta like) Point and Click games.",
      "No Man’s Sky is like a guy who owes you $1,000 from 6 years ago coming back with $10,000 to repay you after you thought the money was gone.\n\nI really like this game. I’ve been playing it for years on and off, returning after every major update to see the state of things. No man’s Sky might be a fantastic game now, but you gotta always remember how it all begun. When the game first came out it could best be described to had been as wide as the ocean, but having the depth of a puddle. \n\nThe game has improved so much from when it came out that it is easily one of my favorite space exploration games nowadays. One of the greatest redemption stories in video game history. It’s almost like they used the money they earned from sales  to actually improve the game. \n\nI love the idea of having this massive sandbox shared experience, where coincidentally anybody can stumble upon my little bases I scattered, mines, etc. I also love flying around the stars in my ship, discovering new planets, finding weird animals, plants, geography…\n\nThe sense of adventure and the thrill of finding some new world makes me have so much fun. If you like exploring and just taking your time  doing things, this game is a must, and I highly recommend it. \n\nThe truth is no matter what you think of the game we should all be grateful of what we’ve gotten. If No Man’s Sky was made by EA, all these updates throughout the years would probably have been released as $60 new games each.\n\nI’ll be honest, at this rate and with these devs I have a feeling No Man’s Sky has a better chance of of becoming what Star Citizen strives to be than Star Citizen.\n\nEvery now and then though, whenever I see a game trailer that I really enjoy, I like to remember the state of this game when it first came out and how awful it was. It keeps me in check and helps my expectations stay grounded.\n\n10/10",

      "Finally, a video game that is everything televangelists in the 90’s said that video games were. Exactly what my Christian mother would love to catch me playing.\n\nIt’s like Animal Crossing and Doom\nEternal had a son… as was foretold when they released on the same day.\n\nThis game really makes you FEEL like you’re sacrificing your friends to an almighty force. Would I really just sacrifice 5 of my friends  again for some loot chests? I’m a gamer, of course I would.\n\nI fell in love with the aesthetic of this game instantly. It was brilliant when the gameplay held up to those expectations.  \n\nI loved it. I loved the art. The humor. The theme. The premise. The combat. The cult management. Sacrifices. Collecting the bones of my enemies. The juice visual effects. Most of all I loved feeding my followers bowls of poop.\n\nThe combat is fun but definitely not the meat of the game. Building your cult and just upgrading stuff is quite satisfying.  There's some goofy stuff to laugh at and it's quick and responsive. There’s something about the music that makes you feel relaxed and in terrible danger all at the same time.\n\nThis is not a game that you're gonna put 50-100 hours in either.  Which to me is a big plus.  Most of the runs don't take you more than 15 minutes.  So it's an easy game to pick up and play for a bit and jump back in later. It's like Vampire Survivors in that regard.\n\nIt's basically Animal Crossing with a roguelite twist.

Every character behaves identically towards you. Even your own wife will try to introduce herself. Kill someone's father/brother/entire clan? They will never mention it and will behave towards you just like anyone else.\n-\"Realistic mode\" means all your enemies will be absolute tank meat sponges while you are made of glass.\n-After you get your first settlement the game becomes extremely tedious. You will play whack a mole with enemy armies who take almost no time to recuperate. Wipe out 3 enemy armies in a massive, \"war changing battle\"? Oops, looks like all of those armies are back to full strength in a matter of days.\n-Almost zero variation of playstyles. Sure you can be a trader or a rogue mercenary for the early game, but you will always end up cheesing the smithing economy mechanics to support the larger armies you need in the mid game\n\nThis is simply an unfinished game. The fact they have been selling it for $50 successfully for years is wild.\nWould have much rather paid $100 for a fully finished product.\n\nUnless they have a massive overhaul on the \"Official Release\" October 25th, I cannot recommend this game. Shame.",
      "I'm going to write an honest review for this game since A LOT of people seem to be very biased.\n\nThis is not a perfect game. No 2K basketball game will ever be a perfect game. Does that mean this game is bad? No. Should you hold off on the game for now? Probably.\n\nLet's start with the positives:\n\n- A lot of people seem to gloss over the fact that 2K rehauled a lot of mechanics for this game. Shot meters feel more legitimate, this game is MUCH much more realistic (fouls, shot tendencies, etc...) This game is better and more fluid to control, and the gameplay reflects each players' ratings (defense, shots, etc...) much more accurately.\n\n- Online play seems to be better and more fluid. I've yet to encounter any latency issues online with quick play and the such.\n\n- MyCareer is MUCH better than last years. There is no cheesy story and the cutscenes feel much more integrated into the game. Orange Juice and dynamic duos are a great idea in general. The UI for MyCareer (and the game in general) is so much cleaner and more functional.\n\n- The game is visually beautiful, not much else to say on the matter.\n\nNow, the cons:\n\n- Help defense is broken. It's quite ridiculous that 2K hasn't fixes this lingering issue in such a long time but it's still there. This is a BIG issue in MyCareer and not quite as bad in other modes since you can manually control players.\n\n- Stat allocation is broken. This is a huge issue in MyCareer and has deterred me from playing the mode any more until 2K fixes this issue. Introducing the idea of stats that can only be raised in practice is actually quite a neat idea. However, these boosts are not permanent, even though 2K has stated they are. This is detrimental and demoralizing and discourages players from playing the game more. Limit caps are ridiculously strict as well. 2K NEEDS to fix these issues ASAP.\n\n- Numerous glitches.\n\n- 2K introduced broken mechanics along with the good mechanics. Ankle breakers are now pathetically easy to pull off (using Stephen Curry behind the back moves is a surefire way to have your defender fall). Moving screens are now a thing. \n\nI would hold off on buying this game until 2K patches it. There are just too many issues with the game that prevent it from being a playable game. I like this game. I really do. That's why I'm hoping 2K listens to the community and starts working on the issues at hand immediately.",
      "EDIT: I nominated this game for game of the year (2023)\n\nLong ago I had heard about this game and how detailed and intricate it could be, and how you could spend hours upon hours building the massive empire of dwarves only for it to all come crashing down in some spectacular but unforeseen way.  Then I got into Rimworld briefly and thought it was ok, but it tended toward chaos a bit too much for my liking.  THEN I heard this game was coming to steam and I eagerly awaited it.\n\nIt's not necessarily that I was too good to play a game with mostly ascii/character graphics (I used to play them a lot back in the 1980s).  I was more intimidated by the depth of the game and not knowing if there was a wiki for it (there is) or how I'd find help if I needed it (I'm sure there's a ton of communities JUST for this game).  I expected that when it came to Steam, it'd be beefed up and worth the wait.\n\nWell it finally arrived and I think I'm STILL a bit intimidated by the sheer amount of options you have... mostly because it's not just me that I have to worry about, but a whole community of dwarves.  In the case of something like minecraft, I could dig a whole intricate tunnel and if stuff starts to go bad, I just high-tail it out of there and recover until I can go back and finish it.  In Dwarf Fortress though, if stuff starts to go bad, you can't just leave.  You are encouraged to deal with the adversity and push onward in the name of greatness... or something.\n\nIn a way it's like role playing, except you don't have to roll character sheets and you don't really control any of the characters directly.  You make decisions about where to mine, what trees to chop down, what to build, what to trade, what to plant, and for every thing there is a season (turn turn turn).  You're forced to deal with death, birth, attacks, sickness, madness, and a ton of other things that I have no idea are coming.  \n\nI keep thinking \"I could do better\" and I start a new game, but then I start to realize that no matter what I do, I'm never gonna have a perfect game, or a game where everything goes exactly according to plan.  I am eventually going to have to buckle down and stick to one game save to see it through.\n\nIf you're like me and starting something new holds a lot more interest than continuing an existing project (ADHD?) you may have difficulty with this game.  At the same time you may become so engrossed in it that you lose track of time and suddenly it's 6am and you wonder why you stayed up all night digging holes.  I'm starting to feel a bit of the madness myself.  (it's almost 4:30am as I write this)\n\nIn any case, it's probably not for everyone, but I'd say if you're unsure, find the non-steam version and try that, and if you can grok what's going on and it interests you, definitely buy this and support the developers... OR buy this and try to stay under the 2 hour refund  limit while you learn the basics (Good luck with that, it'll be 6 hours before you know what happened).  I believe this game is worth the money though (full price).  If you were going to wait for a sale you'd be waiting a long time anyway.  \n\nTL;DR If this looks interesting to you, don't wait! Buy now.  If you aren't sure, do a bit of research and come back and buy it.",

      "Visually-speaking, this is possibly the highest quality otome I've ever played. Characters blink, their mouths move when they speak, and even backgrounds have some animated aspects, such as water movement, crackling fires and other neat little touches. The art is top-notch and, in my opinion, the game's strongest point.\n\nAnother aspect that makes Bustafellows a standout is the heroine. Teuta has much more presence than a lot of other protagonists in the genre because she has a face, voice and strong personality. She's her own character and not one of those 'we're going to make MC as bland as humanly possible for self-insertion purposes' heroines, which I very much appreciated.\n\nThe Steam version is a bit clunky compared to the console release, and at times it suffered from some pacing issues, but all the characters and their interactions were enjoyable. The main story was great; I really loved the group dynamic they established in the common route, and while Shu and Crow were definitely my favorites, there was nobody I really disliked as a love interest. They each had an interesting story behind them and unique dynamic with Teuta.\n\nThe final stories that attempt to wrap everything up were the only part of the game that just really didn't do it for me. I can't go into much detail without spoilers, but the best I can describe it is everything comes at you too fast, parts of it felt out of nowhere, and for me it was a downer. Not awful enough to ruin the game, and some of the ideas were good, but I feel like they were executed poorly.\n\nAll in all, Bustafellows is one of the better otome games out there. It's not perfect, but its strengths shine brighter than its flaws, and I'm dearly hoping Bustafelllows Season 2 gets localized so I can see more of its wonderful art and characters.",
      "This is a really clever game; smart and witty dialog, hand drawn graphic-novel style art, and creatively written missions.  I've only played through one set of 7 day missions but there is definitely a desire to go back and try to win in other ways.  In this game you have to manage the resource of your superheroes - not just which ones you think will survive the mission uninjured but to find compatibility and relationships between the superheroes.  There are some contrived bits, some superhero style (groan) humor - but overall this game lets you feel the joy, awkwardness, and humanity of relationships.  I *really* cared about these characters and their trials.  Love is love is love. (Disclaimer - I know Jesse Schell personally, but I don't know the team and I don't feel that relationship influenced my review or appreciation of the game which stands on its own).",
      "Nobody is gonna read this but here we go.... \nI recommend it, especially people who are really into classic Sonic. It plays like the Genesis games and is updated to incorporate elements and stages from each one, including Sonic CD. What it makes up for in updated graphics, music, and ideas, it loses in length of stage and just overall.... stage design. What I loved about the classic Sonic is that it felt like a choice to either blow through it or explore.. this one makes even the first level of each stage take about 5 or 6 minutes to get through... and then fight a boss. Overkill in my opinion, takes away what I liked about classic Sonic games... the speed. Still pretty good considering how much Sega has messed with Sonic throughout the years.",

      "A Short Hike is a relaxing, casual game about exploring an expansive, mountainous island park and eventually making your way to its summit so you can get cell phone reception.\n\nYou play as Claire, a bird who can climb, glide, and flap to great heights using a stamina system based upon how many golden and silver feathers you’ve collected. Along the path to the mountaintop you’ll encounter Animal Crossing-style characters who are friendly, punny, and usually have some minor task for you to solve, ranging from finding lost items to making deliveries.\n\nHelping residents of the island is completely optional, as is just about every activity in the game other than locating a few feathers and reaching the summit; as a result, length can range from an hour if you don’t stop to smell the roses to a few hours if you decide to make friends with everyone and see all the park has to offer.\n\nActivities include filling out a fishing journal by trading in your catches, digging in suspicious spots, solving treasure map clues, parkour racing, and opening up shortcuts by breaking blocked entrances and watering bouncy flowers. \n\nA Short Hike has a charming aesthetic and a lovely, peaceful soundtrack. I felt driven to see everything the game had to offer despite not being forced into any of it and never lost interest until I did so. It’s a beautiful little world that will make fans of Animal Crossing feel right at home.",
      "This is a passable if grindy 3D first person family friendly farming \"shooter\" with cartoony artwork.  You have a simple \"vacuum\" gun that you use to capture wild critters, throw them into pens, feed them, collect their stuff, sell it, rinse repeat.  \n\nThe implementation here is of high quality and works well on PC with a range of implementation options.  While the gameplay is somewhat repetitive and grindy, this is decent enough family friendly game that should be considered when on sale.  The retail price is too high, however, this game appears on sale and in bundles often enough.",

Brilliant characters, neatly constructed plot and enjoyable gameplay with the classic \"easy to play, hard to master\" aspect to it.\n\nI really can't pick at the graphics or music - they are just in line with the Supergaint roster, crafted at the level we have come to expect.\n\nIs there anything substantial that I would change? Not really, no. Adjustment to the \"progress\" in the one place, perhaps some slight balancing elsewhere... But does it matter when taking everything into account? Nope, not at all.\n\nEasy recommendation.",

      "I shall start by saying that if you are deciding to buy this game then don't let the negative reviews sway you. In general, Fallout 4 is an amazing game and can be incredibly fun.\n\nPros: \n-Very immersive and will drain so many hours, days, weeks and months from your life.\n-Far Harbour, Automotron and (first half of) NukaWorld DLC have really good stories, quests and environments.\n-Mostly fluid combat system. Everything depends on how you want to play the game.\n\nCons: \n-WIll drain so much of your life away (might've forgotten my gf's birthday ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ )\n-Main story was incredibly lackluster compared to previous Fallout games\n-Giving you the option to be literally any kind of character you want to be....except you're always tied to being a parent.\n-a few repitive quests. (although gives you opportunities to approach these quests, areas and enemies differently\n\nAll in all, If you're a Fallout fan because of previous stories then you might not feel fulfilled playing this game, however if you love character creations, lore and immersive environments with untold stories then I completely recommend this game to you.",

And now your game is dead. Good work! Piss poor development. Just sad and dissapointed I have over 2k in hours in crap. And yes this game actually is years old it was originally released Jan 2015.

      "I have not play for long, but know well enough this game deserves a mention. A side on, survival-ish game set in a war. Now, While I admire this game, it does have a few issues I personally find abnoxious.\nI'll start with those, and then will share what I like about it.\n\n-Characters you play seem to have never stolen anything at all from anyone, ever during the war. This is reflected in how unhappy and whiney they become caring more about the people they have taken from than their own wellbeing.\n\n-Characters you play are too softhearted. Just use the example with the point above. \n\n-Characters are expert carfters for being just average people. How many average people know how to pick locks, make servicable firearms and make alcoholic beverages? Well these three certain are capable of all three and more. For that matter, they all can do everything, but have one special skill they are the better at than the rest.\n\n-You get to only visit one building per night. This is bad since if you chose a building with other survivors in it, you will either need to steal from them to get supplies and be faced with a lot of unhappy complaining, or return home with nothing.\n\n-Visting other survivors, you cannot negotiate with them let alone talk to them. What you can do is beat them to death (or kill them with whatever weapon you happen to have on you at the time). I don't see how this was a good design choice at all when the characters you play are not personally that sort of people. Attacking other survivors is certain to cause problems with your characters.\n\n-You can not relocate from your starting place. What you start with is your base of operations.\n\n-Raids happen frequently to you only. You will never kill raiders, only chase them off and this happens behind the scenes, out of your control, while your character is out scavanging.\n\n-You can not sleep in shifts. If a person sleeps, they sleep the whole night.\n\n-Rediculous resource requirements. Some things require far too much, while others require far too little. \n\n-There is little to none interaction between your characters. No idle chatter between them. \n\n\nNow for the good points.\n-You play 3 characters to begin with, each having one specialty. They somewhat have different personalities.\n\n-The art style appeals to me.\n\n-Characters are well animated. Different staes of tiredness, different things they do when unhappy or when they have nothing else to do.\n\n-The overall idea, even though it isn't implemented well enough.\n\n-Building your shelter from ground up.\n\n-Forgaing and stealth play.\n\n\nSo while i find some issues with this game's design, if you ignore the lack of realism and consider this to be just a game with a very narrow play style, it is quite fine. It has a certain atmosphere you generally don't find elsewhere. I still recommend to give it a try.",
      "This game is basically awesome, under 3 conditions:\n\n1- You get rid of all on-screen icons (i.e. incoming attacks, ennemy spotting)\n2- Do not care about secondary missions only here to further lenghten the game's lifespan\n3- Play the game as you would if  YOU were in charge\n\nBasically, nevermind the Ubisoft micro transactions' system and other abhorrent company induced  greed-leaned system to get stuff faster and more easily by robbing you out of your hard-earned cash...you can finish the game without spending a single dime in the store, it's all pay to win...\nThe open-world aspect is very satisfying and rewarding, in terms of progression, don't fall for the micro transaction system\nCombat is easy even in the highest difficulty setting, but makes you think you are badass when you slash through waves of ennemies, whose AI is rather basic, with your arsenal of rockets, LMGs and explosives but it is satisfying as fuck!\n\nImagine strapping C4 to your plane, jump out of it, have it crashing down an ennemy outpost meanwhile you are parachuting down and throwing hand grenades their way, land on a roof and eliminate the remaining ennemies with fire ammo shotgun and a motherfucking M60 with armor-piercing bullets while throwing dynamites and there you have it...FarCry5 in a nutshell\n\nOh and don't forget about the flame-thrower lol, who doesn't love a flame-thrower scorching ennemies to their own demise eh?\n\nFarCry5 got it all, extreme freedom of how you wanna handle a situation (stealthily or all guns blazing) while being challenging enough in the highest difficulty setting!\nP.S. don't forget to turn off all the on-screen icons, really ruins it for hardcore FPS fans by making it extremely easy, please hear me out, you don't need these!",

      "Portal is a first person puzzle platformer where you are testing science with portals guided by GLaDOS.\n\nThe game is a classic for a reason. It uses portals as the main puzzle mechanic and combines other mechanics with the portals such as falling and gaining momentum to launch at a higher speed through the other portal. The levels gradually build up with complexity, but are never too frustrating and half of them are done with access to only a single portal. The puzzles have great visual clarity with the mostly white colors and decent visual cues on how it should all work out.\n\nPortal has the classic Valve way of telling stories, as things are already happening before you get there. You are woken up to follow instructions for the testing purposes of GLaDOS, but you are also figuring out if maybe there isn't a role better suited that could fit you. It's an enjoyable mystery leading you on without forcing it's way in.\n\nGoing back from Portal 2 to Portal made me aware of the improvements to the overall gameplay. Exiting through portals in Portal makes the camera rotate in a weird way sometimes and the levels are generally designed to be slower pace than what Portal 2 offers.\n\nIf there is one thing I didn't enjoy, it's the advanced and challenge levels. Figuring the harder puzzles is one part of the challenge, but executing them relied on tight timings where the puzzle mechanics they rely on felt too clunky to be fun.\n\nFor achievement hunters:\nTwo playthroughs are required with 2 sets of collectibles, one of which requires to be done in one go, a few challenges through the story and completing the advanced and challenge levels that can be console cheesed.

Not really.\n\nEdit: Upon completing this game, here's something I'll have to claim in advance: while still recommending this great game with an 8 out of 10 and it has quite a solid story, I'll have to admit  that apart from Dorothy's hidden scenario, this game did not dig very deep into its cyberpunk/dystopian background, which is really a pity - and it's becoming the reason to expect another game (more specifically, A [b]SEQUEL[/b]!!!!! or prequel) from them :)\n\nVA-11 Hall-A - or Valhalla for convenience - while seemingly was a Waifu Bartending Simulation game, is actually somewhat [i]Papers, Please[/i] with excellent characters, vivid graphics, elaborated dialogues and not-so-mind-fucking gaming mechanics.\n\nDon't get me wrong: I love [i]Papers, Please[/i] and of course would rather NOT say that one is superior to another; they are both one of their unique kind, but with the very same root - under the daily life of dystopia denizens, truth and conspiracies weave with vague notices in advance; and just before you could think twice things are going really, really out of track.\n\nThat being said, I mean these two games are very similiar in story-telling: as long as you enjoy taking in all the random, weird stories as a bystander, just to find out that all these fragments come together and form a bigger picture, this game is definitely for you. And you get cyberpunk waifus, a Joshikousei hologram, a pretty cool onêchan as protagonist - and more!\n\nLast but not least, the developers of this game are nothing but truly [b]RESPECTABLE[/b]. We have crybabies on Kickstarter and Steam Early Access every focking day blaming everything for their faulty products, while this army of two whined [b]NOTHING[/b] about all the fuck-ups in Venezuela unless asked.

      "[h1][u]Wonderful game with a great battle system, but terrible netcode[/u][/h1]\n\n[h2]Foreword[/h2]\nI got to know \"Naraka: Bladepoint\" through a friend.\nAt first I was very skeptical, so I only bought the Standard Edition, and later the Ultimate and Deluxe Editions.\nFirst of all, this game has a steep learning curve with its battles.\nExactly why the game may not be suitable for everyone.\nUnfortunately, that doesn't make the playerbase any better, but read more about that below.\nNevertheless, the game and especially the combat system offers a lot of potential and has a lot of posivites to offer.\n\n[h2]Positives[/h2]\n[list]\n[*]Regular updates with ever increasing content\n[*]Few to almost no bugs and if they are, then they are fixed very quickly\n[*]Steep learning curve - Especially at the beginning the game is not easy, but you can quickly get into it with friends\n[*]Pleasant graphics\n[*]Nice sound design, which is location dependent\n[*]Potential to grind for higher ranks and for the Hall of Fame\n[*]Different game modes and events\n[*]Extremely extensive combat system - many possibilities to conter weapons\n[*]Extensive stats, either ingame or with Naraka+ mobile app (app is absolutely top!)\n[*]Well thought through character designs\n[*]Extremely individual character editor - From Thanos to Bruce Lee everything is customizable.\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Neutral[/h2]\n[list]\n[*]Climbing system - It's really good compared to other games. However, you still sometimes get stuck on edges or can't get to the platforms above.\n[*]Microtransactions - I'm personally not a fan of them, but it's not a must in this game and doesn't favor anyone.\n[*]Answers of Discord team members very questionable on some questions\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Negatives[/h2]\n[list]\n[*]Terrible netcode - players with highpings are treated preferentially\n[*]Few European players - Extremely many VPN players with many different Asian characters and languages in the voicechat\n[*]Voicechat is not well thought through\n[*]Partial performance losses\n[*]Ranking matches are partly wrong - Either with new players (Bronze) or experienced players (Asura)\n[*]Partially bad English, as well as German translation\n[*]Some abilities are combined absolutely disgusting and unfortunately more or less meta\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Review written out[/h2]\nNaraka has become a real love-hate relationship game for me.\nI love the extensive combat system and also the steep learning curve from noob to a slightly experienced player. (I am Platinum 1 - Solar 5 at the time of this review).\nSo while the combat system could be frustrating at times at first, I love it all the more now.\nOnly the climbing system, as well as some combinations of abilities or ultimates could be revised.\nFor example, it is common practice (meta) that many players use Ultimates that stun and ensure that you immediately get into the next Ultimate.\nThis is sometimes a bit frustrating, because these combinations are played very often and other heroes, especially the new ones, are not really played because of it. \nHowever, you can work around these combinations or counter them yourself. Unfortunately, this is not always easy, especially for new players.\n(For example, the combination of Valda - Viper - Tianhai).\nHowever, a victory and the killing of opponents, especially higher ones, with whom you are unfortunately sometimes matched, releases a lot of endorphins in Naraka, so that a victory feels extremely rewarding.\n\nUnfortunately, this brings me to the part that makes it extremely difficult for me to decide on a positive rating for this game.\nThe game, for being released in 2021, has a horrible netcode for a martial arts battle royale game.\nThere are extremely many Asian players who connect directly or via VPN to the europian servers.\nThis is especially noticeable when you activate the voice chat, which by the way, has no individual regulation for volume or a mute function per player.\nUnfortunately, those players have a ping beyond 150ms.\nSadly, this is a big problem for people with low latency.\nYou partly punch through enemies bodies.\nVarious focus attacks are therefore not always blockable or the opponent lags at you, while the player for himself has no lags at all.\nThis is not only unfair, but should actually no longer be a problem in 2022.\nFor example, it would be enough to not let players with a ping greater than 150ms/200ms move.\nAccording to the Discord community manager, there is a region lock and most of the names are just \"memes\" . \nBut you don't notice anything about the region lock in the game and we can theoretically connect to other servers.\n\nAnother big problem is the matchmaking.\nEven with Bronze or Silver, you are matched with Asura players when there is a lack of players.\nThis is not necessarily nice, but you get a lot of points for survival and you also learn a lot of techniques.\n\nAs negative as this all sounds, the game still gets a positive rating from me.\nI love the sound design, which comes into its proper place in the battles and is different for each location on the map.\nThis reminds me of Prince of Persia in some areas and provides more excitement in fights.\nIn addition, the varied battles, no matter how hopeless they sometimes seem, are all the more rewarding if you win.\nEspecially when you're killing another team, consisting of 3 people, as the last survivor of your team.\nThe map design is also absolutely great. Every location has been carefully thought through. \nGreat lighting design really highlights some of the locations.\nYou can overlook small bugs like misplaced branches (a branch hangs in the air next to a tree).\n\nBut my favorite part is the grinding to a higher rank. \nThe ranking system and especially the Hall of Fame encourage you to play.\nGetting into the top 100 of a much-played character feels very rewarding.\nSo does slaying a moonbane.\n\n[h2]Epilogue[/h2]\nAll in all, despite the flaws, Naraka has a lot going for it, and even though the larger issues can be extremely frustrating, the game saves itself with the extensive battle system, the incredibly great locations including sound design, and the extensive ranking system including Hall of Fame.\nI love the game because of the thoughtful little things, even if I hate it extremely at times.\n\nEven though the game can quickly become frustrating for new players, you should be aware that it has a lot to offer if you are willing to learn.\nThe accompanying app is an extremely well thought through and great gimmick in this regard.\n\nI would be happy to take you by the hand and introduce you to the game.\nJust visit us on our [URL=https://discord.nox-eagles.de]Discord[/URL].\n\nI would like to thank all of you who have read my review until the end.\nI'm looking forward to your opinions :)\nWith best regards\nYour Holt",
      "A new game from Zeboyd, you know I'm there! And this was such a fun game\n\nThis game is about as long as Cthulhu Saves Christmas and it's just as Linear. However given their statement on this video, that's meant to be the point these days.\n\nThe Graphics for the main game are basic but it's fitting for the Genre. Also they have dropped the random battles with on screen monsters to avoid if you want to not fight (And you still have the option to start a battle through the main menu). The fighting system is identical to CSC too which I've enjoyed but I can understand those who may not like it. The Animation for the transformations are incredible...except I'm always stuck watching them every single time which can get very tedious.\n\nThe story is clever, and they provide \"Translations\" for the Ole English of Shakespeare...but a lot of the translations are jokes and very silly ones at that.\n\nThere isn't a LOT of replay value but you will enjoy the story enough you'll want to play it again eventually.\n\nThere is no New Game Plus mode...yet but given how they patched it into CSC later on I'm certain they're do that here eventually.\n\nI say the game is incredible for the price range and is entertaining for all ages.\n\n\nVIDEO REVIEW: https://youtu.be/wuw9pJPowqM",

      "While it seems grindy at times, you will probably feel greatly rewarded when you can get enough resolve to spec out a specific build exactly how you want it. I think the progression of the tower abilities and gold gain is great, but even the burdens available don’t seem to switch it up quite enough. I’m on ng+4 and i feel like it’s getting a tad stale. I still like playing it of course. Some classes like the chef make the idea of playing anything else not quite worth it. I’m sure there’s some great niche builds but keep that in mind. Overall, this game keeps you on your toes. If you get hit, it’s almost always because you did something wrong. I LOVE the movement abilities in this game. You can feel like a speed runner with a few hours of practice gliding and jumping. This is a completely different game compared to rogue legacy 1 in all the best ways. 9/10",
      "Ever wanted to be a futuristic dual wielding samurai drummer with a penchant for slicing boxes? No? You didn't even know that was a thing? Well you will after playing this. \n\nProbably the most satisfying rhythm game out there, Beat Saber turns sword thrusts into dance. With notes expertly timed to the music and directional swipes that lead smoothly into each other creating an almost choreographed flow, you will find yourself naturally completing songs and feeling boss after every single track.\n\nWith a choice of difficulty settings and a huge array of modifiers, it is accessible to many skill levels and makes it perfect for newcomers, parties or just to simply show off VR, while remaining a huge challenge for those who wish to test themselves on the most hardcore difficulties.\n\nBeat Saber is a game that probably should be on the radar of any VR user, as it's pretty visuals and reliance on your motions makes it a perfect fit for VR. If you don't have this game I highly recommend you pick it up, as when you do, you may just find it hard to put it down.\n\nNow if you will excuse me, I have a few more hardcore songs I have to embarrass myself attempting.",

The actual puzzle-solving aspect of the game is adequate, but with minimal diversity and accretion.  It is definitely a story-driven experience, with the gameplay taking a passenger seat.  If you can appreciate a game in that style, this is a good bet for you. \n\nThe entrancing narrative and the style in which it transpires work in concert with the mystifying ambiance to create a wondrous experience. The story touches on some thought-provoking metaphysical issues, while skillfully avoiding a fall too deep into the rabbit hole to keep the average person’s interest. Much of the rest of the narrative is comfortable, cliché sci-fi tropes that we all know and love.\n\nThe gameplay and the puzzles are far from [i]bad[/i], but they also are nothing special.  As I alluded to: they are sufficient, but fail to develop into anything overly interesting. Very little changes from the first puzzle to the last, so it does get a little bit dry.  That said, some of the later ones are quite tricky and a few require not only puzzle-solving ability but also decent reflexes. \n\nThe graphics are pleasurable and align perfectly with the vibe of the game. But the whole soundscape is what truly brings the atmosphere of [b]The Swapper[/b] to life. The ambient soundtrack, the cryptic chatter, and the selectively placed voice-overs contribute a wonderful blend of emotions and mystery. If you are into it, this is a game you might enjoy with the lights off and your headphones on (or however else you may get into the zone).  \n\n[b]The Swapper[/b] is a brief, interesting, and enjoyable experience. It is not a complex or intricate puzzle-platformer, but I recommend it to any fan of the genre who would appreciate the atmosphere and narrative.\n\n[i][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/murphyslawyercuration#curation]Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations![/url][/i]",

      "Hard to recommend. I enjoyed F1 2020, and this is just that game with the latest cars, slightly updated graphics (ray tracing etc) and a story mode that I found fun, but its about 5 hours of entertainment max. The coop career mode is nice, I enjoy racing with friends. The racing is fun and close when difficulty is tunes, and I enjoy the act of just driving around in this (though some of the kerbs can get knotted).\n\nBig issue is the VIP pass thing, and the attitude it shows. It's even more egregious than F1 2020 - it's front and centre, with some more categories of items to dilute your experience further. By default there are very limited customisation options (even compared with F1 2020), so you might be even more tempted to part with an extra £9 or so just to get the VIP pass. On top of the £55 already spent, with EAs regional pricing making it far more expensive in some areas. That's just grubby. I'm fine with XP based unlocks, but paying for additional cosmetic items in a game like this is predatory and exploitative.\n\nDon't reward them for this. \n\nGet the game if you feel the price is worth it for the story mode and the coop career mode, and you are fortunate enough to have the disposable income. I am, and I did, but it doesn't feel like I got my money's worth this year, to be honest.",
      "An excellent maximalist mashup of Slay The Spire with some Tower Defence and CCG Mechanics. Not as tight and elegantly designed as StS, but with a lot more variety in card design leads to a lot more varied and wild interactions and deck composition. Compulsive and mechanically satisfying, Monster Train embraces excess in a satisfying way, even if the whole package is wrapped up in a slightly odd aesthetic package of half remembered hearthstone knock offs. (The soundtrack, incidentally, slaps)",
      "Very fun game. Best wave shooter on the market that I've ever seen. The roguelike nature of it is very fun. Each run hits you with different challenges in building your weapons.\n\nBiggest critiques - \n1. Achievements locked behind multiplayer in a dead game. God I hate when devs do this. It luckily lets you play through normal mode when queuing, but its still very annoying. The last achievement I needed was \"get to wave 50 of multiplayer gauntlet mode\". I've so far been able to play 2 games of multiplayer. One, my partner had no voice coms. Second, my partner started with extremely staticy voice coms and it cut out at about wave 5. We pushed through to wave 48. Aaaaaaaaaand network error. It took about an hour and a half to get that far just for the game to crash and lose it all. Devs, please stop hiding achievements behind multiplayer when you know full well your game won't have a huge online player base.\n\n2. You get TWO GUN ARMS! This is AMAZING AND AWESOME! Except for the fact that a ton of the attachments for your weapons affect every part on your gun. So by not just making one super mega death arm, you are effectively chopping your total strength into two parts. There are a few pieces that only give you buffs for \"dual wielding\" or having a firing barrel on each arm. But these are not very common, and the stats you get from them pale in comparison to just making a super gun on one arm and keeping the other arm clenched for punching enemies that get up to your face, or putting on a single melee weapon on the other hand for the same purpose. \n\n3. The variety of guns is fun, but in the end it ends up turning into \"hold the fire button, aim for enemies, walk in a circle to trick enemy aim as best as possible, and occasionally punch an enemy that gets to you\". The biggest change to this system is getting either the rocket launcher or the Barrel Barrel which shoots massive barrels at the enemies. They have a very slow fire rate and do best when aiming the shots more precisely. But even then, with some weapons having a spooling time, and others outputting a hale of bullets, the best strategy is to just keep the trigger held 24/7 and strafe your aim from enemy to enemy.\n\nI really enjoyed my time with this game, but don't try to 100% it. The multiplayer achievement isn't worth it. Network is terrible. There's too much going on on screen when you have 2 players in the mix so crashing is likely. If I were the Completionist I would give this game a rating of Finish It. Play through the game with all the unique starting bonuses, all the difficulties. But stay away from multiplayer unless you have a friend to dedicate multiple hours to trying the gauntlet with.",
      "This review only relates to the single player campaign. At 50 years old I have zero interest in multiplayer.\n\nAfter playing Gears of War 4, I was looking forward to this title. I wasn't disappointed. I found the new upgrade system with Jack enjoyable. The campaign was fun to play with minor exceptions. Graphics, sound, and voice acting were amazing. Campaign took me about 11 hours to beat. I consider that well worth the $60 I paid for the game.\n\nMy only real gripe about the single player campaign:  As a father of 3 girls, I'm all for strong female leading characters. Kait just isn't it, though. I didn't care for her in 4 and that didn't change in 5. For me she seems out of her league and just isn't believable as a team member.

      "I'm gonna give this a thumbs up but with like, idk, a cautionary sideways thumb for maybe. \n\nif I read credits right, it looks like this game had all its programming, art, music, and writing done by one guy, so I have to give respect to that. For a real indie game like this, it's very very good. \n\nBut it's still really flawed. If you're looking for a 2D Metroid game, and you've played EVERY other 2D metroid game, I suppose yeah, go for this one, and I think you'll enjoy it. If you're not a fan of metroid, I would not bother, sadly. This game suffers from a lot of problems from metroid games, and does not fix any, and at times exagerates those problems. \n\nThe art style is very interesting and cool, but the way the levels and map design are, leaves most areas feeling like a mess of unmemorable places. \n\nThe combat is INCREDIBLY simplistic, yet somehow bogged down by WAY too many useless weapons and just kind of badly designed controls. I found there were about 5 weapons that were actually useful in the game out of what seems like more than 10. Most enemies you either cheese, or be cheesed. There's no charge up shots, there's not really much nuance to the enemies or bosses. They have about two attacks and repeat while you dodge the same one bullet pattern and just kind of shoot in their general direction. (I played it on hard by the way. Not a particularly difficult game, but even the slightly challenging stuff felt kind of dull and uninteresting.) \n\nThe music was cool again. nothing quite mind blowing, but it was nice. The world itself seems like a mess, but there are cool ideas. The giant robot people were really cool to see. \n\nOne little idea i really liked is that the LOW HEALTH beep sound is actually in sync with every song in the game. I thought that was really cute, and it's not something I've seen any game do. Sounds dumb, but I give a lotta props to that, it was cool. \n\nWriting is okay. I feel it left more to be desired. There seemed to be an interesting world here that wasn't explored enough. It wasn't bad, I suppose, but not really that great. \n\nThat is kind of this game. It's not bad by any means, but not the best game on the planet. Play it if you're in need of a Metroid game, and I'm certain you will be pleased enough despite the flaws. Even if you're just having a hankering for a platformer and have already played Hollow Knight and some other great ones first, I think you should enjoy this, but don't expect a 10/10 game. \n\nGive it a try if you feel it looks interesting.",

      "If 'Baba is You' and 'The Witness' are the puzzle game equivalents to a full-course meal, then Patrick's Parabox is a fluffy dessert that you just can't put down. It's full of bite-sized puzzles that rarely repeat themselves, instead iterating and expanding upon each other as you learn all of the tricks and mechanics the game has to offer. A delight to the very last bite.\n\nIf you're looking to be challenged then there's plenty of that too, but not as much as you'd find in a typical sokobon game. With that said there [i]is[/i] some Level Editor support so the potentials there for dastardly custom levels ;P",

Many have compared themselves and failed.\n\nEugene Jarvis is the creative consultant on this title - so if anything has some \"spirit of Robotron\" in it - this is the game.\n\nThe game is Robotron + Gauntlet with a bunch of secrets rolled in.  As will all good twich arcade games, greed plays a central part in the game.  If you just want to mindlessly blast your way through the worlds - you can.  But you will not be rewarded for it.\n\nScoring high in this game is all about the multiplier - and the multiplier is all about saving humans (which can be harder than it sounds).

      "If Disco Elysium is a meditation on lost futures and the value of self destruction, Norco answers with an indictment that we might be inhabiting the end times and should hold on regardless. Every scene and character portrait is a painstaking work of art that works along with the dreamy soundtrack to draw you into the gorgeous, hazy bible belt setting. The point and click gameplay is straightforward (and at times a little overbearing with handholding), with small minigame sections to mix things up somewhat, but rewards interacting with the world and the people in it to uncover another small truth about it. I don't think I've come across anything that quite captures the sense of melancholy and unease that dominates the current moment in the 20s.",

      "Think you’re good at racing? Well, this game will give you a RKO.\n\nI don’t even know much about rally when I bought the game. I just see cars driving at dirt, weaving steering left and right constantly, and thought it looks cool. \n\nThis game is HARD. The learning curve is really steep. The first time I played, I constantly fly off a cliff and hug into trees. Because i don’t understand what my co driver is reading. He talk so fast that my tiny brain couldn’t process in time, sometimes I’m so confused that I go straight in junction because I can’t remember he said turn left or right. The cars are constantly out of control. \n\nAfter I learned about weight transfers that I’m able to start utilizing oversteer into corners. No more cripple into finish line with two tyres missing, that’s when the fun begins. Dirt Rally 2.0 is different from other racing games. You don’t race against other drivers, instead you race against time. If you turn off the hud, then it’s only you and the road, and TREES :)\n\nThe sound of the gravel hitting under your car. Dirt stained on your car as you progress through out the stage. The pops and bang coming out of exhaust when you shift. These combination feels somehow relaxing and satisfying at the same time.\n\nThe only downside of Dirt Rally 2.0 is that it requires constant internet connection, even when most of its content are single player. I wouldn’t complain if the server is stable. But sadly it isn’t. The server down happen quite frequently. Imagine you feel like you completed a 10 minutes perfect run, no crashes or mistakes. But then the game refuses to connect to the server. So the game won’t record your progress. It’s like a big middle finger to the player. \n\nI could make this review a thumbs down solely for the “always online” requirement, cuz it makes the player experience kinda inconsistent, but the gameplay itself does make up for it though. I mean when it works, it works remarkably well.\n\nApart from always online issue. Dirt Rally 2.0 is fantastic, the handling, physics, graphics etc. everything is on point. If you’re interested, buy the GOTY edition, it easily double the contents of the original game had. Worth every single cents.",
      "On the Steam Store page for [i]Candle[/i] I saw:\n\n1. The game's description: \"Candle is an adventure with challenging puzzles.\"\n2. The 5 most popular tags for the game: Indie, Adventure, Hand-Drawn, Puzzle & Fantasy\n3. The beautiful screenshots\n4. The 'very positive' reviews\n\nSo I bought it. I should have actually read some of the reviews, though. It turns out [i]Candle[/i] is just another platformer game. Granted, it's a \"puzzle-platformer\" but still a platformer where agility, dexterity and a lot of trial & error are key to finishing the game, although there is some light puzzling involved, as well. I don't like platformers. I also don't like pixel hunting for items, which is what you need to do in [i]Candle[/i] to find all the items you need to advance. You see, some items are almost absorbed in the background and frustratingly hard to spot. So there will be a lot of backtracking, unless you follow a guide, which then kills part of the fun anyway.\n\n[b]In summary, just a friendly warning: if you think [i]Candle[/i] is a beautiful point & click adventure game, like I did, don't be fooled.

      "Bioshock Infinite is the third and (presumably) final game in the venerable Bioshock series of narrative driven FPS action games.  Gameplay, as always, consists of somewhat linear FPS combat with a \"genetic\" progression advancement system that lets you upgrade your abilities through \"splicing\" \"plasmids\".  This gives you somewhat supernatural abilities to augment the more traditional shooting of enemies with guns that we all enjoy from FPS games.  There's also the usual gamut of minigames, with a carnival theme to them. \n\nFrom the technical perspective, even though this is getting a little old, it's a AAA game and it shows.  Everything gamers expect is delivered here in terms of visual tweaks, control customisation, 4K support and a lot of graphics fine tuning options to allow gamers to experience a perfectly optimised experience.  There's not much else to say when developers get it right!  The visuals are equally top notch. \n\nWhile a great technical implementation is a must, and a minimum requirement for a recommendable game, of course Bioshock Infinite goes beyond that to deliver a masterpiece story that will leave gamers hooked, and perhaps a little bereft once it's over, but that's how all great stories should be.\n\nBioshock Infinite is a must-play for fans of narrative FPS games, although I do recommend trying Bioshock 1 & 2 first.  It's not required, but just like you wouldn't enjoy it as much if you watched Return of the Jedi first, you should try the first two episodes of Bioshock before the third one.",

It has beautiful art, beautiful music, wonderful narration, it's atmospheric, great characters, meaningful choices, a story of overcoming hardships similar to a real life instead of just a story, and the ending I got was beautiful!

      "[b] Target Audience: [/b] [I] Anyone with a Soul[/i]\n\n[b] Summary: [/b]  \n\nIt's a damn shame that this game isn't topping people's game of the year list this year, because Wandersong is one of the best story based experiences that I've played on Steam. A game that is beautiful woven from start to end, every element works together in harmony to make what will be a cult classic in my mind: and only a cult classic due to the fact that it should be a blockbuster, but won't get the recognition. The 3 man team took an upbeat story of a young bard on a whismical journey and \nmade someone who usually gravitates toward more depressing/out there stories and fall in love with the Bard, Miriam, and the vast cast of characters here. \n\nThe funny thing is, it's hard to quantify what makes Wandersong such a complete package, because everything works in harmony so well with everything else. Take the music for example: I actually struggled to specifically remember any individual track at first, and that's because the games tracks are so tied to the emotions that you feel during scenes. You are the music in how you play through your game, you experience this game how you want, and it's singing mechanic that alters the world aroudn you allows you to be the player you want to be while still staying in a relatively linear story line. The color and presentation is fantastic, the gameplay mechanics stay just long enough before changing up, it's hard to really think of anything that the game did wrong.\n\nLook, even those who may hate games with less “gameplay” will most likely be charmed by Wandersong's spell. It's a siren of sorts: except it'll make you crash into jagged rocks of love and happiness. Story elements feel earned. Everything has very specific detail. It's clear this was a labor of love, and it shows even in the scene select: where the splooshes by the team just make you smile. You will sit and wonder about your own life after playing certain sections, and the club scene is one of the best set pieces I've seen in character development. Honestly, I really struggle to think of negatives for the game: each thing has a purpose and is there for a specific reason, and executes it beautifully. \n\nIf you're reading this review, it's because you're considering buying the game. Do it. Do it now. It's worth it.\n\n[b]Video Review: [/b] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ycIvIVfblk\n\n[u] Lists: [/u]\n[b]Positives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Oozes charm and love.\n[*] A fantastic buddy story that is great from start to finish. Great set pieces, great small stories, and just  great writing overall.\n[*] All characters are people that you want to run into again, having unique stories and good jokes.\n[*] Story elements feel earned despite upbeat nature. Protagonist has reason to be upbeat, but does face hardship.\n[*] Miriam's character is the best and shines as the secondary protagonist.\n[*] The club scene. Just. All of it.\n[*] Colored presentation is sharp and vividly pleasing, while always matching the emotion of what it's depicting.\n[*] Music drives the game forward via emotion: and makes you remember the set pieces and small moments easily.\n[*] Perfect for all ages: and adapts to the way you view it. \n[*] Every game needs a dance button. Every game. This proves it.\n[*] Attention to detail making every action feel like it effects the world makes a game you can get lost in.\n[*] Length of the game is perfect for story being told.\n[*] Each gameplay mechanic cleverly twists the singing base element and uses it in a new way. Only stays long enough before it gets over used, and then moves on to the next.\n[*] Controls work rather well and great indicators for actions.\n[*] Despite music focus, can still be played by deaf/colorblind players.\n[*] No performance issues.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Negatives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] There's one jump in the game that will frustrate you. This is literally the worst thing I can think about this game. \n[*] Once in a while the game gets a strange bug that makes you laugh more then anything.\n[*] People expecting fantastic gameplay aren't going to get it here, but the thing is, it fits the game and the story. \n[*] That it hasn't sold more.\n[/list]\n\n[b] If you want more reviews/information regarding games I've reviewed, visit my curator.

      "Great game! At times it can get frustrating (boss battles), but the good out weighs the bad by a landslide. Even when i did get mad, which was a lot, I never stayed mad for long. There is just far too much to enjoy about the game. The art style is just simply amazing, the movement of your character around the world is just so satisfying once you get used to it, the puzzles aren't too easy or too hard, and everything in the game just goes together pretty much perfectly. All in all this game is extremely well made. Would recommend buying if you want a super unique experience 11/10",
      "I really, really wanted to like this game.\n\nI preface this review by saying that Guacamelee 1 is in my top 10 games of all time. I've been a gamer for 33 years. Sotn, Chrono Trigger, and FFVII are my go-tos. G-Melee 1 is a charming and original romp through a metroidvania style genre.\n\nGuacamelee 2 fails so ridiculously hard, it actually makes me sad when I think about it. The puzzles are uninspired, the abilities don't really feel enjoyable, and the platforming elements are just unforgivingly tight for the sake of it. I had all the \"schools\" maxed out before the end, it didnt make me feel any more powerful. I didn't have that super saiyan mode like in GM 1.\n\nThe final bossfight is a 3/10 compared to the first game where it is at BARE MINIMUM 9/10.\n\nI wish I could rank this game higher because I adore the original. However, this became a slog several hours before I could finish it. I would not recommend this to anyone, ever. It's light on the humor and story, it requires you to be invested in the previous game. The mechanics aren't new and they threw in some unnecessary tight, like razor thin, platforming into the game.",
      "I'm seeing a new trend in gaming here: A studio wants to port an oldie but goodie to consoles, so polishes it up a bit, releases the new version on console and gives it as a free upgrade to the PC boys. It benefits everyone, but don't get too excited.\n\nIt's not a stunning remaster, because Mark of the Ninja looked damn good to begin with. To this end, everything only got tweaked a [i]bit[/i]. The backgrounds are a [i]bit[/i] more detailed, the cutscenes are a [i]bit[/i] sharper and more fluid-moving, the lighting effects have a [i]bit[/i] more dynamic range, and the resolution is a [i]bit[/i] better. Less a remaster and more a cleanup. Most of the changes are so subtle and detailed you won't even find them by actively looking for them, but they're there.\n\nIt costs exactly the same as the special edition of the original, and includes the SE content, and if you already own the original's SE, you get the remaster for free. So basically, if you want the full MotN package, there's no reason not to pick this up. I'm just playing through it mostly because Mark of the Ninja is a kickass game with or without 4K. There is no downside to picking this up if you want the base game. Do it.",

      "I was reluctant to buy this because 2020 should be out in a few months but I couldn't pass up the deal I got. I am having a blast with this game! The presentation is wonderful, sense of speed is some of the best I've experienced, and the AI seems very human like so far. I was a little worried about the RPG elements and leveling up because I'm not really into stuff like that but it really isn't that much to worry about and I'm glad I got over myself. I've completed 2 weekends so far with default assists on and I'm currently 10 points behind 1st in the standings. I think it's time to take assists off. Oh I'm using a PS4 controller, by the way. I'll be happy to answer questions if you have any.\n\n***Update because it's super cheap with 2020 coming out soon. I still stand behind my OG review. Early reviews of 2020 indicates that there may be more realistic physics but could still use improvement. I say either get 19 now or wait for 20 to get discounted in a few months. No series is worth $60+ every single year.",
      "While it seems grindy at times, you will probably feel greatly rewarded when you can get enough resolve to spec out a specific build exactly how you want it. I think the progression of the tower abilities and gold gain is great, but even the burdens available don’t seem to switch it up quite enough. I’m on ng+4 and i feel like it’s getting a tad stale. I still like playing it of course. Some classes like the chef make the idea of playing anything else not quite worth it. I’m sure there’s some great niche builds but keep that in mind. Overall, this game keeps you on your toes. If you get hit, it’s almost always because you did something wrong. I LOVE the movement abilities in this game.

      "UPDATE: This remains to be one of the best games I have ever played. The company that created the game though... One more launcher that is completely unnecessary. The performance with the 'next-gen' update is horrible. I have half the fps I used to have on the very same rig and that is after going lower with the settings that I used to have. Why did you have to do this b U Ll $I t?\n\n\nThe best way to embrace the true greatness of this game is to look on how the series has improved since the first and the second part of The Witcher. You simply won't find anything that hasn't changed for the better.\n\n- Vast open world that IS NOT randomly created and filled with dull stuff,\n- Story which engages you from the first 10 minutes to the very end,\n- Graphics, even despite the whole controversy of a thing called downgrade, still makes this game THE BEST LOOKING RPG ever created,\n- Soundtrack, it finally goes back to the style presented originally in The Witcher 1, something that makes you forget that's just the video game, it gives you the feeling you are in there, in some village, city or that you are fighting with someone / something, which turns every single battle into an unforgettable memory,\n- Every single side quest, and believe me, there is A LOT of them, is actually a little story that keeps you playing with the same force as the main quests - I call it - a new quality in RPGs,\n- Choices and their impact on the story - even a small choice that seems insignificant at the time can wage on the whole world around you,\n- THIS GAME IS MATURE, finally a game dealing with a lot of subjects which are usually handled very childishly or not at all,\n- Combat - nothing more to add, it's decent, though it's nothing to be praised really, you won't be able to mash buttons and win - you have to dodge, use signs, and on higher difficulties get yourself ready to have an oil for a specific enemy and a bomb to be able to put an end to his or her misery.\n\nThe Witcher 3 is not a game without its flaws, although nothing that can't be fixed - some balance issues, economy basically showing Geralt as a very wealthy person (who he should not be), small performance problems like stuttering in Novigrad and in my opinion very limited after the end content (fixed by the expansions). Many of the things I struggled with have been already fixed and there is no need to disclose them. \n\nAll in all, one of the best games in the last few years (even a decade).",
      "This might literally be the coolest game I've ever played, and possibly the best game that I've played in the last 10 years.\n\nThough, I might be the wrong person to ask though as Earthbound is my favorite game, and this game is obviously heavily Earthbound inspired. Stylistically and comedy wise anyway. The story is much darker than anything in Earthbound, but it's all buried underneath some of the funniest writing I've ever seen in a game. The writing start to finish is amazing, I'm only dissappointed that the game wasn't longer as there's a few questions left unanswered.\n\nI did normal mode, first run, collected all characters and beat the game in 12-13 hours. For 10 dollars, that's pretty alright. The fights are pretty open ended as there are like 20+ characters you can choose from, but I ended up using Rage, Bottles and Mad Dog. I found it wasn't the hardest game I've played, but I also haven't tried pain mode yet.\n\nAnyway, if this game interests you at all, buy it. You won't regret it.",
      "everyone posting 16 gb ram specs and saying it runs well, lul\n\ni have 8 gigs of ram with a gtx 660 (yep) and a fx-8350 and it runs around 45-60 FPS (i cap it at 60) at High settings. yeah. REALLY well optimized, considering this computer is nearing the end of its life and the visuals are gorgeous.\n\nEDIT: 1080p :)\n\noh, and it's fun too, right.\n\nEdit 2- Actual review\n\nGame is pretty easy. I forget if there was a hard mode, but if there was I picked normal mode, and the game feels like it should be on easy. I've yet to break a sweat on a boss (currently chapter 5), and the only thing stopping me from taking on enemies 10+ higher than me is that the game auto-nerfs your damage if the enemy is too far above you. I've actually found the game very relaxing as a result, because there isn't the frustration of having to redo bosses after getting wiped, so it's not entirely a bad thing. But if you were looking for a challenge in your battles, this isn't your game.\n\nAs for story, it's also fairly basic, and rides off of having a sizeable to-do list as sidequests. Recruiting new citizens, doing major sidequest chains, unlocking new stuff, it's got a good amount to do in-game to keep you occupied, unless you're a \"main quest line only\" player. It helps that the warp system is easy to use (and you will use it often) and the game is gorgeous, so you don't really feel too bored doing the same shet over and over again. \n\nThere are several elements to the gameplay. \n\nOne, the overworld traversing. Overall, I'm ambivalent to it. It can feel slightly sluggish at parts, but collecting the shiny areas is surprisingly addicting (maybe because I'm a sem-completionist), as are finding chests. The unfortunate part is that most of these chests contain utterly useless items, so don't really feel that rewarding. \n\nTwo, dungeon crawling. Have to admit this is one of the weaker parts for me. The dungeons are basic, and don't really have much in the way of puzzling elements. Could change later, highly doubt it will. I do like how the battles are seamless, though.\n\nThree, army battles. Also not much of a fan of this, but only because it seems like a side addition without much depth to it. Fortunately it's not a major part of the game, so meh.\n\nFour, kingdom management. Holy cow I love this part of it. People might complain it feels like a mobile game with the wait times and whatever, but since you can warp straight back to your castle whenever you want, it's not that big of an issue. I do wish your gains accumulated while you're offline (or tabbed out, at least...), but idk something about managing the kingdom and making it grow/level up is stupidly addicting.\n\nOverall, if you're looking for a challenging or engaging JRPG, this might not be the game for you. If you're looking for a game with gorgeous visuals, fantastic voice acting (using JP), laid-back atmosphere, and want to be the president of the United States serving some random kid as his vassal, highly recommended.\n\nHighly recommend to play on controller. I'm using the Switch Pro Con.",
      "This is a game that should not exist. It is so niche that I struggle to understand how a company could have greenlit a project like this. But I'm very glad they did, because it is absolutely incredible.\n\nIt is a love letter to history, to writing, to stories, to culture. A gorgeously illustrated and scored, geekly researched slice of humanity, where the fate of the Universe is not at stake, where there are no cosmic heroes to save the day. What there are however, is a cast of profoundly human characters, shaped by where they came from, having to decide where they will go and what will become of their tiny, little piece of the world.",
      "[b]Content Warning[/b]: Discussions of mental illness, attempted suicide, cyberbullying, toxic gamer culture, manipulation/gaslighting\n\nThe protagonist is chosen to be an esports team manager and must make difficult decisions while trying to keep everyone on the team happy. In a society that tells people that winning and success are what give us worth, it can certainly be a struggle to accept a loss. However, if someone is surrounded by healthy friendships and perhaps even a lover, their perspective can be changed, and then it turns out, losing isn’t so bad, actually. \n\n[u]Information[/u]\n    • This is a sequel to Arcade Spirits, but someone can understand this story without knowing the first one. They just wouldn’t get some of the references, as some characters from the first game do make an appearance. \n    • The mini-game is super easy. If you fail, just reload (on the first playthrough). After the first playthrough, a new feature is unlocked to simply scroll back to try a different choice.\n    • The Rival can be friendly or hostile. \n    • Romantic scenes are tame. Implied sex only. The Rival’s romance route is definitely the most risque in terms of dialogue. \n    • 7 romanceable characters: 3 women, 2 men, 1 enby, and the Rival (any gender). \n\n[u]Praises[/u]\n    • Elaboration on the AI Iris’s origins that players probably wondered about in the first game.\n    • Neat character creation setup. Protagonist & Rival.\n    • Several pronoun options. \n    • Indicates whether a choice influences romance or not.\n    • Personality traits like in the first game are back: quirky, steady, kind, gutsy, and flexible.\n    • Amusing effects that company ridiculous jokes.\n    • Disabled character representation. A [i]romanceable[/i] character who’s a gorgeous goth.\n    • Characters are pleasantly racially diverse. \n    • Polyamory route.\n    • Critiques of societal pressures and what exactly “success” means.\n    • Various discussions of having toxic parents and other relatives.\n    • Throughout the story, various social issues are brought up related to the gaming scene: from capitalist ventures like loot boxes to branding.\n    • The game touches heavily on depression and suicide. As someone who has struggled with depression her whole life and, once upon a time, had suicidal tendencies, I found the ways those topics were integrated into the story to be helpful. (There many instances in media about “Shadow Selves” but it reminded me of Persona 4, when characters have to face the parts of themselves they want to deny.)\n    • There is a cat and there is an option to pet it.\n\n[u]Complaints[/u]\n    • Thicc body types for the protagonist/rival are drawn awkwardly and sloppily. I also feel that the devs took a step back on thicc representation in this game vs the first one. While Zapper (a romanceable character) is slightly plump, I wouldn’t necessarily categorize her as “thicc.” There were two genuinely thicc romanceable characters in the first game.\n    • Only one afro-textured hairstyle in character creation, while straight hair has several.\n    • Beginning of the game is a bit rushed. I think it’s because it’s expected of the player to have played the first game and know all about the AI Iris. \n    • I figure the devs wanted to demonstrate what disabled people go through in terms of discrimination and disrespect from others, but I feel they could’ve done better. They gave the protagonist [i]forced[/i] problematic lines and players aren’t gonna feel great about being an a$$hole to a disabled character. \n    • Sometimes, there’s too much telling and not enough showing.\n    • More resource links should be added to help people with depression and suicidal thoughts than the hotline listed after [spoiler]Coda tries to kill himself[/spoiler]. I think it would also be better if those resources were listed in the credits as well. \n\nIt seems like the most common thing people complain about in the other reviews is political preaching being in the game. I agree: things should be shown rather than told, in this case. On the other hand, I’ve literally known gamers who talk about the issues brought up in the game. I didn’t find it [i]that[/i] unrealistic. I think it’s just that a lot of it is condensed into one story, whereas, in real life, these types of subjects come up every now and then over the course of knowing people for years. \n\nDespite the flaws mentioned, I really liked the game. I do believe I liked the first one a bit better, but I’m happy with the sequel overall. It was a lot of fun and very geeky.\n\n[quote] Please follow our curator page,\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/4680120/]Otome Lovers[/url], if you'd like to see\nmore reviews like this one!

      "My previous review reflected the terrible state of the game as it was on launch day. After years of improvements, the game has had its map design & cover placement tweaked, pretty-boy playermodels have been dirtied up, cringy voicelines were adjusted & a bunch of new content has been added. A lot of my complaints were addressed and I recognize the amount of work the team has done to bring the game back. It finally feels content complete and has reached an acceptable level of quality that should've been there when it came out.\n\nHowever, I am still disappointed to say it falls very short of its predecessors in terms of gameplay, map design and atmosphere. I see no reason to play this instead of BF3/BF4. \n\nPlay the map Grand Bazaar in Battlefield 3. Look at all of the particle effects, post processing and detail that map has. It has such a thick rainy atmosphere. Play it through to the end and you'll see how players tear up the map and make it look destroyed. In BF4's Paracel Storm, the foliage will sway & the waves will rise as the strong winds of a storm approaches the map. Watch as a sandstorm creeps up in Gulf of Oman and eventually engulfs it in a torrent of chaos. These landscapes have so much drama that the ones in 2042 lack. Sure, there are sandstorms and tornadoes, but they still look so sterile compared to the previous games this title stands upon.\n\nConceptually, 2042's world is supposed to be on its knees. The growing reality of extreme climate, natural disasters becoming commonplace and the world powers fighting over the last resources Earth has to offer depicts a dire situation to immerse ourselves in. This makes me imagine maps where earthquakes adjust the layout of flags throughout the round, or tsunamis roll in and what once was a playable area is now flooded. Giant tornado events that tear down skyscrapers. Sandstorms that turn the widest of maps into a close-quarters brawl. \n\nThe maps in the game have some aspects of this concept but nowhere to the amount that it should. The technology is there. The previous games have had a genuinely impressive level of immersion and atmosphere. 2042 did not have this on launch and it still doesn't. This could have been the wild natural disaster Battlefield game where we see SHTF.\n\nI don't care that we have 128 player matches or goofy butt specialists to play as. They missed the mark with 2042 and no update can fix that, conceptually, it never was able to realize its potential.",

So you are telling me that I have to purchase this faction as well as US & OBERKOMANDO to play offline VS AI?? WTH is wrong with gaming companies nowadays?\n- Impulse Control is a lazy, badly made ripoff of Angry Birds, with slightly less features and options, poorer physics, worse quality assets, and overall worse gameplay.  But to differentiate, they slapped a Facebook style personality quiz on the front, much like putting a hat on Frankensteins Monster works well as a disguise, you know.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, the game doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.\n\nThere's no options to change the resolution for the game or customise the graphics settings.  There's no way for gamers to ensure this is running at the native resolution of their displays... there's no guarantee this game will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.  There's no way for gamers to try improve the low quality graphics.\n\nThese technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.\n\nThe game is completely free.  This is noble a gesture that shows dedication to both gamers, and the gaming industry.  Nothing speaks more to a developers belief in themselves and their product than making their game available for everyone without remuneration.  It's a shame in this case that the implementation is below the minimum standards a dedicated PC game should offer to enthusiasts.  The quality here is simply too low for me to recommend, even for free.  I really feel like this should have been a mobile app, like the Angry Birds game this is a blatant ripoff of, but then it would have to compete with Angry Birds.  It certainly doesn't belong on PC.  Sometimes the only way to win is not to play.\n- Great Game, play the Demo instead of reading reviews.\n- Two main things first up: -\n\n1)  The advertising is wrong.  This is isometric 3D for nearly the whole game, not 2D.\n2)  Do have an X-Box controller if you buy this game.  The game is far more difficult and less enjoyable if you don't.\n\n   The game shows you don't need a complex plot to make a great game.  Evil Wizard has attacked castle and kidnapped four princesses.  Your job (and that of up to three of your mates) is to go out there, beat up the bad guys, and rescue the princesses.  The game is effectively \"Double Dragon Medieval\".  You don't get to use the scenery as weapons but you do have archery, magic, fast or heavy melee options, jumping, attacks combos, different weapons, and pets that give you bonuses.  The game is reasonably fast paced - two to three massed minion attacks, mini boss, two to three more massed minion attacks, big boss.\n\n    The key game mechanic is experience points with which you can build strength (melee attacks do more damage), power (magic does more damage and recharges quicker), defence (enemy attacks do less damage), and speed (move quicker and srchery does more damage).  This means the more you play, the tougher your character gets, and the easier the enemies become.  It's quite fun playing from the start with high level characters who easily demolish the starting opposition.\n\n   The game's graphics are bright and colourful, the different soundtracks for each stage are bouncy and fun.  The enemies change regularly so the games doesn't become too monotonous but there are few foes that cannot be beaten with melee combos and dodge (that said there are a small number of mini bosses and big bosses from whom you need to keep your distance and a decent magic attack becomes essential).\n\n    Any negatives ?\n\n    1) The dev's humour is basic and scatological.  If you have a strong aversion to poo jokes this will be a negative.\n    2)  Minor spoiler - Some of the bad guys look like angry golliwogs.  Coupled with the knights' outfits that aren't too dissimilar  from the KKK this has caused accusations of racism.  Of course the KKK costumes are reminiscent of medieval knights which is the more likely inspiration for the game.  One of the princesses is definitely black.  Personally I'm not sure.  Compared with \"Birth of a Nation\" the game is \"Sesame Street\" but only an idiot wouldn't have recognised that someone would have been upset by the imagery.  Personally I can live with it and still enjoy it as a medieval Double Dragon but I give you warning in case you won't.\n\nS.x.\n\n\n- This is half of a very good game. You might be impressed in the first 10 hours, but after that it becomes evident you are playing the skeleton of what could be a generational game. Here is some of the good and some of the bad.\n\nThe Good:\n-Graphics look great, even on lower settings\n-Decently varied battle maps\n-Sound design makes killing blows feel amazing\n-Decent variety of weapons\n\nThe Bad:\n-Extremely shallow \"campaign\"\n-Almost zero role playing elements. Every character behaves identically towards you. Even your own wife will try to introduce herself. Kill someone's father/brother/entire clan? They will never mention it and will behave towards you just like anyone else.\n-\"Realistic mode\" means all your enemies will be absolute tank meat sponges while you are made of glass.\n-After you get your first settlement the game becomes extremely tedious. You will play whack a mole with enemy armies who take almost no time to recuperate. Wipe out 3 enemy armies in a massive, \"war changing battle\"? Oops, looks like all of those armies are back to full strength in a matter of days.\n-Almost zero variation of playstyles. Sure you can be a trader or a rogue mercenary for the early game, but you will always end up cheesing the smithing economy mechanics to support the larger armies you need in the mid game\n\nThis is simply an unfinished game. The fact they have been selling it for $50 successfully for years is wild.\nWould have much rather paid $100 for a fully finished product.\n\nUnless they have a massive overhaul on the \"Official Release\" October 25th, I cannot recommend this game. Shame.\n- 3 things:\n\n-Flatten land\n\n-Click citadel to get warriors\n\n-Click warriors at their warriors\n\nGood job, you've just mastered the entire game.\n\nThe game includes such crazy moments as:\n\n-Flattening land\n\n-Seeing the enemy flatten land\n\n-flattening your land faster\n\n-Clicking trees and rocks since your workers can't do shit\n\n-Clicking your warriors into their town\n\n-Watching your warriors fight their warriors\n\n-Accidentliy Alt+Tabing and having the game get stuck in windowed mode\n\n10/10 Would trust Peter Moloneux and be dissapointed again... apparently.\n\nProtip, send this to someone that loves you and watch them try to pretend that they enjoy it.\n- If you are into space opera, transhumanism, cyperpunk-esque narratives, you're going to have a great time with this one. Even with my rampant ADHD, this game has kept my focus for a lot longer than most games. \n\nThe music is banging and the story is rich and diverse with a lot of awesome twists and turns. \n\nGo and grab your chits and buy some drugs.\n- This game taught me about the diversity of cultures that our small little corner of the universe offers.\n\nThen it taught me to hate them all.\n- Great game! At times it can get frustrating (boss battles), but the good out weighs the bad by a landslide. Even when i did get mad, which was a lot, I never stayed mad for long. There is just far too much to enjoy about the game. The art style is just simply amazing, the movement of your character around the world is just so satisfying once you get used to it, the puzzles aren't too easy or too hard, and everything in the game just goes together pretty much perfectly. All in all this game is extremely well made. Would recommend buying if you want a super unique experience 11/10\n- [b]What was added:[/b]\n- Roguelike mode\n- New campaigns\n- 5 new units\n- Groove/Super groove\n- 4 new commanders\n- New OST, including Commanders'\n\n[b]What did it cost:[/b]\n- No more Arcade and Puzzles\n- A lot of maps removed from Multiplayer\n- Can't randomize weather anymore (????)\n- Can't use previous OST\n- No more Co-op campaign\n- Nothing to unlock with stars. All characters are already unlocked, so there is no point completing the campaign with more than 1 star per mission.\n\n[b]With that being said, here are some issues:[/b]\n- Balancing may need some work. Won't get into details, but it doesn't feel right, as it wasn't right in Wargroove\n- AI is still bad. Even worse than before. They just didn't touch it. They will use their Groove on cooldown most of the time, without bothering about the Supergroove. Commanders will run into you only to get surrounded and killed.\n- Once a player lose, all of his team lose, putting the game to an end. Though there is a toggle in map editor to disable it, but doesn't seem to work\n- A lot of tooltips missing for settings. We don't know what most settings are doing...\n- Tried to make a map where Commanders can respawn after 2 turns, to prevent AI to lose instantly, and let them play more agressive. But when you increment counters or set flags booleans, they get changed for both teams, making it impossible to script... Can't debug efficiently either.\n- The new Commanders' themes are glitchy when looping\n- The Codex didn't get updated properly. When selecting a Commander, we can only see a short text for the Groove, without any details.\n- In Map Editors, there are two entries for Wulfar, but using different names.\n\nI'd say if you liked Wargroove 1, you'd just like that one too. But it feels really disappointing right now. I don't know why they removed features instead of just adding new ones... In 2020, they said they were working on AI. But they did absolutely nothing.\n- ROLLBACK NETCODE BABYYYYYY\n- Game concept is good, but execution is bad. Add to that the attitude of the dev team, and I recommend you don't encourage this kind of community censorship.\n\nDon't buy this. Devs close topics because their fanboys get flamey when you bring up any kind of criticism. Like how the servers with anti-cheat and server saving (which doesn't save player status/location) functions enabled kick all players from the server every 30-60 minutes. I wouldn't mind reconnecting if my location and hunger/thirst got saved during this \"server save\". But apparently trying to open a discussion on the topic is considered flaming and they close down your topic. Horribly handled.\n\n- Screw this game.\nScrew it for having a beautifully painted artstyle that makes you think this'll be a wholesome adventure with your animal spirit pals.\nScrew it for having incredibly well-written dialogue and characters that make you connect with them as if they were part of your real life.\nScrew it for having a great sense of humor in its moments and animations. Daffodil, I'm looking at you.\nScrew it for the plethora of unique crafting minigames, especially the cooking one. \nScrew it for the many hours it takes to get through the whole story, ensuring my friend and I had many nights to enjoy the game.\nScrew it for having a heartfelt soundtrack that swells up at JUST the right time to pull my heartstrings straight out of my chest.\nAnd finally, screw it for making me cry each and every time I had to say goodbye.\nThis game touched my heart in a way very few have, and very few will.\n10/10 would ugly cry again.\n- Fun Tower-Defense style indie game. Definitely one where your skill improves every time you die. And you will die, repeatedly. :P Expect to try out many monster combinations per floor before you find something that can delay the hordes of adventurers long enough to set up the floor beneath! I would probably enjoy some more horizontal progression + permanent upgrades for long term re-playability, but it seems like a solo dev/small scoped project. Definitely worth the price for the current amount of content!\n- So this is what upsets me about rainbow six siege as a casual player. I bought the starter edition like a moron. Thats on me. But I wasn't sure I'd like the game. Turns out I do. So now that I realize I like the game I want to fully purchase the game. Turns out you can't upgrade starter to standard. The game legit punishes people who want to play it. Who paid money to basically test if they would enjoy the game.  Why should I pay $55 for a $40 edition? Just let me pay $25 for the $40 edition. I already paid the money. Why are you punishing me for wanting to spend more?\n- The Steam trailer really doesn't do this game justice.\n\nIts extremely early access right now, and the gameplay itself is nothing too spectacular (yet), but the super dynamic proximity chat is what really makes this game for me.\nHearing the muffled screams of someone getting choked out by a bug, followed shortly after by the panicked wails of another crewmember running for the life, is likely one of the funniest things I have ever experienced in a video game.\nIt truly is such a simple, yet infinitely expandable mechanic that I am really exited to see build upon in the future.\n\nPERSONAL IDEA IF THE DEVS READ THIS REVIEW:\nA monster that picks a target to stalk and follow silently. While stalking, the monster records whatever its target says, then, after it has stalked enough and kills it target, it turns from a hunter to an ambush predator. Staying stationary in the dark and playing the recorded sounds of its now dead target in order to lure in their friends.\nImagine hearing your friend, rounding the corner, and realizing that your friend is already long dead...\n- First, there was Guitar Hero. Now you've got Guitar Nero. \n\nIt's wild that this came out of nowhere, because this is easily one of the best games I've ever played. This is what I've been waiting for rhythm games to be like since Space Channel 5 on Dreamcast.\n- cool game but the font is almost unreadable at times\n- Overall, as a single player game Wargroove 2 is a tremendous improvement over the first game. The campaign is well designed and engaging, the writing is much improved and overall the gameplay is fun. The new roguelike conquest mode is a much more entertaining side thing than the godawful Arcade in 1, as well.\n\nAs a primary single player game, I hated Wargroove 1, and I can say that 2 has turned my opinion around - this game is fun, I finished the campaign and craved more, which is all you can really say! The only thing I really missed from 1 was the Puzzle mode, but maybe it'll show up in a future update? Who knows.\n\nThe major downsides is that the user interface is still the same terrible user interface that WG1 had without significant improvements, and the AI is still absolutely atrocious so playing even Vs maps against the AI is going to be pretty dull, but that hasn't changed from the first game. The soundtrack is not quite as catchy either.\n\nBut unlike WG1, I enjoyed my time with WG2 in spite of these shortcomings, and if you ever have a choice between the two, skip WG1 and just go straight into WG2.\n- The fact that you can't pause the game during cutscenes and conversations, is very frustrating. The cinematics are long (and sometimes exhausting). If your baby wakes up, If your phone rings, if someone's at the door, if you need to take a pan out of the oven... you can't pause the game! What's the deal with that? Put a pause feature! We have the technology!\n- Amazing game that I love to play, but the boyfriend that I was playing it with broke up with me a few days after playing this game. A game that's about fixing your relationship.\n10/10 game.\n0/10 in my heart.\n\nedit: why do people find this funny i wasn't kidding\n\nEdit # 2: It has been 7 months since I had originally played this game. What was originally a game of heartbreak and painful memories, I had managed to find it someone new to play with. While this game had terrible memories, I had decided that a game such as this was undeserving of them, and thus created new memories with another special person in my life.\n\nThe game is remarkable, with good writing, and amazing gameplay, and it is deserving of the buy. Each level is crafted with amazing detail, and all of the mini-games are just as fun as the main game itself. Don't let bad memories keep you down, and instead create happier ones. Live your life, ya'll.\n- Would I recommend DBD? ...It's complicated.\n\nDead By Daylight is an unique experience of asymmetric hide and seek/tag with shifting rules. \nIs the game fun? Yes. Is it creative? Yes.\nIs it fair and enjoyable? Well, it depends.\nGames get very intense, and playing as killer is some of the most intense gaming experience I've ever accumulated...\nWhich is where things often go wrong. The survivors seem to have decided that the killers have to honor strict code of rules. Don't use these items, these abilities, or these strategies. If you do, you'll be insulted after the game.\nIf you follow these rules, the odds are that you will spend the game running in literal circles, the survivors will win, t-bag you at the gate and then insult you after the game. I don't know about you, but that kind of ruins the game for me. It is actually kind of amazing how helpless one can feel in this game.\n\nSo to conclude my thoughts; I really like the game, but I also really hate it. I can't recommend it, as every time I fire it up, there is about 50% chance I feel more harassed, than entertained.\nI play a lot of online games, from League of Legends to Tekken, but this is the only one that makes me frequently think: \n\"I should really uninstall this\"\n\nEdit: \nI returned after a long break, and I still kinda like the game. \nHowever, same pattern repeats whenever I return. Eventually, I get teabagged one time too many and uninstall the game. The game is fun, the community could not be much worse. And sadly, that often ruins the experience.\n- I had never played a Monster Hunter game before this, but World has definitely turned me into a fan. The fights are exhilarating, and I always feel like I'm making progress towards something- a new gear set, a cosmetic, an upgrade for the base, or even just filling out the monster guide. The environments are sprawling, beautiful, and full of opportunites to use the terrain against your foes. \n\nI have been playing the game entirely in co-op, with no issues after the first couple weeks. Playing story missions together is unintuitive, but only a minor inconvenience once you've figured it out. And story missions account for a very small amount of the content- this game is huge.\n- You, yes you, the person that is reading the reviews.\nI envy you because i can't play this game again for the first time.\n\nScroll back up, buy the game, get a drink and take a seat.\n\nEnjoy you waifus, music, sex stories, and reflection on your own life at 2am moments.\nDon't mind the alpacas.\n\n- turns out you do alot more then just tax evasion\n\n... I murdered a snail for rent money\n- Black Mesa is a fantastic remake of the Original Valve classic and one of the greatest of all time video games, Half-Life.  This sci-fi classic FPS has you take on what might seem like a hum-drum day in the life of an experimental physicist, but things go quite off rails when experimenting with a strange material sample from an even stranger dude in a suit. \n\nAfter a while (and shooting a lot of aliens and bashing their heads in with a crowbar) you'll save the world... but now Black Mesa lets you do this with dramatically updated graphics, 4K support and a plethora of visual tweaks so you can rest assured this will run great on any gaming rig. \n\nA must have for big fans of Half-Life or gamers who are new to the scene and never got to play the original.   When on sale, of course!\n- Did you like the first two chapters?\nWell, here we have everything and tons of new and improved things, like the 2nd chapter did with regards to the first one (which was awesome, but quite simple gameplay-wise).\nA classical turn-based strategy game, now more polished than ever with wave-like combats and tons of units to start with, to upgrade and well, we don't even have real classes here - more correctly, each hero is a class on its own and has different abilities and such.\nThe story follows always the same one-way saga and you'll have to make lots of choices determining your fate, your battles and so on; the graphics are the most beautiful I've ever seen here and the soundtrack is quite amazing and atmospheric too.\nYou'll have also many features like arena combat, and a great history re-telling if you don't remember the first two chapters, plus a great tutorial to start with even if you're not new to the series and the genre.\nIt's quite fundamental if you're a little bit interested in this awesome story to play the other chapters - here in fact we'll start with all the old heroes, all the story right back from the caravan that reached Arberrang.\nWe're basically reviewing one of the best strategy tactical turn-based role-playing games of the last 5-10 years and I won't add more than this, it has already thousands of reviews and mine is quite useless I think. \nLots of endings, lots of characters to explore and promote, lots of weapons, accessories, modes.. we have everything. Recommended to anyone (maybe with a little discount).\n- POTENTIAL SPOILERS \n\n\n\nSome guy came to me asking for mercy, gave me $20 and gave me a digital watch and asked me to let him in for the love of god, I arrested him.\n\nI let a prostitute get enslaved because I felt like it.\n\nI've ruined more marraiges than Monopoly.\n\nI've made a deal with a group of terrorists.\n\nI put poison on a random dudes passport and got him killed, along with another soldier.\n\nI got shot in the face in front of my own family.\n\nI'm only 3 hours into the game.\n\n\n\n10/10 \"It's okay\", \"Like Skyrim with guns\"\n\nDid I mention I killed Biker from Hotline Miami?\n- lmao they made tetris into a full blown religious experience\n- The game itself is great, but Square Enix really dropped the ball by removing the true PC version and leaving us with this Switch port as the only option. It's a huge visual downgrade, but it has more content. Luckily though, a small handful of incredible modders have taken the time to painstakingly transfer the old, high-quality PC assets over to this version which is what saved it for me. Without the mods, I would not have kept playing.\n\nIf you're on the fence, I'd say catch it on sale, then head over to a modding site (Nexus is what I used) and start installing the mods that restore this game to its full PC potential. It's probably the easiest-to-mod game I've ever dealt with too btw. You don't have to be super savvy to get things the way you want them and you don't need any additional software. Just grab the .pak files, slap them into the game's pak folder, enjoy. It really is that simple. (You may want to edit some .ini files to tweak things to your liking, but that's as complex as it gets. If you can open Notepad, you can do this.)\n\nAs for the core gameplay, it's an incredibly solid JRPG with a likable cast and well thought out story. There's plenty of content to enjoy here and it has a good end game. The music is absolutely phenomenal as well. Visually, it's very vibrant and the aesthetic is charming. I think it's a fantastic game overall and is very enjoyable as is, but playing it in 1440p/144Hz with high resolution character and texture assets with better lighting/animation mods and subtle character/NPC/monster upgrades totally elevated it to the next level.\n\np.s. If you do install mods, I HIGHLY recommend grabbing the one that removes the black borders around characters! That gives the game a clean and refreshing new feel that greatly improves it in my opinion!\n- I love this game. I've clocked over 300 hours in it through Origin (on my ONE character xD ). It's an excellent game, even despite it being an \"open world faffaround simulator\" which was all the rage at the time.\n\nAnd finally on Steam!? Yay! Or yay..?\n\nBut, as we know, we can't have good things. Massive thumb down to the EA Origin \"integration\" in Steam. EA, how about just stop being such massive ducks?\n\nThis is the same \"we hate our customers\" behaviour expressed by d-bags like Ubisoft and Epic. Only that EA sort of makes it worse. They *know* how much people hate the unnecessary and malicious Uplay \"integration\" that Ubisoft have forced on us for several years. Seeing this, EA decides that doing the exact same thing, with their total-garbage Origin client made even worse, is surely the only way to harass the customers enough to be worthy of the EA brand. \n\nDO NOT BUY OR LINK your Steam account if you own the game on Origin from earlier. \nIf you buy a game on Steam, which you already own on Origin, it will overwrite your Origin game.\nIf you then refund the game on Steam, this will remove the game from Origin too (even if you already own it there!), and you'll spend hours in line to get a hold of customer support. Then you must chat with bots, or people who are so void of understanding (and likely not paid near enough to care) that they might as well be bots. And if you're lucky, you might, after going through 4 or 5 different \"agents\", finally get to talk to a person that comprehends English and is authorised to do anything beyond telling you \"they'll discuss it with their team\". Then you might get your game back. \nBut! You won't get back the GOTY. Because the Steam-Orgin-GOTY overwrites your Origin GOTY. And when refunding, via Steam, you're left with a dumb/lame/placeholder copy of the GOTY in your Origin library, which doesn't work, but somehow just lingers there. Then you need to get a Digital Deluxe Edition + all DLC to get back to where you were.\n\nThis [integration] is such a tremendous show of manure, that I'm actually left wondering if EA planned it. Did Andrew Wilson take one of his billions of pocked change and say \"hey, we should make an extra effort here, to make sure that this integration is as frustrating and poorly implemented as possible, but still functional, such that things are barely limping along but just barely, because nothing is as frustrating as something that just barely sorta works but only sorta, and only by the skin of its teeth. That'll teach those entitled peasants.\"\n\nSo yeah. Great game. Bad EA.\n\nUpdate! A new Origin experience: The EA App! An all new website, wrapped inside an all new Electron wrapper! For an all new Frustrating(TM) experience and much better hogging of your PC performance.\n- [h1] Floppy Knights is just boat loads of fun. If you like tactics games, this is right up your alley. [/h1]\n[b]The Good:[/b] \nThe art style. It is just so fun and creative. From the different faces that Carlton, your AI arm and best friend makes, to the enemies, even including the fully drawn cutscenes.\nThe dialogue. Everything that is said between Phoebe, Carlton, and others is tons of fun and gives plenty of plot to be invested in it. Plenty of jokes.\nThe combat, units, and general gameplay. You build a deck of up to 30 cards with a mixture of effects ranging from straight up buffing your units (or dealing damage to them with positive side effects!), to creating lots of card draw. Every turn, you draw 5 cards and your commander generates it's own card every turn. These feel unique, while not being too many of them to create bloat. You can even swap between sets of decks that you have built before you start a level, allowing you different options to quickly switch up your play style. \nThe music. There is enough of a variation of music that has a quick beat to it, that it keeps you wanting more. The songs along, ESPECIALLY the boss music, had me tapping my foot alongside it the whole time.\n[b]The Bad[/b]\nYes, every game isn't perfect. However the singular real flaw I have found is one singular bug that the devs state is rare, and it really didn't affect my gameplay at all. I wasn't able to interact with something on a map, however I was still able to clear the level. The fix was just a simple reboot, and after that I literally haven't encountered it once, at all. They are aware of it and are working on it!\n[b]The Subjective[/b]\nI'm not super great at tactics games, sometimes really taking my time or making stupid decisions. The game's difficulty to myself is fairly difficult later on, however after sitting back, thinking, and playing tactically (hah go figure!), I'm able to overcome the objective by planning around different units and synergies with the cards. There is always a factor of RNG within games that have deck building, but you can always squish the size of your deck if you so choose to.\n[b]Overall[/b]\nI would EXTREMELY recommend this game to pretty much anyone who likes turn based games that require thinking. If you aren't sure if you like tactics style games, I would HIGHLY recommend picking this up and trying it out. You won't regret it!\n- This game is really special. I'm a 50 year old man with an emotional structure made largely of mud and thumbtacks, and I had to bite the inside of my jaw in a parts to keep from tearing up. \n\nMany people seem to equate an \"adult game\" with gore and violence or explicit imagery. Nothing wrong with those types of games, I have and will continue to enjoy them. This game explores mature themes on relationships and mortality and doesn't pull any punches, without being cheap or manipulative. In that sense, its the most adult game I've ever played. \n\nI won't ever forget it. If this sounds like something you'd be interested in, stop reading and buy it. Its a slow burn, and you won't be invested until you've spent some time with the characters in the story. In the end, the payoff is tremendous.\n- Basic game, extremely well done. Like going home and eating your mom's food after decades on the road.\n\nEditing the review to mention some of the flaws of the game:\n- the level design in general is not that great, with every tiny room requiring some mindlessly easy puzzle to be solved first. Eventually it just feels like a chore.\n- not sure if it's something with my steam deck, but I had to put both the game's and the screen's brightness to the max to be able to see things; before that I was constantly missing objects and having trouble with moving around because some soil path looked like a hole in the ground or something.\n- while the game is 2d, there's a lot of different layers of height and depth that get mixed in together and may be hard to tell apart. You often don't know if some platform can be climbed onto or jumped out of until you try to do it.\n- battle system gets repetitive after a while.\n\nDespite those problems, the game is still great and more than make up for those things in other areas.\n- SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT.\n\nAs the store page states, NOREN is supposedly a 'simple' keyfinding game. That would be true if there were any keys actually in the game, but as it stands it seems that NOREN is a simple abandoned shovelware game that's impossible to progress in, let alone beat. You play as some soldier in a massive, dark castle, equipped only with a dying lantern. The light fades quickly, and you can regain light slowly by... standing by a light source. That'd be simple enough if you weren't endlessly pursued by dinosaurs that are programmed with AI which knows your exact location at all times; three chomps and you're 'aparted' from the world, where you respawn with whatever amount of light and sanity you have left. Additionally, the translation attempt is abysmal at best. \n\nBoth NOREN and its developer, ThroneLab, should be banned from Steam. I do not blow the 'scam' whistle lightly, and I only do such when I am 100% certain of something actually being a scam. There are a handful of videos of this title on YouTube as well, with only one being over 5 minutes long. No one found a key. If evidence can be presented to me that there is in fact a way to progress in this game, I will rewrite this review. Until then, beware and stay vigilant.\n\n[h1]Rating: [b]0.0/5.0[/b] - WARNING. Scam developer. Abandon all hope, ye who enter.[/h1]\nThe Horror Network [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28221963/]Curator[/url] | [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thehorrornetwork]Group[/url] Click for Gore\n- Joined the Discord Server to get a sense of the toxic, immature, insulting community. If the Discord server is not moderated, which is the first impression for new players, then you know in what state the game is.\n- So the game can be played I believe in flat screen and VR, I played in VR. You play the game in a third person prospective controlling a spirit dog. The concept is easy, get the people to the light beam, but that's easier said than done. It was very nearly a short game play video as i become really stuck to the point i nearly quit but I tried, tried and tried again until i did it. It very much reminded of a game i use to play as a kid called lemmings only in this one it doesn't matter if the people fall of the edge. Its a very challenging game, one where you can just sit and try to figure it all out. I thought it would get repetitive but each level is very different from the last. I have a game play video in which i get a bit frustrated lol if you wanted to check out some game play. https://youtu.be/7VPsLnDDDlQ\n- Only originally bought this to support the artist, since I'm a huge fan of his pixel art work. It's amazing, and there's a tonne of eye candy to fill your eyeballs with. However, I can't recommend this to everyone as after the first few hours it's become a bit of a chore.\n\n- The game is a \"clicker\" type with rpg/upgrade elements. It's too slow to play in the background/absent mindedly but not fast enough to keep your attention fully.\n- Each round/attempt at a boss takes way too goddamn long. \n- Barely any interaction with the world. You build tower defense style, and equip new items, but beyond that you don't have any special abilities, no \"oh shit\" once per loop power, no ability to target specific enemies, nothing. Just watch everything play out and hope your little guy doesn't get pulped.\n- Crafting/Supplying is sort of hidden away and if you don't know about dismantling you'll never grind out all the items you need to build new stuff.\n- Lore/Journal entries are hidden away and require resources to unlock using a little button on the bottom of the screen that's easy to miss. I only found it 20 hours in. The writing is cringey and obviously done by someone who probably enjoys Adam Sandler films.\n- The card system is a neat idea, but jesus christ there's too much garbage shuffling. Imagine playing MtG with a deck of 100 cards and 90 of them are lands, and everytime you get a new hand you reshuffle the whole deck so all you get is more lands. Oblivion (destroys a tile) rarely, if ever, pops up. \n- Character skills are kinda bad? You might get a good one every level (which again, takes forever) but half the time it'll be useless \"leave 10% of food/resources at camp\" when you're not doing a resource grind run.\n- So much trash equipment you have to sort through and breaks game flow.\n\nAnd the biggest \"don't recommend\" from me would be the issue with how combining tiles works. If you put two tiles beside each other they sometimes change the tiles to something else. Example - put a Vampire Mansion beside a Village and you get a town full of ghouls that after 3 loops around the map turns into an upgraded town. But you still get trash equipment from the quests it gives, and putting a Vampire Mansion beside any other type of town doesn't change that town at all. So there's no reason to experiment, and it really limits the gameplay. You'd think they'd focus on that aspect gameplay wise, especially with experimentation to get the most bonuses out of all your tiles... but no. There's a small list of things that interact with each other, and that's it.\n\nI still highly recommend it since the game is cheap, the art is amazing and the artist/indie devs should get support. But I think it's a good 2-3 major updates, expansions or fan modding away from getting really, really amazing.\n- TL;DR: This game didn't receive a similar love and praise than Undertale because potato. Play it.\n\n------\n\nIf you're reading this, I already like you and I already think you have a good taste in videogames.\n\nOneShot is one of those little surprises you might have heard of but always keep pushing onto your backlog, assuming other games should have more priority. Eventually I decided to try it out and it took just a few minutes to regret all those delays.\n\nIt is extremely hard to give you some useful information about OneShot without spoiling the heck out of it. You start the game in a dark, small bedroom where the main character (Niko) simply wakes up. That's it. By simply walking around and interacting with elements you soon get some clue of the mechanics that will be present through the whole game and how to progress. \n\nAnd you will also see why this game is special. \n\nWhat the game attempts is probably not new to you. It has constant elements of surprise but many other titles (Undertale as the easiest example) have done so too. When the idea is saturated, it gets harder to eventually fulfill its purpose and, well, surprise the player. \n\nOneShot is the game that will surprise you no matter what. \n\nThrough a simplistic but engaging plot, amazing and memorable soundtrack, and interesting dialogues you'll get yourself into a journey you won't regret. I wish I could give you more details but like many other reviews here, I feel like I would ruin the experience for you. The best I can do is to assure you that you will easily feel like us: that this title is an incredible gem and that you will feel bad for giving it a chance so late.\n- The Award for the worst Cancer Game 2017 goes to: Friday the 13th! \nCongrats! *clapping Hands with bloody Babytears in my eyes*\nThis Game is a complete waste of Money. Don't buy it - don't even think of buying this crappy Master Piece.\nIt's not worth it, to be honest.\nI played it for almost 200 Hours. And it's awful. Never saw a Game with these bugs, with these massive salty Community. There exactly 0 Bugfixes, so many exploits, the horrible earbleeding intro, the Community that is pure Cancer, the horrible Graphic that looks like it's straight out of the Kindergarten and the huge amount of Bugs. Bugs are normal, but MAN there are Bugs everywhere! I mean, yeah the Hype was real, but now i wish i could refund this crap.\nNever had to dream about uninstalling a game before.\nI mean, the Devs. are just Human like you and me - but honestly - never saw someone who failed his job like this.\nJust do me a favor, don't buy it. It's not worth the Ragequits, the broken Keyboards, the Heartattacks and it's definitely not the Money worth!\nNever want to touch it again.\n\nAnd btw. thank you for killing the Sealmothers and making the babyseals crying bloody sad little Tears. </3\n- Who would win?\n\nThe highest-grossing media franchise of all time OR 2 British bois\n- everyone posting 16 gb ram specs and saying it runs well, lul\n\ni have 8 gigs of ram with a gtx 660 (yep) and a fx-8350 and it runs around 45-60 FPS (i cap it at 60) at High settings. yeah. REALLY well optimized, considering this computer is nearing the end of its life and the visuals are gorgeous.\n\nEDIT: 1080p :)\n\noh, and it's fun too, right.\n\nEdit 2- Actual review\n\nGame is pretty easy. I forget if there was a hard mode, but if there was I picked normal mode, and the game feels like it should be on easy. I've yet to break a sweat on a boss (currently chapter 5), and the only thing stopping me from taking on enemies 10+ higher than me is that the game auto-nerfs your damage if the enemy is too far above you. I've actually found the game very relaxing as a result, because there isn't the frustration of having to redo bosses after getting wiped, so it's not entirely a bad thing. But if you were looking for a challenge in your battles, this isn't your game.\n\nAs for story, it's also fairly basic, and rides off of having a sizeable to-do list as sidequests. Recruiting new citizens, doing major sidequest chains, unlocking new stuff, it's got a good amount to do in-game to keep you occupied, unless you're a \"main quest line only\" player. It helps that the warp system is easy to use (and you will use it often) and the game is gorgeous, so you don't really feel too bored doing the same shet over and over again. \n\nThere are several elements to the gameplay. \n\nOne, the overworld traversing. Overall, I'm ambivalent to it. It can feel slightly sluggish at parts, but collecting the shiny areas is surprisingly addicting (maybe because I'm a sem-completionist), as are finding chests. The unfortunate part is that most of these chests contain utterly useless items, so don't really feel that rewarding. \n\nTwo, dungeon crawling. Have to admit this is one of the weaker parts for me. The dungeons are basic, and don't really have much in the way of puzzling elements. Could change later, highly doubt it will. I do like how the battles are seamless, though.\n\nThree, army battles. Also not much of a fan of this, but only because it seems like a side addition without much depth to it. Fortunately it's not a major part of the game, so meh.\n\nFour, kingdom management. Holy cow I love this part of it. People might complain it feels like a mobile game with the wait times and whatever, but since you can warp straight back to your castle whenever you want, it's not that big of an issue. I do wish your gains accumulated while you're offline (or tabbed out, at least...), but idk something about managing the kingdom and making it grow/level up is stupidly addicting.\n\nOverall, if you're looking for a challenging or engaging JRPG, this might not be the game for you. If you're looking for a game with gorgeous visuals, fantastic voice acting (using JP), laid-back atmosphere, and want to be the president of the United States serving some random kid as his vassal, highly recommended.\n\nHighly recommend to play on controller. I'm using the Switch Pro Con.\n- I didn't like the FPS section; was honestly pretty repetitive and gratuitously violent. Also the 8 hour sex scene was a bit out of nowhere, but after like hour 3 you understand why they devote so much time to it. Overall game was ok I guess\n- Everytime I browser my library, looking something to play, I see this game and I think: Rayman is cool, I gonna play, but then I remember this \"Requires 3rd-Party Account: Uplay\", and then I give up.\n- Can we please get an online co-op? My s/o and I both have the game and remote play doesn't work cuz internet connection is too slow. So we can't even play this game that we were super excited to play together. Please update for an online co-op!\n- This is the purest Megaman experience I've had in years. I don't remember the last time I sat down with a Megaman-style game like this and just had pure Fun, and got fully engrossed in it over everything else. 20XX? No. Fangames? No. Even Megaman 11 didn't grab me this hard. This is it. This is the game people wanted when they saw Mighty Number 9 the first time. This is the Megaman successor we've been waiting for.\n\nIf I had to say anything negative about it, it'd be the music. It's mediocre at best. It's Meh. It does its job and fills dead air, but I'm not rushing to download the OST any time soon. I can't think of a single track that I went \"wow I need that\" for. It doesn't hinder my opinion of the game, but I would have loved it even more if it had gotten this right.\n- This is the best Civilization up to this point, and the DLC just made it even better. I will grant that the with all the add ons it would feel a tad crowded to anyone who hadn't played it before, but you have a crazy amount of options. The game series tagline of \"one more turn\" could not be more applicable.\n\nYou can strive for one of several victories: diplomatic, cultural, technological or domination. Each has its unique challengers to overcome and create a lot of the fun of the game. They are also not necessarily mutually exclusive and after completing one victory, you can go for the others. Each AI opponent has their own personality, and are pretty predictable in how they behave. Any one who has started the game next to Neopoleon or Ghengis Kahn knows they immediately have to have a decent military to repel invasion, while Ghandi will to muscle you out with religion and culture.\n\nThere are some important changes between Civilization IV and V. One of the most notable is that wars are plausible again as you dont constantly lose health in enemy territory and cities are easier to conquer. Additionally, culture doesn't automatically take over neighbor's cities anymore. \n\nThis game is easily worth the money. I'm not entirely sure how it stacks up to Civilization VI, but any game that I log 200+ hours on over a period of years and still haven't come close to doing everything is doing something right. A great game from a great series.\n- no autosave, plus crashes, so if you put in several hours and never saved - you lost ALL the progress on ALL stages on a random crash, That makes me wanna quit the game and not play it anymore. Overall game is very good, but multiple bugs were never fixed, so you're basically buying the old buggy version of it.\n- *puts on hipster cap* Well I have played this before, and let me tell you it is quite the experience.\n\nYume Nikki is a bare-bones surreal game created with RPGMaker. You play as a young girl (Madotsuki, according to the fandom) who refuses to step outside of her bedroom. Besides the dreadfully boring video games in her room, all she can do to entertain herself is to sleep, entering into her dream world. The \"goal\" of the game is to explore her dreams, collecting the various effects and bringing them back to the main nexus.\n\nLittle is known about the creator, and even less is known about the game's story. Yume Nikki lives very much by the philosophy of \"Show, Don't Tell\". There is no dialogue, music is limited to short sound bytes on loop, and the graphics look like something out of the 16-bit era. Despite all of this, Yume Nikki still managed to gather an almost cult-like following; the amount of fan work and theories created for Yume Nikki is truly astounding.\n\nPlenty of games try to capture the beauty and wonder of our dreams, but the reality is they can also be ugly and painful experiences, dredging up our deepest subconscious fears and desires. Yume Nikki refuses to shy away from the dark and the strange, understanding that this what gives our dreams meaning. Like any abstract art piece, it is impossible to place a singular meaning on anything in Yume Nikki. Everyone will interpret and relate to its events differently, and perhaps this is the crux of what let Yume Nikki gather its cult following.\n\nIts greatest strength is also its greatest weakness. The complete lack of direction is not exactly user friendly. This game does not hold your hand. There is no map, so the only way to figure out where to go is to get hopelessly lost many times as you explore the strange worlds behind each nexus door. It will be tempting to simply look up a guide, and I must admit I was guilty of watching a play-through myself for some parts. Indeed, completing the game without looking anything up is an achievement in itself.  However, the game was meant to be played, not watched. The joy (and sometimes terror) of discovery makes the experience worth experiencing. After you've given the game a proper playing, THEN you should look up all the stuff you inevitably missed. Cough cough [spoiler]Uboa[/spoiler] cough cough.\n\nWith that in mind, I humbly offer some advice to make your experience a bit more palatable. Feel free to ignore this if you wish to remain completely spoiler-free.\n\n1) Know the controls! They are not explained very well in the game.\n\nArrow keys: Movement\nZ: Accept; interact with objects (also Enter, Spacebar)\nX: Cancel; open the game menu (also C, V, B, N, Insert)\n1: Use an effect’s ability\n3: Cancel an effect’s ability\n5: Drop an effect on the ground (only in the Nexus)\n9: Pinch yourself to wake up and return to the real world. This one is especially important to remember, as sometimes you may find yourself in a dead-end zone leaving this as your only means of escape.\n\n2) Each time you wake up, make sure to use the desk In the real world to save your progress.\n\n3) Be thorough. Many of the dream worlds are expansive, with few landmarks. However, many of them also warp at each end, meaning if you walk in a straight line you will eventually return to where you started. You can use this to your advantage while mapping out the more expansive zones. Take note of interesting landmarks that you can use for future exploration. It might be helpful to keep some scratch paper handy if you have a bad memory like me.\n\n4) Interact with everything. If you see anything that looks strange or out of place, give it a poke. There are few enemies in the game, and nothing can actually kill you. Sometimes that creepy object might be the ticket to transport you into a new area. Also, try using different effects in different situations. You may find they have useful properties.\n\n5) Search for the bicycle effect first, it will make exploration much easier as it greatly increases your movement speed. You can find the bike effect in [spoiler]the zone behind the right door at the bottom-most side of the nexus[/spoiler]. I will leave locating it to you.\n\n\nWell, what are you waiting for? Give this game a try, you have nothing to lose! Except, maybe your sanity. Eh, you didn't really need that anyway.\n- Wylde Flowers is a magical farming simulation. The spoken dialogue is wonderful and touches on difficult subjects, such as grief, estrangement from family members, and gender identity. The characters are diverse, have complex personalities and are really funny.\n\nThis game could be considered as Stardew Valley's even gayer little sibling. On a more serious note, it can be friendlier than Stardew Valley for first time or younger gamers, because of its simplicity, tightly told storyline (it is not an \"endless game\" as Stardew can be) and guided playthrough.\n\nIn my opinion, the game could be improved on a few fronts: character customization is one of them, and the fact that Tara, the main character, wears the same dress-leather jacket-chelsea boots millenial outfit during all seasons (including to bed, while sleeping over the covers) icks me profoundly. \n\nFinally, the pace of the game is a bit confusing to me, in the sense that it can be difficult to balance the storytelling aspect of the game with the more concrete tasks.\n\nAltogether, Wylde Flowers is a beautifully conceived game, filled with positivity, magic, a good soundtrack, and charming visuals.\n\n\n\n- I played the demo and instantly became enamored. The mix of Slay the Spire-style deck-building with elements of the ship combat from FTL: Faster Than Light is an absolutely fascinating mix, and the \"single-axis\" movement system adds a whole extra layer that I've never seen in anything except the Mega Man: Battle Network series.\n\nI bought the full game within the first hour of being available. After having played for nearly 4 hours at the time of writing, my opinion hasn't changed in the slightest. I already love what's available and so far I feel like I've barely scratched the surface.\n\nI can't wait to see what awaits in the future for this awesome title.\n\nEDIT: As a small addition, I will say: I beat my very first run, which is set to the lowest difficulty (Normal). I jumped up to Hard to try to unlock a new ship, and I haven't been able to beat a run since then. It's probably just that I'm bad, all things considered, but be aware that the changes made with difficulty increases are probably more impactful than they may seem.\n\nAlso I wanna say to the devs: thank you for launching the game with mod support and working on making it easier! But also please look into getting Steam Workshop support if you can!\n- Gone are the days of mindless building and fun. Power grids? Taxes? Intense accounting and counter-intuitive path building. A pre-built zoo for tutorials. I actually felt MORE stressed after playing this game. If you're looking for something to flex that brain, perfect. If you're looking to release the cougars and create chaos, you can do that in sandbox I guess. You could also just not connect power grids correctly. Works like a charm. Honestly who thinks of these things\n- Guys this game is brilliant!!\n\nIf you have the chance and you like nostalgic and engaging exploration and mystery solving, I promise you won't regret buying this one.\nI honestly kept searching for more games like this at Steam and I was not able to find any that were this good.\n\nThe pixelated artwork is >very< detailed.\nI don't know how to describe it, but every scene feels like it's straight out of a framed vintage painting that you'd see in a farm cottage made by the grandfather of the previous owner. It just has this vibe, and I love it.\n\nAll characters are voiced and the VAs did a really great job, especially the main VA. Sarcastic, funny and witty lines are all over, as well as capturing the weight of each life, of their memories, and when they share their stories.\n\nYou won't regret playing this one! Go ahead, and have a great excavation...\nDon't forget: the answer lies in the soil...\n- i would recomend it because the physics are great, the game has 8 or 9 level packs (i dont know if there will be a 9th because there are 7 at the time of this review) the units are diverse, there are a lot of secret units to find and i dont know for the final boss because the most expensive unit artimis isnt a good final boss like the dark pesant in the alphas but i hope that the games final boss unit is actually hard to kill and requires more than 7 archers because that wasnt hard or anything hopefully they will make the most expensive unit actually overpowered and unballanced because that would be a great final boss, the sandbox mode is great i like the custom campains , the custom units arent out yet so i cant say anything about that over all this game is worth the money and if its near a sale time like a few days away from a sale then get it on sale if not then just get it you wont regret it and if it lage turn off all the graphics settings\n- It's responsive, quick and smooth, the Arrange and Matsuri modes are a treat, and it sounds/looks wonderful. Finally, a better shmup than Crimzon Clover is on Steam! Highly, highly recommended.\n- To be honest, this game is a bit of an acquired taste. At first I didn't get it: Few options to customize your army, at the beginning of a battle every unit has its predetermined place on the map, there's an unforgiving time limit to reach your objectives and the graphics could be much better. The first encounters with an entrenched enemy ended in a bloodbath for my units, despite overall superiority in numbers and total command of the air. And when I learned that you don't necessarily keep your veteran units after a successful battle but sometimes have to start the next scenario with new ones, I came close to deleting the game.\n\nLuckily, I  didn't. Like any decent strategy-game, UOCII takes some time to learn. The game's mechanics and its reliance on logistics are the main differences to most others I've played. The first lesson: Your success depends heavily on understanding both your own and the enemy's supply network. Finding his vulnerable spots while protecting your own is elementary. Once you figured out where to strike and with which units, your chances improve dramatically. The AI is quite good and will help you find your own weak spots soon enough – a single forgotten enemy in your rear can easily stop the most impressive offensive, if it decides to block the one railway line supporting all your units and your HQ. +-To make things more interesting, the game relies on Headquarters, which you have to move around together with your regular units. These HQ can and must be improved over time to learn additional “skills” like bridge-building, special orders, emergency supply etc. During a battle, they must be kept within range of your units to be effective, giving the game a bit of an role-playing-aspect: One or several generals moving around, each commanding a part of your force, never too close to the firing line, all the while learning new skills and helping your units to do a limited number of special tricks. Nice flavour.\n\nI could write a lot more, but to sum it up: UOCII is a really rewarding strategy-game with some new and interesting features I haven't found anywhere else. It's not perfect – more options to customize or to place units would be welcome and the difficulty in some of the later DLCs is quite brutal -  but all in all it's very much worth its price. Still enjoy it after several years and look forward to the next DLC (Africa) :-)\n- HOW?? WHY?? WHY IS THIS GAME SO GOOD?? IT HAS NO REASON TO BE THIS GOOD WTF?\nThe trailers or advertisements will not even give anything close to a sense on how good this story, build up, characters and mechanics (did I mention the story?) really is.\n\nShu Takumi and Yasumasa Kitagawa, you've done it again, from Ace Attorney to this. I can 100% say if you haven't played this game, you are definitely missing out.\n\n10/10!!!\n- Upon further play, the game wasn't super luck based, it just doesn't do a great job explaining core mechanics that are crucial to gameplay. It has a more hands off, let the player discover how this works type of playstyle, but a simple line of dialogue alluding to these features would have been nice. That said, the story is really gripping, the gameplay (once learned) is fun, and overall, I definitely think it's worth $20.\n- This game isn't for me, as it turned out it is too fast-paced for me to enjoy. But I really do want to recommend it. The game works fine, and the controls are solid, by that I mean you do feel in control, even though I only played a little I died a lot, but it never felt unfair. You get to do a lot of customization, and it is fun, but I just don't have the right temper for games where you die a lot. 7/10.\n- I definitely would not recommend this. The aesthetic of it might appeal to some people, which is what initially drew me in, but the visual awe wears off after seeing the same scene too many times. The game is best played with paper and pencil in hand so that you waste as little time as possible wandering around in a straight line. \n\nThis game survives off of the mysterious nature of its content in the sense that if people knew how small the experience was, they would not buy it. I was thoroughly let down by this game, especially since its promotional material hyped me up for an exploration game with a unique method of interacting with the world. \n\nThe main feature that sets the game apart from other titles, the use of the telephone to access parts of the static world, becomes little more than a password screen used to pick up where you left off or were booted out of your game by a short time limit. After the first two or three times I used the game's core feature, I was tired of it and wished there was a way to play the game that was faster or had more depth.\n\nFor anyone who has played or seen any amount of gameplay from Yume Nikki, you will realise that this game's design begs the audience to compare the two. However, the most useful comparison to draw between the two is by using the game that Madotsuki can play in her room as an example. In Madotsuki's game, \"Nasu,\" is a joyless game about catching fruit. It is repetitive, intentionally annoying, has no bearing on your progression/success, and is meant to urge you toward doing something else. Unfortunately, this is a suitable comparison, as it succeeded in making me feel like Madotsuki in real life and I want to turn off the game and do almost anything else in record time.\n\nI truly wanted to like this game, but I cannot justify spending $5 for this experience when I played better flash games all the way back in middle school for free.\n- G.A.R.B.A.G.E\n\nuhm idk man, it was but it just isn't, you know? because I don't know??? lots of bugs, cinematics are rushed, game is rigged, friends cheat... FUCKS THIS SHIET\n- Events that took place:\n\nDid not want to sell player,\nGot an offer for said player,\nRejected the offer,\nPlayer demaned to be allowed to speak to the club,\nGot a second offer from said club,\nEssentially forced to accept the offer,\nPlayer reached an agreement with the club,\nWished player the \"best of luck\" in his future endeavours,\nPlayer is angry that he is leaving,\nPlayer considerers his new club a \"step down\" in his career,\nReminder: Player demanded to go to said club,\nMe finding solice in the fact that FM19 although lacking in the football department, delivers a brilliant experience in dealings with manic and psychotic people.\n\nAllow me to grant you an insight into SI's employee knowledge on the subject their games are about. I once engaged in a conversation with a developer at SI about FM, and football in general. After some talking about premier league, and me slightly confused, I eventually understood that this developer thought that Tottenham Hotspurs were located in Liverpool. So I posed him the following question: \"Then why do they call any matches between Tottenham and Arsenal the 'North London Derby'?\" to which he responded that he did not know, but he assured me that Tottenham F.C was located in Liverpool. I had to resort to showing him the borough of Tottenham in London for him to understand that Tottenham Hotspurs is not lovated in Liverpool, but in fact in London.\n\nThis will be the last edition of this game series I will ever purchase. In a football management simulator such as this, letting SI and their employees (including the one that responded to this review) tell you various aspects of football, is like having a pervert preach to you about the virtues of sexual absitence. They know nothing, and since the core game has not progressed the slightest in 10 years, it would be a fair assumption that they do not care neither.\n\nFuck SI, Fuck their beloved \"devs\" and fuck Charlton Heston while you're at it.\n- [h1] My tier S game [/h1]\n\n[b] This game is fantastic! [/b]\n- Well-incentivised exploration\n- No bs OP bosses, no random encounters, no pointless fetch quests \n- Packed with content; lots of it\n- Mini games and a variety to the gameplay\n- No need to play the first instalment of the series (8bit adventure 1)\n- The last boss fight is epic\n- Memorable cast of characters \n- No grinding needed; you will be OP just by playing it\n- Stress: The videogame.\n\nBut in all seriousness, Isaac is an awesome roguelike game with infinite replayability. It's tough at first but as you get better at the game you will appreciate it more and more for the unique experience it provides. Every run feels different and even after getting close to 2k hours of playtime I still discover new things.\n\nAll DLC, and especially the latest of them - Repentance - introduce a ton of new content on top of the already existing one.\nThere are 34 characters in total, over 600 steam achievements and 3 save files to choose from.\n\nOn top of that, the game features a community workshop with countless great mods that add Quality of Life improvements and new features for every taste.\n\nIf you enjoy roguelikes or are looking for a game with great replay value then I can wholeheartedly recommend Isaac to you.\n- So Epic takes over, breaks the game, can't connect to the Epic Services so I can't play, takes away garage items, and then Steam blocks new reviews due to \"off topic\" review activity unless you change the settings manually. Went from a game a played daily to a game I literally can't play. Epic can go blow themselves.\n- Okami is the best non-Zelda Zelda game, but also best dog simulator.\n\n10/10 Dog features include:\n\nYou can bark at people for no reason! You can dig up bones! You can catch a birb in your mouth and then prance! You can bite people in the crotch and they are like \"hey! what! why i oughta!\" If you see a demon, you can pee on it!\n\n\nPlease purchase The Legend of Dog Zelda for a good time.\n- The game is a masterpiece, just like the first one. After finishing PoE 1, I immediately started with the second one and I was treated to another marvel of a game. Here are some of my thoughts:\n\nThe Good:\n-Very good main story but the side content is what made this game great\n-Interesting and deep characters, both new ones and some returning from the first game, including companions\n-The story picks up after the events of the first game and is a direct continuation of the first game (just like with Baldur’s Gate 1 and 2)\n-If you still have the savegame-files from the first game, your decisions and consequences from the first game will carry over\n-There is so much lore, if you are into reading and listening to stories\n-A lot of voice-acting\n-A lot of pets you can collect and the equipped one has a small benefit to your party\n-Interesting races and sub-races, each with its own boons and downsides\n-Interesting classes and sub-classes, including the possibility of multi-classes\n-You can retrain your characters\n-You can make a new character to join your party at any time at tavern\n-Item and weapon diversity (including pistols)\n-You have the option to play the game as either turn-based (like divinity original sin) or real time (with game pause, just like Baldur’s Gate)\n-You can sail the seas as a pirate and attack any ship you meet without consequence. The ships on the map will respawn endlessly so you will never run out, which makes them a real great source of income.\n-Besides the ship you are given at the beginning, there are a few others you can buy. Each has its own benefits\n-Ship, crew and sailing require some management, but if you like this sort of stuff you can get real invested in it \n-Exploring the map by ship, if you are into that kind of stuff\n-When engaging other ships, you have a choice between boarding or naval combat\n-Endurance is no longer a thing so you only need to manage your Health during fights. You will like this if you were not a big fan of the Endurance vs Health system from the first game\n-The resting system has improved. Besides taverns, now you can rest anywhere you want as long as you have food\n-No inventory management is necessary. Your inventory is infinite so just pick everything up because sooner or later you might need things like explosives, potions, tools etc.\n-Choice matters, and boy are there a lot of different paths you can choose from\n-Romance options\n-Bounties are fun and offer good experience and money\n-DLCs are a bit shorter than the one from the first game, but they are just as good (will not describe them to avoid spoilers)\n\nThe Bad:\n-Loading screens are too long and too many\n-Just like in the first game, I reached max level at about 2/3 of the game(max level 20) so any experience gathered beyond that was pointless. By the end of the game could have easily reached level 30 if that was a thing\n-Naval combat is scripted, so it might not be as spectacular as you might imagine\n-Exploring islands on foot isn’t so much fun\n-The idea of factions might not be to everyone’s liking\n-After playing for a few hours, the game performance seems to decrease and my pc struggled with running it. Maybe the game has an optimization problem but it’s possibly that this one is on me and the game is fine. This might not be the case for other users.\n\nAdvice:\n-In the beginning of the game, try to reach Neketaka asap and do as many quests there as you can before heading out on your ship exploring the seas\n-Pick everything up. Your inventory space is infinite and you will end up needing diverse items like explosives, traps, tools etc.\n-Always have tools with you: hammer and chisel, prybar, lockpicks, grappling hook. You will really need them from time to time\n-Plundering other ships is a great source of experience, resources and money but be careful not to burn yourself out if you do it for too long\n-If you get stuck on a quest, just do some online research\n-Invest money in your ship and crew as soon as you can\n-Always have a tank and healer in the party\n-Make sure to diversify the skills of your party. It’s always good to have someone with Mechanics, Religion, Athletics or Diplomacy most of all\n-Enchant your items\n-When you get the white/grey colored legendary items, make sure to bind them to the character you equip them on and do the mini-quests inscribed on them to unlock new powers and features\n-Use summons, as they are great for distracting enemies. They can take a lot of hits and also dish it out\n\nMy game experience:\nI played on the classic (normal) difficulty, just like I do with every new game I start, and found the game not very hard but fun. I played the game in real time, because turn-based takes too long. As soon as I got my first ship working, I sailed to Neketaka, found the last companions I knew I wanted on my permanent team (Maia and Pallegina) and just quested away in the city until I had enough money and levels under my belt to start exploring the seas and attack other ships. I never did the scripted naval combat because I was having too much fun boarding the ships and watch my characters fight. My party consisted of my Watcher (Moon Godlike, Chanter, specced in summoning), Eder (because he’s a beast of a tank and has some fun interactions with others), Xoti (gotta have a healer, she’s also fun to have around), Maia Rua (very good ranged DPS and she comes with a pet cause she’s a ranger) and Pallegina, who is an excellent off-tank and support character. Once I took to the seas, I made my fortune by plundering ships, equipped my ship and characters with the best money could buy and then just catered to the different existing factions in the Deadfire, while not loosing sight of my main mission.\n\nI had a great time playing Pillars of Eternity 1 and 2. I consider they offer some great replay value and are great fun if you are into this style of RPG games. If you are a fan of games like the Baldur’s Gate, Icewind Dale, Diablo, Dragon Age, Neverwinter Nights and Divinity Original Sin series, you must try PoE 1 and 2.\nI really hope they make Pillars of Eternity 3.\n\n- Visually-speaking, this is possibly the highest quality otome I've ever played. Characters blink, their mouths move when they speak, and even backgrounds have some animated aspects, such as water movement, crackling fires and other neat little touches. The art is top-notch and, in my opinion, the game's strongest point.\n\nAnother aspect that makes Bustafellows a standout is the heroine. Teuta has much more presence than a lot of other protagonists in the genre because she has a face, voice and strong personality. She's her own character and not one of those 'we're going to make MC as bland as humanly possible for self-insertion purposes' heroines, which I very much appreciated.\n\nThe Steam version is a bit clunky compared to the console release, and at times it suffered from some pacing issues, but all the characters and their interactions were enjoyable. The main story was great; I really loved the group dynamic they established in the common route, and while Shu and Crow were definitely my favorites, there was nobody I really disliked as a love interest. They each had an interesting story behind them and unique dynamic with Teuta.\n\nThe final stories that attempt to wrap everything up were the only part of the game that just really didn't do it for me. I can't go into much detail without spoilers, but the best I can describe it is everything comes at you too fast, parts of it felt out of nowhere, and for me it was a downer. Not awful enough to ruin the game, and some of the ideas were good, but I feel like they were executed poorly.\n\nAll in all, Bustafellows is one of the better otome games out there. It's not perfect, but its strengths shine brighter than its flaws, and I'm dearly hoping Bustafelllows Season 2 gets localized so I can see more of its wonderful art and characters.\n- [h1]SMOOTH RIDING WITH A FEW BUMPY ROADS[/h1]\n\nFirst off, I am going to get this out of the way. If you are planning to buy this game and wondering which version to get, ask yourself this. If you are a minimalist, standard is fine. If you want the expansions, get ultimate. Deluxe on the other hand I think is worth skipping entirely. If $99.99 is too much for you for Ultimate, just wait for a sale. Ultimate is definitely my choice for recommendation. The amount of content you get is impressive and worth the price of admission. \n\nForza Horizon 4 is a car collector's dream, with a roster of over 700 cars (with Ultimate). And also a racing enthusiasts dream playground with a decently sized map with tons of racing variety and events to play around with. I have tons of racing games on Steam personally, and none have held my interest as much as Forza Horizon 4. It's a shame though that this came so late to Steam. But even still, I got my money's worth with over 120 hours of playtime at the time of writing this. \n\nIs Forza Horizon 4 perfect though? Sadly, it is not. The Steam version is hampered with some unfortunate bugs. People may experience random crashes, which while not happening often after the last few updates, still do happen, as this game is a few versions behind the Microsoft store's own version. Something I don't know if will ever be fully fixed. Also online racing can be hit or miss with issues. Those issues usually lie in the wait times sadly, so it might be offputting for those looking to race with others. Luckily there is more than enough content without having to do online races to keep most people happy. \n\n I'm still giving this a recommend regardless of that issue, just because more often than not, the game does run smoothly. \n\nIf you happen to just get the standard version of the game you get access to the main map which is a caricatured version of Great Britain, which includes many race events ranging from your standard street races, dirt tracks and even full blown off road events. There are also other events which include speed traps, drifting, massive jumps, promotional events (like racing the Halo Warthog, racing against trains, and more), and some cool little story events like racing for Top Gear, or even opening your own businesses. There's plenty of content for sure. If you decide to get the expansions, you get other maps, including Fortune Island, which is, well, an Island, complete with both low and high altitude locations, lots of off roading, some impressive night time visuals (Aurora Borealis anyone?), and more. You also get the Lego Speed Champions map which is a fun and impressively designed map based on the Lego toys which features it's own variety of fun and unique settings, including a beach riddled with pirate ships, a haunted lighthouse, a stunt arena, and more. Also it gets it's own radio station that plays just 1 song on loop. If you guessed that song is \"Everything is Awesome\", you'd be right, Both expansions also come with a unique way of progression and their own vehicles to collect. Fortune Island will have you progress to unlock a variety of treasure hunts, that each unlock 1 million credits, and the Lego expansion has you doing different tasks to collect studs which can be used to build your house and also collect new cars. Both expansions will also include a majority of the types of events you will be used to in the base game, with their own unique flair. \n\nWith 700 cars luckily there is enough variety for anyone. But for those looking for more, you can custom tune each vehicle to your own liking, with a variety of parts and overhauls, including full blown engine swaps. For those who are not gear heads, the community has you covered and you can even download custom tunes from others. Forza Horizon 4 is one of the most generous racing games I have ever played with the sheer amount of cars they dump on you. You can win cars from events. You can win cars from wheelspins. you can win cars from leveling up. You can win cars from performing certain tasks. You can win cars from barn finds, which are like little treasure hunts. You can also buy cars from both an auto show, or take your chances at an in game auction house, which is also a great way to make money, to well, buy more cars. Basically, Horizon does not let you down with the cars. It's like Pokemon for car lovers. And once you have that dream car, don't forget to give it that unique look. Most cars can have some visual parts swapped out, ranging from spoilers to bumpers and more, and you can add custom designs to the paint jobs too. Want to race around in Jurassic Park Jeep? Want to race around in the Bandit 1 from Smokey and the Bandit? Forza has you covered. And if you just want to look at the cars in all their glory, Forza also has a nice little feature called Forzavista which allows to do things with your car like opening and closing doors, and for some vehicles you can open up trunks and hoods and look inside at the engines. If you get the James Bond pack, you can even look at those nifty little gadgets like the machine guns mounted to some of the Bond vehicles. Pretty neat stuff. \n\nAt the end of the day, is Forza Horizon 4 worth it? I'd say yes.\n- Know your History: \n\nMany of you will already know this, but this game has ties much deeper than you think. It's no secret that Bethesda's Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim had extended it's life through an extensive modding community. For decades, literally, ENBs, shaders, textures, companions, and even story-lines added THOUSANDS of hours to an already sizable game. One story-line mod was called \"The Forgotten City\".  Over the next few years since it's release, the mod had acquired awards such as the 2016 Australian Writers' Guild Award, Zero Period Top 5 Quest Mods of 2015, and others. It was an astounding mod that threw the dragon born into a deeply profound, well written, and engaging story. It was a staple for my personal mod list for years. I've played the Skyrim version countless times, but as soon as I saw this release I immediately bought this and booted it up. \nObviously this is nothing like the mod, both visually or engine wise, but the spirit of the game is still there. It's more defined, expanded, and developed. It deserves every award and accolade it's received. When I walked into the opening scene and fell down the tunnel I couldn't help but shake my head and smile as a wave of nostalgia mixed with new expectations flooded my mind:\n\n\"My god, they've done it.\" \n\nHere's to you, Modern Storyteller, all the best and more to come!\n- Instant uninstall after reading the privacy policy.\n\nShort version: \"We may collect any data we want (including sensible personal data) from the user and transmit it to anyone the laws allow us to. Also we may transmit your data to any foreign country where other (read: laxer) data protection laws may apply.\"\n\nUpon installation and booting up the game, the very first thing you will be asked to do is accept these conditions and enter your age so they can send it (together with other data) to third parties which will then show you \"appropriate\" advertisement ingame.\n\nYeah SEGA, aint no way I am saying yes to that. Uninstalled and refund requested.\n- The story of this game is interesting and well written, but it doesn't fully make up for the game's flaws. Here are the problems I saw with the game.\n\n1. There are a wide variety of guns available, but very few combinations of those guns are viable. The shotguns are rarely viable for combat with gun wielding enemies, since advancing far enough forward to make shotgun damage effective inevitably puts you in the line of fire of enough of your enemies to prove lethal. Other weapons like sniper rifles and pistols have critically low DPS and a low maximum ammo cap, making them almost universally not viable. Additionally this game likes to spring ambushes on the player in a way that takes away any advantage gained from long range optics. The special pneumatic weapons in the game also suffer from a low ammo cap. This leaves you with assault rifles, which the game seems to have been made for.\n\n2. In encounters with bestial enemies it is frequently impossible to avoid taking damage. The enemies sprint at you in packs which even sustained automatic shotgun fire cannot fully stop. Some of the boss enemies are even worse in this department. In normal mode with the larger health pool and regeneration over time this wouldn't be such a problem. But in ranger mode this makes certain obstacles unbeatable. You might have a boss which takes your entire ammo pool from both guns to kill, and which gets a guaranteed hit on you once every thirty seconds. If you go into that boss fight hurt and with no healing items, then you'll be met with mathematically guaranteed failure. The simple fix for this is to give the player a dodge function to avoid taking an instance of damage.\n\n3. This story has a few decisions to make, but mostly it is on rails. This isn't always a problem in a game, but it is when your character gets repeatedly taken unawares by things you as the player have already figured out. You as the player may sense that Artyom is being tricked, is about to be ambushed, or is going to let the bad guy get away through poor decision making. You just have to frustratedly walk into the cut scene and let it happen anyways. Its fine for this to happen at least once. But by the fourth or fifth instance it becomes infuriating to play as the character who just gets tricked and captured all the time.\n- THIS REVIEW IS FOR VERSION 1.3 \n\nStarbound is the space game that all people who crave space games like I do will enjoy. \n\nFrom playing with your friends and colonizing an entire star sytem to role playing as a galactic bounty hunter, this game truly offers what all of us enjoy. \n\nPros \n+ Unique art style \n+ Infinite procedurally generated universe \n+ Creative alien races that are completely customizable \n+ Pets unique to each race \n+ A heart wrenching story that [Spoilers] makes you a hero \n+ Crafting system that requires a plethora of materials \n+ Mining and harvesting isn't a grind \n+ Materials can be acquired through pickaxes, drills, mechs, and the infamous and upgradable Matter Manipulator \n+ Devs constantly working to update and add new features \n+ Every planet is different with several contributing features such as weather, temperature, radiation, and colonization \n+ Many different generated structures such as buildings and towns that generate on some of the planets, with origins of each race \n+ An upgrading and advancement tree that takes time and effort that is always enjoyable.

First if they did they wouldn't be pushing the community the whey and as hard as they have. When things get pushed like they are, hateful people just harden there harts more, and just become infuriated. The sympathetic the become hatful towards it. The more something gets pushed, after awhile the more it gets hatted. A better approach would be, (if they really did care,) would be to put what they are talking about into a FREE pack, and get people whom make amazing custom content to contribute to it. If there is enough nice stuff in the pack people will download it, and talk people whom are on the fence to download it, and maybe to come over, and might start to get the people on the other side to at least get on the fence. That whey the LGBTQ community would get there representation, and acceptance would be pushed in a whey that won't burn people out.\n\n\nAnother resin why they should do it like this, and is part of why people are getting mad, is that they bought this game a certain whey, paid a lot for it and it's DLC, now they are changing, it and braking it to do so. Changing the experience against there will. Evan something you love like chocolate, or bacon, or anything will become something you hate if it's shoved down your throat ageist you will. If you want people to take it just offer it, most of the time people will take it. And if they don't just make it just make it more appealing. IE instead of braking the main game to add something even the LGBTQ community can't enjoy with a broken game. Make a free pack, and to tempt more people to get the pack, just add more nice CAS and build mode stuff. And maybe update the pack and add more stuff to it every once in awhile.\n\n\nI just had to say this for two resins, one companies being this careless or ignorant is just killing the public sentiment for LGBTQ and similar groups. And two, they are just killing interest in what they are selling, it will cut the Sims 4's life short, and will cut the Sims 5's life much, much sorter. \nIt's good to give options, as long as they are options. Or you are just like Hennery Ford, “The people can have the model T in any color! so long as it's black.”\n\n- It's more of a mixed recommendation but the positives outweigh the negatives if you're a returning fan.\n\nEverything in the game that's an adaptation of the original FF7, I love.  It gave me major nostalgia vibes to walk through a gorgeously rendered versions of FF7's environments.  The combat is much more engaging - no more watching a tv show on the side while I button-mash another random encounter.  Many of the big story moments still hit and I found even more to love in the characters based on their performances going beyond text boxes and blocky animations.  Even the music is just top-notch.  The OST will be a mainstay in my playlist for years.  It feels like I'm seeing the old game with fresh eyes and remembering why it made such an impact.\n\nThat said, the new content feels like a filler arc in a beloved anime.  Your character falls into a random hole like 3-4 times, spends 2 hours fighting random baddies, and then walks out like \"right, so back to that thing I was doing.\"  I don't even know if a new player could understand wtf is happening with Sephiroth because he's never really introduced and certain essential events are never explained.  It tries to take some clever left-turns on the plot so returning players have new surprises to enjoy but it often feels pretentious and pointless.  The ending gave me flashbacks to Peter Jackson's Hobbit trilogy because of how unnecessarily forced it was and the sudden cartoon levels of action.\n\nI'm tentatively enthusiastic for the sequel but there's a few troubling signs I hope don't become a trend.\n- Not For Broadcast is a good game... but it has some issues.\n\nThe story is really captivating; though the game does switch between humour and a serious story quite often, both are excellently done. Advance (the political party who ends up getting into power and becomes authoritarian) actually only gets into power in the first part of the game (the tutorial broadcast). You actually get to see the descent into authoritarianism and dystopia, which basically no other game (at least, any game I've ever played) has actually done, and not really any other forms of media either. You also get to influence some events in game [spoiler](for example, one of the ads you can play is an advertisement for a children's toy, and later there is an... incident... involving the toy, and (if you played the ad), the presenters of National Nightly News (Jeremy and Megan) state in a segment regarding the incident that they should never have advertised the toy.[/spoiler] It's a really minor thing, because you can just choose [i]not[/i] to play the ad, but I really love that detail), and having a noticeable impact on anything is really enjoyable.\n\nThe gameplay is mostly good. You basically just have to be on your toes, switching to different cameras every now and again, being ready to censor things, and being ready to go to the adverts. All basic tasks, but since you're doing most of them together, it relies on you being attentive and reactive. The only part of the gameplay I would criticize is the signal interference section. It's easy, and doesn't even really distract you, as you just have to move a slider up and down with a slight bit of delay. It's just not a fun part of the game.\n\nMy biggest gripe with the game has to be the lag; something which I know I'm not alone in experiencing. Online, it suggests closing down performance heavy tasks, such as web browsers, but I know for a fact that I had a few webpages up when I was playing the free prologue (the first broadcast, which gives a pretty good idea of what the game is), and experienced no issues at all. I really don't know what the coding differences between the paid version and the prologue of the game are, but that doesn't seem like it should be a difference. Generally the lag was irritating, but not something that hinders you in any way, but there is one level where you're advised to switch screens because naked protesters may pop up to protest Advance's policies. Visual lag, in this case, really isn't good. I also just got a windows pop up saying that the game was frozen, and so I had to close it down... not great.\n\nOverall; the gameplay is good, with really the exception of the interference task, and the story is excellent, but the technical issues are just... really, really irritating. I would recommend the game, but I would warn you that the technical issues do end up being quite irritating.\n\nOverall; the game is good, but the technical issues can be annoying.\n- Refunded.\n\nFeels like they released the wrong game files - half the game seems to be broken or missing...\nBasic functions such as zooming in and out, no tutorial, huge amounts of buttons that don't have any impact. Good idea, terrible execution.\n- I am generally not a big fan of card games, because luck is most often the deciding factor in them, and so it is also here. But there are many solid mechanics that lessen the randomness and make it enjoyable. You can plan builds and be tactical with your card purchases, so you get a strong deck that can beat the boss. \n\nOf course it is also a rougelike, you will die. But that's part of it, you can have a strategy and get better with every run. It is also addicting in a good way. There are no in game purchases, or other such garbage that is common in so many other card games.\n\nThis is one of the best games that went through Early Access, and the developers made good updates, introducing two new characters with new cards and gameplay mechanics and also further balancing the game. They are currently working on a fourth character. They also interact really well with the players, featuring artwork and being active in the discussions.\n\nThere is much to love with this game, I saw myself coming back time and time again. \nI recommend it for everyone =)\n- This game is for sure not perfect, but worth buying for a specific type of gamer.\n\n[b]What is good in this game?[/b]\n- It has a pretty solid gun gameplay. The movement is quick and polished as well.\n- One level is on average 20 seconds. It's fun to improve your gameplay to get better times in the small levels. \n- It's really a blast getting a perfect run, killing enemies in bullet time or exploiting the enemies weakspots.\n- There is content for around 10-15 hours. Maybe more if you consider going for 100%.\n\n[b]Anyway there are also some flaws: [/b]\n- In Neon White or Ghostrunner the movement and pace through the levels often feels like a perfect choreographic \"dance\"\n- The levels and the areas in Warstride are verry tight. I often lost pace through \"stupid\" placed rocks or small doors.\n- There is not much to explore. The levels are verry linear. While in Neon White it was so much fun to explore shortcuts or other hidden possibilities to improve ur time there are no such mechanics in Warstride at all. I'd love to have some exploration at least in the \"long levels\".\n- It could get repetitive for some players as it's a core element to complete the levels on 5 different difficulties. \n\n[b]Conclusion: [/b]\nIf you like fast paced games like Ghostrunner, Neon White or Doom and you have no problem in repeating short levels several times and u don't except an extraordinary game u will have fun for several hours on a low price.\n\n- [h1][b]★★★★☆[/b][/h1]\nSuper Time Force Ultra (STFU...) hits all the stereotypical tropes of an indie game. Fourth wall breaking humor, bright pastel colors, a synth soundtrack and of course retro graphics. Granted, this game came out in 2014, but today, frequent gamers might be sick of this. Despite that, the game certainly is still worth checking out. Behind the bad, immature humor lies a very apparant, unique and interesting game mechanic: the ability to rewind time and to run next to your former self.\n\nThe humor really turned me off the first time I booted this game up. It's too much in your face and it tries really hard to be funny. On top of that, it also tends to be really profane. There is a character that you can control that literally is a turd that has an ability to fart. One of the levels takes place within a sewer where you have to fight poop and ride it down pipes. Humor like this makes it feel like you're playing a game made by a 13 year old.\n\nThe gameplay, on ther other hand, is suprisingly refreshing and fun. Not only can you rewind time, you will also see your former selves run next to you and do the same damage as before. The whole game is build around this 'cloning' mechanic, as levels have to be finished within a certain time limit that can only be beaten with cooperation with yourself. For example, it can take forever to take a boss out by yourself, but by rewinding (to any moment you like) you can use more firepower to kill the boss faster. As you can imagine, this can create scenes where you fight of enemies along [i]many[/i] other characters you have controlled. It's the good kind of chaotic, as it never feels random to what happens in the game. My only real problem with it are the controls that don't always seem to registrate well. For instance, when you run of a slope, your character tend to be in the air just a couple of pixels high, which means it cannot jump. I ran off so many platforms because of this, but it is not a severe problem.\n\nThe game is not particulairy hard. You can rewind lots of times and by doing so, the level gets easier and easier. The dev also included a kind of trial mode, aside from the diverse story levels. Some of these levels are a little annoying, but ultimately I had fun with it in short sessions. The achievements are also not hard to unlock. It mostly involves collecting orbs and characters.\n\nFor the standard 13 bucks, this is not a bad deal! That is, if you go for all the achievements. When it is on sale, I would say this is a safe buy.\n- Okay so first and foremost the reason why I'm giving this a thumbs up is simple. The game does what it set out to do perfectly. Because of that I have no complaints about it's style.\n\nHOWEVER.\n\nI personally do not like the game. It is my own personal hangup. But I can understand why other people will enjoy it.\n\nThe game is fast paced, level by level FPS with challenges. Almost every single one of them is timed if not all of them are timed. It's similar to Doom or Killing Floor. Only there are no cusomizations implemented at time of play. \n\nThe game is challenging and offers you many different faucets on those challenges. It has different gun types for different enemies, different strategies and all of them complicated and challenging. But that's the point right?\n\nRegardless, the game was pretty fun and if you're looking for a level by level challenge system set to a similar style of Doom then you might just enjoy this game.\n\nIf this wasn't enough for you then please check out the video on my YouTube Channel for a more precise in depth explanation (link below).\n\nThanks for reading and I hope I helped some of you out there to spend your money wisely.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXiok7bhPdY\n- Looks like a game for children, but underneath the friendliness there is a great challenge! Move on the rhythm of good songs on a note bar! \n\n[h2]Swim! Swim little tredpole! [/h2]\nYou are a newborn tredpole. The first thing you do is break free of your egg! Through various rivers and waters you journey, and eventually save your pond from a disaster that will occur. \nEverything in the river translates to an instrument tone and respects the height on the note bar. The primary goal is to reach the finish. The melody is depicted as little mines which hurt your health if you swim across one. Along the way you can collect points by collecting bubbles (with a bonus if you collect them all), little bubbles, health packs, and you can slap your tail on bamboo or cymbals that launch you in the air! Many predators would like to make a snack out of you! \nAll this on the rhythm of unique songs! \n\n[h2]Thoughts [/h2]\nThis looks like a friendly game, a bit for kids perhaps, right? Well, I started with letting a non-gamer play this, without success. You need to have musical rhythm in you to perform well. None of my friends possess that really, so a simple playthrough wasn't all that easy. \nThe music is very original, and makes this game fun. It's a tough game, and poses quite a challenge for lovers of rhythm games. I am totally unfamiliar with that breed of gamers. For the simple gamer like me, I'd say: nice for a playthrough. \n\n70/100\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[td]\n[i]More reviews at [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/39546715/]Omnivore Gamer[/url], games that are easy to control (for handicapped gamers). [/i][/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n- Absolutely Don't understand all the negative reviews for this game. \n\nFirst off: this game is a RogueLite in that death is permanent, be prepared for this. Death is a part of the game and you are NOT losing progress by dying.. it's death mechanic is very much like Rogue Legacy in that you keep progress that carries on to your next character when you begin again. Dying also isn't like you lost more than 45 minutes of your time. Every single game in this genre will have plenty of deaths involved before you FINALLY get that first win (in most cases). Some people are going to need to spend some time grinding levels, dying and repeat until they have enough sticker slots open to overpower things. Keep that in mind going into it. You retain your level and any big upgrades you acquire when you die so you are NOT starting from scratch every single time like you would in most rogue likes. \n\nI normally wouldn't review a game so early but I saw the negative reviews pouring in and felt I needed to add some counters to it. \n\nThe second thing: the art/music/atmosphere is absolutely brilliant for a game in this genre where most games of this nature tend to be relatively grim. As with most roguelike/lites its procedurally generated so the map, enemies and what have you will be different each time. \n\nThird: the forced timer before you have to fight the boss is a bit jarring at first as i've never played a game of this type where I have limited time to actually get there.. but it's kind of brilliant really because it adds a completely different layer to the game in that you have to manage your time very well. What do you think you have time to do before the inevitable? Do you want to run around and grind exp killing trash mobs? Or do you think that time could be better spent knocking some dungeons out (time halts when in dungeons so take your time in these) and getting some gear and arguably more exp than you would just wandering the map. Also, you absolutely have plenty of time to explore the map as there are shrines (you have to find them but the map isn't huge), that you can pay a special currency to add another day of time to the clock. If you see a review complaining about the timer and they have less than an hour in the game... take that with a grain of salt. \n\nFour: The combat is pretty simple but well done. There is a surprising amount of depth to it as well when you start buying and finding more powerful weapons (toys) that can do a variety of things and synergize pretty well together. Enemy variety is pretty good so far, each time you level up it adds more enemy variety to encounter around the map. \n\nFive: dungeons are fairly simple and a good mix of mini puzzles and fun combat encounters. \n\nIf you enjoy roguelike/lite games DEFINITELY give this a spot in your library to see what it has to offer. So far I'd put it 8-9/10 but I don't quite have the amount of time necessary to feel comfortable ranking it against other rogue games. I may edit this once I get to a point to see how much replayability it has but until then I'm eager to keep sending swords into a meat grinder and just adding to my power each time. Please look at how much time people have in a game before rating their reviews and taking their word. .5 hours is not enough time to really warrant a helpful review... nor is 6 in my case but I really don't want this game to be DoA\n\nEdit: Just beat Mormo for the second time.. trust me when i say you can make the timer go on infinitely. I Don't want to spoil anything BUT head to dungeons and kill as many enemies as you can to save up gold and another currency, and make a good loop around each area of the map and you'll find all sorts of neat things. As for bugs, I've had none and I'm at 13 hours of steady play. Don't waste time killing EVERY enemy that's in the open areas cause that will eat too much of your time, but focus on finding dungeons and the hidden npc encounters. I had my timer extended to approx. 8 days in game time and I also found a way to permanently increase the amount of time I have on subsequent runs. Give it a chance, learn how the game works before being upset about the timer.\n- It is a total eyegasm with a captivating story/lore. If you're even a tiny bit interested in anything f*cked-up and mysterious (SCP-like), buy this.\n\nFrom the gameplay perspective, it is simply good. Nothing mind-blowing, but good nonetheless.\n\nI've completed the game with a couple of sidequests (there are more for me) in about 13 hours, and there are two story DLC + the Expeditions mode, so I anticipate at least another 10+ hours of gameplay. Which is great for the price.\n\nUpdate: I've put in ~10 more hours to complete the Foundation DLC. It is a good DLC, and brings a few more hours of joy living in this world. It also has some sick areas (like that dark cave with the TV). The overall design is a bit more dull, but I enjoyed the story.\n- I got this game on a whim because I once played this series like... a decade ago. DW3/4 to be specific. And even though I know full well that this sort of game is basically meant for consoles, I managed to play it just fine once I adjusted the key bindings to stuff that worked well for me. Anyway... game.\n\nIf, like me, you have played these games before, you pretty much know what you are in for. If you have never played any of these games, I'm not quite sure what else is quite like it. Basically it's a fighting game, except it is on large battlefield maps where you murder thousands of random and a handful of named NPC's while following objectives in order to complete each level. If that sounds repetitive... well it can certainly be that. It's the ultimate hack and slash-fest game, and if you get bored with murdering insane numbers of enemies, then chances are this game is not for you.\n\nThe game is based upon the Three Kingdoms era of Ancient China (184-280, roughly), and, despite the absurd outfits and personalities of many of the characters in the game, it is actually fairly consistent with what is known about the period. Or rather, it is consistent with the famous novel 'Romance of the Three Kingdoms' by Luo Guanzhong, which is basically a work of historical fiction that takes real events and bends them a bit according to the whims and views of the author. Which, of course, means that certain characters (particularly Shu-Han characters like Xuande/Liu Bei) are depicted as noble honorable sorts fighting for justice while others (like Mengde/Cao Cao) are depicted as villanous and driven by ambition. I don't want to dig too deep into this because there most likely are entire books written about how Luo Guanzhong messed around with the characters, but the depictions he made are pretty much what are found in this and all previous DW games. The nice thing though is that if you read between the lines (or maybe it's just because I am very familiar with the source material this game is based off of), you can see the flaws in the author's bias in the game as well. Namely that Liu Bei was a massive hypocrite every bit as ambitious as his rivals, and that Cao Cao, while not exactly the nicest guy around, wasn't the hellspawn other characters (like Liu Bei) called him.\n\nAnyway, the game follows the story decently well, though some creative license and trimming down obviously has happened. I still liked how the game depicted things most of the time. Perhaps my favorite was Lu Bu's campaign which, while maintaining the massive \"OMG ITS LU BU\" hype that all DW games have had, reveals exactly why the real Lu Bu got himself executed in chapter 19 of a 120 chapter book: that he was dumb as a brick, betrayed people constantly, and never listened to anyone's advice. While the old DW games I played did have storylines for him, they didn't take the historical route that this game's (default) story path takes. The same goes for the numerous character deaths shown, though many of these are made more dramatic than they actually were.\n\nAlso, while the playable character cast has increased to the point of total insanity (including some that may not have even existed or actually fought on battlefields), I did like that, in the time between DW4 and this, they added a number of characters that rounded out the cast further by including some of the other lesser-known strategists (Chen Gong, Lu Su) and characters who rose to prominence in the later parts of the story (Deng Ai, the sons of Guan Yu/Zhang Fei, as well as the entire Jin faction who were the ultimate winners of this whole mess). I thought that was a nice treat since these sorts had been badly neglected in past games, where everything seemed to stop at the year 234 (when Kongming/Zhuge Liang died), which was roughly the chronological halfway point of the entire story.\n\nOk, I better stop and just finish this up.\n\nIn short, It's a DW game. That means that on the one hand, the combat gets repetitive, many of the characters are very hard to take seriously, and many of the story events are overdramatized to the point of being kind of ridiculous. On the other hand, there is a MASSIVE amount of content (and all those DLC's for this \"Complete Edition\" are purely cosmetic), big battles are kind of fun, and one can even argue that the storyline's inherent cheesiness may actually be more a positive than a negative.\n\nIf you have never played one of these games before, this is the one i'd look at because (to my knowledge) it's the newest one and has an insane amount of content even compared to its predecessors. If you have played these and liked them before... why not? If you didn't like these games however, then most likely this will do nothing to change your opinion.\n\nFor all it's goofiness and repetition, DW is still entertaining enough for me to waste sizeable amounts of time with it. Hooray and stuff.\n- Very fun game if you are looking for a cozy relaxing farming sim. if you had a hard time with the fishing mechanic in stardew valley then you will have an easier time with this game, ontop of that there are lots of cute little rhythm games to play and the animal raising is alot more in depth then stardew. just a little note of warning to new players, the game doesn't make this very clear but you shouldn't spend too much time gardening in your first year. Automatic watering systems aren't available until later on and if you are like me you will think making the biggest profit possible year one is a great idea but I accidentally ended up upgrading/unlocking everything except irrigation in my first year and now do not have much to spend my currency on. Other then finishing catching every fish, maybe decorating my farm/the village and getting the rare coloured animals theres not much else to do in the game for late game content. It feels like there is the intention of possibly adding more content later on? either way if you decide to play, for your first play through I really recommend exploring first and getting to know the villagers before you start large scale farming.\n- Have you ever asked yourself, \"Man, why doesn't someone make a cooperative fantasy RPG with all the nifty RPG-ism's that I love, like skills and talents and crafting and that I can play at my own pace with my friend and we can decide how we complete quests and treat people in the world and if we disagree then there was a mechanic in place that supported that and NPC characters we could hire and have join our adventures and instead of mindlessly blasting through hundreds of monsters like every other action RPG out there, we could fight in some nail-biting tactical, turn-based combat with spells and abilities that would affect the environment and turn the tide of the battle and the whole thing is wrapped up in a fantastic looking package with great looking characters and animations and some genuinely good and at times humorous writing?\"\n\nGuess what? It's your lucky day.\n- [h1]He did it again[/h1]\n\nI don't know how this guy does it but he nailed it again. Maybe it's not as good as To the Moon but it's still very good.\n\nFinding Paradise plays very similarly to To the Moon. You basically walk around collecting a person's memories and going through his life. You experience every important step and decision in his life. The purpose of that is to grant dying man a last wish and make him happy. But something unexpected happens as always and you start figuring out what is happening.\n\nThe story again is very good and hits you right in the feels. There's some mystery and new gameplay mechanics. Now we have a small mini-game each time we unlock a memory. It's not hard so it won't distract you from the story.\nThe whole story is funny and sad at the same time. There are lots of well written dialogues.\nI didn't like the ending sequence, i thought it was tedious and almost broke the enjoyment. Please don't do that in the next game, leave it as it should be.\n\nAnother thing i dislike is graphics engine. I don't like this pixelated retro graphics. It's ugly. But what i don't like even more is not being able to adjust the resolution. It's 2019 (ok the game was released in 2017) how a game released in that year doesn't have resolution options? No, just no. I won't accept that and i don't think there's any justification for that. Just stop with this retro crap already. Running the game in 280x200 or whatever the resolution doesn't make it cool.\n\nFortunately this game is all about the story and story is perfect and makes up for all the annoying things. This guy should make a movie or something.\n\nOh almost forgot. Music. Another outstanding aspect of this game. The guy's a genius.\n\nOverall a very good game if you want an amazing story. It's around 5 hours and that's in my opinion is enough to tell a great story.\n\n[b]Pros[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Amazing story\n[*]Amazing soundtrack\n[*]Great writing and character desing\n[/list]\n[b]Cons[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Retro style to the degree of nokia 3310 resolution\n[*]Ending sequence wasn't very fun\n[/list]\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/32930811-Kosmos%27s-Cosmic-reviews/?appid=704030][h1]Follow my curator page for more[/h1][/url]\n- Update 09/10/16\nSo they have added 'last man standing' mode which is great. The only issue is now that the controls are too difficult. If they fix this issue it would be a really fun party game and worth porting to consoles.\n\nPros:\n-Good visuals\n-Fun power ups\n-Awesome 4 player local play\n-In general the game is very fun and I believe with a few tweaks the game would be great. If they had done an early access build it would probably have been a great game on full release but there are still a few things that I and the people I played with don't like.\n\nCons:\nNOW FIXED (THEY ADDED LAST MAN STANDING' MODE) -Scoring system *the scoring system is based on how many you kill, we all thought the game would be better if you had lives instead and had to stay alive, when we played this game it was a case of constant kamakaze and not caring because it doesn't matter if you die* REPEAT THIS HAS BEEN FIXED\n-Controls *this type of game obviously can't be played with keyboard and mouse so this is only reviewed using Xbox 360 controller and it still isn't perfect, none of us felt that  had full control of the vehicle*\n\nVerdict:\nFor now I will give it a thumbs up as if they allow you to select scoring system based on kills or based on deaths we would play this a lot. And I think they could easily improve the controls. I hope the devs don't just leave this game to rot as it is a great idea for a local co-op game\n- this game is fire\n\nedit: actual review\n\na few weeks ago, i picked up dicey dungeons and that was a lot of fun; my first introduction to dice games\n\nafterwards, i saw some streamers playing slice and dice so i picked that up, and that was fun too - just not on steam unfortunately\n\nwell, this game is slay the spire + dice + cards. but what really sets it apart is the whole tug of war between corruption and purification. each character is very unique and i really can't recommend this enough, even with only just a few hours played.\n\ni just beat the game on difficulty 0 with the first character after playing the first 5 a few times.\n- Launch controversy aside, what this game should have been called for the longest time is 'Early Access'. Around the time of the Beyond update is when I'd say would have been the true 'launch'. \n\nI didn't get this when it first came out, but even when I did it was a fragmented mess of a game. Now, finally, with the Beyond and Synthesis updates there's a solid game here that's almost (but not quite) like what Sean Murray promised way back at the beginning.\n\nPerformance on PC has dramatically improved with the switch over to the Vulkan API, and it finally supports Ultrawide and various other PC-specific options. The game itself provides a significant amount of variety, offering a combination of Elite-lite and 'Minecraft in Space' mechanics. There's plenty to see and do, and the exploration aspect is enjoyable - if a little bland. The planetary biomes and overall game could still do with further diversity, but there's plenty here to get to your teeth into.\n\nHello Games show no sign of slowing down their support for the game either, having just recently released a bizarre in-game music synthesizer of all things, and going by the evidence of their progress to date I can only see the game improving further as time moves on.\n\nEDIT - 24/09/2020 \"Origins\" Patch: well, you can ignore the previous comments about diversity being a bit on the low side. They already added things like living ships, derelicts, space creatures and robots since I made this review, and with the Origins patch the variety of experience on offer is on such a scale now that I don't think I'm going to be lacking for things to do for some time. Also, impressively, the game runs even better than it did when I originally posted this - and the rejigged UI looks fantastic on Ultrawide. \n\nBrilliant work by the team at Hello Games. I can't think of any game I've played (and I've been indulging since the late 80's) where I've ever gone from \"I can't stand this\" to \"this is one of my favourite games\". It's taken a while to get here, but No Man's Sky is definitely one of the greats.\n- a very interesting FPS multiplayer and co-op, It would be better if it was still in development like early access because it needs some work. shorter spawn times, vehicles , larger and more varied maps, what this game has that no other FPS has is realistic weapons. you will not find another game that models modern military grade firearms more realisticily in terms of what they sound like ,recoil, look, feel ( to the extent that a pc game can offer) they are amazing and I would buy this game for 8 bucks just for that alone. But it does need work , this game could be a great title to rival Battlefield and COD franchises ( maybe not Advanced Warfare) it may not surpass those titles but it could give them a better run for the money.\n- Uncharted 4: A Thief's End:\n\nThe ambitious end to a long running franchise, Uncharted 4: A Thief's End is a very fascinating game.\nThe gunplay is enjoyable, the puzzles are decent and the humor is pretty good, there are some hilarious character interactions.\n\nThe story though, isn't very deep but I liked the darker approach and the flashbacks, it's interesting enough to keep you playing, and it really makes you care for the characters.\n\nExploration works decently, but it could've been better, there are documents you can read or find collectibles. The open area in Madagascar was one of the best parts of the game in my opinion, the car handles very well and the driving feels phenomenal.\n\nLastly, climbing is a very big part of the game, and even though the climbing mechanics are very smooth, I really had to force myself to enjoy it some times, and I wish there was less of it.\n\nThe action sequences are easily the best thing about this game, some jaw-dropping set-pieces keep you on the edge of your seat.\n\nUncharted 4 is the definition of a \"Movie Videogame\".\nIt's absolutely gorgeous, the cinematography is outstanding, the performances are fantastic and the soundtrack fits well, but gameplay-wise it's just... exhausting, not because of the controls or the gunplay, but because of the hand-holding and the linearity.\n\nUncharted the Lost Legacy:\n\nUncharted the Lost Legacy is proof that Uncharted can great even without Nathan Drake. The Lost Legacy is essentially just more Uncharted 4, it's something like a stand-alone expansion, and a good one at that.\n\nHonestly, I am surprised, I enjoyed this more than I expected. Even though the gameplay is more of the same, there's less climbing, and the fact that the game is relatively short is mostly a positive.\n\nThe game rarely feels repetitive, every puzzle is different from each other, and there is also an open area in the middle of the game where you can explore, which was implemented very well.\n\nAs for Chloe and Nadine, they make a pretty nice duo, where's Chloe is likeable and a goofball, Nadine is the opposite, she's aggressive and focuses on her mission. I liked their chemistry and I think both characters work very well together.\n\nAnd now for the negatives, the story isn't necessarily bad, it's just very generic and there are no stakes. Also, in my personal opinion, the biggest flaw the game has is that there are barely any highlights in it, almost no action except from the last chapter, which is a complete letdown considering how the action is literally the best part about this series.\n\nOverall it's very solid, and for its size it's definitely worth checking out, a great stand-alone expansion.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThank you Sony! Both games runs surprisingly well and overall very fun games. Uncharted 2 is still my favorite tho, but i'm happy to see Uncharted 4 and the Lost Legacy finally on PC, Uncharted 1,2,3 when?\n- Dear Dev, \nI love this game, if you're reading reviews, please consider some ideas to make it better:\n-  Level designing: Add more ways to choose, and different endings. Right now SoR4 is flat from A to B, it made me feel down compare to SoR3.\n- Alternate customs, and playable same characters: Floyd is overrated and all my friends want to pick him. Make a game with 4 Floyds running sound fun. Use lifetime score to unlock customs.\n- 2v2 Battle! WHY NOT?\n- Shiva (new), Max (new), Roo, Estel (Badass Woman Cop)\n- Steam trading cards: I know it's not importance, but who doesnt want some badass backgrounds on steam profile?\n- This game is more than just a driving simulator. It's a landscape experience.\n\nScreenshots won't reveal the full beauty of this game, cause they don't show how daytime and weather change while you drive, how the first sunbeams flash through trees and hills as you leave the night behind, how massive forests reveal as you climb mountain roads and cut through curvy canyons, or the mad contrast of Las Vegas' vibrant colors vs the lonely Route-66-style desert roads... these moments are gold, and define the atmosphere of a game that can be as relaxing or challenging as you want, based on the truck and cargo that you pick – but it will always be a beautiful trip.\n\nAlso, THIS is the game that TRULY deserves the Labor of Love award. In a year that has been most difficult for everyone, SCS managed to add more than ever: 2 map expansion DLCs, 3 completely new trucks brands (for FREE!), completely rework the lighting system (after complely overhauling the audio engine)... They just make the game better. Every year. For free.\n\nFor years now, SCS keep improving and remain honest, loyal and supportive to their customers and games. What more can you ask.\n\n(P.S. They just revealed plans for official co-op multiplayer.)\n- Too litle content for it's price. 2 scenes only and 0 choices.\n- Heartbound is a fantastic indie game with a lot of heart and fantastical mysteries.\nIf you enjoy beautiful 2D gaming experiences this is the game for you! \n\nPlay as a young boy on his journey to find his doggo, Baron. \nYou will explore various, unique worlds on this journey each with mysteries of their own...\n\nThe music I must draw particular attention to: It is wonderful to listen to. Honestly do yourself a favour and pick up this game- it is still in development but you will be glad to know that the updates are (thankfully) free!\n\nGive this game the love and attention it deserves!\n- I have never cried so damn much at a game\n- Very calm game with heartwarming moments. Better played with friends. Really brilliant gameplay idea. I just hope it gets a final ending really soon!\n\nEdit: After reaching the ultimate end, I felt bit disappointed. The progress was just straight up boring and uninteresting after years of restarting again and again.\nVery fun game anyways\n- This is everything a remaster is supposed to be. You remember playing this game over a decade ago, and the graphics weren't \"that bad\". But nostalgia is a cruel mistress. You play the original again, and you can barely stand it.\n\nThe comes the HD version, which was alright, playable. But then, the real remaster, the Definitive Edition, you start playing the game and it FEELS like it used to feel. Like it is supposed to look. It is quite obviously way better than it used to be, but it FEELS the same.\n\nIf you ever liked playing this game, and want to play it again, this won't disappoint you. Especially with the distinct lack of RTS games in the last decade or so, this still holds true as one of the best ones.\n\n【グループB】\n- A criminally underrated game, I have seldom seen a developer take their original hit which was already almost perfect, and actually manage to improve on it in every way shape and form. You do not need to have played the original to play or enjoy this game. Their stories are completely seperate.\n\nThe game itself is much less linear than its predecessor. The best way I can explain the feeling of going through the environments without referencing Grimrock itself is by saying it felt an awful lot like Myst to me, just with combat. Required puzzles for progression were challenging but not impossible, some of the secret challenges were much more difficult. I admit I used an online guide more than a few times, but it did nothing to diminish my enjoyment of the game. It is immersive, challenging, and satisfying. \n\nThe only drawback I can think of is the difficulty. It feels like you cannot win with any group composition, I suggest no more than 2 of any class or weapon/armor type user. I went with a warrior, two rogues(one range), and a mage, this way you as well makes you unlikely to complete a difficult fight or puzzle and be rewarded with something you cannot use. Combat itself can be challenging as I said, but you will rarely feel like you are simply incapable of winning. There are obvious ways to optimize the way you approach an encounter the second time if you die the first.\n\nBe prepared to immerse yourself, you must pay attention to your surroundings, read and remember notes you find, explore every nook and cranny you can find, and you will be rewarded. Good luck!\n\n- If you are looking for a game that you can never master, here is the game for you.\n- Absolutely Don't understand all the negative reviews for this game. \n\nFirst off: this game is a RogueLite in that death is permanent, be prepared for this. Death is a part of the game and you are NOT losing progress by dying.. it's death mechanic is very much like Rogue Legacy in that you keep progress that carries on to your next character when you begin again. Dying also isn't like you lost more than 45 minutes of your time. Every single game in this genre will have plenty of deaths involved before you FINALLY get that first win (in most cases). Some people are going to need to spend some time grinding levels, dying and repeat until they have enough sticker slots open to overpower things. Keep that in mind going into it. You retain your level and any big upgrades you acquire when you die so you are NOT starting from scratch every single time like you would in most rogue likes. \n\nI normally wouldn't review a game so early but I saw the negative reviews pouring in and felt I needed to add some counters to it. \n\nThe second thing: the art/music/atmosphere is absolutely brilliant for a game in this genre where most games of this nature tend to be relatively grim. As with most roguelike/lites its procedurally generated so the map, enemies and what have you will be different each time. \n\nThird: the forced timer before you have to fight the boss is a bit jarring at first as i've never played a game of this type where I have limited time to actually get there.. but it's kind of brilliant really because it adds a completely different layer to the game in that you have to manage your time very well. What do you think you have time to do before the inevitable? Do you want to run around and grind exp killing trash mobs? Or do you think that time could be better spent knocking some dungeons out (time halts when in dungeons so take your time in these) and getting some gear and arguably more exp than you would just wandering the map. Also, you absolutely have plenty of time to explore the map as there are shrines (you have to find them but the map isn't huge), that you can pay a special currency to add another day of time to the clock. If you see a review complaining about the timer and they have less than an hour in the game... take that with a grain of salt. \n\nFour: The combat is pretty simple but well done. There is a surprising amount of depth to it as well when you start buying and finding more powerful weapons (toys) that can do a variety of things and synergize pretty well together. Enemy variety is pretty good so far, each time you level up it adds more enemy variety to encounter around the map. \n\nFive: dungeons are fairly simple and a good mix of mini puzzles and fun combat encounters. \n\nIf you enjoy roguelike/lite games DEFINITELY give this a spot in your library to see what it has to offer. So far I'd put it 8-9/10 but I don't quite have the amount of time necessary to feel comfortable ranking it against other rogue games. I may edit this once I get to a point to see how much replayability it has but until then I'm eager to keep sending swords into a meat grinder and just adding to my power each time. Please look at how much time people have in a game before rating their reviews and taking their word. .5 hours is not enough time to really warrant a helpful review... nor is 6 in my case but I really don't want this game to be DoA\n\nEdit: Just beat Mormo for the second time.. trust me when i say you can make the timer go on infinitely. I Don't want to spoil anything BUT head to dungeons and kill as many enemies as you can to save up gold and another currency, and make a good loop around each area of the map and you'll find all sorts of neat things. As for bugs, I've had none and I'm at 13 hours of steady play. Don't waste time killing EVERY enemy that's in the open areas cause that will eat too much of your time, but focus on finding dungeons and the hidden npc encounters. I had my timer extended to approx. 8 days in game time and I also found a way to permanently increase the amount of time I have on subsequent runs. Give it a chance, learn how the game works before being upset about the timer.\n- After around an hour and a half of bad spawns, scarce resources, and short-lived ventures into the more inhabited areas of the map, I ran into the first friendly player I had met in Rust. I had initially spotted him pretty far away, but I paid no real notice to him as he had a rock equipped. Eventually he got close enough for us to clearly see each other and, upon the realization that neither of us were hostile, we both pulled out torches as a mutual sign of peace (or the highest possible level of non-aggression that can exist in Rust). I dropped my old hatchet for him as I had just finished crafting one with metal, and he gave me some food as a sign of good faith. After nearly 30 minutes of searching and scavenging, we had pooled enough resources to craft us each some minimally decent gear. We knew that if we wanted to progress any further we would need to mine boulders, and a lot of them. I used what remaining materials we had to put together a 9mm handgun and several bullets, though I reminded him it was only in case we really needed it. I had decided earlier during my many unwanted experiences with bullets to the face that I would try my hardest not to run around slaughtering every newly spawned player that I came across. A few minutes out from camp we had encountered a player with a hunting bow. I had been running with my hatchet out, so I quickly took out the handgun in my inventory and pointed it in his direction, attempting to scare him away. When the player was far enough away we continued up a road towards a few stones. The area was surrounded by trees so I opted to stand guard with the handgun while my friend mined. Just as we were moving on to the next boulder, I heard the gunfire start. I turned around to see a player with an assault rifle gunning down my friend, and before I could land any shots on him he had already begun shooting me. It was at that moment that I remembered I hadn't even crafted a sleeping bag for the camp, as that was one of the objectives of the trip we were taking. I typed into the chat, thanking the friend I had made for all of his help and asking the player who had killed us if we had been intruding in his area or something along those lines. He simply wrote \"Sorry guys :D\" This is the single problem that I have with games like this. Why does it have to be \"shoot-on-sight?\" That player had obviously taken us by surprise and was better equipped than us. Even if he had a justifiable reason for approaching two very poorly equipped players (which he really didn't considering we were in the middle of the woods and he had pretty much all of the gear you could need in this game) he could have easily told us to cooperate by either putting away our weapons or just leaving the area. But of course, he comes around, sees some players trying to gather enough supplies to get to a stable point in the game, and decides to go out of his way to approach us and use unecessary ammo for a hatchet and a handgun with four bullets. Then, to add even more of an insult, he adds an apology at the end, as if he had no choice but to shoot two unexpecting, half-naked, unprepared players. \n\nAll in all, though, I do see a lot of potential in this game, and the good in the community does shine through every once in a while. I just wish that people would realize that they don't need to go around killing players who haven't had the chance to experience the game. People like that are the single reason why so many players on steam feel that they wasted money on what would otherwise be a great experience.\n- ~ DIFFICULTY ~\n\n🔲 My 90 year old grandma could play it\n🔲 Easy\n🔲 Normal\n✅ Hard\n🔲 Dark Souls\n\n~ GRAPHICS ~\n\n🔲 MS Paint\n🔲 Bad\n🔲 Meh\n🔲 Graphics don't matter in this game\n✅ Good\n🔲 Beautiful\n🔲 Masterpiece\n\n~ MUSIC ~\n\n🔲 Bad\n🔲 Not special\n🔲 Good\n✅ Beautiful\n\nI WILL GIVE YOU MY ALL! and also FLAMES OF LOVE is a hit\n\n~ STORY ~\n\n🔲 This game has no story\n🔲 Like playing Temple Runners for the story\n✅ It's there for the people who want it\n🔲 Well written\n🔲 Epic story\n🔲 Imagine Kingdom Hearts but on crack\n\n~ PRICE ~\n\n🔲 Free\n🔲 Underpriced\n✅ Perfect Price\n🔲 Could be cheaper\n🔲 Overpriced\n🔲 Complete waste of money\n\nIt went free on some point\n\n~ REQUIREMENTS ~\n\n🔲 You can run it on a microwave\n✅ Average\n🔲 High end\n🔲 NASA computer\n\n~ LENGTH ~\n\n🔲 Very Short (0 - 2 hours)\n🔲Short (2 - 15 hours)\n🔲 Average (15-50 hours)\n🔲 Long (50-90 hours)\n🔲 Extremely long (90-110 hours)\n✅ No ending\n\n~ FUN ~\n\n🔲 I'd rather watch paint dry\n🔲 Hard to enjoy\n🔲 Repetitive\n🔲 Actually pretty amusing\n🔲The kind of fun you'll remember\n✅ Ride of your life\n\n~ REPLAYABILITY~\n\n🔲 It's a one-time experience\n🔲 Only for achievements\n🔲 If you wait a few months/years\n✅ Definitely\n🔲 Infinitely replayable\n\n~ WORTH BUYING ~\n\n🔲 No\n✅ Wait for sale\n✅ Yes\n- I normally hate \"retro\" platformers, I never liked Mega Man, only Mega Man X, didn't care much for Shovel Knight but loved Hollow Knight, things like that. The Messenger IS a platformer, even though the second part of the game makes it less linear, and I loved it.\n\nDevs could take a lot of notes here - checkpoints are frequent, boss fights are short and creative and you don't have to go through 2 easy phases to retry a hard 3rd phase, most rooms and even most trick rooms have multiple ways to approach them given your fairly simple moveset. You never have to do anything pixel-perfect to get through but doing things well is massively rewarding. It constantly surprised you with new things but doesn't overstay anything, and completely foreign mechanics introduced are not punishing (Skylands, for example).\n\nA lot of people comment on how great the writing is, and well... it is great. It's sparse but fantastic throughout, with more personality in what amounts to a few pages than most games can give with 10 times as many words (and lore pickups).\n\nFor reference, I completed it with all the challenge collectibles in 14.5 hours, but did not get all achievements nor go through NG+. It is well paced and hard to put down, but easy enough to play in chunks, and I felt like I was learning new tricks up through the end of the game.\n\nDo the thing!\n- Don't buy this game if you are planning a full co-op playthrough with a friend.\n\nAt first we thought only story progress wasn't shared which was fine as we'd both get to experience the missions regardless. However it turns out that all unlocks tied to completing each area such as new guns, cars and basically all the things you'd want to progress in are locked for the person who isn't hosting. This means your partner is stuck with the level 1 unlocks from start to finish unless they go back and do everything in their game as well.\n\nCompletely pointless and took us until clearing one of the lieutenants for us to realise this, bought this a while back too so not gonna be able to get a refund. Worst implemented co-op I have seen in a long time.\n- In a world where \"enhanced edition\" has started to be synonymous with \"will run on modern hardware if you shell out $20\" it's absolutely refreshing to see Larian deliver this masterpiece free of charge to owners of the original. You start out with an already fantastic game that's received numerous game of the year and editor's choice awards. Then you spend a year polishing that game, and adding new features. The result is brilliant Enhanced Edtion of an already fantastic game.\n\nNew features for EE:\n[list]\n[*] Fully voice acted - Every line of dialog now has voice acting. The voice acting is really good too\n[*] Dual wield - Rogues now look more iconic with the ability to dual wield\n[*] Grenades - You can craft and throw various sorts of grenades. \n[*] Tactician Mode - A new  challenging mode where encounters are redesigned to be harder by adding new spells and enemies into the mix. Classic mode still available obviously.\n[*] Split screen co-op \n[*] Controller support\n[*] Updated graphics - The UI is totally reworked, the graphics are updated, and spells have new effects\n[*] Updates to the story  - The story, esepcially the ending, was rewritten a bit to clear up some confusing aspects\n[/list]\n\nI'm sure there's more, but really these ought to be reason enough to play this game.\n- This game has such a HUGE potential like Stardew Valley in its early days!!\nCollecting stuff, helping people by crafting potions its so rewarding and lovely pls dear developers keep working on it. I BEG YOU! :D\nSure it has some bug right now but even on day one they managed to get some fast fixes and tried their best to make it work for everyone. \nThe controls were a bit tricky in the beginning (used Playstation 5 Controller) but its just a matter of time, its just not the normal controls like in other games.\nThe music was pretty nice and chill and also the animations were super cute, i love watching little Rubrum built his sandcastles over and over again. >3< \n\nOverall a good game, but could become even more better in the future, keep going guys!!\n- I have mixed feelings about this game. It could have been very very good but has been let down by some very shoddy quality issues. This would not in itself have been a problem BUT given its AAA high price tag, to be honest, the consumer deserves better in terms of finish and execution. To name a few of the irritations:\n1.) AI characters shooting through walls.\n2.) Poorly realised inventory system (You can't compare stats of your secondary weapon with inventory items)\n3.) Camera does not follow actions during combat\n4.) Right click items in inventory and you do not always get the correct sub menus.\n5.) Mouse & Keyboard use was definitely an afterthought in terms of design\n6.) The frustrating click to confirm attribute/perk/talent spend.\n7.) UI does not always detail consumed action points to move to a location during combat\n\nAs I said lots of irritations that normally, in an indie game such as this, you would expect... but NOT when the publisher charges AAA prices.\n\nEz\n\n- very well made cant stop playing. only complaint is keyboard set up and i get that the game says play with controller but thats not an option for me but the keys are all over the place r select upgrade e to reroll f to chat with npc r to enter their shop its like that for everything and you cant change the keybinds for UI stuff i wish it was just e to interact its all over the place and i find my self still miss typing things. if you buy the game use a controller \n\n- It has poor simulation of hand skeleton, so you can't use all fingers, benefits of Index Knuckles controller or VR gloves, etc. And, scenario doesn't allow you to do anything, actually, except one straightforward way. Some things are elaborated, but mostly it isn't worth time or money. But I'm rating it as professional developer for VR, sexual content itself is not matter nor interested for me. My advice for game developer is to add more hand tracking features and more scenarios - in this case it can be something better.\n- [h2] Visual Novel Reviews [/h2]\n\n[b] TLDR [/b] Two scenes, no customization, no choices, character development needs work, but the Extremely short story delivered (If you know what I mean) a whopping 38 minutes of game play for me. \n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [th]Question[/th]\n        [th]Answer[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Buy Again[/td]\n        [td]No, I wouldn't.

Someone is the neighborhood knows the whole story, but who \ncould that be? \n\n[h3] Overall Score: [/h3]\n\nScore: 3.8 - Length, Character Development, and Storytelling leaves a lot to be desired with this game. This is the second game that this developer has released, so I am not disappointed that I spent 5$ dollars on a game that they created, but I will say that I will think Long and Hard (No Pun Intended) before purchasing another game from this studio.\n- This game may actually be my favorite 2D Zelda game of all time.\n\nI knew going into it that the music by Lena Rain (who did Celeste's music) would be great. It is. I knew the game would be wholesome and adorable since it's by the designer from Wandersong. And it is. What I didn't expect was just how fun and interesting the paint-based gameplay would be. The puzzles constantly make you feel super smart, and the abilities you gain are all super fun to play with. When I first heard about the idea, I didn't think there would be all that many interesting puzzles and mechanics based on painting, but wow was I wrong. The puzzles and mechanics never get old, and there are an absolute ton of creative ideas being introduced all the way to the end of the game.\n\nAnd I certainly didn't predict how incredibly deep and personal the story and overall theme would be. The characters, writing, and plot of this game are astoundingly well done, and they turn a fantastic cozy 2D Zelda game into a truly unique and wonderful experience.\n\nI guess what I'm saying is, Chicory does for 2D Zelda games what Celeste did for platformers. It takes the base concept, turns the gameplay, music, and charm up to 11, and interweaves incredibly deep and emotional threads into every aspect of the game.\n\nI cannot recommend Chicory enough. I did back it on Kickstarter, which is how I got an advanced copy, but the game is better than I ever dreamed it could be. If you like cozy games about discussing feelings and helping people, or you like 2D Zelda games with innovative puzzles and hundreds of collectibles, or you just want to draw butts on everyone you meet, you need to get Chicory.\n- A very easy game to get into, super popular at the moment so there is always someone to play with, and for only 5 EUR you can invest a lot of hours into the game\n- Basic RPG with phenomenal music. Very linear nearly no exploration. Short and didn't overstay it's welcome. Not bloated with useless content like a lot of JRPG's. Some comedy. No gear or weapons to loot. Definitely took inspiration from Sailor Moon. Didn't provide much of a challenge. However I enjoyed my time with it, 100% in under 8 hours. It was a decent game. 7/10\n- Refunded.\n\nFeels like they released the wrong game files - half the game seems to be broken or missing...\nBasic functions such as zooming in and out, no tutorial, huge amounts of buttons that don't have any impact. Good idea, terrible execution.\n- Please, bare with me here...I NEVER write reviews for anything (this is probably the third review I have ever written), but I feel like I need to write this one for so many reasons!!!  I grew up playing the Telltale/Lucas Arts Series: Monkey Island. After discovering and playing those, I figured out that I have an infinite amount of love for Point and Click adventure games. After finishing that series, I really only played the other games made by either Lucas Arts or Telltale (Mostly because I thought they were the only creators of Point and Click games...until about a year ago, when I discovered there's an entire genre/world of Point and Click).  Of course, I must also note: The Curse of Monkey Island will always be my fav, as it was the first Point and Click I ever played. Ok...NOW...with all of that being said, I recently discovered WADJET EYE GAMES and I am SO happy I did. I would recommend EVERY.SINGLE,GAME they sell. I have played all of their MAC/iOS compatible Point and Clicks, and I have yet to be (even slightly) disappointed. I had very high expectations going in as the Monkey Island games, Day of the Tentacle, Full Throttle, Grim Fandago, etc. are some of the best games in the history of Point and Click; however, all of the games I have played from Wadjet Eye have been amazing. They have actually been so amazing that I can 100% say Wadjet Eye is at the top of my list, right there with the Telltale/Lucas Arts games. I 100% recommend purchasing and playing every game made by Wadjet Eye to anyone who likes (even those who kinda sorta like) Point and Click games.\n- No Man’s Sky is like a guy who owes you $1,000 from 6 years ago coming back with $10,000 to repay you after you thought the money was gone.\n\nI really like this game. I’ve been playing it for years on and off, returning after every major update to see the state of things. No man’s Sky might be a fantastic game now, but you gotta always remember how it all begun. When the game first came out it could best be described to had been as wide as the ocean, but having the depth of a puddle. \n\nThe game has improved so much from when it came out that it is easily one of my favorite space exploration games nowadays. One of the greatest redemption stories in video game history. It’s almost like they used the money they earned from sales  to actually improve the game. \n\nI love the idea of having this massive sandbox shared experience, where coincidentally anybody can stumble upon my little bases I scattered, mines, etc. I also love flying around the stars in my ship, discovering new planets, finding weird animals, plants, geography…\n\nThe sense of adventure and the thrill of finding some new world makes me have so much fun. If you like exploring and just taking your time  doing things, this game is a must, and I highly recommend it. \n\nThe truth is no matter what you think of the game we should all be grateful of what we’ve gotten. If No Man’s Sky was made by EA, all these updates throughout the years would probably have been released as $60 new games each.\n\nI’ll be honest, at this rate and with these devs I have a feeling No Man’s Sky has a better chance of of becoming what Star Citizen strives to be than Star Citizen.\n\nEvery now and then though, whenever I see a game trailer that I really enjoy, I like to remember the state of this game when it first came out and how awful it was. It keeps me in check and helps my expectations stay grounded.\n\n10/10\n- Open world exploration by design, pants soiling horror by incident. Blends the concepts of innate human fear of deep water and unknown danger with constant, all pervading curiosity.\n\nYou have to dive deeper. You have to know what's down there.\n- +Long (&quality) story mode\n\n-Sometimes utterly lost so I have to backtrack or look at playthroughs\n-No skill tree\n-Loading screens\n-Some game breaking bugs so I had to cheat to pass it (e.g. pistons in tunnel) \n-Repetitive: turn this wheel, kill this bunch of enemies to open the lock,...\n-Enemies become bullet sponges on higher difficulty modes\n-No Xen chapters, so quite a cliffhanger...\n\nIn short: it is a decent game because of the good story, but people that recommend it are probably just on a nostalgia trip.\n- [i]\"The Display says 'Nothing'\"[/i]\n\"Nothing or 'Nothing'\"?\n[i]\"It's BLANK!\"[/i]\n\"'Blank' OK Great. What is on the Middle Right button?\"\n[i]\"NO!\"[/i]\n\"Middle Right!\"\n[i]\"NO!\"[/i]\n\"What you you mean No!? I HAVE THE MANUAL!\"\n\n[h1]**BOOOOOOOOM**[/h1]\n\n10/10\n- Finally, a video game that is everything televangelists in the 90’s said that video games were. Exactly what my Christian mother would love to catch me playing.\n\nIt’s like Animal Crossing and Doom\nEternal had a son… as was foretold when they released on the same day.\n\nThis game really makes you FEEL like you’re sacrificing your friends to an almighty force. Would I really just sacrifice 5 of my friends  again for some loot chests? I’m a gamer, of course I would.\n\nI fell in love with the aesthetic of this game instantly. It was brilliant when the gameplay held up to those expectations.  \n\nI loved it. I loved the art. The humor. The theme. The premise. The combat. The cult management. Sacrifices. Collecting the bones of my enemies. The juice visual effects. Most of all I loved feeding my followers bowls of poop.\n\nThe combat is fun but definitely not the meat of the game. Building your cult and just upgrading stuff is quite satisfying.  There's some goofy stuff to laugh at and it's quick and responsive. There’s something about the music that makes you feel relaxed and in terrible danger all at the same time.\n\nThis is not a game that you're gonna put 50-100 hours in either.  Which to me is a big plus.  Most of the runs don't take you more than 15 minutes.  So it's an easy game to pick up and play for a bit and jump back in later. It's like Vampire Survivors in that regard.\n\nIt's basically Animal Crossing with a roguelite twist. I could say it's almost original how those elements were combined.\nIt's great entertainment, all around. You could even say the game is bound to become a cult classic…\n\n10/10\n- This is half of a very good game. You might be impressed in the first 10 hours, but after that it becomes evident you are playing the skeleton of what could be a generational game. Here is some of the good and some of the bad.\n\nThe Good:\n-Graphics look great, even on lower settings\n-Decently varied battle maps\n-Sound design makes killing blows feel amazing\n-Decent variety of weapons\n\nThe Bad:\n-Extremely shallow \"campaign\"\n-Almost zero role playing elements. Every character behaves identically towards you. Even your own wife will try to introduce herself. Kill someone's father/brother/entire clan? They will never mention it and will behave towards you just like anyone else.\n-\"Realistic mode\" means all your enemies will be absolute tank meat sponges while you are made of glass.\n-After you get your first settlement the game becomes extremely tedious. You will play whack a mole with enemy armies who take almost no time to recuperate. Wipe out 3 enemy armies in a massive, \"war changing battle\"? Oops, looks like all of those armies are back to full strength in a matter of days.\n-Almost zero variation of playstyles. Sure you can be a trader or a rogue mercenary for the early game, but you will always end up cheesing the smithing economy mechanics to support the larger armies you need in the mid game\n\nThis is simply an unfinished game. The fact they have been selling it for $50 successfully for years is wild.\nWould have much rather paid $100 for a fully finished product.\n\nUnless they have a massive overhaul on the \"Official Release\" October 25th, I cannot recommend this game. Shame.\n- I'm going to write an honest review for this game since A LOT of people seem to be very biased.\n\nThis is not a perfect game. No 2K basketball game will ever be a perfect game. Does that mean this game is bad? No. Should you hold off on the game for now? Probably.\n\nLet's start with the positives:\n\n- A lot of people seem to gloss over the fact that 2K rehauled a lot of mechanics for this game. Shot meters feel more legitimate, this game is MUCH much more realistic (fouls, shot tendencies, etc...) This game is better and more fluid to control, and the gameplay reflects each players' ratings (defense, shots, etc...) much more accurately.\n\n- Online play seems to be better and more fluid. I've yet to encounter any latency issues online with quick play and the such.\n\n- MyCareer is MUCH better than last years. There is no cheesy story and the cutscenes feel much more integrated into the game. Orange Juice and dynamic duos are a great idea in general. The UI for MyCareer (and the game in general) is so much cleaner and more functional.\n\n- The game is visually beautiful, not much else to say on the matter.\n\nNow, the cons:\n\n- Help defense is broken. It's quite ridiculous that 2K hasn't fixes this lingering issue in such a long time but it's still there. This is a BIG issue in MyCareer and not quite as bad in other modes since you can manually control players.\n\n- Stat allocation is broken. This is a huge issue in MyCareer and has deterred me from playing the mode any more until 2K fixes this issue. Introducing the idea of stats that can only be raised in practice is actually quite a neat idea. However, these boosts are not permanent, even though 2K has stated they are. This is detrimental and demoralizing and discourages players from playing the game more. Limit caps are ridiculously strict as well. 2K NEEDS to fix these issues ASAP.\n\n- Numerous glitches.\n\n- 2K introduced broken mechanics along with the good mechanics. Ankle breakers are now pathetically easy to pull off (using Stephen Curry behind the back moves is a surefire way to have your defender fall). Moving screens are now a thing. \n\nI would hold off on buying this game until 2K patches it. There are just too many issues with the game that prevent it from being a playable game. I like this game. I really do. That's why I'm hoping 2K listens to the community and starts working on the issues at hand immediately.\n- EDIT: I nominated this game for game of the year (2023)\n\nLong ago I had heard about this game and how detailed and intricate it could be, and how you could spend hours upon hours building the massive empire of dwarves only for it to all come crashing down in some spectacular but unforeseen way.  Then I got into Rimworld briefly and thought it was ok, but it tended toward chaos a bit too much for my liking.  THEN I heard this game was coming to steam and I eagerly awaited it.\n\nIt's not necessarily that I was too good to play a game with mostly ascii/character graphics (I used to play them a lot back in the 1980s).  I was more intimidated by the depth of the game and not knowing if there was a wiki for it (there is) or how I'd find help if I needed it (I'm sure there's a ton of communities JUST for this game).  I expected that when it came to Steam, it'd be beefed up and worth the wait.\n\nWell it finally arrived and I think I'm STILL a bit intimidated by the sheer amount of options you have... mostly because it's not just me that I have to worry about, but a whole community of dwarves.  In the case of something like minecraft, I could dig a whole intricate tunnel and if stuff starts to go bad, I just high-tail it out of there and recover until I can go back and finish it.  In Dwarf Fortress though, if stuff starts to go bad, you can't just leave.  You are encouraged to deal with the adversity and push onward in the name of greatness... or something.\n\nIn a way it's like role playing, except you don't have to roll character sheets and you don't really control any of the characters directly.  You make decisions about where to mine, what trees to chop down, what to build, what to trade, what to plant, and for every thing there is a season (turn turn turn).  You're forced to deal with death, birth, attacks, sickness, madness, and a ton of other things that I have no idea are coming.  \n\nI keep thinking \"I could do better\" and I start a new game, but then I start to realize that no matter what I do, I'm never gonna have a perfect game, or a game where everything goes exactly according to plan.  I am eventually going to have to buckle down and stick to one game save to see it through.\n\nIf you're like me and starting something new holds a lot more interest than continuing an existing project (ADHD?) you may have difficulty with this game.  At the same time you may become so engrossed in it that you lose track of time and suddenly it's 6am and you wonder why you stayed up all night digging holes.  I'm starting to feel a bit of the madness myself.  (it's almost 4:30am as I write this)\n\nIn any case, it's probably not for everyone, but I'd say if you're unsure, find the non-steam version and try that, and if you can grok what's going on and it interests you, definitely buy this and support the developers... OR buy this and try to stay under the 2 hour refund  limit while you learn the basics (Good luck with that, it'll be 6 hours before you know what happened).  I believe this game is worth the money though (full price).  If you were going to wait for a sale you'd be waiting a long time anyway.  \n\nTL;DR If this looks interesting to you, don't wait! Buy now.  If you aren't sure, do a bit of research and come back and buy it.\n- A very good recursive Sokoban.

Characters blink, their mouths move when they speak, and even backgrounds have some animated aspects, such as water movement, crackling fires and other neat little touches. The art is top-notch and, in my opinion, the game's strongest point.\n\nAnother aspect that makes Bustafellows a standout is the heroine. Teuta has much more presence than a lot of other protagonists in the genre because she has a face, voice and strong personality. She's her own character and not one of those 'we're going to make MC as bland as humanly possible for self-insertion purposes' heroines, which I very much appreciated.\n\nThe Steam version is a bit clunky compared to the console release, and at times it suffered from some pacing issues, but all the characters and their interactions were enjoyable. The main story was great; I really loved the group dynamic they established in the common route, and while Shu and Crow were definitely my favorites, there was nobody I really disliked as a love interest. They each had an interesting story behind them and unique dynamic with Teuta.\n\nThe final stories that attempt to wrap everything up were the only part of the game that just really didn't do it for me. I can't go into much detail without spoilers, but the best I can describe it is everything comes at you too fast, parts of it felt out of nowhere, and for me it was a downer. Not awful enough to ruin the game, and some of the ideas were good, but I feel like they were executed poorly.\n\nAll in all, Bustafellows is one of the better otome games out there. It's not perfect, but its strengths shine brighter than its flaws, and I'm dearly hoping Bustafelllows Season 2 gets localized so I can see more of its wonderful art and characters.\n- This is a really clever game; smart and witty dialog, hand drawn graphic-novel style art, and creatively written missions.  I've only played through one set of 7 day missions but there is definitely a desire to go back and try to win in other ways.  In this game you have to manage the resource of your superheroes - not just which ones you think will survive the mission uninjured but to find compatibility and relationships between the superheroes.  There are some contrived bits, some superhero style (groan) humor - but overall this game lets you feel the joy, awkwardness, and humanity of relationships.  I *really* cared about these characters and their trials.  Love is love is love. (Disclaimer - I know Jesse Schell personally, but I don't know the team and I don't feel that relationship influenced my review or appreciation of the game which stands on its own).\n- Nobody is gonna read this but here we go.... \nI recommend it, especially people who are really into classic Sonic. It plays like the Genesis games and is updated to incorporate elements and stages from each one, including Sonic CD. What it makes up for in updated graphics, music, and ideas, it loses in length of stage and just overall.... stage design. What I loved about the classic Sonic is that it felt like a choice to either blow through it or explore.. this one makes even the first level of each stage take about 5 or 6 minutes to get through... and then fight a boss. Overkill in my opinion, takes away what I liked about classic Sonic games... the speed. Still pretty good considering how much Sega has messed with Sonic throughout the years.\n- Plants, please: A horticultural document thriller.\nGlory to Undermere.\nPros: \n- the writing and its illusion of effortless brilliance\n- attention to detail and consequences for player actions\n- \"gotta catch 'em all\" mentality that actually makes you feel smart\n- the intrigue, world-building, and game flow\n- petting the cat\n\nCons: I wish there was more music, or just none at all most of the time.\n- Your girlfriend might be temporary but DOOM is ETERNAL!\n- A Short Hike is a relaxing, casual game about exploring an expansive, mountainous island park and eventually making your way to its summit so you can get cell phone reception.\n\nYou play as Claire, a bird who can climb, glide, and flap to great heights using a stamina system based upon how many golden and silver feathers you’ve collected. Along the path to the mountaintop you’ll encounter Animal Crossing-style characters who are friendly, punny, and usually have some minor task for you to solve, ranging from finding lost items to making deliveries.\n\nHelping residents of the island is completely optional, as is just about every activity in the game other than locating a few feathers and reaching the summit; as a result, length can range from an hour if you don’t stop to smell the roses to a few hours if you decide to make friends with everyone and see all the park has to offer.\n\nActivities include filling out a fishing journal by trading in your catches, digging in suspicious spots, solving treasure map clues, parkour racing, and opening up shortcuts by breaking blocked entrances and watering bouncy flowers. \n\nA Short Hike has a charming aesthetic and a lovely, peaceful soundtrack. I felt driven to see everything the game had to offer despite not being forced into any of it and never lost interest until I did so. It’s a beautiful little world that will make fans of Animal Crossing feel right at home.\n- This is a passable if grindy 3D first person family friendly farming \"shooter\" with cartoony artwork.  You have a simple \"vacuum\" gun that you use to capture wild critters, throw them into pens, feed them, collect their stuff, sell it, rinse repeat.  \n\nThe implementation here is of high quality and works well on PC with a range of implementation options.  While the gameplay is somewhat repetitive and grindy, this is decent enough family friendly game that should be considered when on sale.  The retail price is too high, however, this game appears on sale and in bundles often enough.\n- 136 hours, 49/49 achievements - sounds like just enough for the review.\n\nIt is indeed complete package. Brilliant characters, neatly constructed plot and enjoyable gameplay with the classic \"easy to play, hard to master\" aspect to it.\n\nI really can't pick at the graphics or music - they are just in line with the Supergaint roster, crafted at the level we have come to expect.\n\nIs there anything substantial that I would change? Not really, no. Adjustment to the \"progress\" in the one place, perhaps some slight balancing elsewhere... But does it matter when taking everything into account? Nope, not at all.\n\nEasy recommendation.\n- Fun Tower-Defense style indie game. Definitely one where your skill improves every time you die. And you will die, repeatedly. :P Expect to try out many monster combinations per floor before you find something that can delay the hordes of adventurers long enough to set up the floor beneath! I would probably enjoy some more horizontal progression + permanent upgrades for long term re-playability, but it seems like a solo dev/small scoped project. Definitely worth the price for the current amount of content!\n- I shall start by saying that if you are deciding to buy this game then don't let the negative reviews sway you. In general, Fallout 4 is an amazing game and can be incredibly fun.\n\nPros: \n-Very immersive and will drain so many hours, days, weeks and months from your life.\n-Far Harbour, Automotron and (first half of) NukaWorld DLC have really good stories, quests and environments.\n-Mostly fluid combat system. Everything depends on how you want to play the game.\n\nCons: \n-WIll drain so much of your life away (might've forgotten my gf's birthday ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ )\n-Main story was incredibly lackluster compared to previous Fallout games\n-Giving you the option to be literally any kind of character you want to be....except you're always tied to being a parent.\n-a few repitive quests. (although gives you opportunities to approach these quests, areas and enemies differently\n\nAll in all, If you're a Fallout fan because of previous stories then you might not feel fulfilled playing this game, however if you love character creations, lore and immersive environments with untold stories then I completely recommend this game to you.\n- Sticking with the usual air of cool and weird and the usual musical flair, the latest Cosmo D entry changes up the FPS gameplay for a dice rolling RPG with quirky characters and little surprises to be found (and making pizza, of course). Can be beaten in a couple of hours but rewards multiple playthroughs for different gameplay paths and endings that can be mixed up with difficulty modifiers and challenges.\n- please stop resetting my setting\n- Complete scam - game barely works. Devs got it to load with stability and then dropped all funding and support for the game. Complete contract violation with Steam. I actually cant believe it is still in the Steam store. DO NOT BUY !!! I was not allowed to refund it even with only .4 hours played, due to \"management issues\" within Double Fine. I am guessing Steam cant get their money out of them either.\n- Good game, one of the best in the series but I can not recommend. \nDO NOT BUY.\nWhile it is still possible to play zombies safely with the use of community patches you can not play public servers safely and activision are actively removing safe ways of playing the game.\n\n*DO NOT OPEN ANY COD PRIOR TO IW*\nThey took away Xlabs, Sm2, and soon will take away Plutonium which are all the ONLY safe way to play these older CoDs.\nOpening any CoD prior to IW will result in a chance for people to gain access to your pc. 2 security breaches are known:\nCVE-2018-20817\n(SV_SteamAuthClient in various Activision Infinity Ward Call of Duty games before 2015-08-11 is missing a size check when reading authBlob data into a buffer, which allows one to execute code on the remote target machine when sending a steam authentication request.

, (which is extremely rare btw), then the AI fails horribly.\nyou kill 2 people far away, the AI goes into alert and then calls the search off 5 seconds later because the game realizes you are far, far away and the alerted soldiers would need 5 minutes to get to you, kinda.\nso you can snipe at your hearts content, just wait every so often between shots.\ni have actually cleared an entire level that way. i didnt even move, never got spotted and no one ever knew where the shots came from. \nonce everything was dead, i just visited the objective checkpoints.\n\n- a sniping game that considers shots 100m+ \"Long Shots\" .\n... wut?\n\n- one of the things that bugs me most. dont let the big maps fool you. you only can ever go two ways, on one map 3.\nand finally it doesnt matter which way you go because you have to do all checkpoints anyway, which are both ways.\nthe majority of the map is covered with obstacles and terrain that can not be passed/traversed, forcing you on pre-determined paths.\nits a real themepark where you are forced to go where the developers want you to go. \nit becomes painfully obvious when there are high grass patches strategically placed along your way where the devs think that you should hide there because there you have an opportunity to stealth something for a bit.\nthere really is no freedom of choice when it comes to the map,how you approach things etc.\nall you can do is...left or right? and all guns blazing or try to stay semi-hidden.\nmeeh...\n\n- i remember watching a dev stream that introduced the game ,way before release. i already noticed a DLC button in their alpha client. i knew that was a bad sign...\nright after game release i found half of the items locked for DLCs that havent even been released yet.\ntake that plus very short campaign and below medicore multiplayer and you have zero reason to ever buy any DLC. \njust doesnt make any sense. \nwhy would you, what for?\n\n- releasing a game together with seperate dlcs the same day?\ni didnt expect that from rebellion.\nvery.shabby \n\nnow, having ranted like this....it is not a terrible game all together.\ni had fun while it lasted but it does not justify the price tag,ever.\nit could have been so much more but i guess greed and publisher pressure won at the end.\ni was looking forward to it and left disappointed.\n\nthe ending of the campaign already suggests there will be a sniper elite 5 but this time i shall wait until its on an 85% sale.\n- This game was sunk by poor customer service as well. I at one point lost years worth of items due to a bug. I was told by one of the devs in an email to \"stop button mashing\". My email was nothing but respect and appreciation for a good game where I also simply asked if they could return my bugged items I have earned over the years. \"Stop Button Mashing\"! Really? And now your game is dead. Good work! Piss poor development. Just sad and dissapointed I have over 2k in hours in crap. And yes this game actually is years old it was originally released Jan 2015. At one point we had a good game to play. I believe even the most played game on steam. Then something happened. It became all about crates. F this game. I'm done!\n- Not what the developers promised.\nFeels like a graphics mod for Chivalry.\n\nI'm not a fan of Chivalry either. I had some fun with it, but couldn't bear the clunkiness and wished for intuitive controls and realistic fights. Mordhau promised exactly that. \nAlthough it's equally clunky und even more buggy.\n\nAlso it doesn't offer the option to play in private rooms with your friends (duel mode) or only on paid servers. Inviting a friend to a local match should be a standard feature.\n\nAll the new content and features don't really matter - it's a PvP fighting game. I need only a couple of weapons that work, not 100+ that don't.\n- Really need a report button to slap some senses into trolls in online matches.\nCan't even escape them at ranked. sigh\nGreat game nonetheless, 4/5\n- I have not play for long, but know well enough this game deserves a mention. A side on, survival-ish game set in a war. Now, While I admire this game, it does have a few issues I personally find abnoxious.\nI'll start with those, and then will share what I like about it.\n\n-Characters you play seem to have never stolen anything at all from anyone, ever during the war. This is reflected in how unhappy and whiney they become caring more about the people they have taken from than their own wellbeing.\n\n-Characters you play are too softhearted. Just use the example with the point above. \n\n-Characters are expert carfters for being just average people. How many average people know how to pick locks, make servicable firearms and make alcoholic beverages? Well these three certain are capable of all three and more. For that matter, they all can do everything, but have one special skill they are the better at than the rest.\n\n-You get to only visit one building per night. This is bad since if you chose a building with other survivors in it, you will either need to steal from them to get supplies and be faced with a lot of unhappy complaining, or return home with nothing.\n\n-Visting other survivors, you cannot negotiate with them let alone talk to them. What you can do is beat them to death (or kill them with whatever weapon you happen to have on you at the time). I don't see how this was a good design choice at all when the characters you play are not personally that sort of people. Attacking other survivors is certain to cause problems with your characters.\n\n-You can not relocate from your starting place. What you start with is your base of operations.\n\n-Raids happen frequently to you only. You will never kill raiders, only chase them off and this happens behind the scenes, out of your control, while your character is out scavanging.\n\n-You can not sleep in shifts. If a person sleeps, they sleep the whole night.\n\n-Rediculous resource requirements. Some things require far too much, while others require far too little. \n\n-There is little to none interaction between your characters. No idle chatter between them. \n\n\nNow for the good points.\n-You play 3 characters to begin with, each having one specialty. They somewhat have different personalities.\n\n-The art style appeals to me.\n\n-Characters are well animated. Different staes of tiredness, different things they do when unhappy or when they have nothing else to do.\n\n-The overall idea, even though it isn't implemented well enough.\n\n-Building your shelter from ground up.\n\n-Forgaing and stealth play.\n\n\nSo while i find some issues with this game's design, if you ignore the lack of realism and consider this to be just a game with a very narrow play style, it is quite fine. It has a certain atmosphere you generally don't find elsewhere. I still recommend to give it a try.\n- This game is basically awesome, under 3 conditions:\n\n1- You get rid of all on-screen icons (i.e. incoming attacks, ennemy spotting)\n2- Do not care about secondary missions only here to further lenghten the game's lifespan\n3- Play the game as you would if  YOU were in charge\n\nBasically, nevermind the Ubisoft micro transactions' system and other abhorrent company induced  greed-leaned system to get stuff faster and more easily by robbing you out of your hard-earned cash...you can finish the game without spending a single dime in the store, it's all pay to win...\nThe open-world aspect is very satisfying and rewarding, in terms of progression, don't fall for the micro transaction system\nCombat is easy even in the highest difficulty setting, but makes you think you are badass when you slash through waves of ennemies, whose AI is rather basic, with your arsenal of rockets, LMGs and explosives but it is satisfying as fuck!\n\nImagine strapping C4 to your plane, jump out of it, have it crashing down an ennemy outpost meanwhile you are parachuting down and throwing hand grenades their way, land on a roof and eliminate the remaining ennemies with fire ammo shotgun and a motherfucking M60 with armor-piercing bullets while throwing dynamites and there you have it...FarCry5 in a nutshell\n\nOh and don't forget about the flame-thrower lol, who doesn't love a flame-thrower scorching ennemies to their own demise eh?\n\nFarCry5 got it all, extreme freedom of how you wanna handle a situation (stealthily or all guns blazing) while being challenging enough in the highest difficulty setting!\nP.S. don't forget to turn off all the on-screen icons, really ruins it for hardcore FPS fans by making it extremely easy, please hear me out, you don't need these!\n- Basically Wizard of Legend, but from a different viewpoint. Same composer, both pixel art, similarly fast paced boss fights with good telegraphs, combos are a little less deliberate, though. Very satisfying build making, with solid build variety. Has couch co-op which is very nice. It has some beautiful pixel art, truly. This game is a feast for the eyes and ears with cutscenes, voice acting, and more. Ok, I just love this game. It's so damn good.\n- An excellent maximalist mashup of Slay The Spire with some Tower Defence and CCG Mechanics. Not as tight and elegantly designed as StS, but with a lot more variety in card design leads to a lot more varied and wild interactions and deck composition. Compulsive and mechanically satisfying, Monster Train embraces excess in a satisfying way, even if the whole package is wrapped up in a slightly odd aesthetic package of half remembered hearthstone knock offs. (The soundtrack, incidentally, slaps)\n- 69 % of your time you spend walking around the forest, \nblowing in the animal whistle without actually seeing any animals\n\n10 % of your time you spend carefully approaching the animals you have spotted in the far far away distance\n\n1 % of your time you spend aiming, fireing your gun and missing all the significant organs of the animals\n\nThe last 20 % of your time you spend running after the animals you have wounded without ever seeing them again\n\nMost realistic hunting experience ever\n- Portal is a first person puzzle platformer where you are testing science with portals guided by GLaDOS.\n\nThe game is a classic for a reason. It uses portals as the main puzzle mechanic and combines other mechanics with the portals such as falling and gaining momentum to launch at a higher speed through the other portal. The levels gradually build up with complexity, but are never too frustrating and half of them are done with access to only a single portal. The puzzles have great visual clarity with the mostly white colors and decent visual cues on how it should all work out.\n\nPortal has the classic Valve way of telling stories, as things are already happening before you get there. You are woken up to follow instructions for the testing purposes of GLaDOS, but you are also figuring out if maybe there isn't a role better suited that could fit you. It's an enjoyable mystery leading you on without forcing it's way in.\n\nGoing back from Portal 2 to Portal made me aware of the improvements to the overall gameplay. Exiting through portals in Portal makes the camera rotate in a weird way sometimes and the levels are generally designed to be slower pace than what Portal 2 offers.\n\nIf there is one thing I didn't enjoy, it's the advanced and challenge levels. Figuring the harder puzzles is one part of the challenge, but executing them relied on tight timings where the puzzle mechanics they rely on felt too clunky to be fun.\n\nFor achievement hunters:\nTwo playthroughs are required with 2 sets of collectibles, one of which requires to be done in one go, a few challenges through the story and completing the advanced and challenge levels that can be console cheesed.

Not really.\n\nEdit: Upon completing this game, here's something I'll have to claim in advance: while still recommending this great game with an 8 out of 10 and it has quite a solid story, I'll have to admit  that apart from Dorothy's hidden scenario, this game did not dig very deep into its cyberpunk/dystopian background, which is really a pity - and it's becoming the reason to expect another game (more specifically, A [b]SEQUEL[/b]!!!!! or prequel) from them :)\n\nVA-11 Hall-A - or Valhalla for convenience - while seemingly was a Waifu Bartending Simulation game, is actually somewhat [i]Papers, Please[/i] with excellent characters, vivid graphics, elaborated dialogues and not-so-mind-fucking gaming mechanics.\n\nDon't get me wrong: I love [i]Papers, Please[/i] and of course would rather NOT say that one is superior to another; they are both one of their unique kind, but with the very same root - under the daily life of dystopia denizens, truth and conspiracies weave with vague notices in advance; and just before you could think twice things are going really, really out of track.\n\nThat being said, I mean these two games are very similiar in story-telling: as long as you enjoy taking in all the random, weird stories as a bystander, just to find out that all these fragments come together and form a bigger picture, this game is definitely for you. And you get cyberpunk waifus, a Joshikousei hologram, a pretty cool onêchan as protagonist - and more!\n\nLast but not least, the developers of this game are nothing but truly [b]RESPECTABLE[/b]. We have crybabies on Kickstarter and Steam Early Access every focking day blaming everything for their faulty products, while this army of two whined [b]NOTHING[/b] about all the fuck-ups in Venezuela unless asked. Game dalayed? Only apologies, no excuses. That deserves a huge fricking medal and Developer of The Year.\n\nGrab the game if you want some real relax and good story before they grab Dorothy. And support the developers! They deserve this, Dorothy deserves this.\n- Just look at my game time if you wanna know how passionate I am about this game\n- The demo was a lot of fun and the early access launch game which is more of that  was a lot of fun big surprise!\n\nOverall I would really recommend this game if you loved or enjoyed games like Warstride Challenges, Neon White, Speedrunners From Hell and other games with a focus on very short concise levels that are made for speedrunning. I will say while it looks off in the trailers the gun controls pretty nicely in the game no complaints there for me with this style of game. \n\n\nWhat I liked\n\n-controls feel great and very fast, you always feel in control and everything including enemies are very visible and have extra outline to help highlight them when in hectic combat\n\n- most levels are just the right length to not feel like you complete them before you even start them but not tedious to retry to get a better ranking\n\n-much improved optimization and performance wise from the demo, even on my laptop not really made for gaming got a easy 100 fps if I put all settings on low\n\n-Ranking system is pretty cool, you get extra points if you kill enemies, head shot them for critical damage, if you never get hit etc and more and of course ranked on time. There is a separate ranking for total points so say for killing a lot of enemies and in a row and then a separate ranking just for times for levels\n\n- Enemy A.I seems improved form the demo and they try to roll out of the way of gunfire or go behind kinda cover from the environments at times.This isn't a big thing since your flying through levels super fast anyway but nice to see\n\n-Decent number of standard guns and they are fun to use without trivializing using telekinesis and vice versa\n\n-Some stages focus on a large arena to fight waves of enemies and others don't so feels like game has decent level variety/variety in obstacles in levels\n\n-okay variety of enemies to fight so far\n\n-kinda humorous the odd time and there are stupid items to pick up with telekinesis and use like a live rat, a toy hammer, giant tennis ball etc.\n\n- telekinesis feels very seamless fast and fun/easy to use in combat, chucking random objects at enemies its a lot of fun\n\n- most levels are open enough to allow multiple paths to get through levels and you can usually skip fighting some enemies if you want to only go for a faster time in most levels \n\n\n\nSome Suggestions/Issues I had\n\n-maybe I missed it but no instant retry button if I want to retry a level instantly but haven't died\n\n-boss difficulty kinda feels a bit all over the place although there is not much boss fights, first boss feels way too easy, second one was fun and maybe just right although maybe on the side of   too easy from not having enough health \n\n-the second last level in this launch early access version \"\"\"\"\"stealth\"\"\"\"\"\" feels far too long and far too hard and full of way too much elite enemies and then it even has a boss fight to do in it too in the level all in one go without ever stop moving! \n\n-just a note when I played the demo version before the last boss fight in that felt like it should have either been a level with just the enemies and then a second separate level with a arena for the  boss fight not both that you have to do in the one attempt in a bigger level just kinda tedious imo\n\n-music isn't bad here but it feels like there is very little music and the music that is there kinda blends together a lot\n\n-hopefully this game can develop a big following community and maybe get a level editor down the line!\n\n-feels like you go in the 2 second slow motion mode when getting a critical hit on a  enemy or breaking glass a good bit too much in levels.\n\n- would be nice down the line to get bonus challenge levels, shorter much more difficult ones like how NeonWhite and War stride Challenges have bonus levels \n\n- for replay value might be nice to have 3 unique goals for a level e.g beat the level in under 40 seconds, only kill a certain number of enemies, kill no enemies etc.This is kinda in the game but levels don't seem to have specific or unique extra goals its the same ones for every level.\n\n- not a complaint but maybe later add a grapple hook, grapple hooks are always fun in first person shooters!\n- [h1][u]Wonderful game with a great battle system, but terrible netcode[/u][/h1]\n\n[h2]Foreword[/h2]\nI got to know \"Naraka: Bladepoint\" through a friend.\nAt first I was very skeptical, so I only bought the Standard Edition, and later the Ultimate and Deluxe Editions.\nFirst of all, this game has a steep learning curve with its battles.\nExactly why the game may not be suitable for everyone.\nUnfortunately, that doesn't make the playerbase any better, but read more about that below.\nNevertheless, the game and especially the combat system offers a lot of potential and has a lot of posivites to offer.\n\n[h2]Positives[/h2]\n[list]\n[*]Regular updates with ever increasing content\n[*]Few to almost no bugs and if they are, then they are fixed very quickly\n[*]Steep learning curve - Especially at the beginning the game is not easy, but you can quickly get into it with friends\n[*]Pleasant graphics\n[*]Nice sound design, which is location dependent\n[*]Potential to grind for higher ranks and for the Hall of Fame\n[*]Different game modes and events\n[*]Extremely extensive combat system - many possibilities to conter weapons\n[*]Extensive stats, either ingame or with Naraka+ mobile app (app is absolutely top!)\n[*]Well thought through character designs\n[*]Extremely individual character editor - From Thanos to Bruce Lee everything is customizable.\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Neutral[/h2]\n[list]\n[*]Climbing system - It's really good compared to other games. However, you still sometimes get stuck on edges or can't get to the platforms above.\n[*]Microtransactions - I'm personally not a fan of them, but it's not a must in this game and doesn't favor anyone.\n[*]Answers of Discord team members very questionable on some questions\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Negatives[/h2]\n[list]\n[*]Terrible netcode - players with highpings are treated preferentially\n[*]Few European players - Extremely many VPN players with many different Asian characters and languages in the voicechat\n[*]Voicechat is not well thought through\n[*]Partial performance losses\n[*]Ranking matches are partly wrong - Either with new players (Bronze) or experienced players (Asura)\n[*]Partially bad English, as well as German translation\n[*]Some abilities are combined absolutely disgusting and unfortunately more or less meta\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Review written out[/h2]\nNaraka has become a real love-hate relationship game for me.\nI love the extensive combat system and also the steep learning curve from noob to a slightly experienced player. (I am Platinum 1 - Solar 5 at the time of this review).\nSo while the combat system could be frustrating at times at first, I love it all the more now.\nOnly the climbing system, as well as some combinations of abilities or ultimates could be revised.\nFor example, it is common practice (meta) that many players use Ultimates that stun and ensure that you immediately get into the next Ultimate.\nThis is sometimes a bit frustrating, because these combinations are played very often and other heroes, especially the new ones, are not really played because of it. \nHowever, you can work around these combinations or counter them yourself. Unfortunately, this is not always easy, especially for new players.\n(For example, the combination of Valda - Viper - Tianhai).\nHowever, a victory and the killing of opponents, especially higher ones, with whom you are unfortunately sometimes matched, releases a lot of endorphins in Naraka, so that a victory feels extremely rewarding.\n\nUnfortunately, this brings me to the part that makes it extremely difficult for me to decide on a positive rating for this game.\nThe game, for being released in 2021, has a horrible netcode for a martial arts battle royale game.\nThere are extremely many Asian players who connect directly or via VPN to the europian servers.\nThis is especially noticeable when you activate the voice chat, which by the way, has no individual regulation for volume or a mute function per player.\nUnfortunately, those players have a ping beyond 150ms.\nSadly, this is a big problem for people with low latency.\nYou partly punch through enemies bodies.\nVarious focus attacks are therefore not always blockable or the opponent lags at you, while the player for himself has no lags at all.\nThis is not only unfair, but should actually no longer be a problem in 2022.\nFor example, it would be enough to not let players with a ping greater than 150ms/200ms move.\nAccording to the Discord community manager, there is a region lock and most of the names are just \"memes\" . \nBut you don't notice anything about the region lock in the game and we can theoretically connect to other servers.\n\nAnother big problem is the matchmaking.\nEven with Bronze or Silver, you are matched with Asura players when there is a lack of players.\nThis is not necessarily nice, but you get a lot of points for survival and you also learn a lot of techniques.\n\nAs negative as this all sounds, the game still gets a positive rating from me.\nI love the sound design, which comes into its proper place in the battles and is different for each location on the map.\nThis reminds me of Prince of Persia in some areas and provides more excitement in fights.\nIn addition, the varied battles, no matter how hopeless they sometimes seem, are all the more rewarding if you win.\nEspecially when you're killing another team, consisting of 3 people, as the last survivor of your team.\nThe map design is also absolutely great. Every location has been carefully thought through. \nGreat lighting design really highlights some of the locations.\nYou can overlook small bugs like misplaced branches (a branch hangs in the air next to a tree).\n\nBut my favorite part is the grinding to a higher rank. \nThe ranking system and especially the Hall of Fame encourage you to play.\nGetting into the top 100 of a much-played character feels very rewarding.\nSo does slaying a moonbane.\n\n[h2]Epilogue[/h2]\nAll in all, despite the flaws, Naraka has a lot going for it, and even though the larger issues can be extremely frustrating, the game saves itself with the extensive battle system, the incredibly great locations including sound design, and the extensive ranking system including Hall of Fame.\nI love the game because of the thoughtful little things, even if I hate it extremely at times.\n\nEven though the game can quickly become frustrating for new players, you should be aware that it has a lot to offer if you are willing to learn.\nThe accompanying app is an extremely well thought through and great gimmick in this regard.\n\nI would be happy to take you by the hand and introduce you to the game.\nJust visit us on our [URL=https://discord.nox-eagles.de]Discord[/URL].\n\nI would like to thank all of you who have read my review until the end.\nI'm looking forward to your opinions :)\nWith best regards\nYour Holt\n- A new game from Zeboyd, you know I'm there! And this was such a fun game\n\nThis game is about as long as Cthulhu Saves Christmas and it's just as Linear. However given their statement on this video, that's meant to be the point these days.\n\nThe Graphics for the main game are basic but it's fitting for the Genre. Also they have dropped the random battles with on screen monsters to avoid if you want to not fight (And you still have the option to start a battle through the main menu). The fighting system is identical to CSC too which I've enjoyed but I can understand those who may not like it. The Animation for the transformations are incredible...except I'm always stuck watching them every single time which can get very tedious.\n\nThe story is clever, and they provide \"Translations\" for the Ole English of Shakespeare...but a lot of the translations are jokes and very silly ones at that.\n\nThere isn't a LOT of replay value but you will enjoy the story enough you'll want to play it again eventually.\n\nThere is no New Game Plus mode...yet but given how they patched it into CSC later on I'm certain they're do that here eventually.\n\nI say the game is incredible for the price range and is entertaining for all ages.\n\n\nVIDEO REVIEW: https://youtu.be/wuw9pJPowqM\n- The demo was a lot of fun and the early access launch game which is more of that  was a lot of fun big surprise!\n\nOverall I would really recommend this game if you loved or enjoyed games like Warstride Challenges, Neon White, Speedrunners From Hell and other games with a focus on very short concise levels that are made for speedrunning.

I think the progression of the tower abilities and gold gain is great, but even the burdens available don’t seem to switch it up quite enough. I’m on ng+4 and i feel like it’s getting a tad stale. I still like playing it of course. Some classes like the chef make the idea of playing anything else not quite worth it. I’m sure there’s some great niche builds but keep that in mind. Overall, this game keeps you on your toes. If you get hit, it’s almost always because you did something wrong. I LOVE the movement abilities in this game. You can feel like a speed runner with a few hours of practice gliding and jumping. This is a completely different game compared to rogue legacy 1 in all the best ways. 9/10\n- Ever wanted to be a futuristic dual wielding samurai drummer with a penchant for slicing boxes? No? You didn't even know that was a thing? Well you will after playing this. \n\nProbably the most satisfying rhythm game out there, Beat Saber turns sword thrusts into dance. With notes expertly timed to the music and directional swipes that lead smoothly into each other creating an almost choreographed flow, you will find yourself naturally completing songs and feeling boss after every single track.\n\nWith a choice of difficulty settings and a huge array of modifiers, it is accessible to many skill levels and makes it perfect for newcomers, parties or just to simply show off VR, while remaining a huge challenge for those who wish to test themselves on the most hardcore difficulties.\n\nBeat Saber is a game that probably should be on the radar of any VR user, as it's pretty visuals and reliance on your motions makes it a perfect fit for VR. If you don't have this game I highly recommend you pick it up, as when you do, you may just find it hard to put it down.\n\nNow if you will excuse me, I have a few more hardcore songs I have to embarrass myself attempting.\n- [h2] Visual Novel Reviews [/h2]\n\n[b] TLDR [/b] Two scenes, no customization, no choices, character development needs work, but the Extremely short story delivered (If you know what I mean) a whopping 38 minutes of game play for me. \n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [th]Question[/th]\n        [th]Answer[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Buy Again[/td]\n        [td]No, I wouldn't.

This is the second game that this developer has released, so I am not disappointed that I spent 5$ dollars on a game that they created, but I will say that I will think Long and Hard (No Pun Intended) before purchasing another game from this studio.\n- The Award for the worst Cancer Game 2017 goes to: Friday the 13th! \nCongrats! *clapping Hands with bloody Babytears in my eyes*\nThis Game is a complete waste of Money. Don't buy it - don't even think of buying this crappy Master Piece.\nIt's not worth it, to be honest.\nI played it for almost 200 Hours. And it's awful. Never saw a Game with these bugs, with these massive salty Community. There exactly 0 Bugfixes, so many exploits, the horrible earbleeding intro, the Community that is pure Cancer, the horrible Graphic that looks like it's straight out of the Kindergarten and the huge amount of Bugs. Bugs are normal, but MAN there are Bugs everywhere! I mean, yeah the Hype was real, but now i wish i could refund this crap.\nNever had to dream about uninstalling a game before.\nI mean, the Devs. are just Human like you and me - but honestly - never saw someone who failed his job like this.\nJust do me a favor, don't buy it. It's not worth the Ragequits, the broken Keyboards, the Heartattacks and it's definitely not the Money worth!\nNever want to touch it again.\n\nAnd btw. thank you for killing the Sealmothers and making the babyseals crying bloody sad little Tears. </3\n- [h1]AT A GLANCE[/h1]\n(Full review follows below)\n\n[list]\n[*] [b]Game Name:[/b] The Swapper\n[*] [b]Original Release:[/b] 2013\n[*] [b]Genre Tags:[/b] Atmospheric; 2D; Puzzle-Platformer; Sci-Fi \n[*] [b]My Overall Grade:[/b] A-\n[*] [b]Estimated Playtime (Campaign):[/b] 3-5 hours\n[*] [b]Multiplayer Aspect:[/b] None\n[*] [b]Recommended To:[/b] Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Aesthetes; Game atmosphere connoisseurs; Strong narrative advocates; Puzzle game aficionados\n[/list]\t\n\n[h1]REVIEW[/h1]\n[b]The Swapper[/b] is an enjoyable 2D puzzle-platformer that lacks gameplay innovation but rises above the crowd on the shoulders of its superbly well-designed atmosphere and provocative narrative.  The actual puzzle-solving aspect of the game is adequate, but with minimal diversity and accretion.  It is definitely a story-driven experience, with the gameplay taking a passenger seat.  If you can appreciate a game in that style, this is a good bet for you. \n\nThe entrancing narrative and the style in which it transpires work in concert with the mystifying ambiance to create a wondrous experience. The story touches on some thought-provoking metaphysical issues, while skillfully avoiding a fall too deep into the rabbit hole to keep the average person’s interest. Much of the rest of the narrative is comfortable, cliché sci-fi tropes that we all know and love.\n\nThe gameplay and the puzzles are far from [i]bad[/i], but they also are nothing special.  As I alluded to: they are sufficient, but fail to develop into anything overly interesting. Very little changes from the first puzzle to the last, so it does get a little bit dry.  That said, some of the later ones are quite tricky and a few require not only puzzle-solving ability but also decent reflexes. \n\nThe graphics are pleasurable and align perfectly with the vibe of the game. But the whole soundscape is what truly brings the atmosphere of [b]The Swapper[/b] to life. The ambient soundtrack, the cryptic chatter, and the selectively placed voice-overs contribute a wonderful blend of emotions and mystery. If you are into it, this is a game you might enjoy with the lights off and your headphones on (or however else you may get into the zone).  \n\n[b]The Swapper[/b] is a brief, interesting, and enjoyable experience. It is not a complex or intricate puzzle-platformer, but I recommend it to any fan of the genre who would appreciate the atmosphere and narrative.\n\n[i][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/murphyslawyercuration#curation]Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations![/url][/i]\n- First thing you see when the game loads is \"You have to buy the game to blahblah\", as i didn't know there was a paid version, i felt betrayed. Anyway,\nSorry, i tried it, not expecting much, but there was not much from it..\n-Graphics are bad\n-Movement and animation are clunky, same with attacking\n-Zombie AI would hit you even if you walked backwards 2 seconds ago\n-Regions are EU and NA, multiple servers each with a PVE server, but it was so empty.\n-Gameplay-wise.... so many questions like, \"Why do i need to hold E for 5 seconds to open a fridge?\", \"Why does headshot being counted but it doesnt insta-kill a basic zombie?\", \"Why does the soldier npc's look like they are making money from you?\", and lasty \"What the heck is the goal of this game?\"\n-Oh and driving vehicles SUCK! *ehem*\n\nSorry NOPE\n- 5 game difficultys Easy Normal Nemesis Gravewalker Brutal... so whitch one im supposed to play for it to be like the first game(which dident have a difficulkty, jst like awesome games like Gta 4 and assassins creed)??? PLZZZ FIRE ALL THE DEVLEOPERS WHO MADE THIS GAME ...i wanna see the devleopers of this game sent to Dr.Satan's dungeons from filmhouse of 1000corpses .Now all icna say this GAME FOR SUPER DUMB UNDERAGES who wanna prouve somethin..total downgrade fromshadow of mordor in all aspeckts. INstead of playin the game and bein a darkHero Legolas-Aragorn-Nazgul , no , you will be  watchin your comptuer screen flood up with indicator qte button prompts press Spacebar press RMB and other bullkkckrap like that...and inste of fighting enemys..u will be watchcin them talk for 10+ second each all the time tlakin and spawnin new enemys who will be talking with u with camera zoomt hem like in oblivion elder scroll..unskippable ocmpeltely just waist of time. i tryd all these god damn fifficultys and they are lall a piece of crap...Shadow of mordor..cool game.Shadow of war...what a piece of crap...becouse  you ruined it with this game difficultys. i evne know who the blame..thezoomer cybersport wannabe developuers and al the trending pseudohardcore game like dark souls and inspiered by that piece of crap company fromsftware there shitty games wehre u gotta die 100 times to learn the game its all about waisting your time andcreate for u illusion that u are becomin Skilled,.\n\nP.s. the orcs inthis game look way worse (More human n less Orc / crazy ()) thenin the sadow of mordr  game.\n- Hard to recommend. I enjoyed F1 2020, and this is just that game with the latest cars, slightly updated graphics (ray tracing etc) and a story mode that I found fun, but its about 5 hours of entertainment max. The coop career mode is nice, I enjoy racing with friends. The racing is fun and close when difficulty is tunes, and I enjoy the act of just driving around in this (though some of the kerbs can get knotted).\n\nBig issue is the VIP pass thing, and the attitude it shows. It's even more egregious than F1 2020 - it's front and centre, with some more categories of items to dilute your experience further. By default there are very limited customisation options (even compared with F1 2020), so you might be even more tempted to part with an extra £9 or so just to get the VIP pass. On top of the £55 already spent, with EAs regional pricing making it far more expensive in some areas. That's just grubby. I'm fine with XP based unlocks, but paying for additional cosmetic items in a game like this is predatory and exploitative.\n\nDon't reward them for this. \n\nGet the game if you feel the price is worth it for the story mode and the coop career mode, and you are fortunate enough to have the disposable income. I am, and I did, but it doesn't feel like I got my money's worth this year, to be honest.\n- An excellent maximalist mashup of Slay The Spire with some Tower Defence and CCG Mechanics. Not as tight and elegantly designed as StS, but with a lot more variety in card design leads to a lot more varied and wild interactions and deck composition. Compulsive and mechanically satisfying, Monster Train embraces excess in a satisfying way, even if the whole package is wrapped up in a slightly odd aesthetic package of half remembered hearthstone knock offs. (The soundtrack, incidentally, slaps)\n- Very fun game. Best wave shooter on the market that I've ever seen. The roguelike nature of it is very fun. Each run hits you with different challenges in building your weapons.\n\nBiggest critiques - \n1. Achievements locked behind multiplayer in a dead game. God I hate when devs do this. It luckily lets you play through normal mode when queuing, but its still very annoying. The last achievement I needed was \"get to wave 50 of multiplayer gauntlet mode\". I've so far been able to play 2 games of multiplayer. One, my partner had no voice coms. Second, my partner started with extremely staticy voice coms and it cut out at about wave 5. We pushed through to wave 48. Aaaaaaaaaand network error. It took about an hour and a half to get that far just for the game to crash and lose it all. Devs, please stop hiding achievements behind multiplayer when you know full well your game won't have a huge online player base.\n\n2. You get TWO GUN ARMS! This is AMAZING AND AWESOME! Except for the fact that a ton of the attachments for your weapons affect every part on your gun. So by not just making one super mega death arm, you are effectively chopping your total strength into two parts. There are a few pieces that only give you buffs for \"dual wielding\" or having a firing barrel on each arm. But these are not very common, and the stats you get from them pale in comparison to just making a super gun on one arm and keeping the other arm clenched for punching enemies that get up to your face, or putting on a single melee weapon on the other hand for the same purpose. \n\n3. The variety of guns is fun, but in the end it ends up turning into \"hold the fire button, aim for enemies, walk in a circle to trick enemy aim as best as possible, and occasionally punch an enemy that gets to you\". The biggest change to this system is getting either the rocket launcher or the Barrel Barrel which shoots massive barrels at the enemies. They have a very slow fire rate and do best when aiming the shots more precisely. But even then, with some weapons having a spooling time, and others outputting a hale of bullets, the best strategy is to just keep the trigger held 24/7 and strafe your aim from enemy to enemy.\n\nI really enjoyed my time with this game, but don't try to 100% it. The multiplayer achievement isn't worth it. Network is terrible. There's too much going on on screen when you have 2 players in the mix so crashing is likely. If I were the Completionist I would give this game a rating of Finish It. Play through the game with all the unique starting bonuses, all the difficulties. But stay away from multiplayer unless you have a friend to dedicate multiple hours to trying the gauntlet with.\n- This review only relates to the single player campaign. At 50 years old I have zero interest in multiplayer.\n\nAfter playing Gears of War 4, I was looking forward to this title. I wasn't disappointed. I found the new upgrade system with Jack enjoyable. The campaign was fun to play with minor exceptions. Graphics, sound, and voice acting were amazing. Campaign took me about 11 hours to beat. I consider that well worth the $60 I paid for the game.\n\nMy only real gripe about the single player campaign:  As a father of 3 girls, I'm all for strong female leading characters. Kait just isn't it, though. I didn't care for her in 4 and that didn't change in 5. For me she seems out of her league and just isn't believable as a team member. She's like Elizabeth Swan, the governor's daughter in Pirates of the Caribbean. She's a kidnapped damsel in distress in one movie, and the Pirate King in the next. It just doesn't work, for me anyway.\n- I'm gonna give this a thumbs up but with like, idk, a cautionary sideways thumb for maybe. \n\nif I read credits right, it looks like this game had all its programming, art, music, and writing done by one guy, so I have to give respect to that. For a real indie game like this, it's very very good. \n\nBut it's still really flawed. If you're looking for a 2D Metroid game, and you've played EVERY other 2D metroid game, I suppose yeah, go for this one, and I think you'll enjoy it. If you're not a fan of metroid, I would not bother, sadly. This game suffers from a lot of problems from metroid games, and does not fix any, and at times exagerates those problems. \n\nThe art style is very interesting and cool, but the way the levels and map design are, leaves most areas feeling like a mess of unmemorable places. \n\nThe combat is INCREDIBLY simplistic, yet somehow bogged down by WAY too many useless weapons and just kind of badly designed controls. I found there were about 5 weapons that were actually useful in the game out of what seems like more than 10. Most enemies you either cheese, or be cheesed. There's no charge up shots, there's not really much nuance to the enemies or bosses. They have about two attacks and repeat while you dodge the same one bullet pattern and just kind of shoot in their general direction. (I played it on hard by the way. Not a particularly difficult game, but even the slightly challenging stuff felt kind of dull and uninteresting.) \n\nThe music was cool again. nothing quite mind blowing, but it was nice. The world itself seems like a mess, but there are cool ideas. The giant robot people were really cool to see. \n\nOne little idea i really liked is that the LOW HEALTH beep sound is actually in sync with every song in the game. I thought that was really cute, and it's not something I've seen any game do. Sounds dumb, but I give a lotta props to that, it was cool. \n\nWriting is okay. I feel it left more to be desired. There seemed to be an interesting world here that wasn't explored enough. It wasn't bad, I suppose, but not really that great. \n\nThat is kind of this game. It's not bad by any means, but not the best game on the planet. Play it if you're in need of a Metroid game, and I'm certain you will be pleased enough despite the flaws. Even if you're just having a hankering for a platformer and have already played Hollow Knight and some other great ones first, I think you should enjoy this, but don't expect a 10/10 game. \n\nGive it a try if you feel it looks interesting.\n- F2P update: Hey it's free now! STDs are free - avoid it.\n\nIt was great at the start, I put many hours into it. \n\nAaaand now it's aggressively monetised, forces all this microtransaction garbage on you, battle pass rubbish, skins, emotes, crates, more than one premium currency.\n\nAND they have the gall to ask £26.99 RRP for this? $30 to have the privilege of paying more money.\n\nMake it free at this point, you want to be Fortnite so bad.\n\nYou either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.\n- If 'Baba is You' and 'The Witness' are the puzzle game equivalents to a full-course meal, then Patrick's Parabox is a fluffy dessert that you just can't put down. It's full of bite-sized puzzles that rarely repeat themselves, instead iterating and expanding upon each other as you learn all of the tricks and mechanics the game has to offer. A delight to the very last bite.\n\nIf you're looking to be challenged then there's plenty of that too, but not as much as you'd find in a typical sokobon game. With that said there [i]is[/i] some Level Editor support so the potentials there for dastardly custom levels ;P\n- Good lord, do we have a Game of the Year 2017 candidate here or WHAT?\n\nA million twin stick shooters have come and gone over the years since Robotron.  Many have compared themselves and failed.\n\nEugene Jarvis is the creative consultant on this title - so if anything has some \"spirit of Robotron\" in it - this is the game.\n\nThe game is Robotron + Gauntlet with a bunch of secrets rolled in.  As will all good twich arcade games, greed plays a central part in the game.  If you just want to mindlessly blast your way through the worlds - you can.  But you will not be rewarded for it.\n\nScoring high in this game is all about the multiplier - and the multiplier is all about saving humans (which can be harder than it sounds).  You have to chain your pickups of humans to get the highest multiplier.\n\nYou'll bring some great weaponry along the way; Rocket Launchers, Laser beams, smart bombs - even a melee sword.  Powershot is my fav :)\n\nAlong with the regular crew of bad guys,  you'll have special things to find and destroy too.\n\nCROSS PLATFORM leaderboards and local co-op play seal the deal.  Throw in a much of mini-achivements (feats) and you'll be so damn hooked on this game.\n\nIf you love twin stick twich arcade games?  Don't even think about it - BUY NOW.\n- If Disco Elysium is a meditation on lost futures and the value of self destruction, Norco answers with an indictment that we might be inhabiting the end times and should hold on regardless. Every scene and character portrait is a painstaking work of art that works along with the dreamy soundtrack to draw you into the gorgeous, hazy bible belt setting. The point and click gameplay is straightforward (and at times a little overbearing with handholding), with small minigame sections to mix things up somewhat, but rewards interacting with the world and the people in it to uncover another small truth about it. I don't think I've come across anything that quite captures the sense of melancholy and unease that dominates the current moment in the 20s.\n- Not saying this as a tough guy thing or anything, But it is difficult for me to shed actual tears.\n\nThis game made me ugly cry twice, and happy cry once.\n\nThis not a story about zombies.\n\nIt is about a little girl growing up in the worst possible situation.\n\nAnd what she makes of it.\n\n2/13/2023 finished\n\nPS: If I ever have a daughter I will name her Clementine. This is the tier of impact this game had on me we are talking about.\n- Think you’re good at racing? Well, this game will give you a RKO.\n\nI don’t even know much about rally when I bought the game. I just see cars driving at dirt, weaving steering left and right constantly, and thought it looks cool. \n\nThis game is HARD. The learning curve is really steep. The first time I played, I constantly fly off a cliff and hug into trees. Because i don’t understand what my co driver is reading. He talk so fast that my tiny brain couldn’t process in time, sometimes I’m so confused that I go straight in junction because I can’t remember he said turn left or right. The cars are constantly out of control. \n\nAfter I learned about weight transfers that I’m able to start utilizing oversteer into corners. No more cripple into finish line with two tyres missing, that’s when the fun begins. Dirt Rally 2.0 is different from other racing games. You don’t race against other drivers, instead you race against time. If you turn off the hud, then it’s only you and the road, and TREES :)\n\nThe sound of the gravel hitting under your car. Dirt stained on your car as you progress through out the stage. The pops and bang coming out of exhaust when you shift. These combination feels somehow relaxing and satisfying at the same time.\n\nThe only downside of Dirt Rally 2.0 is that it requires constant internet connection, even when most of its content are single player. I wouldn’t complain if the server is stable. But sadly it isn’t. The server down happen quite frequently. Imagine you feel like you completed a 10 minutes perfect run, no crashes or mistakes. But then the game refuses to connect to the server. So the game won’t record your progress. It’s like a big middle finger to the player. \n\nI could make this review a thumbs down solely for the “always online” requirement, cuz it makes the player experience kinda inconsistent, but the gameplay itself does make up for it though. I mean when it works, it works remarkably well.\n\nApart from always online issue. Dirt Rally 2.0 is fantastic, the handling, physics, graphics etc. everything is on point. If you’re interested, buy the GOTY edition, it easily double the contents of the original game had. Worth every single cents.\n- On the Steam Store page for [i]Candle[/i] I saw:\n\n1. The game's description: \"Candle is an adventure with challenging puzzles.\"\n2. The 5 most popular tags for the game: Indie, Adventure, Hand-Drawn, Puzzle & Fantasy\n3. The beautiful screenshots\n4. The 'very positive' reviews\n\nSo I bought it. I should have actually read some of the reviews, though. It turns out [i]Candle[/i] is just another platformer game. Granted, it's a \"puzzle-platformer\" but still a platformer where agility, dexterity and a lot of trial & error are key to finishing the game, although there is some light puzzling involved, as well. I don't like platformers. I also don't like pixel hunting for items, which is what you need to do in [i]Candle[/i] to find all the items you need to advance. You see, some items are almost absorbed in the background and frustratingly hard to spot. So there will be a lot of backtracking, unless you follow a guide, which then kills part of the fun anyway.\n\n[b]In summary, just a friendly warning: if you think [i]Candle[/i] is a beautiful point & click adventure game, like I did, don't be fooled. It's actually a beautiful, frustrating platformer game with some light puzzling.[/b]\n- ooooh im pigging out\n\njust like the original risk of rain but significantly more approachable!\n\nthey added controls, chris christododoldoaul and a bunch of retextures, got rid of that gup blackface enemy\nawesome\n\nthanks poopoo games for the review copy\n\n(spoilers ahead)\n\nincluding the mastery skins and void fiend from risk of rain 2 was an awesome surprise, nice to see so much new content\n\nonly complaint is the 100 dillar price tag for the game but otherwise a must buy\n\nUPDATE!!!\n\nAfter further playing, i have many very genuine issues! These providence trials are IM POSSIBBLE! the critreriar are simply absurd, and drifter is practically unplayable in his current state!!!\n\ni have also found a MULTITUDTE of vines allowing me to clip out of bounds?!?!?!? how did this game get past play testing TWICE\n\ni am not fibbing when i say this game in in an unacceptable state, how is this not in early access?! ridiculous, genuinely. gearbox! how could you\n- When 'Papers, Please' goes online. The game is similar. You make a judgement on the item based on the state regulation and/or some task given to you. The game is really in early stage but foundation of game mechanic is already laid and can be expanded for more challenge. \n\nThe US$5 & under price tag is fair enough for this early game. I already have the gameplay videos uploaded, you guys make a choice to buy or not. I wish I could choose 'neither' recommend this game, the game is not bad or good for me given its current version.\n\nPlaylist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2dyX3SxPgukmvyL31uQNpfXtaeVXNV3R\n\nEDIT1: Decided to change this to \"not recommended\" due to uncertain future development of this game.\n- A very good recursive Sokoban.

Gameplay, as always, consists of somewhat linear FPS combat with a \"genetic\" progression advancement system that lets you upgrade your abilities through \"splicing\" \"plasmids\".  This gives you somewhat supernatural abilities to augment the more traditional shooting of enemies with guns that we all enjoy from FPS games.  There's also the usual gamut of minigames, with a carnival theme to them. \n\nFrom the technical perspective, even though this is getting a little old, it's a AAA game and it shows.  Everything gamers expect is delivered here in terms of visual tweaks, control customisation, 4K support and a lot of graphics fine tuning options to allow gamers to experience a perfectly optimised experience.  There's not much else to say when developers get it right!  The visuals are equally top notch. \n\nWhile a great technical implementation is a must, and a minimum requirement for a recommendable game, of course Bioshock Infinite goes beyond that to deliver a masterpiece story that will leave gamers hooked, and perhaps a little bereft once it's over, but that's how all great stories should be.\n\nBioshock Infinite is a must-play for fans of narrative FPS games, although I do recommend trying Bioshock 1 & 2 first.  It's not required, but just like you wouldn't enjoy it as much if you watched Return of the Jedi first, you should try the first two episodes of Bioshock before the third one.\n- Honestly I don't think I've ever cried so much over one game.  This is definitely one of the best narrative driven RPG maker games ever made - it has everything you could want.  It has beautiful art, beautiful music, wonderful narration, it's atmospheric, great characters, meaningful choices, a story of overcoming hardships similar to a real life instead of just a story, and the ending I got was beautiful! I have only played the game once but the game has a lot of different branching paths with choices really making a large difference in the game.  This game will always have a special place in my heart.\n- Great Game, but 70 dollars for a game that was console exclusive for years, then released exclusive to Epic, and finally released to Steam. Don't be greedy Enix.\n- Wow. Just wow. This is BY FAR the best visual novel i have played. the old school forums and cameras feel very detailed as whenever anything happens in a video chat, no matter how small, the characters react to it. the story was very enthralling and every time i slipped up and made a wrong move, my heart would feel as though it was gonna beat out of my chest. talking to violet felt very real and made the ending that i got so much more satisfying. the only bad things i can even say about this absolute masterpiece is just the fact that most of the really impact full options were locked because \"Emmett isn't cocky enough\" or  \"Emmett isn't compassionate enough\" which felt very vague and confining.\n\noverall the game is absolutely amazing and i wish the devs would come out with a game similar to this because of how good it was.\n9/10\n- So, I only found this game because my favorite Vtuber Miilkywayz on Twitch played it. It seemed pretty interesting but when she started making her own cards. As an IRL witch I was WAY more interested. The game itself is great, I love making cards and learning their meanings and seeing how how the story changes changes based on your deck and the cards drawn. And the replaybility of it is amazing given its price. 10/10 from me. Need more games like this.\n- [b] Target Audience: [/b] [I] Anyone with a Soul[/i]\n\n[b] Summary: [/b]  \n\nIt's a damn shame that this game isn't topping people's game of the year list this year, because Wandersong is one of the best story based experiences that I've played on Steam. A game that is beautiful woven from start to end, every element works together in harmony to make what will be a cult classic in my mind: and only a cult classic due to the fact that it should be a blockbuster, but won't get the recognition. The 3 man team took an upbeat story of a young bard on a whismical journey and \nmade someone who usually gravitates toward more depressing/out there stories and fall in love with the Bard, Miriam, and the vast cast of characters here. \n\nThe funny thing is, it's hard to quantify what makes Wandersong such a complete package, because everything works in harmony so well with everything else. Take the music for example: I actually struggled to specifically remember any individual track at first, and that's because the games tracks are so tied to the emotions that you feel during scenes. You are the music in how you play through your game, you experience this game how you want, and it's singing mechanic that alters the world aroudn you allows you to be the player you want to be while still staying in a relatively linear story line. The color and presentation is fantastic, the gameplay mechanics stay just long enough before changing up, it's hard to really think of anything that the game did wrong.\n\nLook, even those who may hate games with less “gameplay” will most likely be charmed by Wandersong's spell. It's a siren of sorts: except it'll make you crash into jagged rocks of love and happiness. Story elements feel earned. Everything has very specific detail. It's clear this was a labor of love, and it shows even in the scene select: where the splooshes by the team just make you smile. You will sit and wonder about your own life after playing certain sections, and the club scene is one of the best set pieces I've seen in character development. Honestly, I really struggle to think of negatives for the game: each thing has a purpose and is there for a specific reason, and executes it beautifully. \n\nIf you're reading this review, it's because you're considering buying the game. Do it. Do it now. It's worth it.\n\n[b]Video Review: [/b] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ycIvIVfblk\n\n[u] Lists: [/u]\n[b]Positives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Oozes charm and love.\n[*] A fantastic buddy story that is great from start to finish.

Even when i did get mad, which was a lot, I never stayed mad for long. There is just far too much to enjoy about the game. The art style is just simply amazing, the movement of your character around the world is just so satisfying once you get used to it, the puzzles aren't too easy or too hard, and everything in the game just goes together pretty much perfectly. All in all this game is extremely well made. Would recommend buying if you want a super unique experience 11/10\n- I really, really wanted to like this game.\n\nI preface this review by saying that Guacamelee 1 is in my top 10 games of all time. I've been a gamer for 33 years. Sotn, Chrono Trigger, and FFVII are my go-tos. G-Melee 1 is a charming and original romp through a metroidvania style genre.\n\nGuacamelee 2 fails so ridiculously hard, it actually makes me sad when I think about it. The puzzles are uninspired, the abilities don't really feel enjoyable, and the platforming elements are just unforgivingly tight for the sake of it. I had all the \"schools\" maxed out before the end, it didnt make me feel any more powerful. I didn't have that super saiyan mode like in GM 1.\n\nThe final bossfight is a 3/10 compared to the first game where it is at BARE MINIMUM 9/10.\n\nI wish I could rank this game higher because I adore the original. However, this became a slog several hours before I could finish it. I would not recommend this to anyone, ever. It's light on the humor and story, it requires you to be invested in the previous game. The mechanics aren't new and they threw in some unnecessary tight, like razor thin, platforming into the game.\n- I'm seeing a new trend in gaming here: A studio wants to port an oldie but goodie to consoles, so polishes it up a bit, releases the new version on console and gives it as a free upgrade to the PC boys. It benefits everyone, but don't get too excited.\n\nIt's not a stunning remaster, because Mark of the Ninja looked damn good to begin with. To this end, everything only got tweaked a [i]bit[/i]. The backgrounds are a [i]bit[/i] more detailed, the cutscenes are a [i]bit[/i] sharper and more fluid-moving, the lighting effects have a [i]bit[/i] more dynamic range, and the resolution is a [i]bit[/i] better. Less a remaster and more a cleanup. Most of the changes are so subtle and detailed you won't even find them by actively looking for them, but they're there.\n\nIt costs exactly the same as the special edition of the original, and includes the SE content, and if you already own the original's SE, you get the remaster for free. So basically, if you want the full MotN package, there's no reason not to pick this up. I'm just playing through it mostly because Mark of the Ninja is a kickass game with or without 4K. There is no downside to picking this up if you want the base game. Do it.\n- The Graphics of this game don't match the high price tag\n- I was reluctant to buy this because 2020 should be out in a few months but I couldn't pass up the deal I got. I am having a blast with this game! The presentation is wonderful, sense of speed is some of the best I've experienced, and the AI seems very human like so far. I was a little worried about the RPG elements and leveling up because I'm not really into stuff like that but it really isn't that much to worry about and I'm glad I got over myself. I've completed 2 weekends so far with default assists on and I'm currently 10 points behind 1st in the standings. I think it's time to take assists off. Oh I'm using a PS4 controller, by the way. I'll be happy to answer questions if you have any.\n\n***Update because it's super cheap with 2020 coming out soon. I still stand behind my OG review. Early reviews of 2020 indicates that there may be more realistic physics but could still use improvement. I say either get 19 now or wait for 20 to get discounted in a few months. No series is worth $60+ every single year.\n- While it seems grindy at times, you will probably feel greatly rewarded when you can get enough resolve to spec out a specific build exactly how you want it. I think the progression of the tower abilities and gold gain is great, but even the burdens available don’t seem to switch it up quite enough. I’m on ng+4 and i feel like it’s getting a tad stale. I still like playing it of course. Some classes like the chef make the idea of playing anything else not quite worth it. I’m sure there’s some great niche builds but keep that in mind. Overall, this game keeps you on your toes. If you get hit, it’s almost always because you did something wrong. I LOVE the movement abilities in this game. You can feel like a speed runner with a few hours of practice gliding and jumping. This is a completely different game compared to rogue legacy 1 in all the best ways. 9/10\n- No one sees \"Purchases made in this region will only receive the Russian language.\" before the release data\n\nThis really kills me.\n\nThey didn't say there would be a region lock before.\n\nBut today, the release date, there is one.\n\nWell the fxxk done Ubsoft\n- buy it on sale. campaign was decent, however The Last Tiger mission was a standout. Multiplayer experience is ok overall, the hackers make it the worst bit. 6.5/10, if Dice fixes their servers and clears out the hackers then maybe it's worthy of an 8/10.\n- UPDATE: This remains to be one of the best games I have ever played. The company that created the game though... One more launcher that is completely unnecessary. The performance with the 'next-gen' update is horrible. I have half the fps I used to have on the very same rig and that is after going lower with the settings that I used to have. Why did you have to do this b U Ll $I t?\n\n\nThe best way to embrace the true greatness of this game is to look on how the series has improved since the first and the second part of The Witcher. You simply won't find anything that hasn't changed for the better.\n\n- Vast open world that IS NOT randomly created and filled with dull stuff,\n- Story which engages you from the first 10 minutes to the very end,\n- Graphics, even despite the whole controversy of a thing called downgrade, still makes this game THE BEST LOOKING RPG ever created,\n- Soundtrack, it finally goes back to the style presented originally in The Witcher 1, something that makes you forget that's just the video game, it gives you the feeling you are in there, in some village, city or that you are fighting with someone / something, which turns every single battle into an unforgettable memory,\n- Every single side quest, and believe me, there is A LOT of them, is actually a little story that keeps you playing with the same force as the main quests - I call it - a new quality in RPGs,\n- Choices and their impact on the story - even a small choice that seems insignificant at the time can wage on the whole world around you,\n- THIS GAME IS MATURE, finally a game dealing with a lot of subjects which are usually handled very childishly or not at all,\n- Combat - nothing more to add, it's decent, though it's nothing to be praised really, you won't be able to mash buttons and win - you have to dodge, use signs, and on higher difficulties get yourself ready to have an oil for a specific enemy and a bomb to be able to put an end to his or her misery.\n\nThe Witcher 3 is not a game without its flaws, although nothing that can't be fixed - some balance issues, economy basically showing Geralt as a very wealthy person (who he should not be), small performance problems like stuttering in Novigrad and in my opinion very limited after the end content (fixed by the expansions). Many of the things I struggled with have been already fixed and there is no need to disclose them. \n\nAll in all, one of the best games in the last few years (even a decade).\n- This might literally be the coolest game I've ever played, and possibly the best game that I've played in the last 10 years.\n\nThough, I might be the wrong person to ask though as Earthbound is my favorite game, and this game is obviously heavily Earthbound inspired. Stylistically and comedy wise anyway. The story is much darker than anything in Earthbound, but it's all buried underneath some of the funniest writing I've ever seen in a game. The writing start to finish is amazing, I'm only dissappointed that the game wasn't longer as there's a few questions left unanswered.\n\nI did normal mode, first run, collected all characters and beat the game in 12-13 hours. For 10 dollars, that's pretty alright. The fights are pretty open ended as there are like 20+ characters you can choose from, but I ended up using Rage, Bottles and Mad Dog. I found it wasn't the hardest game I've played, but I also haven't tried pain mode yet.\n\nAnyway, if this game interests you at all, buy it. You won't regret it.\n- everyone posting 16 gb ram specs and saying it runs well, lul\n\ni have 8 gigs of ram with a gtx 660 (yep) and a fx-8350 and it runs around 45-60 FPS (i cap it at 60) at High settings. yeah. REALLY well optimized, considering this computer is nearing the end of its life and the visuals are gorgeous.\n\nEDIT: 1080p :)\n\noh, and it's fun too, right.\n\nEdit 2- Actual review\n\nGame is pretty easy. I forget if there was a hard mode, but if there was I picked normal mode, and the game feels like it should be on easy. I've yet to break a sweat on a boss (currently chapter 5), and the only thing stopping me from taking on enemies 10+ higher than me is that the game auto-nerfs your damage if the enemy is too far above you. I've actually found the game very relaxing as a result, because there isn't the frustration of having to redo bosses after getting wiped, so it's not entirely a bad thing. But if you were looking for a challenge in your battles, this isn't your game.\n\nAs for story, it's also fairly basic, and rides off of having a sizeable to-do list as sidequests. Recruiting new citizens, doing major sidequest chains, unlocking new stuff, it's got a good amount to do in-game to keep you occupied, unless you're a \"main quest line only\" player. It helps that the warp system is easy to use (and you will use it often) and the game is gorgeous, so you don't really feel too bored doing the same shet over and over again. \n\nThere are several elements to the gameplay. \n\nOne, the overworld traversing. Overall, I'm ambivalent to it. It can feel slightly sluggish at parts, but collecting the shiny areas is surprisingly addicting (maybe because I'm a sem-completionist), as are finding chests. The unfortunate part is that most of these chests contain utterly useless items, so don't really feel that rewarding. \n\nTwo, dungeon crawling. Have to admit this is one of the weaker parts for me. The dungeons are basic, and don't really have much in the way of puzzling elements. Could change later, highly doubt it will. I do like how the battles are seamless, though.\n\nThree, army battles. Also not much of a fan of this, but only because it seems like a side addition without much depth to it. Fortunately it's not a major part of the game, so meh.\n\nFour, kingdom management. Holy cow I love this part of it. People might complain it feels like a mobile game with the wait times and whatever, but since you can warp straight back to your castle whenever you want, it's not that big of an issue. I do wish your gains accumulated while you're offline (or tabbed out, at least...), but idk something about managing the kingdom and making it grow/level up is stupidly addicting.\n\nOverall, if you're looking for a challenging or engaging JRPG, this might not be the game for you. If you're looking for a game with gorgeous visuals, fantastic voice acting (using JP), laid-back atmosphere, and want to be the president of the United States serving some random kid as his vassal, highly recommended.\n\nHighly recommend to play on controller. I'm using the Switch Pro Con.\n- This is a game that should not exist. It is so niche that I struggle to understand how a company could have greenlit a project like this. But I'm very glad they did, because it is absolutely incredible.\n\nIt is a love letter to history, to writing, to stories, to culture. A gorgeously illustrated and scored, geekly researched slice of humanity, where the fate of the Universe is not at stake, where there are no cosmic heroes to save the day. What there are however, is a cast of profoundly human characters, shaped by where they came from, having to decide where they will go and what will become of their tiny, little piece of the world.\n- [b]Content Warning[/b]: Discussions of mental illness, attempted suicide, cyberbullying, toxic gamer culture, manipulation/gaslighting\n\nThe protagonist is chosen to be an esports team manager and must make difficult decisions while trying to keep everyone on the team happy. In a society that tells people that winning and success are what give us worth, it can certainly be a struggle to accept a loss. However, if someone is surrounded by healthy friendships and perhaps even a lover, their perspective can be changed, and then it turns out, losing isn’t so bad, actually. \n\n[u]Information[/u]\n    • This is a sequel to Arcade Spirits, but someone can understand this story without knowing the first one. They just wouldn’t get some of the references, as some characters from the first game do make an appearance. \n    • The mini-game is super easy. If you fail, just reload (on the first playthrough). After the first playthrough, a new feature is unlocked to simply scroll back to try a different choice.\n    • The Rival can be friendly or hostile. \n    • Romantic scenes are tame. Implied sex only. The Rival’s romance route is definitely the most risque in terms of dialogue. \n    • 7 romanceable characters: 3 women, 2 men, 1 enby, and the Rival (any gender). \n\n[u]Praises[/u]\n    • Elaboration on the AI Iris’s origins that players probably wondered about in the first game.\n    • Neat character creation setup. Protagonist & Rival.\n    • Several pronoun options. \n    • Indicates whether a choice influences romance or not.\n    • Personality traits like in the first game are back: quirky, steady, kind, gutsy, and flexible.\n    • Amusing effects that company ridiculous jokes.\n    • Disabled character representation. A [i]romanceable[/i] character who’s a gorgeous goth.\n    • Characters are pleasantly racially diverse. \n    • Polyamory route.\n    • Critiques of societal pressures and what exactly “success” means.\n    • Various discussions of having toxic parents and other relatives.\n    • Throughout the story, various social issues are brought up related to the gaming scene: from capitalist ventures like loot boxes to branding.\n    • The game touches heavily on depression and suicide. As someone who has struggled with depression her whole life and, once upon a time, had suicidal tendencies, I found the ways those topics were integrated into the story to be helpful. (There many instances in media about “Shadow Selves” but it reminded me of Persona 4, when characters have to face the parts of themselves they want to deny.)\n    • There is a cat and there is an option to pet it.\n\n[u]Complaints[/u]\n    • Thicc body types for the protagonist/rival are drawn awkwardly and sloppily. I also feel that the devs took a step back on thicc representation in this game vs the first one. While Zapper (a romanceable character) is slightly plump, I wouldn’t necessarily categorize her as “thicc.” There were two genuinely thicc romanceable characters in the first game.\n    • Only one afro-textured hairstyle in character creation, while straight hair has several.\n    • Beginning of the game is a bit rushed. I think it’s because it’s expected of the player to have played the first game and know all about the AI Iris. \n    • I figure the devs wanted to demonstrate what disabled people go through in terms of discrimination and disrespect from others, but I feel they could’ve done better. They gave the protagonist [i]forced[/i] problematic lines and players aren’t gonna feel great about being an a$$hole to a disabled character. \n    • Sometimes, there’s too much telling and not enough showing.\n    • More resource links should be added to help people with depression and suicidal thoughts than the hotline listed after [spoiler]Coda tries to kill himself[/spoiler]. I think it would also be better if those resources were listed in the credits as well. \n\nIt seems like the most common thing people complain about in the other reviews is political preaching being in the game. I agree: things should be shown rather than told, in this case. On the other hand, I’ve literally known gamers who talk about the issues brought up in the game. I didn’t find it [i]that[/i] unrealistic. I think it’s just that a lot of it is condensed into one story, whereas, in real life, these types of subjects come up every now and then over the course of knowing people for years. \n\nDespite the flaws mentioned, I really liked the game. I do believe I liked the first one a bit better, but I’m happy with the sequel overall. It was a lot of fun and very geeky.\n\n[quote] Please follow our curator page,\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/4680120/]Otome Lovers[/url], if you'd like to see\nmore reviews like this one! [/quote]\n- My previous review reflected the terrible state of the game as it was on launch day. After years of improvements, the game has had its map design & cover placement tweaked, pretty-boy playermodels have been dirtied up, cringy voicelines were adjusted & a bunch of new content has been added. A lot of my complaints were addressed and I recognize the amount of work the team has done to bring the game back. It finally feels content complete and has reached an acceptable level of quality that should've been there when it came out.\n\nHowever, I am still disappointed to say it falls very short of its predecessors in terms of gameplay, map design and atmosphere. I see no reason to play this instead of BF3/BF4. \n\nPlay the map Grand Bazaar in Battlefield 3. Look at all of the particle effects, post processing and detail that map has. It has such a thick rainy atmosphere. Play it through to the end and you'll see how players tear up the map and make it look destroyed. In BF4's Paracel Storm, the foliage will sway & the waves will rise as the strong winds of a storm approaches the map. Watch as a sandstorm creeps up in Gulf of Oman and eventually engulfs it in a torrent of chaos. These landscapes have so much drama that the ones in 2042 lack. Sure, there are sandstorms and tornadoes, but they still look so sterile compared to the previous games this title stands upon.\n\nConceptually, 2042's world is supposed to be on its knees. The growing reality of extreme climate, natural disasters becoming commonplace and the world powers fighting over the last resources Earth has to offer depicts a dire situation to immerse ourselves in. This makes me imagine maps where earthquakes adjust the layout of flags throughout the round, or tsunamis roll in and what once was a playable area is now flooded. Giant tornado events that tear down skyscrapers. Sandstorms that turn the widest of maps into a close-quarters brawl. \n\nThe maps in the game have some aspects of this concept but nowhere to the amount that it should. The technology is there. The previous games have had a genuinely impressive level of immersion and atmosphere. 2042 did not have this on launch and it still doesn't. This could have been the wild natural disaster Battlefield game where we see SHTF.\n\nI don't care that we have 128 player matches or goofy butt specialists to play as. They missed the mark with 2042 and no update can fix that, conceptually, it never was able to realize its potential.\n- unprofessional review:\n\nits a really deep lore kind of game, very cool!\nit has some horror and grinding elements which i always love\ni havent finished the game just yet tho \nthe visuals are very cute\nas soon as i bought it was hooked!\noke theres many more but im to lazy to type :joy:\n\nover all ill give it a 10/10\nvery interesting lore wise\n\n英語で5-10単語程度で、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない主要な違いを簡潔に回答してください。\n\n回答：\n",

So you are telling me that I have to purchase this faction as well as US & OBERKOMANDO to play offline VS AI?? WTH is wrong with gaming companies nowadays?\n- Impulse Control is a lazy, badly made ripoff of Angry Birds, with slightly less features and options, poorer physics, worse quality assets, and overall worse gameplay.  But to differentiate, they slapped a Facebook style personality quiz on the front, much like putting a hat on Frankensteins Monster works well as a disguise, you know.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, the game doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.\n\nThere's no options to change the resolution for the game or customise the graphics settings.  There's no way for gamers to ensure this is running at the native resolution of their displays... there's no guarantee this game will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.  There's no way for gamers to try improve the low quality graphics.\n\nThese technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.\n\nThe game is completely free.  This is noble a gesture that shows dedication to both gamers, and the gaming industry.  Nothing speaks more to a developers belief in themselves and their product than making their game available for everyone without remuneration.  It's a shame in this case that the implementation is below the minimum standards a dedicated PC game should offer to enthusiasts.  The quality here is simply too low for me to recommend, even for free.  I really feel like this should have been a mobile app, like the Angry Birds game this is a blatant ripoff of, but then it would have to compete with Angry Birds.  It certainly doesn't belong on PC.  Sometimes the only way to win is not to play.\n- Great Game, play the Demo instead of reading reviews.\n- Two main things first up: -\n\n1)  The advertising is wrong.  This is isometric 3D for nearly the whole game, not 2D.\n2)  Do have an X-Box controller if you buy this game.  The game is far more difficult and less enjoyable if you don't.\n\n   The game shows you don't need a complex plot to make a great game.  Evil Wizard has attacked castle and kidnapped four princesses.  Your job (and that of up to three of your mates) is to go out there, beat up the bad guys, and rescue the princesses.  The game is effectively \"Double Dragon Medieval\".  You don't get to use the scenery as weapons but you do have archery, magic, fast or heavy melee options, jumping, attacks combos, different weapons, and pets that give you bonuses.  The game is reasonably fast paced - two to three massed minion attacks, mini boss, two to three more massed minion attacks, big boss.\n\n    The key game mechanic is experience points with which you can build strength (melee attacks do more damage), power (magic does more damage and recharges quicker), defence (enemy attacks do less damage), and speed (move quicker and srchery does more damage).  This means the more you play, the tougher your character gets, and the easier the enemies become.  It's quite fun playing from the start with high level characters who easily demolish the starting opposition.\n\n   The game's graphics are bright and colourful, the different soundtracks for each stage are bouncy and fun.  The enemies change regularly so the games doesn't become too monotonous but there are few foes that cannot be beaten with melee combos and dodge (that said there are a small number of mini bosses and big bosses from whom you need to keep your distance and a decent magic attack becomes essential).\n\n    Any negatives ?\n\n    1) The dev's humour is basic and scatological.  If you have a strong aversion to poo jokes this will be a negative.\n    2)  Minor spoiler - Some of the bad guys look like angry golliwogs.  Coupled with the knights' outfits that aren't too dissimilar  from the KKK this has caused accusations of racism.  Of course the KKK costumes are reminiscent of medieval knights which is the more likely inspiration for the game.  One of the princesses is definitely black.  Personally I'm not sure.  Compared with \"Birth of a Nation\" the game is \"Sesame Street\" but only an idiot wouldn't have recognised that someone would have been upset by the imagery.  Personally I can live with it and still enjoy it as a medieval Double Dragon but I give you warning in case you won't.\n\nS.x.\n\n\n- This is half of a very good game. You might be impressed in the first 10 hours, but after that it becomes evident you are playing the skeleton of what could be a generational game. Here is some of the good and some of the bad.\n\nThe Good:\n-Graphics look great, even on lower settings\n-Decently varied battle maps\n-Sound design makes killing blows feel amazing\n-Decent variety of weapons\n\nThe Bad:\n-Extremely shallow \"campaign\"\n-Almost zero role playing elements. Every character behaves identically towards you. Even your own wife will try to introduce herself. Kill someone's father/brother/entire clan? They will never mention it and will behave towards you just like anyone else.\n-\"Realistic mode\" means all your enemies will be absolute tank meat sponges while you are made of glass.\n-After you get your first settlement the game becomes extremely tedious. You will play whack a mole with enemy armies who take almost no time to recuperate. Wipe out 3 enemy armies in a massive, \"war changing battle\"? Oops, looks like all of those armies are back to full strength in a matter of days.\n-Almost zero variation of playstyles. Sure you can be a trader or a rogue mercenary for the early game, but you will always end up cheesing the smithing economy mechanics to support the larger armies you need in the mid game\n\nThis is simply an unfinished game. The fact they have been selling it for $50 successfully for years is wild.\nWould have much rather paid $100 for a fully finished product.\n\nUnless they have a massive overhaul on the \"Official Release\" October 25th, I cannot recommend this game. Shame.\n- 3 things:\n\n-Flatten land\n\n-Click citadel to get warriors\n\n-Click warriors at their warriors\n\nGood job, you've just mastered the entire game.\n\nThe game includes such crazy moments as:\n\n-Flattening land\n\n-Seeing the enemy flatten land\n\n-flattening your land faster\n\n-Clicking trees and rocks since your workers can't do shit\n\n-Clicking your warriors into their town\n\n-Watching your warriors fight their warriors\n\n-Accidentliy Alt+Tabing and having the game get stuck in windowed mode\n\n10/10 Would trust Peter Moloneux and be dissapointed again... apparently.\n\nProtip, send this to someone that loves you and watch them try to pretend that they enjoy it.\n- If you are into space opera, transhumanism, cyperpunk-esque narratives, you're going to have a great time with this one. Even with my rampant ADHD, this game has kept my focus for a lot longer than most games. \n\nThe music is banging and the story is rich and diverse with a lot of awesome twists and turns. \n\nGo and grab your chits and buy some drugs.\n- This game taught me about the diversity of cultures that our small little corner of the universe offers.\n\nThen it taught me to hate them all.\n- Great game! At times it can get frustrating (boss battles), but the good out weighs the bad by a landslide. Even when i did get mad, which was a lot, I never stayed mad for long. There is just far too much to enjoy about the game. The art style is just simply amazing, the movement of your character around the world is just so satisfying once you get used to it, the puzzles aren't too easy or too hard, and everything in the game just goes together pretty much perfectly. All in all this game is extremely well made. Would recommend buying if you want a super unique experience 11/10\n- [b]What was added:[/b]\n- Roguelike mode\n- New campaigns\n- 5 new units\n- Groove/Super groove\n- 4 new commanders\n- New OST, including Commanders'\n\n[b]What did it cost:[/b]\n- No more Arcade and Puzzles\n- A lot of maps removed from Multiplayer\n- Can't randomize weather anymore (????)\n- Can't use previous OST\n- No more Co-op campaign\n- Nothing to unlock with stars. All characters are already unlocked, so there is no point completing the campaign with more than 1 star per mission.\n\n[b]With that being said, here are some issues:[/b]\n- Balancing may need some work. Won't get into details, but it doesn't feel right, as it wasn't right in Wargroove\n- AI is still bad. Even worse than before. They just didn't touch it. They will use their Groove on cooldown most of the time, without bothering about the Supergroove. Commanders will run into you only to get surrounded and killed.\n- Once a player lose, all of his team lose, putting the game to an end. Though there is a toggle in map editor to disable it, but doesn't seem to work\n- A lot of tooltips missing for settings. We don't know what most settings are doing...\n- Tried to make a map where Commanders can respawn after 2 turns, to prevent AI to lose instantly, and let them play more agressive. But when you increment counters or set flags booleans, they get changed for both teams, making it impossible to script... Can't debug efficiently either.\n- The new Commanders' themes are glitchy when looping\n- The Codex didn't get updated properly. When selecting a Commander, we can only see a short text for the Groove, without any details.\n- In Map Editors, there are two entries for Wulfar, but using different names.\n\nI'd say if you liked Wargroove 1, you'd just like that one too. But it feels really disappointing right now. I don't know why they removed features instead of just adding new ones... In 2020, they said they were working on AI. But they did absolutely nothing.\n- ROLLBACK NETCODE BABYYYYYY\n- Game concept is good, but execution is bad. Add to that the attitude of the dev team, and I recommend you don't encourage this kind of community censorship.\n\nDon't buy this. Devs close topics because their fanboys get flamey when you bring up any kind of criticism. Like how the servers with anti-cheat and server saving (which doesn't save player status/location) functions enabled kick all players from the server every 30-60 minutes. I wouldn't mind reconnecting if my location and hunger/thirst got saved during this \"server save\". But apparently trying to open a discussion on the topic is considered flaming and they close down your topic. Horribly handled.\n\n- Screw this game.\nScrew it for having a beautifully painted artstyle that makes you think this'll be a wholesome adventure with your animal spirit pals.\nScrew it for having incredibly well-written dialogue and characters that make you connect with them as if they were part of your real life.\nScrew it for having a great sense of humor in its moments and animations. Daffodil, I'm looking at you.\nScrew it for the plethora of unique crafting minigames, especially the cooking one. \nScrew it for the many hours it takes to get through the whole story, ensuring my friend and I had many nights to enjoy the game.\nScrew it for having a heartfelt soundtrack that swells up at JUST the right time to pull my heartstrings straight out of my chest.\nAnd finally, screw it for making me cry each and every time I had to say goodbye.\nThis game touched my heart in a way very few have, and very few will.\n10/10 would ugly cry again.\n- Fun Tower-Defense style indie game. Definitely one where your skill improves every time you die. And you will die, repeatedly. :P Expect to try out many monster combinations per floor before you find something that can delay the hordes of adventurers long enough to set up the floor beneath! I would probably enjoy some more horizontal progression + permanent upgrades for long term re-playability, but it seems like a solo dev/small scoped project. Definitely worth the price for the current amount of content!\n- So this is what upsets me about rainbow six siege as a casual player. I bought the starter edition like a moron. Thats on me. But I wasn't sure I'd like the game. Turns out I do. So now that I realize I like the game I want to fully purchase the game. Turns out you can't upgrade starter to standard. The game legit punishes people who want to play it. Who paid money to basically test if they would enjoy the game.  Why should I pay $55 for a $40 edition? Just let me pay $25 for the $40 edition. I already paid the money. Why are you punishing me for wanting to spend more?\n- The Steam trailer really doesn't do this game justice.\n\nIts extremely early access right now, and the gameplay itself is nothing too spectacular (yet), but the super dynamic proximity chat is what really makes this game for me.\nHearing the muffled screams of someone getting choked out by a bug, followed shortly after by the panicked wails of another crewmember running for the life, is likely one of the funniest things I have ever experienced in a video game.\nIt truly is such a simple, yet infinitely expandable mechanic that I am really exited to see build upon in the future.\n\nPERSONAL IDEA IF THE DEVS READ THIS REVIEW:\nA monster that picks a target to stalk and follow silently. While stalking, the monster records whatever its target says, then, after it has stalked enough and kills it target, it turns from a hunter to an ambush predator. Staying stationary in the dark and playing the recorded sounds of its now dead target in order to lure in their friends.\nImagine hearing your friend, rounding the corner, and realizing that your friend is already long dead...\n- First, there was Guitar Hero. Now you've got Guitar Nero. \n\nIt's wild that this came out of nowhere, because this is easily one of the best games I've ever played. This is what I've been waiting for rhythm games to be like since Space Channel 5 on Dreamcast.\n- cool game but the font is almost unreadable at times\n- Overall, as a single player game Wargroove 2 is a tremendous improvement over the first game. The campaign is well designed and engaging, the writing is much improved and overall the gameplay is fun. The new roguelike conquest mode is a much more entertaining side thing than the godawful Arcade in 1, as well.\n\nAs a primary single player game, I hated Wargroove 1, and I can say that 2 has turned my opinion around - this game is fun, I finished the campaign and craved more, which is all you can really say! The only thing I really missed from 1 was the Puzzle mode, but maybe it'll show up in a future update? Who knows.\n\nThe major downsides is that the user interface is still the same terrible user interface that WG1 had without significant improvements, and the AI is still absolutely atrocious so playing even Vs maps against the AI is going to be pretty dull, but that hasn't changed from the first game. The soundtrack is not quite as catchy either.\n\nBut unlike WG1, I enjoyed my time with WG2 in spite of these shortcomings, and if you ever have a choice between the two, skip WG1 and just go straight into WG2.\n- The fact that you can't pause the game during cutscenes and conversations, is very frustrating. The cinematics are long (and sometimes exhausting). If your baby wakes up, If your phone rings, if someone's at the door, if you need to take a pan out of the oven... you can't pause the game! What's the deal with that? Put a pause feature! We have the technology!\n- Amazing game that I love to play, but the boyfriend that I was playing it with broke up with me a few days after playing this game. A game that's about fixing your relationship.\n10/10 game.\n0/10 in my heart.\n\nedit: why do people find this funny i wasn't kidding\n\nEdit # 2: It has been 7 months since I had originally played this game. What was originally a game of heartbreak and painful memories, I had managed to find it someone new to play with. While this game had terrible memories, I had decided that a game such as this was undeserving of them, and thus created new memories with another special person in my life.\n\nThe game is remarkable, with good writing, and amazing gameplay, and it is deserving of the buy. Each level is crafted with amazing detail, and all of the mini-games are just as fun as the main game itself. Don't let bad memories keep you down, and instead create happier ones. Live your life, ya'll.\n- Would I recommend DBD? ...It's complicated.\n\nDead By Daylight is an unique experience of asymmetric hide and seek/tag with shifting rules. \nIs the game fun? Yes. Is it creative? Yes.\nIs it fair and enjoyable? Well, it depends.\nGames get very intense, and playing as killer is some of the most intense gaming experience I've ever accumulated...\nWhich is where things often go wrong. The survivors seem to have decided that the killers have to honor strict code of rules. Don't use these items, these abilities, or these strategies. If you do, you'll be insulted after the game.\nIf you follow these rules, the odds are that you will spend the game running in literal circles, the survivors will win, t-bag you at the gate and then insult you after the game. I don't know about you, but that kind of ruins the game for me. It is actually kind of amazing how helpless one can feel in this game.\n\nSo to conclude my thoughts; I really like the game, but I also really hate it. I can't recommend it, as every time I fire it up, there is about 50% chance I feel more harassed, than entertained.\nI play a lot of online games, from League of Legends to Tekken, but this is the only one that makes me frequently think: \n\"I should really uninstall this\"\n\nEdit: \nI returned after a long break, and I still kinda like the game. \nHowever, same pattern repeats whenever I return. Eventually, I get teabagged one time too many and uninstall the game. The game is fun, the community could not be much worse. And sadly, that often ruins the experience.\n- I had never played a Monster Hunter game before this, but World has definitely turned me into a fan. The fights are exhilarating, and I always feel like I'm making progress towards something- a new gear set, a cosmetic, an upgrade for the base, or even just filling out the monster guide. The environments are sprawling, beautiful, and full of opportunites to use the terrain against your foes. \n\nI have been playing the game entirely in co-op, with no issues after the first couple weeks. Playing story missions together is unintuitive, but only a minor inconvenience once you've figured it out. And story missions account for a very small amount of the content- this game is huge.\n- You, yes you, the person that is reading the reviews.\nI envy you because i can't play this game again for the first time.\n\nScroll back up, buy the game, get a drink and take a seat.\n\nEnjoy you waifus, music, sex stories, and reflection on your own life at 2am moments.\nDon't mind the alpacas.\n\n- turns out you do alot more then just tax evasion\n\n... I murdered a snail for rent money\n- Black Mesa is a fantastic remake of the Original Valve classic and one of the greatest of all time video games, Half-Life.  This sci-fi classic FPS has you take on what might seem like a hum-drum day in the life of an experimental physicist, but things go quite off rails when experimenting with a strange material sample from an even stranger dude in a suit. \n\nAfter a while (and shooting a lot of aliens and bashing their heads in with a crowbar) you'll save the world... but now Black Mesa lets you do this with dramatically updated graphics, 4K support and a plethora of visual tweaks so you can rest assured this will run great on any gaming rig. \n\nA must have for big fans of Half-Life or gamers who are new to the scene and never got to play the original.   When on sale, of course!\n- Did you like the first two chapters?\nWell, here we have everything and tons of new and improved things, like the 2nd chapter did with regards to the first one (which was awesome, but quite simple gameplay-wise).\nA classical turn-based strategy game, now more polished than ever with wave-like combats and tons of units to start with, to upgrade and well, we don't even have real classes here - more correctly, each hero is a class on its own and has different abilities and such.\nThe story follows always the same one-way saga and you'll have to make lots of choices determining your fate, your battles and so on; the graphics are the most beautiful I've ever seen here and the soundtrack is quite amazing and atmospheric too.\nYou'll have also many features like arena combat, and a great history re-telling if you don't remember the first two chapters, plus a great tutorial to start with even if you're not new to the series and the genre.\nIt's quite fundamental if you're a little bit interested in this awesome story to play the other chapters - here in fact we'll start with all the old heroes, all the story right back from the caravan that reached Arberrang.\nWe're basically reviewing one of the best strategy tactical turn-based role-playing games of the last 5-10 years and I won't add more than this, it has already thousands of reviews and mine is quite useless I think. \nLots of endings, lots of characters to explore and promote, lots of weapons, accessories, modes.. we have everything. Recommended to anyone (maybe with a little discount).\n- POTENTIAL SPOILERS \n\n\n\nSome guy came to me asking for mercy, gave me $20 and gave me a digital watch and asked me to let him in for the love of god, I arrested him.\n\nI let a prostitute get enslaved because I felt like it.\n\nI've ruined more marraiges than Monopoly.\n\nI've made a deal with a group of terrorists.\n\nI put poison on a random dudes passport and got him killed, along with another soldier.\n\nI got shot in the face in front of my own family.\n\nI'm only 3 hours into the game.\n\n\n\n10/10 \"It's okay\", \"Like Skyrim with guns\"\n\nDid I mention I killed Biker from Hotline Miami?\n- lmao they made tetris into a full blown religious experience\n- The game itself is great, but Square Enix really dropped the ball by removing the true PC version and leaving us with this Switch port as the only option. It's a huge visual downgrade, but it has more content. Luckily though, a small handful of incredible modders have taken the time to painstakingly transfer the old, high-quality PC assets over to this version which is what saved it for me. Without the mods, I would not have kept playing.\n\nIf you're on the fence, I'd say catch it on sale, then head over to a modding site (Nexus is what I used) and start installing the mods that restore this game to its full PC potential. It's probably the easiest-to-mod game I've ever dealt with too btw. You don't have to be super savvy to get things the way you want them and you don't need any additional software. Just grab the .pak files, slap them into the game's pak folder, enjoy. It really is that simple. (You may want to edit some .ini files to tweak things to your liking, but that's as complex as it gets. If you can open Notepad, you can do this.)\n\nAs for the core gameplay, it's an incredibly solid JRPG with a likable cast and well thought out story. There's plenty of content to enjoy here and it has a good end game. The music is absolutely phenomenal as well. Visually, it's very vibrant and the aesthetic is charming. I think it's a fantastic game overall and is very enjoyable as is, but playing it in 1440p/144Hz with high resolution character and texture assets with better lighting/animation mods and subtle character/NPC/monster upgrades totally elevated it to the next level.\n\np.s. If you do install mods, I HIGHLY recommend grabbing the one that removes the black borders around characters! That gives the game a clean and refreshing new feel that greatly improves it in my opinion!\n- I love this game. I've clocked over 300 hours in it through Origin (on my ONE character xD ). It's an excellent game, even despite it being an \"open world faffaround simulator\" which was all the rage at the time.\n\nAnd finally on Steam!? Yay! Or yay..?\n\nBut, as we know, we can't have good things. Massive thumb down to the EA Origin \"integration\" in Steam. EA, how about just stop being such massive ducks?\n\nThis is the same \"we hate our customers\" behaviour expressed by d-bags like Ubisoft and Epic. Only that EA sort of makes it worse. They *know* how much people hate the unnecessary and malicious Uplay \"integration\" that Ubisoft have forced on us for several years. Seeing this, EA decides that doing the exact same thing, with their total-garbage Origin client made even worse, is surely the only way to harass the customers enough to be worthy of the EA brand. \n\nDO NOT BUY OR LINK your Steam account if you own the game on Origin from earlier. \nIf you buy a game on Steam, which you already own on Origin, it will overwrite your Origin game.\nIf you then refund the game on Steam, this will remove the game from Origin too (even if you already own it there!), and you'll spend hours in line to get a hold of customer support. Then you must chat with bots, or people who are so void of understanding (and likely not paid near enough to care) that they might as well be bots. And if you're lucky, you might, after going through 4 or 5 different \"agents\", finally get to talk to a person that comprehends English and is authorised to do anything beyond telling you \"they'll discuss it with their team\". Then you might get your game back. \nBut! You won't get back the GOTY. Because the Steam-Orgin-GOTY overwrites your Origin GOTY. And when refunding, via Steam, you're left with a dumb/lame/placeholder copy of the GOTY in your Origin library, which doesn't work, but somehow just lingers there. Then you need to get a Digital Deluxe Edition + all DLC to get back to where you were.\n\nThis [integration] is such a tremendous show of manure, that I'm actually left wondering if EA planned it. Did Andrew Wilson take one of his billions of pocked change and say \"hey, we should make an extra effort here, to make sure that this integration is as frustrating and poorly implemented as possible, but still functional, such that things are barely limping along but just barely, because nothing is as frustrating as something that just barely sorta works but only sorta, and only by the skin of its teeth. That'll teach those entitled peasants.\"\n\nSo yeah. Great game. Bad EA.\n\nUpdate! A new Origin experience: The EA App! An all new website, wrapped inside an all new Electron wrapper! For an all new Frustrating(TM) experience and much better hogging of your PC performance.\n- [h1] Floppy Knights is just boat loads of fun. If you like tactics games, this is right up your alley. [/h1]\n[b]The Good:[/b] \nThe art style. It is just so fun and creative. From the different faces that Carlton, your AI arm and best friend makes, to the enemies, even including the fully drawn cutscenes.\nThe dialogue. Everything that is said between Phoebe, Carlton, and others is tons of fun and gives plenty of plot to be invested in it. Plenty of jokes.\nThe combat, units, and general gameplay. You build a deck of up to 30 cards with a mixture of effects ranging from straight up buffing your units (or dealing damage to them with positive side effects!), to creating lots of card draw. Every turn, you draw 5 cards and your commander generates it's own card every turn. These feel unique, while not being too many of them to create bloat. You can even swap between sets of decks that you have built before you start a level, allowing you different options to quickly switch up your play style. \nThe music. There is enough of a variation of music that has a quick beat to it, that it keeps you wanting more. The songs along, ESPECIALLY the boss music, had me tapping my foot alongside it the whole time.\n[b]The Bad[/b]\nYes, every game isn't perfect. However the singular real flaw I have found is one singular bug that the devs state is rare, and it really didn't affect my gameplay at all. I wasn't able to interact with something on a map, however I was still able to clear the level. The fix was just a simple reboot, and after that I literally haven't encountered it once, at all. They are aware of it and are working on it!\n[b]The Subjective[/b]\nI'm not super great at tactics games, sometimes really taking my time or making stupid decisions. The game's difficulty to myself is fairly difficult later on, however after sitting back, thinking, and playing tactically (hah go figure!), I'm able to overcome the objective by planning around different units and synergies with the cards. There is always a factor of RNG within games that have deck building, but you can always squish the size of your deck if you so choose to.\n[b]Overall[/b]\nI would EXTREMELY recommend this game to pretty much anyone who likes turn based games that require thinking. If you aren't sure if you like tactics style games, I would HIGHLY recommend picking this up and trying it out. You won't regret it!\n- This game is really special. I'm a 50 year old man with an emotional structure made largely of mud and thumbtacks, and I had to bite the inside of my jaw in a parts to keep from tearing up. \n\nMany people seem to equate an \"adult game\" with gore and violence or explicit imagery. Nothing wrong with those types of games, I have and will continue to enjoy them. This game explores mature themes on relationships and mortality and doesn't pull any punches, without being cheap or manipulative. In that sense, its the most adult game I've ever played. \n\nI won't ever forget it. If this sounds like something you'd be interested in, stop reading and buy it. Its a slow burn, and you won't be invested until you've spent some time with the characters in the story. In the end, the payoff is tremendous.\n- Basic game, extremely well done. Like going home and eating your mom's food after decades on the road.\n\nEditing the review to mention some of the flaws of the game:\n- the level design in general is not that great, with every tiny room requiring some mindlessly easy puzzle to be solved first. Eventually it just feels like a chore.\n- not sure if it's something with my steam deck, but I had to put both the game's and the screen's brightness to the max to be able to see things; before that I was constantly missing objects and having trouble with moving around because some soil path looked like a hole in the ground or something.\n- while the game is 2d, there's a lot of different layers of height and depth that get mixed in together and may be hard to tell apart. You often don't know if some platform can be climbed onto or jumped out of until you try to do it.\n- battle system gets repetitive after a while.\n\nDespite those problems, the game is still great and more than make up for those things in other areas.\n- SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT.\n\nAs the store page states, NOREN is supposedly a 'simple' keyfinding game. That would be true if there were any keys actually in the game, but as it stands it seems that NOREN is a simple abandoned shovelware game that's impossible to progress in, let alone beat. You play as some soldier in a massive, dark castle, equipped only with a dying lantern. The light fades quickly, and you can regain light slowly by... standing by a light source. That'd be simple enough if you weren't endlessly pursued by dinosaurs that are programmed with AI which knows your exact location at all times; three chomps and you're 'aparted' from the world, where you respawn with whatever amount of light and sanity you have left. Additionally, the translation attempt is abysmal at best. \n\nBoth NOREN and its developer, ThroneLab, should be banned from Steam. I do not blow the 'scam' whistle lightly, and I only do such when I am 100% certain of something actually being a scam. There are a handful of videos of this title on YouTube as well, with only one being over 5 minutes long. No one found a key. If evidence can be presented to me that there is in fact a way to progress in this game, I will rewrite this review. Until then, beware and stay vigilant.\n\n[h1]Rating: [b]0.0/5.0[/b] - WARNING. Scam developer. Abandon all hope, ye who enter.[/h1]\nThe Horror Network [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28221963/]Curator[/url] | [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thehorrornetwork]Group[/url] Click for Gore\n- Joined the Discord Server to get a sense of the toxic, immature, insulting community. If the Discord server is not moderated, which is the first impression for new players, then you know in what state the game is.\n- So the game can be played I believe in flat screen and VR, I played in VR. You play the game in a third person prospective controlling a spirit dog. The concept is easy, get the people to the light beam, but that's easier said than done. It was very nearly a short game play video as i become really stuck to the point i nearly quit but I tried, tried and tried again until i did it. It very much reminded of a game i use to play as a kid called lemmings only in this one it doesn't matter if the people fall of the edge. Its a very challenging game, one where you can just sit and try to figure it all out. I thought it would get repetitive but each level is very different from the last. I have a game play video in which i get a bit frustrated lol if you wanted to check out some game play. https://youtu.be/7VPsLnDDDlQ\n- Only originally bought this to support the artist, since I'm a huge fan of his pixel art work. It's amazing, and there's a tonne of eye candy to fill your eyeballs with. However, I can't recommend this to everyone as after the first few hours it's become a bit of a chore.\n\n- The game is a \"clicker\" type with rpg/upgrade elements. It's too slow to play in the background/absent mindedly but not fast enough to keep your attention fully.\n- Each round/attempt at a boss takes way too goddamn long. \n- Barely any interaction with the world. You build tower defense style, and equip new items, but beyond that you don't have any special abilities, no \"oh shit\" once per loop power, no ability to target specific enemies, nothing. Just watch everything play out and hope your little guy doesn't get pulped.\n- Crafting/Supplying is sort of hidden away and if you don't know about dismantling you'll never grind out all the items you need to build new stuff.\n- Lore/Journal entries are hidden away and require resources to unlock using a little button on the bottom of the screen that's easy to miss. I only found it 20 hours in. The writing is cringey and obviously done by someone who probably enjoys Adam Sandler films.\n- The card system is a neat idea, but jesus christ there's too much garbage shuffling. Imagine playing MtG with a deck of 100 cards and 90 of them are lands, and everytime you get a new hand you reshuffle the whole deck so all you get is more lands. Oblivion (destroys a tile) rarely, if ever, pops up. \n- Character skills are kinda bad? You might get a good one every level (which again, takes forever) but half the time it'll be useless \"leave 10% of food/resources at camp\" when you're not doing a resource grind run.\n- So much trash equipment you have to sort through and breaks game flow.\n\nAnd the biggest \"don't recommend\" from me would be the issue with how combining tiles works. If you put two tiles beside each other they sometimes change the tiles to something else. Example - put a Vampire Mansion beside a Village and you get a town full of ghouls that after 3 loops around the map turns into an upgraded town. But you still get trash equipment from the quests it gives, and putting a Vampire Mansion beside any other type of town doesn't change that town at all. So there's no reason to experiment, and it really limits the gameplay. You'd think they'd focus on that aspect gameplay wise, especially with experimentation to get the most bonuses out of all your tiles... but no. There's a small list of things that interact with each other, and that's it.\n\nI still highly recommend it since the game is cheap, the art is amazing and the artist/indie devs should get support. But I think it's a good 2-3 major updates, expansions or fan modding away from getting really, really amazing.\n- TL;DR: This game didn't receive a similar love and praise than Undertale because potato. Play it.\n\n------\n\nIf you're reading this, I already like you and I already think you have a good taste in videogames.\n\nOneShot is one of those little surprises you might have heard of but always keep pushing onto your backlog, assuming other games should have more priority. Eventually I decided to try it out and it took just a few minutes to regret all those delays.\n\nIt is extremely hard to give you some useful information about OneShot without spoiling the heck out of it. You start the game in a dark, small bedroom where the main character (Niko) simply wakes up. That's it. By simply walking around and interacting with elements you soon get some clue of the mechanics that will be present through the whole game and how to progress. \n\nAnd you will also see why this game is special. \n\nWhat the game attempts is probably not new to you. It has constant elements of surprise but many other titles (Undertale as the easiest example) have done so too. When the idea is saturated, it gets harder to eventually fulfill its purpose and, well, surprise the player. \n\nOneShot is the game that will surprise you no matter what. \n\nThrough a simplistic but engaging plot, amazing and memorable soundtrack, and interesting dialogues you'll get yourself into a journey you won't regret. I wish I could give you more details but like many other reviews here, I feel like I would ruin the experience for you. The best I can do is to assure you that you will easily feel like us: that this title is an incredible gem and that you will feel bad for giving it a chance so late.\n- The Award for the worst Cancer Game 2017 goes to: Friday the 13th! \nCongrats! *clapping Hands with bloody Babytears in my eyes*\nThis Game is a complete waste of Money. Don't buy it - don't even think of buying this crappy Master Piece.\nIt's not worth it, to be honest.\nI played it for almost 200 Hours. And it's awful. Never saw a Game with these bugs, with these massive salty Community. There exactly 0 Bugfixes, so many exploits, the horrible earbleeding intro, the Community that is pure Cancer, the horrible Graphic that looks like it's straight out of the Kindergarten and the huge amount of Bugs. Bugs are normal, but MAN there are Bugs everywhere! I mean, yeah the Hype was real, but now i wish i could refund this crap.\nNever had to dream about uninstalling a game before.\nI mean, the Devs. are just Human like you and me - but honestly - never saw someone who failed his job like this.\nJust do me a favor, don't buy it. It's not worth the Ragequits, the broken Keyboards, the Heartattacks and it's definitely not the Money worth!\nNever want to touch it again.\n\nAnd btw. thank you for killing the Sealmothers and making the babyseals crying bloody sad little Tears. </3\n- Who would win?\n\nThe highest-grossing media franchise of all time OR 2 British bois\n- everyone posting 16 gb ram specs and saying it runs well, lul\n\ni have 8 gigs of ram with a gtx 660 (yep) and a fx-8350 and it runs around 45-60 FPS (i cap it at 60) at High settings. yeah. REALLY well optimized, considering this computer is nearing the end of its life and the visuals are gorgeous.\n\nEDIT: 1080p :)\n\noh, and it's fun too, right.\n\nEdit 2- Actual review\n\nGame is pretty easy. I forget if there was a hard mode, but if there was I picked normal mode, and the game feels like it should be on easy. I've yet to break a sweat on a boss (currently chapter 5), and the only thing stopping me from taking on enemies 10+ higher than me is that the game auto-nerfs your damage if the enemy is too far above you. I've actually found the game very relaxing as a result, because there isn't the frustration of having to redo bosses after getting wiped, so it's not entirely a bad thing. But if you were looking for a challenge in your battles, this isn't your game.\n\nAs for story, it's also fairly basic, and rides off of having a sizeable to-do list as sidequests. Recruiting new citizens, doing major sidequest chains, unlocking new stuff, it's got a good amount to do in-game to keep you occupied, unless you're a \"main quest line only\" player. It helps that the warp system is easy to use (and you will use it often) and the game is gorgeous, so you don't really feel too bored doing the same shet over and over again. \n\nThere are several elements to the gameplay. \n\nOne, the overworld traversing. Overall, I'm ambivalent to it. It can feel slightly sluggish at parts, but collecting the shiny areas is surprisingly addicting (maybe because I'm a sem-completionist), as are finding chests. The unfortunate part is that most of these chests contain utterly useless items, so don't really feel that rewarding. \n\nTwo, dungeon crawling. Have to admit this is one of the weaker parts for me. The dungeons are basic, and don't really have much in the way of puzzling elements. Could change later, highly doubt it will. I do like how the battles are seamless, though.\n\nThree, army battles. Also not much of a fan of this, but only because it seems like a side addition without much depth to it. Fortunately it's not a major part of the game, so meh.\n\nFour, kingdom management. Holy cow I love this part of it. People might complain it feels like a mobile game with the wait times and whatever, but since you can warp straight back to your castle whenever you want, it's not that big of an issue. I do wish your gains accumulated while you're offline (or tabbed out, at least...), but idk something about managing the kingdom and making it grow/level up is stupidly addicting.\n\nOverall, if you're looking for a challenging or engaging JRPG, this might not be the game for you. If you're looking for a game with gorgeous visuals, fantastic voice acting (using JP), laid-back atmosphere, and want to be the president of the United States serving some random kid as his vassal, highly recommended.\n\nHighly recommend to play on controller. I'm using the Switch Pro Con.\n- I didn't like the FPS section; was honestly pretty repetitive and gratuitously violent. Also the 8 hour sex scene was a bit out of nowhere, but after like hour 3 you understand why they devote so much time to it. Overall game was ok I guess\n- Everytime I browser my library, looking something to play, I see this game and I think: Rayman is cool, I gonna play, but then I remember this \"Requires 3rd-Party Account: Uplay\", and then I give up.\n- Can we please get an online co-op? My s/o and I both have the game and remote play doesn't work cuz internet connection is too slow. So we can't even play this game that we were super excited to play together. Please update for an online co-op!\n- This is the purest Megaman experience I've had in years. I don't remember the last time I sat down with a Megaman-style game like this and just had pure Fun, and got fully engrossed in it over everything else. 20XX? No. Fangames? No. Even Megaman 11 didn't grab me this hard. This is it. This is the game people wanted when they saw Mighty Number 9 the first time. This is the Megaman successor we've been waiting for.\n\nIf I had to say anything negative about it, it'd be the music. It's mediocre at best. It's Meh. It does its job and fills dead air, but I'm not rushing to download the OST any time soon. I can't think of a single track that I went \"wow I need that\" for. It doesn't hinder my opinion of the game, but I would have loved it even more if it had gotten this right.\n- This is the best Civilization up to this point, and the DLC just made it even better. I will grant that the with all the add ons it would feel a tad crowded to anyone who hadn't played it before, but you have a crazy amount of options. The game series tagline of \"one more turn\" could not be more applicable.\n\nYou can strive for one of several victories: diplomatic, cultural, technological or domination. Each has its unique challengers to overcome and create a lot of the fun of the game. They are also not necessarily mutually exclusive and after completing one victory, you can go for the others. Each AI opponent has their own personality, and are pretty predictable in how they behave. Any one who has started the game next to Neopoleon or Ghengis Kahn knows they immediately have to have a decent military to repel invasion, while Ghandi will to muscle you out with religion and culture.\n\nThere are some important changes between Civilization IV and V. One of the most notable is that wars are plausible again as you dont constantly lose health in enemy territory and cities are easier to conquer. Additionally, culture doesn't automatically take over neighbor's cities anymore. \n\nThis game is easily worth the money. I'm not entirely sure how it stacks up to Civilization VI, but any game that I log 200+ hours on over a period of years and still haven't come close to doing everything is doing something right. A great game from a great series.\n- no autosave, plus crashes, so if you put in several hours and never saved - you lost ALL the progress on ALL stages on a random crash, That makes me wanna quit the game and not play it anymore. Overall game is very good, but multiple bugs were never fixed, so you're basically buying the old buggy version of it.\n- *puts on hipster cap* Well I have played this before, and let me tell you it is quite the experience.\n\nYume Nikki is a bare-bones surreal game created with RPGMaker. You play as a young girl (Madotsuki, according to the fandom) who refuses to step outside of her bedroom. Besides the dreadfully boring video games in her room, all she can do to entertain herself is to sleep, entering into her dream world. The \"goal\" of the game is to explore her dreams, collecting the various effects and bringing them back to the main nexus.\n\nLittle is known about the creator, and even less is known about the game's story. Yume Nikki lives very much by the philosophy of \"Show, Don't Tell\". There is no dialogue, music is limited to short sound bytes on loop, and the graphics look like something out of the 16-bit era. Despite all of this, Yume Nikki still managed to gather an almost cult-like following; the amount of fan work and theories created for Yume Nikki is truly astounding.\n\nPlenty of games try to capture the beauty and wonder of our dreams, but the reality is they can also be ugly and painful experiences, dredging up our deepest subconscious fears and desires. Yume Nikki refuses to shy away from the dark and the strange, understanding that this what gives our dreams meaning. Like any abstract art piece, it is impossible to place a singular meaning on anything in Yume Nikki. Everyone will interpret and relate to its events differently, and perhaps this is the crux of what let Yume Nikki gather its cult following.\n\nIts greatest strength is also its greatest weakness. The complete lack of direction is not exactly user friendly. This game does not hold your hand. There is no map, so the only way to figure out where to go is to get hopelessly lost many times as you explore the strange worlds behind each nexus door. It will be tempting to simply look up a guide, and I must admit I was guilty of watching a play-through myself for some parts. Indeed, completing the game without looking anything up is an achievement in itself.  However, the game was meant to be played, not watched. The joy (and sometimes terror) of discovery makes the experience worth experiencing. After you've given the game a proper playing, THEN you should look up all the stuff you inevitably missed. Cough cough [spoiler]Uboa[/spoiler] cough cough.\n\nWith that in mind, I humbly offer some advice to make your experience a bit more palatable. Feel free to ignore this if you wish to remain completely spoiler-free.\n\n1) Know the controls! They are not explained very well in the game.\n\nArrow keys: Movement\nZ: Accept; interact with objects (also Enter, Spacebar)\nX: Cancel; open the game menu (also C, V, B, N, Insert)\n1: Use an effect’s ability\n3: Cancel an effect’s ability\n5: Drop an effect on the ground (only in the Nexus)\n9: Pinch yourself to wake up and return to the real world. This one is especially important to remember, as sometimes you may find yourself in a dead-end zone leaving this as your only means of escape.\n\n2) Each time you wake up, make sure to use the desk In the real world to save your progress.\n\n3) Be thorough. Many of the dream worlds are expansive, with few landmarks. However, many of them also warp at each end, meaning if you walk in a straight line you will eventually return to where you started. You can use this to your advantage while mapping out the more expansive zones. Take note of interesting landmarks that you can use for future exploration. It might be helpful to keep some scratch paper handy if you have a bad memory like me.\n\n4) Interact with everything. If you see anything that looks strange or out of place, give it a poke. There are few enemies in the game, and nothing can actually kill you. Sometimes that creepy object might be the ticket to transport you into a new area. Also, try using different effects in different situations. You may find they have useful properties.\n\n5) Search for the bicycle effect first, it will make exploration much easier as it greatly increases your movement speed. You can find the bike effect in [spoiler]the zone behind the right door at the bottom-most side of the nexus[/spoiler]. I will leave locating it to you.\n\n\nWell, what are you waiting for? Give this game a try, you have nothing to lose! Except, maybe your sanity. Eh, you didn't really need that anyway.\n- Wylde Flowers is a magical farming simulation. The spoken dialogue is wonderful and touches on difficult subjects, such as grief, estrangement from family members, and gender identity. The characters are diverse, have complex personalities and are really funny.\n\nThis game could be considered as Stardew Valley's even gayer little sibling. On a more serious note, it can be friendlier than Stardew Valley for first time or younger gamers, because of its simplicity, tightly told storyline (it is not an \"endless game\" as Stardew can be) and guided playthrough.\n\nIn my opinion, the game could be improved on a few fronts: character customization is one of them, and the fact that Tara, the main character, wears the same dress-leather jacket-chelsea boots millenial outfit during all seasons (including to bed, while sleeping over the covers) icks me profoundly. \n\nFinally, the pace of the game is a bit confusing to me, in the sense that it can be difficult to balance the storytelling aspect of the game with the more concrete tasks.\n\nAltogether, Wylde Flowers is a beautifully conceived game, filled with positivity, magic, a good soundtrack, and charming visuals.\n\n\n\n- I played the demo and instantly became enamored. The mix of Slay the Spire-style deck-building with elements of the ship combat from FTL: Faster Than Light is an absolutely fascinating mix, and the \"single-axis\" movement system adds a whole extra layer that I've never seen in anything except the Mega Man: Battle Network series.\n\nI bought the full game within the first hour of being available. After having played for nearly 4 hours at the time of writing, my opinion hasn't changed in the slightest. I already love what's available and so far I feel like I've barely scratched the surface.\n\nI can't wait to see what awaits in the future for this awesome title.\n\nEDIT: As a small addition, I will say: I beat my very first run, which is set to the lowest difficulty (Normal). I jumped up to Hard to try to unlock a new ship, and I haven't been able to beat a run since then. It's probably just that I'm bad, all things considered, but be aware that the changes made with difficulty increases are probably more impactful than they may seem.\n\nAlso I wanna say to the devs: thank you for launching the game with mod support and working on making it easier! But also please look into getting Steam Workshop support if you can!\n- Gone are the days of mindless building and fun. Power grids? Taxes? Intense accounting and counter-intuitive path building. A pre-built zoo for tutorials. I actually felt MORE stressed after playing this game. If you're looking for something to flex that brain, perfect. If you're looking to release the cougars and create chaos, you can do that in sandbox I guess. You could also just not connect power grids correctly. Works like a charm. Honestly who thinks of these things\n- Guys this game is brilliant!!\n\nIf you have the chance and you like nostalgic and engaging exploration and mystery solving, I promise you won't regret buying this one.\nI honestly kept searching for more games like this at Steam and I was not able to find any that were this good.\n\nThe pixelated artwork is >very< detailed.\nI don't know how to describe it, but every scene feels like it's straight out of a framed vintage painting that you'd see in a farm cottage made by the grandfather of the previous owner. It just has this vibe, and I love it.\n\nAll characters are voiced and the VAs did a really great job, especially the main VA. Sarcastic, funny and witty lines are all over, as well as capturing the weight of each life, of their memories, and when they share their stories.\n\nYou won't regret playing this one! Go ahead, and have a great excavation...\nDon't forget: the answer lies in the soil...\n- i would recomend it because the physics are great, the game has 8 or 9 level packs (i dont know if there will be a 9th because there are 7 at the time of this review) the units are diverse, there are a lot of secret units to find and i dont know for the final boss because the most expensive unit artimis isnt a good final boss like the dark pesant in the alphas but i hope that the games final boss unit is actually hard to kill and requires more than 7 archers because that wasnt hard or anything hopefully they will make the most expensive unit actually overpowered and unballanced because that would be a great final boss, the sandbox mode is great i like the custom campains , the custom units arent out yet so i cant say anything about that over all this game is worth the money and if its near a sale time like a few days away from a sale then get it on sale if not then just get it you wont regret it and if it lage turn off all the graphics settings\n- It's responsive, quick and smooth, the Arrange and Matsuri modes are a treat, and it sounds/looks wonderful. Finally, a better shmup than Crimzon Clover is on Steam! Highly, highly recommended.\n- To be honest, this game is a bit of an acquired taste. At first I didn't get it: Few options to customize your army, at the beginning of a battle every unit has its predetermined place on the map, there's an unforgiving time limit to reach your objectives and the graphics could be much better. The first encounters with an entrenched enemy ended in a bloodbath for my units, despite overall superiority in numbers and total command of the air. And when I learned that you don't necessarily keep your veteran units after a successful battle but sometimes have to start the next scenario with new ones, I came close to deleting the game.\n\nLuckily, I  didn't. Like any decent strategy-game, UOCII takes some time to learn. The game's mechanics and its reliance on logistics are the main differences to most others I've played. The first lesson: Your success depends heavily on understanding both your own and the enemy's supply network. Finding his vulnerable spots while protecting your own is elementary. Once you figured out where to strike and with which units, your chances improve dramatically. The AI is quite good and will help you find your own weak spots soon enough – a single forgotten enemy in your rear can easily stop the most impressive offensive, if it decides to block the one railway line supporting all your units and your HQ. +-To make things more interesting, the game relies on Headquarters, which you have to move around together with your regular units. These HQ can and must be improved over time to learn additional “skills” like bridge-building, special orders, emergency supply etc. During a battle, they must be kept within range of your units to be effective, giving the game a bit of an role-playing-aspect: One or several generals moving around, each commanding a part of your force, never too close to the firing line, all the while learning new skills and helping your units to do a limited number of special tricks. Nice flavour.\n\nI could write a lot more, but to sum it up: UOCII is a really rewarding strategy-game with some new and interesting features I haven't found anywhere else. It's not perfect – more options to customize or to place units would be welcome and the difficulty in some of the later DLCs is quite brutal -  but all in all it's very much worth its price. Still enjoy it after several years and look forward to the next DLC (Africa) :-)\n- HOW?? WHY?? WHY IS THIS GAME SO GOOD?? IT HAS NO REASON TO BE THIS GOOD WTF?\nThe trailers or advertisements will not even give anything close to a sense on how good this story, build up, characters and mechanics (did I mention the story?) really is.\n\nShu Takumi and Yasumasa Kitagawa, you've done it again, from Ace Attorney to this. I can 100% say if you haven't played this game, you are definitely missing out.\n\n10/10!!!\n- Upon further play, the game wasn't super luck based, it just doesn't do a great job explaining core mechanics that are crucial to gameplay. It has a more hands off, let the player discover how this works type of playstyle, but a simple line of dialogue alluding to these features would have been nice. That said, the story is really gripping, the gameplay (once learned) is fun, and overall, I definitely think it's worth $20.\n- This game isn't for me, as it turned out it is too fast-paced for me to enjoy. But I really do want to recommend it. The game works fine, and the controls are solid, by that I mean you do feel in control, even though I only played a little I died a lot, but it never felt unfair. You get to do a lot of customization, and it is fun, but I just don't have the right temper for games where you die a lot. 7/10.\n- I definitely would not recommend this. The aesthetic of it might appeal to some people, which is what initially drew me in, but the visual awe wears off after seeing the same scene too many times. The game is best played with paper and pencil in hand so that you waste as little time as possible wandering around in a straight line. \n\nThis game survives off of the mysterious nature of its content in the sense that if people knew how small the experience was, they would not buy it. I was thoroughly let down by this game, especially since its promotional material hyped me up for an exploration game with a unique method of interacting with the world. \n\nThe main feature that sets the game apart from other titles, the use of the telephone to access parts of the static world, becomes little more than a password screen used to pick up where you left off or were booted out of your game by a short time limit. After the first two or three times I used the game's core feature, I was tired of it and wished there was a way to play the game that was faster or had more depth.\n\nFor anyone who has played or seen any amount of gameplay from Yume Nikki, you will realise that this game's design begs the audience to compare the two. However, the most useful comparison to draw between the two is by using the game that Madotsuki can play in her room as an example. In Madotsuki's game, \"Nasu,\" is a joyless game about catching fruit. It is repetitive, intentionally annoying, has no bearing on your progression/success, and is meant to urge you toward doing something else. Unfortunately, this is a suitable comparison, as it succeeded in making me feel like Madotsuki in real life and I want to turn off the game and do almost anything else in record time.\n\nI truly wanted to like this game, but I cannot justify spending $5 for this experience when I played better flash games all the way back in middle school for free.\n- G.A.R.B.A.G.E\n\nuhm idk man, it was but it just isn't, you know? because I don't know??? lots of bugs, cinematics are rushed, game is rigged, friends cheat... FUCKS THIS SHIET\n- Events that took place:\n\nDid not want to sell player,\nGot an offer for said player,\nRejected the offer,\nPlayer demaned to be allowed to speak to the club,\nGot a second offer from said club,\nEssentially forced to accept the offer,\nPlayer reached an agreement with the club,\nWished player the \"best of luck\" in his future endeavours,\nPlayer is angry that he is leaving,\nPlayer considerers his new club a \"step down\" in his career,\nReminder: Player demanded to go to said club,\nMe finding solice in the fact that FM19 although lacking in the football department, delivers a brilliant experience in dealings with manic and psychotic people.\n\nAllow me to grant you an insight into SI's employee knowledge on the subject their games are about. I once engaged in a conversation with a developer at SI about FM, and football in general. After some talking about premier league, and me slightly confused, I eventually understood that this developer thought that Tottenham Hotspurs were located in Liverpool. So I posed him the following question: \"Then why do they call any matches between Tottenham and Arsenal the 'North London Derby'?\" to which he responded that he did not know, but he assured me that Tottenham F.C was located in Liverpool. I had to resort to showing him the borough of Tottenham in London for him to understand that Tottenham Hotspurs is not lovated in Liverpool, but in fact in London.\n\nThis will be the last edition of this game series I will ever purchase. In a football management simulator such as this, letting SI and their employees (including the one that responded to this review) tell you various aspects of football, is like having a pervert preach to you about the virtues of sexual absitence. They know nothing, and since the core game has not progressed the slightest in 10 years, it would be a fair assumption that they do not care neither.\n\nFuck SI, Fuck their beloved \"devs\" and fuck Charlton Heston while you're at it.\n- [h1] My tier S game [/h1]\n\n[b] This game is fantastic! [/b]\n- Well-incentivised exploration\n- No bs OP bosses, no random encounters, no pointless fetch quests \n- Packed with content; lots of it\n- Mini games and a variety to the gameplay\n- No need to play the first instalment of the series (8bit adventure 1)\n- The last boss fight is epic\n- Memorable cast of characters \n- No grinding needed; you will be OP just by playing it\n- Stress: The videogame.\n\nBut in all seriousness, Isaac is an awesome roguelike game with infinite replayability. It's tough at first but as you get better at the game you will appreciate it more and more for the unique experience it provides. Every run feels different and even after getting close to 2k hours of playtime I still discover new things.\n\nAll DLC, and especially the latest of them - Repentance - introduce a ton of new content on top of the already existing one.\nThere are 34 characters in total, over 600 steam achievements and 3 save files to choose from.\n\nOn top of that, the game features a community workshop with countless great mods that add Quality of Life improvements and new features for every taste.\n\nIf you enjoy roguelikes or are looking for a game with great replay value then I can wholeheartedly recommend Isaac to you.\n- So Epic takes over, breaks the game, can't connect to the Epic Services so I can't play, takes away garage items, and then Steam blocks new reviews due to \"off topic\" review activity unless you change the settings manually. Went from a game a played daily to a game I literally can't play. Epic can go blow themselves.\n- Okami is the best non-Zelda Zelda game, but also best dog simulator.\n\n10/10 Dog features include:\n\nYou can bark at people for no reason! You can dig up bones! You can catch a birb in your mouth and then prance! You can bite people in the crotch and they are like \"hey! what! why i oughta!\" If you see a demon, you can pee on it!\n\n\nPlease purchase The Legend of Dog Zelda for a good time.\n- The game is a masterpiece, just like the first one. After finishing PoE 1, I immediately started with the second one and I was treated to another marvel of a game. Here are some of my thoughts:\n\nThe Good:\n-Very good main story but the side content is what made this game great\n-Interesting and deep characters, both new ones and some returning from the first game, including companions\n-The story picks up after the events of the first game and is a direct continuation of the first game (just like with Baldur’s Gate 1 and 2)\n-If you still have the savegame-files from the first game, your decisions and consequences from the first game will carry over\n-There is so much lore, if you are into reading and listening to stories\n-A lot of voice-acting\n-A lot of pets you can collect and the equipped one has a small benefit to your party\n-Interesting races and sub-races, each with its own boons and downsides\n-Interesting classes and sub-classes, including the possibility of multi-classes\n-You can retrain your characters\n-You can make a new character to join your party at any time at tavern\n-Item and weapon diversity (including pistols)\n-You have the option to play the game as either turn-based (like divinity original sin) or real time (with game pause, just like Baldur’s Gate)\n-You can sail the seas as a pirate and attack any ship you meet without consequence. The ships on the map will respawn endlessly so you will never run out, which makes them a real great source of income.\n-Besides the ship you are given at the beginning, there are a few others you can buy. Each has its own benefits\n-Ship, crew and sailing require some management, but if you like this sort of stuff you can get real invested in it \n-Exploring the map by ship, if you are into that kind of stuff\n-When engaging other ships, you have a choice between boarding or naval combat\n-Endurance is no longer a thing so you only need to manage your Health during fights. You will like this if you were not a big fan of the Endurance vs Health system from the first game\n-The resting system has improved. Besides taverns, now you can rest anywhere you want as long as you have food\n-No inventory management is necessary. Your inventory is infinite so just pick everything up because sooner or later you might need things like explosives, potions, tools etc.\n-Choice matters, and boy are there a lot of different paths you can choose from\n-Romance options\n-Bounties are fun and offer good experience and money\n-DLCs are a bit shorter than the one from the first game, but they are just as good (will not describe them to avoid spoilers)\n\nThe Bad:\n-Loading screens are too long and too many\n-Just like in the first game, I reached max level at about 2/3 of the game(max level 20) so any experience gathered beyond that was pointless. By the end of the game could have easily reached level 30 if that was a thing\n-Naval combat is scripted, so it might not be as spectacular as you might imagine\n-Exploring islands on foot isn’t so much fun\n-The idea of factions might not be to everyone’s liking\n-After playing for a few hours, the game performance seems to decrease and my pc struggled with running it. Maybe the game has an optimization problem but it’s possibly that this one is on me and the game is fine. This might not be the case for other users.\n\nAdvice:\n-In the beginning of the game, try to reach Neketaka asap and do as many quests there as you can before heading out on your ship exploring the seas\n-Pick everything up. Your inventory space is infinite and you will end up needing diverse items like explosives, traps, tools etc.\n-Always have tools with you: hammer and chisel, prybar, lockpicks, grappling hook. You will really need them from time to time\n-Plundering other ships is a great source of experience, resources and money but be careful not to burn yourself out if you do it for too long\n-If you get stuck on a quest, just do some online research\n-Invest money in your ship and crew as soon as you can\n-Always have a tank and healer in the party\n-Make sure to diversify the skills of your party. It’s always good to have someone with Mechanics, Religion, Athletics or Diplomacy most of all\n-Enchant your items\n-When you get the white/grey colored legendary items, make sure to bind them to the character you equip them on and do the mini-quests inscribed on them to unlock new powers and features\n-Use summons, as they are great for distracting enemies. They can take a lot of hits and also dish it out\n\nMy game experience:\nI played on the classic (normal) difficulty, just like I do with every new game I start, and found the game not very hard but fun. I played the game in real time, because turn-based takes too long. As soon as I got my first ship working, I sailed to Neketaka, found the last companions I knew I wanted on my permanent team (Maia and Pallegina) and just quested away in the city until I had enough money and levels under my belt to start exploring the seas and attack other ships. I never did the scripted naval combat because I was having too much fun boarding the ships and watch my characters fight. My party consisted of my Watcher (Moon Godlike, Chanter, specced in summoning), Eder (because he’s a beast of a tank and has some fun interactions with others), Xoti (gotta have a healer, she’s also fun to have around), Maia Rua (very good ranged DPS and she comes with a pet cause she’s a ranger) and Pallegina, who is an excellent off-tank and support character. Once I took to the seas, I made my fortune by plundering ships, equipped my ship and characters with the best money could buy and then just catered to the different existing factions in the Deadfire, while not loosing sight of my main mission.\n\nI had a great time playing Pillars of Eternity 1 and 2. I consider they offer some great replay value and are great fun if you are into this style of RPG games. If you are a fan of games like the Baldur’s Gate, Icewind Dale, Diablo, Dragon Age, Neverwinter Nights and Divinity Original Sin series, you must try PoE 1 and 2.\nI really hope they make Pillars of Eternity 3.\n\n- Visually-speaking, this is possibly the highest quality otome I've ever played. Characters blink, their mouths move when they speak, and even backgrounds have some animated aspects, such as water movement, crackling fires and other neat little touches. The art is top-notch and, in my opinion, the game's strongest point.\n\nAnother aspect that makes Bustafellows a standout is the heroine. Teuta has much more presence than a lot of other protagonists in the genre because she has a face, voice and strong personality. She's her own character and not one of those 'we're going to make MC as bland as humanly possible for self-insertion purposes' heroines, which I very much appreciated.\n\nThe Steam version is a bit clunky compared to the console release, and at times it suffered from some pacing issues, but all the characters and their interactions were enjoyable. The main story was great; I really loved the group dynamic they established in the common route, and while Shu and Crow were definitely my favorites, there was nobody I really disliked as a love interest. They each had an interesting story behind them and unique dynamic with Teuta.\n\nThe final stories that attempt to wrap everything up were the only part of the game that just really didn't do it for me. I can't go into much detail without spoilers, but the best I can describe it is everything comes at you too fast, parts of it felt out of nowhere, and for me it was a downer. Not awful enough to ruin the game, and some of the ideas were good, but I feel like they were executed poorly.\n\nAll in all, Bustafellows is one of the better otome games out there. It's not perfect, but its strengths shine brighter than its flaws, and I'm dearly hoping Bustafelllows Season 2 gets localized so I can see more of its wonderful art and characters.\n- [h1]SMOOTH RIDING WITH A FEW BUMPY ROADS[/h1]\n\nFirst off, I am going to get this out of the way. If you are planning to buy this game and wondering which version to get, ask yourself this. If you are a minimalist, standard is fine. If you want the expansions, get ultimate. Deluxe on the other hand I think is worth skipping entirely. If $99.99 is too much for you for Ultimate, just wait for a sale. Ultimate is definitely my choice for recommendation. The amount of content you get is impressive and worth the price of admission. \n\nForza Horizon 4 is a car collector's dream, with a roster of over 700 cars (with Ultimate). And also a racing enthusiasts dream playground with a decently sized map with tons of racing variety and events to play around with. I have tons of racing games on Steam personally, and none have held my interest as much as Forza Horizon 4. It's a shame though that this came so late to Steam. But even still, I got my money's worth with over 120 hours of playtime at the time of writing this. \n\nIs Forza Horizon 4 perfect though? Sadly, it is not. The Steam version is hampered with some unfortunate bugs. People may experience random crashes, which while not happening often after the last few updates, still do happen, as this game is a few versions behind the Microsoft store's own version. Something I don't know if will ever be fully fixed. Also online racing can be hit or miss with issues. Those issues usually lie in the wait times sadly, so it might be offputting for those looking to race with others. Luckily there is more than enough content without having to do online races to keep most people happy. \n\n I'm still giving this a recommend regardless of that issue, just because more often than not, the game does run smoothly. \n\nIf you happen to just get the standard version of the game you get access to the main map which is a caricatured version of Great Britain, which includes many race events ranging from your standard street races, dirt tracks and even full blown off road events. There are also other events which include speed traps, drifting, massive jumps, promotional events (like racing the Halo Warthog, racing against trains, and more), and some cool little story events like racing for Top Gear, or even opening your own businesses. There's plenty of content for sure. If you decide to get the expansions, you get other maps, including Fortune Island, which is, well, an Island, complete with both low and high altitude locations, lots of off roading, some impressive night time visuals (Aurora Borealis anyone?), and more. You also get the Lego Speed Champions map which is a fun and impressively designed map based on the Lego toys which features it's own variety of fun and unique settings, including a beach riddled with pirate ships, a haunted lighthouse, a stunt arena, and more. Also it gets it's own radio station that plays just 1 song on loop. If you guessed that song is \"Everything is Awesome\", you'd be right, Both expansions also come with a unique way of progression and their own vehicles to collect. Fortune Island will have you progress to unlock a variety of treasure hunts, that each unlock 1 million credits, and the Lego expansion has you doing different tasks to collect studs which can be used to build your house and also collect new cars. Both expansions will also include a majority of the types of events you will be used to in the base game, with their own unique flair. \n\nWith 700 cars luckily there is enough variety for anyone. But for those looking for more, you can custom tune each vehicle to your own liking, with a variety of parts and overhauls, including full blown engine swaps. For those who are not gear heads, the community has you covered and you can even download custom tunes from others. Forza Horizon 4 is one of the most generous racing games I have ever played with the sheer amount of cars they dump on you. You can win cars from events. You can win cars from wheelspins. you can win cars from leveling up. You can win cars from performing certain tasks. You can win cars from barn finds, which are like little treasure hunts. You can also buy cars from both an auto show, or take your chances at an in game auction house, which is also a great way to make money, to well, buy more cars. Basically, Horizon does not let you down with the cars. It's like Pokemon for car lovers. And once you have that dream car, don't forget to give it that unique look. Most cars can have some visual parts swapped out, ranging from spoilers to bumpers and more, and you can add custom designs to the paint jobs too. Want to race around in Jurassic Park Jeep? Want to race around in the Bandit 1 from Smokey and the Bandit? Forza has you covered. And if you just want to look at the cars in all their glory, Forza also has a nice little feature called Forzavista which allows to do things with your car like opening and closing doors, and for some vehicles you can open up trunks and hoods and look inside at the engines. If you get the James Bond pack, you can even look at those nifty little gadgets like the machine guns mounted to some of the Bond vehicles. Pretty neat stuff. \n\nAt the end of the day, is Forza Horizon 4 worth it? I'd say yes.\n- Know your History: \n\nMany of you will already know this, but this game has ties much deeper than you think. It's no secret that Bethesda's Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim had extended it's life through an extensive modding community. For decades, literally, ENBs, shaders, textures, companions, and even story-lines added THOUSANDS of hours to an already sizable game. One story-line mod was called \"The Forgotten City\".  Over the next few years since it's release, the mod had acquired awards such as the 2016 Australian Writers' Guild Award, Zero Period Top 5 Quest Mods of 2015, and others. It was an astounding mod that threw the dragon born into a deeply profound, well written, and engaging story. It was a staple for my personal mod list for years. I've played the Skyrim version countless times, but as soon as I saw this release I immediately bought this and booted it up. \nObviously this is nothing like the mod, both visually or engine wise, but the spirit of the game is still there. It's more defined, expanded, and developed. It deserves every award and accolade it's received. When I walked into the opening scene and fell down the tunnel I couldn't help but shake my head and smile as a wave of nostalgia mixed with new expectations flooded my mind:\n\n\"My god, they've done it.\" \n\nHere's to you, Modern Storyteller, all the best and more to come!\n- Instant uninstall after reading the privacy policy.\n\nShort version: \"We may collect any data we want (including sensible personal data) from the user and transmit it to anyone the laws allow us to. Also we may transmit your data to any foreign country where other (read: laxer) data protection laws may apply.\"\n\nUpon installation and booting up the game, the very first thing you will be asked to do is accept these conditions and enter your age so they can send it (together with other data) to third parties which will then show you \"appropriate\" advertisement ingame.\n\nYeah SEGA, aint no way I am saying yes to that. Uninstalled and refund requested.\n- The story of this game is interesting and well written, but it doesn't fully make up for the game's flaws. Here are the problems I saw with the game.\n\n1. There are a wide variety of guns available, but very few combinations of those guns are viable. The shotguns are rarely viable for combat with gun wielding enemies, since advancing far enough forward to make shotgun damage effective inevitably puts you in the line of fire of enough of your enemies to prove lethal. Other weapons like sniper rifles and pistols have critically low DPS and a low maximum ammo cap, making them almost universally not viable. Additionally this game likes to spring ambushes on the player in a way that takes away any advantage gained from long range optics. The special pneumatic weapons in the game also suffer from a low ammo cap. This leaves you with assault rifles, which the game seems to have been made for.\n\n2. In encounters with bestial enemies it is frequently impossible to avoid taking damage. The enemies sprint at you in packs which even sustained automatic shotgun fire cannot fully stop. Some of the boss enemies are even worse in this department. In normal mode with the larger health pool and regeneration over time this wouldn't be such a problem. But in ranger mode this makes certain obstacles unbeatable. You might have a boss which takes your entire ammo pool from both guns to kill, and which gets a guaranteed hit on you once every thirty seconds. If you go into that boss fight hurt and with no healing items, then you'll be met with mathematically guaranteed failure. The simple fix for this is to give the player a dodge function to avoid taking an instance of damage.\n\n3. This story has a few decisions to make, but mostly it is on rails. This isn't always a problem in a game, but it is when your character gets repeatedly taken unawares by things you as the player have already figured out. You as the player may sense that Artyom is being tricked, is about to be ambushed, or is going to let the bad guy get away through poor decision making. You just have to frustratedly walk into the cut scene and let it happen anyways. Its fine for this to happen at least once. But by the fourth or fifth instance it becomes infuriating to play as the character who just gets tricked and captured all the time.\n- THIS REVIEW IS FOR VERSION 1.3 \n\nStarbound is the space game that all people who crave space games like I do will enjoy. \n\nFrom playing with your friends and colonizing an entire star sytem to role playing as a galactic bounty hunter, this game truly offers what all of us enjoy. \n\nPros \n+ Unique art style \n+ Infinite procedurally generated universe \n+ Creative alien races that are completely customizable \n+ Pets unique to each race \n+ A heart wrenching story that [Spoilers] makes you a hero \n+ Crafting system that requires a plethora of materials \n+ Mining and harvesting isn't a grind \n+ Materials can be acquired through pickaxes, drills, mechs, and the infamous and upgradable Matter Manipulator \n+ Devs constantly working to update and add new features \n+ Every planet is different with several contributing features such as weather, temperature, radiation, and colonization \n+ Many different generated structures such as buildings and towns that generate on some of the planets, with origins of each race \n+ An upgrading and advancement tree that takes time and effort that is always enjoyable.

First if they did they wouldn't be pushing the community the whey and as hard as they have. When things get pushed like they are, hateful people just harden there harts more, and just become infuriated. The sympathetic the become hatful towards it. The more something gets pushed, after awhile the more it gets hatted. A better approach would be, (if they really did care,) would be to put what they are talking about into a FREE pack, and get people whom make amazing custom content to contribute to it. If there is enough nice stuff in the pack people will download it, and talk people whom are on the fence to download it, and maybe to come over, and might start to get the people on the other side to at least get on the fence. That whey the LGBTQ community would get there representation, and acceptance would be pushed in a whey that won't burn people out.\n\n\nAnother resin why they should do it like this, and is part of why people are getting mad, is that they bought this game a certain whey, paid a lot for it and it's DLC, now they are changing, it and braking it to do so. Changing the experience against there will. Evan something you love like chocolate, or bacon, or anything will become something you hate if it's shoved down your throat ageist you will. If you want people to take it just offer it, most of the time people will take it. And if they don't just make it just make it more appealing. IE instead of braking the main game to add something even the LGBTQ community can't enjoy with a broken game. Make a free pack, and to tempt more people to get the pack, just add more nice CAS and build mode stuff. And maybe update the pack and add more stuff to it every once in awhile.\n\n\nI just had to say this for two resins, one companies being this careless or ignorant is just killing the public sentiment for LGBTQ and similar groups. And two, they are just killing interest in what they are selling, it will cut the Sims 4's life short, and will cut the Sims 5's life much, much sorter. \nIt's good to give options, as long as they are options. Or you are just like Hennery Ford, “The people can have the model T in any color! so long as it's black.”\n\n- It's more of a mixed recommendation but the positives outweigh the negatives if you're a returning fan.\n\nEverything in the game that's an adaptation of the original FF7, I love.  It gave me major nostalgia vibes to walk through a gorgeously rendered versions of FF7's environments.  The combat is much more engaging - no more watching a tv show on the side while I button-mash another random encounter.  Many of the big story moments still hit and I found even more to love in the characters based on their performances going beyond text boxes and blocky animations.  Even the music is just top-notch.  The OST will be a mainstay in my playlist for years.  It feels like I'm seeing the old game with fresh eyes and remembering why it made such an impact.\n\nThat said, the new content feels like a filler arc in a beloved anime.  Your character falls into a random hole like 3-4 times, spends 2 hours fighting random baddies, and then walks out like \"right, so back to that thing I was doing.\"  I don't even know if a new player could understand wtf is happening with Sephiroth because he's never really introduced and certain essential events are never explained.  It tries to take some clever left-turns on the plot so returning players have new surprises to enjoy but it often feels pretentious and pointless.  The ending gave me flashbacks to Peter Jackson's Hobbit trilogy because of how unnecessarily forced it was and the sudden cartoon levels of action.\n\nI'm tentatively enthusiastic for the sequel but there's a few troubling signs I hope don't become a trend.\n- Not For Broadcast is a good game... but it has some issues.\n\nThe story is really captivating; though the game does switch between humour and a serious story quite often, both are excellently done. Advance (the political party who ends up getting into power and becomes authoritarian) actually only gets into power in the first part of the game (the tutorial broadcast). You actually get to see the descent into authoritarianism and dystopia, which basically no other game (at least, any game I've ever played) has actually done, and not really any other forms of media either. You also get to influence some events in game [spoiler](for example, one of the ads you can play is an advertisement for a children's toy, and later there is an... incident... involving the toy, and (if you played the ad), the presenters of National Nightly News (Jeremy and Megan) state in a segment regarding the incident that they should never have advertised the toy.[/spoiler] It's a really minor thing, because you can just choose [i]not[/i] to play the ad, but I really love that detail), and having a noticeable impact on anything is really enjoyable.\n\nThe gameplay is mostly good. You basically just have to be on your toes, switching to different cameras every now and again, being ready to censor things, and being ready to go to the adverts. All basic tasks, but since you're doing most of them together, it relies on you being attentive and reactive. The only part of the gameplay I would criticize is the signal interference section. It's easy, and doesn't even really distract you, as you just have to move a slider up and down with a slight bit of delay. It's just not a fun part of the game.\n\nMy biggest gripe with the game has to be the lag; something which I know I'm not alone in experiencing. Online, it suggests closing down performance heavy tasks, such as web browsers, but I know for a fact that I had a few webpages up when I was playing the free prologue (the first broadcast, which gives a pretty good idea of what the game is), and experienced no issues at all. I really don't know what the coding differences between the paid version and the prologue of the game are, but that doesn't seem like it should be a difference. Generally the lag was irritating, but not something that hinders you in any way, but there is one level where you're advised to switch screens because naked protesters may pop up to protest Advance's policies. Visual lag, in this case, really isn't good. I also just got a windows pop up saying that the game was frozen, and so I had to close it down... not great.\n\nOverall; the gameplay is good, with really the exception of the interference task, and the story is excellent, but the technical issues are just... really, really irritating. I would recommend the game, but I would warn you that the technical issues do end up being quite irritating.\n\nOverall; the game is good, but the technical issues can be annoying.\n- Refunded.\n\nFeels like they released the wrong game files - half the game seems to be broken or missing...\nBasic functions such as zooming in and out, no tutorial, huge amounts of buttons that don't have any impact. Good idea, terrible execution.\n- I am generally not a big fan of card games, because luck is most often the deciding factor in them, and so it is also here. But there are many solid mechanics that lessen the randomness and make it enjoyable. You can plan builds and be tactical with your card purchases, so you get a strong deck that can beat the boss. \n\nOf course it is also a rougelike, you will die. But that's part of it, you can have a strategy and get better with every run. It is also addicting in a good way. There are no in game purchases, or other such garbage that is common in so many other card games.\n\nThis is one of the best games that went through Early Access, and the developers made good updates, introducing two new characters with new cards and gameplay mechanics and also further balancing the game. They are currently working on a fourth character. They also interact really well with the players, featuring artwork and being active in the discussions.\n\nThere is much to love with this game, I saw myself coming back time and time again. \nI recommend it for everyone =)\n- This game is for sure not perfect, but worth buying for a specific type of gamer.\n\n[b]What is good in this game?[/b]\n- It has a pretty solid gun gameplay. The movement is quick and polished as well.\n- One level is on average 20 seconds. It's fun to improve your gameplay to get better times in the small levels. \n- It's really a blast getting a perfect run, killing enemies in bullet time or exploiting the enemies weakspots.\n- There is content for around 10-15 hours. Maybe more if you consider going for 100%.\n\n[b]Anyway there are also some flaws: [/b]\n- In Neon White or Ghostrunner the movement and pace through the levels often feels like a perfect choreographic \"dance\"\n- The levels and the areas in Warstride are verry tight. I often lost pace through \"stupid\" placed rocks or small doors.\n- There is not much to explore. The levels are verry linear. While in Neon White it was so much fun to explore shortcuts or other hidden possibilities to improve ur time there are no such mechanics in Warstride at all. I'd love to have some exploration at least in the \"long levels\".\n- It could get repetitive for some players as it's a core element to complete the levels on 5 different difficulties. \n\n[b]Conclusion: [/b]\nIf you like fast paced games like Ghostrunner, Neon White or Doom and you have no problem in repeating short levels several times and u don't except an extraordinary game u will have fun for several hours on a low price.\n\n- [h1][b]★★★★☆[/b][/h1]\nSuper Time Force Ultra (STFU...) hits all the stereotypical tropes of an indie game. Fourth wall breaking humor, bright pastel colors, a synth soundtrack and of course retro graphics. Granted, this game came out in 2014, but today, frequent gamers might be sick of this. Despite that, the game certainly is still worth checking out. Behind the bad, immature humor lies a very apparant, unique and interesting game mechanic: the ability to rewind time and to run next to your former self.\n\nThe humor really turned me off the first time I booted this game up. It's too much in your face and it tries really hard to be funny. On top of that, it also tends to be really profane. There is a character that you can control that literally is a turd that has an ability to fart. One of the levels takes place within a sewer where you have to fight poop and ride it down pipes. Humor like this makes it feel like you're playing a game made by a 13 year old.\n\nThe gameplay, on ther other hand, is suprisingly refreshing and fun. Not only can you rewind time, you will also see your former selves run next to you and do the same damage as before. The whole game is build around this 'cloning' mechanic, as levels have to be finished within a certain time limit that can only be beaten with cooperation with yourself. For example, it can take forever to take a boss out by yourself, but by rewinding (to any moment you like) you can use more firepower to kill the boss faster. As you can imagine, this can create scenes where you fight of enemies along [i]many[/i] other characters you have controlled. It's the good kind of chaotic, as it never feels random to what happens in the game. My only real problem with it are the controls that don't always seem to registrate well. For instance, when you run of a slope, your character tend to be in the air just a couple of pixels high, which means it cannot jump. I ran off so many platforms because of this, but it is not a severe problem.\n\nThe game is not particulairy hard. You can rewind lots of times and by doing so, the level gets easier and easier. The dev also included a kind of trial mode, aside from the diverse story levels. Some of these levels are a little annoying, but ultimately I had fun with it in short sessions. The achievements are also not hard to unlock. It mostly involves collecting orbs and characters.\n\nFor the standard 13 bucks, this is not a bad deal! That is, if you go for all the achievements. When it is on sale, I would say this is a safe buy.\n- Okay so first and foremost the reason why I'm giving this a thumbs up is simple. The game does what it set out to do perfectly. Because of that I have no complaints about it's style.\n\nHOWEVER.\n\nI personally do not like the game. It is my own personal hangup. But I can understand why other people will enjoy it.\n\nThe game is fast paced, level by level FPS with challenges. Almost every single one of them is timed if not all of them are timed. It's similar to Doom or Killing Floor. Only there are no cusomizations implemented at time of play. \n\nThe game is challenging and offers you many different faucets on those challenges. It has different gun types for different enemies, different strategies and all of them complicated and challenging. But that's the point right?\n\nRegardless, the game was pretty fun and if you're looking for a level by level challenge system set to a similar style of Doom then you might just enjoy this game.\n\nIf this wasn't enough for you then please check out the video on my YouTube Channel for a more precise in depth explanation (link below).\n\nThanks for reading and I hope I helped some of you out there to spend your money wisely.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXiok7bhPdY\n- Looks like a game for children, but underneath the friendliness there is a great challenge! Move on the rhythm of good songs on a note bar! \n\n[h2]Swim! Swim little tredpole! [/h2]\nYou are a newborn tredpole. The first thing you do is break free of your egg! Through various rivers and waters you journey, and eventually save your pond from a disaster that will occur. \nEverything in the river translates to an instrument tone and respects the height on the note bar. The primary goal is to reach the finish. The melody is depicted as little mines which hurt your health if you swim across one. Along the way you can collect points by collecting bubbles (with a bonus if you collect them all), little bubbles, health packs, and you can slap your tail on bamboo or cymbals that launch you in the air! Many predators would like to make a snack out of you! \nAll this on the rhythm of unique songs! \n\n[h2]Thoughts [/h2]\nThis looks like a friendly game, a bit for kids perhaps, right? Well, I started with letting a non-gamer play this, without success. You need to have musical rhythm in you to perform well. None of my friends possess that really, so a simple playthrough wasn't all that easy. \nThe music is very original, and makes this game fun. It's a tough game, and poses quite a challenge for lovers of rhythm games. I am totally unfamiliar with that breed of gamers. For the simple gamer like me, I'd say: nice for a playthrough. \n\n70/100\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[td]\n[i]More reviews at [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/39546715/]Omnivore Gamer[/url], games that are easy to control (for handicapped gamers). [/i][/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n- Absolutely Don't understand all the negative reviews for this game. \n\nFirst off: this game is a RogueLite in that death is permanent, be prepared for this. Death is a part of the game and you are NOT losing progress by dying.. it's death mechanic is very much like Rogue Legacy in that you keep progress that carries on to your next character when you begin again. Dying also isn't like you lost more than 45 minutes of your time. Every single game in this genre will have plenty of deaths involved before you FINALLY get that first win (in most cases). Some people are going to need to spend some time grinding levels, dying and repeat until they have enough sticker slots open to overpower things. Keep that in mind going into it. You retain your level and any big upgrades you acquire when you die so you are NOT starting from scratch every single time like you would in most rogue likes. \n\nI normally wouldn't review a game so early but I saw the negative reviews pouring in and felt I needed to add some counters to it. \n\nThe second thing: the art/music/atmosphere is absolutely brilliant for a game in this genre where most games of this nature tend to be relatively grim. As with most roguelike/lites its procedurally generated so the map, enemies and what have you will be different each time. \n\nThird: the forced timer before you have to fight the boss is a bit jarring at first as i've never played a game of this type where I have limited time to actually get there.. but it's kind of brilliant really because it adds a completely different layer to the game in that you have to manage your time very well. What do you think you have time to do before the inevitable? Do you want to run around and grind exp killing trash mobs? Or do you think that time could be better spent knocking some dungeons out (time halts when in dungeons so take your time in these) and getting some gear and arguably more exp than you would just wandering the map. Also, you absolutely have plenty of time to explore the map as there are shrines (you have to find them but the map isn't huge), that you can pay a special currency to add another day of time to the clock. If you see a review complaining about the timer and they have less than an hour in the game... take that with a grain of salt. \n\nFour: The combat is pretty simple but well done. There is a surprising amount of depth to it as well when you start buying and finding more powerful weapons (toys) that can do a variety of things and synergize pretty well together. Enemy variety is pretty good so far, each time you level up it adds more enemy variety to encounter around the map. \n\nFive: dungeons are fairly simple and a good mix of mini puzzles and fun combat encounters. \n\nIf you enjoy roguelike/lite games DEFINITELY give this a spot in your library to see what it has to offer. So far I'd put it 8-9/10 but I don't quite have the amount of time necessary to feel comfortable ranking it against other rogue games. I may edit this once I get to a point to see how much replayability it has but until then I'm eager to keep sending swords into a meat grinder and just adding to my power each time. Please look at how much time people have in a game before rating their reviews and taking their word. .5 hours is not enough time to really warrant a helpful review... nor is 6 in my case but I really don't want this game to be DoA\n\nEdit: Just beat Mormo for the second time.. trust me when i say you can make the timer go on infinitely. I Don't want to spoil anything BUT head to dungeons and kill as many enemies as you can to save up gold and another currency, and make a good loop around each area of the map and you'll find all sorts of neat things. As for bugs, I've had none and I'm at 13 hours of steady play. Don't waste time killing EVERY enemy that's in the open areas cause that will eat too much of your time, but focus on finding dungeons and the hidden npc encounters. I had my timer extended to approx. 8 days in game time and I also found a way to permanently increase the amount of time I have on subsequent runs. Give it a chance, learn how the game works before being upset about the timer.\n- It is a total eyegasm with a captivating story/lore. If you're even a tiny bit interested in anything f*cked-up and mysterious (SCP-like), buy this.\n\nFrom the gameplay perspective, it is simply good. Nothing mind-blowing, but good nonetheless.\n\nI've completed the game with a couple of sidequests (there are more for me) in about 13 hours, and there are two story DLC + the Expeditions mode, so I anticipate at least another 10+ hours of gameplay. Which is great for the price.\n\nUpdate: I've put in ~10 more hours to complete the Foundation DLC. It is a good DLC, and brings a few more hours of joy living in this world. It also has some sick areas (like that dark cave with the TV). The overall design is a bit more dull, but I enjoyed the story.\n- I got this game on a whim because I once played this series like... a decade ago. DW3/4 to be specific. And even though I know full well that this sort of game is basically meant for consoles, I managed to play it just fine once I adjusted the key bindings to stuff that worked well for me. Anyway... game.\n\nIf, like me, you have played these games before, you pretty much know what you are in for. If you have never played any of these games, I'm not quite sure what else is quite like it. Basically it's a fighting game, except it is on large battlefield maps where you murder thousands of random and a handful of named NPC's while following objectives in order to complete each level. If that sounds repetitive... well it can certainly be that. It's the ultimate hack and slash-fest game, and if you get bored with murdering insane numbers of enemies, then chances are this game is not for you.\n\nThe game is based upon the Three Kingdoms era of Ancient China (184-280, roughly), and, despite the absurd outfits and personalities of many of the characters in the game, it is actually fairly consistent with what is known about the period. Or rather, it is consistent with the famous novel 'Romance of the Three Kingdoms' by Luo Guanzhong, which is basically a work of historical fiction that takes real events and bends them a bit according to the whims and views of the author. Which, of course, means that certain characters (particularly Shu-Han characters like Xuande/Liu Bei) are depicted as noble honorable sorts fighting for justice while others (like Mengde/Cao Cao) are depicted as villanous and driven by ambition. I don't want to dig too deep into this because there most likely are entire books written about how Luo Guanzhong messed around with the characters, but the depictions he made are pretty much what are found in this and all previous DW games. The nice thing though is that if you read between the lines (or maybe it's just because I am very familiar with the source material this game is based off of), you can see the flaws in the author's bias in the game as well. Namely that Liu Bei was a massive hypocrite every bit as ambitious as his rivals, and that Cao Cao, while not exactly the nicest guy around, wasn't the hellspawn other characters (like Liu Bei) called him.\n\nAnyway, the game follows the story decently well, though some creative license and trimming down obviously has happened. I still liked how the game depicted things most of the time. Perhaps my favorite was Lu Bu's campaign which, while maintaining the massive \"OMG ITS LU BU\" hype that all DW games have had, reveals exactly why the real Lu Bu got himself executed in chapter 19 of a 120 chapter book: that he was dumb as a brick, betrayed people constantly, and never listened to anyone's advice. While the old DW games I played did have storylines for him, they didn't take the historical route that this game's (default) story path takes. The same goes for the numerous character deaths shown, though many of these are made more dramatic than they actually were.\n\nAlso, while the playable character cast has increased to the point of total insanity (including some that may not have even existed or actually fought on battlefields), I did like that, in the time between DW4 and this, they added a number of characters that rounded out the cast further by including some of the other lesser-known strategists (Chen Gong, Lu Su) and characters who rose to prominence in the later parts of the story (Deng Ai, the sons of Guan Yu/Zhang Fei, as well as the entire Jin faction who were the ultimate winners of this whole mess). I thought that was a nice treat since these sorts had been badly neglected in past games, where everything seemed to stop at the year 234 (when Kongming/Zhuge Liang died), which was roughly the chronological halfway point of the entire story.\n\nOk, I better stop and just finish this up.\n\nIn short, It's a DW game. That means that on the one hand, the combat gets repetitive, many of the characters are very hard to take seriously, and many of the story events are overdramatized to the point of being kind of ridiculous. On the other hand, there is a MASSIVE amount of content (and all those DLC's for this \"Complete Edition\" are purely cosmetic), big battles are kind of fun, and one can even argue that the storyline's inherent cheesiness may actually be more a positive than a negative.\n\nIf you have never played one of these games before, this is the one i'd look at because (to my knowledge) it's the newest one and has an insane amount of content even compared to its predecessors. If you have played these and liked them before... why not? If you didn't like these games however, then most likely this will do nothing to change your opinion.\n\nFor all it's goofiness and repetition, DW is still entertaining enough for me to waste sizeable amounts of time with it. Hooray and stuff.\n- Very fun game if you are looking for a cozy relaxing farming sim. if you had a hard time with the fishing mechanic in stardew valley then you will have an easier time with this game, ontop of that there are lots of cute little rhythm games to play and the animal raising is alot more in depth then stardew. just a little note of warning to new players, the game doesn't make this very clear but you shouldn't spend too much time gardening in your first year. Automatic watering systems aren't available until later on and if you are like me you will think making the biggest profit possible year one is a great idea but I accidentally ended up upgrading/unlocking everything except irrigation in my first year and now do not have much to spend my currency on. Other then finishing catching every fish, maybe decorating my farm/the village and getting the rare coloured animals theres not much else to do in the game for late game content. It feels like there is the intention of possibly adding more content later on? either way if you decide to play, for your first play through I really recommend exploring first and getting to know the villagers before you start large scale farming.\n- Have you ever asked yourself, \"Man, why doesn't someone make a cooperative fantasy RPG with all the nifty RPG-ism's that I love, like skills and talents and crafting and that I can play at my own pace with my friend and we can decide how we complete quests and treat people in the world and if we disagree then there was a mechanic in place that supported that and NPC characters we could hire and have join our adventures and instead of mindlessly blasting through hundreds of monsters like every other action RPG out there, we could fight in some nail-biting tactical, turn-based combat with spells and abilities that would affect the environment and turn the tide of the battle and the whole thing is wrapped up in a fantastic looking package with great looking characters and animations and some genuinely good and at times humorous writing?\"\n\nGuess what? It's your lucky day.\n- [h1]He did it again[/h1]\n\nI don't know how this guy does it but he nailed it again. Maybe it's not as good as To the Moon but it's still very good.\n\nFinding Paradise plays very similarly to To the Moon. You basically walk around collecting a person's memories and going through his life. You experience every important step and decision in his life. The purpose of that is to grant dying man a last wish and make him happy. But something unexpected happens as always and you start figuring out what is happening.\n\nThe story again is very good and hits you right in the feels. There's some mystery and new gameplay mechanics. Now we have a small mini-game each time we unlock a memory. It's not hard so it won't distract you from the story.\nThe whole story is funny and sad at the same time. There are lots of well written dialogues.\nI didn't like the ending sequence, i thought it was tedious and almost broke the enjoyment. Please don't do that in the next game, leave it as it should be.\n\nAnother thing i dislike is graphics engine. I don't like this pixelated retro graphics. It's ugly. But what i don't like even more is not being able to adjust the resolution. It's 2019 (ok the game was released in 2017) how a game released in that year doesn't have resolution options? No, just no. I won't accept that and i don't think there's any justification for that. Just stop with this retro crap already. Running the game in 280x200 or whatever the resolution doesn't make it cool.\n\nFortunately this game is all about the story and story is perfect and makes up for all the annoying things. This guy should make a movie or something.\n\nOh almost forgot. Music. Another outstanding aspect of this game. The guy's a genius.\n\nOverall a very good game if you want an amazing story. It's around 5 hours and that's in my opinion is enough to tell a great story.\n\n[b]Pros[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Amazing story\n[*]Amazing soundtrack\n[*]Great writing and character desing\n[/list]\n[b]Cons[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Retro style to the degree of nokia 3310 resolution\n[*]Ending sequence wasn't very fun\n[/list]\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/32930811-Kosmos%27s-Cosmic-reviews/?appid=704030][h1]Follow my curator page for more[/h1][/url]\n- Update 09/10/16\nSo they have added 'last man standing' mode which is great. The only issue is now that the controls are too difficult. If they fix this issue it would be a really fun party game and worth porting to consoles.\n\nPros:\n-Good visuals\n-Fun power ups\n-Awesome 4 player local play\n-In general the game is very fun and I believe with a few tweaks the game would be great. If they had done an early access build it would probably have been a great game on full release but there are still a few things that I and the people I played with don't like.\n\nCons:\nNOW FIXED (THEY ADDED LAST MAN STANDING' MODE) -Scoring system *the scoring system is based on how many you kill, we all thought the game would be better if you had lives instead and had to stay alive, when we played this game it was a case of constant kamakaze and not caring because it doesn't matter if you die* REPEAT THIS HAS BEEN FIXED\n-Controls *this type of game obviously can't be played with keyboard and mouse so this is only reviewed using Xbox 360 controller and it still isn't perfect, none of us felt that  had full control of the vehicle*\n\nVerdict:\nFor now I will give it a thumbs up as if they allow you to select scoring system based on kills or based on deaths we would play this a lot. And I think they could easily improve the controls. I hope the devs don't just leave this game to rot as it is a great idea for a local co-op game\n- this game is fire\n\nedit: actual review\n\na few weeks ago, i picked up dicey dungeons and that was a lot of fun; my first introduction to dice games\n\nafterwards, i saw some streamers playing slice and dice so i picked that up, and that was fun too - just not on steam unfortunately\n\nwell, this game is slay the spire + dice + cards. but what really sets it apart is the whole tug of war between corruption and purification. each character is very unique and i really can't recommend this enough, even with only just a few hours played.\n\ni just beat the game on difficulty 0 with the first character after playing the first 5 a few times.\n- Launch controversy aside, what this game should have been called for the longest time is 'Early Access'. Around the time of the Beyond update is when I'd say would have been the true 'launch'. \n\nI didn't get this when it first came out, but even when I did it was a fragmented mess of a game. Now, finally, with the Beyond and Synthesis updates there's a solid game here that's almost (but not quite) like what Sean Murray promised way back at the beginning.\n\nPerformance on PC has dramatically improved with the switch over to the Vulkan API, and it finally supports Ultrawide and various other PC-specific options. The game itself provides a significant amount of variety, offering a combination of Elite-lite and 'Minecraft in Space' mechanics. There's plenty to see and do, and the exploration aspect is enjoyable - if a little bland. The planetary biomes and overall game could still do with further diversity, but there's plenty here to get to your teeth into.\n\nHello Games show no sign of slowing down their support for the game either, having just recently released a bizarre in-game music synthesizer of all things, and going by the evidence of their progress to date I can only see the game improving further as time moves on.\n\nEDIT - 24/09/2020 \"Origins\" Patch: well, you can ignore the previous comments about diversity being a bit on the low side. They already added things like living ships, derelicts, space creatures and robots since I made this review, and with the Origins patch the variety of experience on offer is on such a scale now that I don't think I'm going to be lacking for things to do for some time. Also, impressively, the game runs even better than it did when I originally posted this - and the rejigged UI looks fantastic on Ultrawide. \n\nBrilliant work by the team at Hello Games. I can't think of any game I've played (and I've been indulging since the late 80's) where I've ever gone from \"I can't stand this\" to \"this is one of my favourite games\". It's taken a while to get here, but No Man's Sky is definitely one of the greats.\n- a very interesting FPS multiplayer and co-op, It would be better if it was still in development like early access because it needs some work. shorter spawn times, vehicles , larger and more varied maps, what this game has that no other FPS has is realistic weapons. you will not find another game that models modern military grade firearms more realisticily in terms of what they sound like ,recoil, look, feel ( to the extent that a pc game can offer) they are amazing and I would buy this game for 8 bucks just for that alone. But it does need work , this game could be a great title to rival Battlefield and COD franchises ( maybe not Advanced Warfare) it may not surpass those titles but it could give them a better run for the money.\n- Uncharted 4: A Thief's End:\n\nThe ambitious end to a long running franchise, Uncharted 4: A Thief's End is a very fascinating game.\nThe gunplay is enjoyable, the puzzles are decent and the humor is pretty good, there are some hilarious character interactions.\n\nThe story though, isn't very deep but I liked the darker approach and the flashbacks, it's interesting enough to keep you playing, and it really makes you care for the characters.\n\nExploration works decently, but it could've been better, there are documents you can read or find collectibles. The open area in Madagascar was one of the best parts of the game in my opinion, the car handles very well and the driving feels phenomenal.\n\nLastly, climbing is a very big part of the game, and even though the climbing mechanics are very smooth, I really had to force myself to enjoy it some times, and I wish there was less of it.\n\nThe action sequences are easily the best thing about this game, some jaw-dropping set-pieces keep you on the edge of your seat.\n\nUncharted 4 is the definition of a \"Movie Videogame\".\nIt's absolutely gorgeous, the cinematography is outstanding, the performances are fantastic and the soundtrack fits well, but gameplay-wise it's just... exhausting, not because of the controls or the gunplay, but because of the hand-holding and the linearity.\n\nUncharted the Lost Legacy:\n\nUncharted the Lost Legacy is proof that Uncharted can great even without Nathan Drake. The Lost Legacy is essentially just more Uncharted 4, it's something like a stand-alone expansion, and a good one at that.\n\nHonestly, I am surprised, I enjoyed this more than I expected. Even though the gameplay is more of the same, there's less climbing, and the fact that the game is relatively short is mostly a positive.\n\nThe game rarely feels repetitive, every puzzle is different from each other, and there is also an open area in the middle of the game where you can explore, which was implemented very well.\n\nAs for Chloe and Nadine, they make a pretty nice duo, where's Chloe is likeable and a goofball, Nadine is the opposite, she's aggressive and focuses on her mission. I liked their chemistry and I think both characters work very well together.\n\nAnd now for the negatives, the story isn't necessarily bad, it's just very generic and there are no stakes. Also, in my personal opinion, the biggest flaw the game has is that there are barely any highlights in it, almost no action except from the last chapter, which is a complete letdown considering how the action is literally the best part about this series.\n\nOverall it's very solid, and for its size it's definitely worth checking out, a great stand-alone expansion.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThank you Sony! Both games runs surprisingly well and overall very fun games. Uncharted 2 is still my favorite tho, but i'm happy to see Uncharted 4 and the Lost Legacy finally on PC, Uncharted 1,2,3 when?\n- Dear Dev, \nI love this game, if you're reading reviews, please consider some ideas to make it better:\n-  Level designing: Add more ways to choose, and different endings. Right now SoR4 is flat from A to B, it made me feel down compare to SoR3.\n- Alternate customs, and playable same characters: Floyd is overrated and all my friends want to pick him. Make a game with 4 Floyds running sound fun. Use lifetime score to unlock customs.\n- 2v2 Battle! WHY NOT?\n- Shiva (new), Max (new), Roo, Estel (Badass Woman Cop)\n- Steam trading cards: I know it's not importance, but who doesnt want some badass backgrounds on steam profile?\n- This game is more than just a driving simulator. It's a landscape experience.\n\nScreenshots won't reveal the full beauty of this game, cause they don't show how daytime and weather change while you drive, how the first sunbeams flash through trees and hills as you leave the night behind, how massive forests reveal as you climb mountain roads and cut through curvy canyons, or the mad contrast of Las Vegas' vibrant colors vs the lonely Route-66-style desert roads... these moments are gold, and define the atmosphere of a game that can be as relaxing or challenging as you want, based on the truck and cargo that you pick – but it will always be a beautiful trip.\n\nAlso, THIS is the game that TRULY deserves the Labor of Love award. In a year that has been most difficult for everyone, SCS managed to add more than ever: 2 map expansion DLCs, 3 completely new trucks brands (for FREE!), completely rework the lighting system (after complely overhauling the audio engine)... They just make the game better. Every year. For free.\n\nFor years now, SCS keep improving and remain honest, loyal and supportive to their customers and games. What more can you ask.\n\n(P.S. They just revealed plans for official co-op multiplayer.)\n- Too litle content for it's price. 2 scenes only and 0 choices.\n- Heartbound is a fantastic indie game with a lot of heart and fantastical mysteries.\nIf you enjoy beautiful 2D gaming experiences this is the game for you! \n\nPlay as a young boy on his journey to find his doggo, Baron. \nYou will explore various, unique worlds on this journey each with mysteries of their own...\n\nThe music I must draw particular attention to: It is wonderful to listen to. Honestly do yourself a favour and pick up this game- it is still in development but you will be glad to know that the updates are (thankfully) free!\n\nGive this game the love and attention it deserves!\n- I have never cried so damn much at a game\n- Very calm game with heartwarming moments. Better played with friends. Really brilliant gameplay idea. I just hope it gets a final ending really soon!\n\nEdit: After reaching the ultimate end, I felt bit disappointed. The progress was just straight up boring and uninteresting after years of restarting again and again.\nVery fun game anyways\n- This is everything a remaster is supposed to be. You remember playing this game over a decade ago, and the graphics weren't \"that bad\". But nostalgia is a cruel mistress. You play the original again, and you can barely stand it.\n\nThe comes the HD version, which was alright, playable. But then, the real remaster, the Definitive Edition, you start playing the game and it FEELS like it used to feel. Like it is supposed to look. It is quite obviously way better than it used to be, but it FEELS the same.\n\nIf you ever liked playing this game, and want to play it again, this won't disappoint you. Especially with the distinct lack of RTS games in the last decade or so, this still holds true as one of the best ones.\n\n【グループB】\n- A criminally underrated game, I have seldom seen a developer take their original hit which was already almost perfect, and actually manage to improve on it in every way shape and form. You do not need to have played the original to play or enjoy this game. Their stories are completely seperate.\n\nThe game itself is much less linear than its predecessor. The best way I can explain the feeling of going through the environments without referencing Grimrock itself is by saying it felt an awful lot like Myst to me, just with combat. Required puzzles for progression were challenging but not impossible, some of the secret challenges were much more difficult. I admit I used an online guide more than a few times, but it did nothing to diminish my enjoyment of the game. It is immersive, challenging, and satisfying. \n\nThe only drawback I can think of is the difficulty. It feels like you cannot win with any group composition, I suggest no more than 2 of any class or weapon/armor type user. I went with a warrior, two rogues(one range), and a mage, this way you as well makes you unlikely to complete a difficult fight or puzzle and be rewarded with something you cannot use. Combat itself can be challenging as I said, but you will rarely feel like you are simply incapable of winning. There are obvious ways to optimize the way you approach an encounter the second time if you die the first.\n\nBe prepared to immerse yourself, you must pay attention to your surroundings, read and remember notes you find, explore every nook and cranny you can find, and you will be rewarded. Good luck!\n\n- If you are looking for a game that you can never master, here is the game for you.\n- Absolutely Don't understand all the negative reviews for this game. \n\nFirst off: this game is a RogueLite in that death is permanent, be prepared for this. Death is a part of the game and you are NOT losing progress by dying.. it's death mechanic is very much like Rogue Legacy in that you keep progress that carries on to your next character when you begin again. Dying also isn't like you lost more than 45 minutes of your time. Every single game in this genre will have plenty of deaths involved before you FINALLY get that first win (in most cases). Some people are going to need to spend some time grinding levels, dying and repeat until they have enough sticker slots open to overpower things. Keep that in mind going into it. You retain your level and any big upgrades you acquire when you die so you are NOT starting from scratch every single time like you would in most rogue likes. \n\nI normally wouldn't review a game so early but I saw the negative reviews pouring in and felt I needed to add some counters to it. \n\nThe second thing: the art/music/atmosphere is absolutely brilliant for a game in this genre where most games of this nature tend to be relatively grim. As with most roguelike/lites its procedurally generated so the map, enemies and what have you will be different each time. \n\nThird: the forced timer before you have to fight the boss is a bit jarring at first as i've never played a game of this type where I have limited time to actually get there.. but it's kind of brilliant really because it adds a completely different layer to the game in that you have to manage your time very well. What do you think you have time to do before the inevitable? Do you want to run around and grind exp killing trash mobs? Or do you think that time could be better spent knocking some dungeons out (time halts when in dungeons so take your time in these) and getting some gear and arguably more exp than you would just wandering the map. Also, you absolutely have plenty of time to explore the map as there are shrines (you have to find them but the map isn't huge), that you can pay a special currency to add another day of time to the clock. If you see a review complaining about the timer and they have less than an hour in the game... take that with a grain of salt. \n\nFour: The combat is pretty simple but well done. There is a surprising amount of depth to it as well when you start buying and finding more powerful weapons (toys) that can do a variety of things and synergize pretty well together. Enemy variety is pretty good so far, each time you level up it adds more enemy variety to encounter around the map. \n\nFive: dungeons are fairly simple and a good mix of mini puzzles and fun combat encounters. \n\nIf you enjoy roguelike/lite games DEFINITELY give this a spot in your library to see what it has to offer. So far I'd put it 8-9/10 but I don't quite have the amount of time necessary to feel comfortable ranking it against other rogue games. I may edit this once I get to a point to see how much replayability it has but until then I'm eager to keep sending swords into a meat grinder and just adding to my power each time. Please look at how much time people have in a game before rating their reviews and taking their word. .5 hours is not enough time to really warrant a helpful review... nor is 6 in my case but I really don't want this game to be DoA\n\nEdit: Just beat Mormo for the second time.. trust me when i say you can make the timer go on infinitely. I Don't want to spoil anything BUT head to dungeons and kill as many enemies as you can to save up gold and another currency, and make a good loop around each area of the map and you'll find all sorts of neat things. As for bugs, I've had none and I'm at 13 hours of steady play. Don't waste time killing EVERY enemy that's in the open areas cause that will eat too much of your time, but focus on finding dungeons and the hidden npc encounters. I had my timer extended to approx. 8 days in game time and I also found a way to permanently increase the amount of time I have on subsequent runs. Give it a chance, learn how the game works before being upset about the timer.\n- After around an hour and a half of bad spawns, scarce resources, and short-lived ventures into the more inhabited areas of the map, I ran into the first friendly player I had met in Rust. I had initially spotted him pretty far away, but I paid no real notice to him as he had a rock equipped. Eventually he got close enough for us to clearly see each other and, upon the realization that neither of us were hostile, we both pulled out torches as a mutual sign of peace (or the highest possible level of non-aggression that can exist in Rust). I dropped my old hatchet for him as I had just finished crafting one with metal, and he gave me some food as a sign of good faith. After nearly 30 minutes of searching and scavenging, we had pooled enough resources to craft us each some minimally decent gear. We knew that if we wanted to progress any further we would need to mine boulders, and a lot of them. I used what remaining materials we had to put together a 9mm handgun and several bullets, though I reminded him it was only in case we really needed it. I had decided earlier during my many unwanted experiences with bullets to the face that I would try my hardest not to run around slaughtering every newly spawned player that I came across. A few minutes out from camp we had encountered a player with a hunting bow. I had been running with my hatchet out, so I quickly took out the handgun in my inventory and pointed it in his direction, attempting to scare him away. When the player was far enough away we continued up a road towards a few stones. The area was surrounded by trees so I opted to stand guard with the handgun while my friend mined. Just as we were moving on to the next boulder, I heard the gunfire start. I turned around to see a player with an assault rifle gunning down my friend, and before I could land any shots on him he had already begun shooting me. It was at that moment that I remembered I hadn't even crafted a sleeping bag for the camp, as that was one of the objectives of the trip we were taking. I typed into the chat, thanking the friend I had made for all of his help and asking the player who had killed us if we had been intruding in his area or something along those lines. He simply wrote \"Sorry guys :D\" This is the single problem that I have with games like this. Why does it have to be \"shoot-on-sight?\" That player had obviously taken us by surprise and was better equipped than us. Even if he had a justifiable reason for approaching two very poorly equipped players (which he really didn't considering we were in the middle of the woods and he had pretty much all of the gear you could need in this game) he could have easily told us to cooperate by either putting away our weapons or just leaving the area. But of course, he comes around, sees some players trying to gather enough supplies to get to a stable point in the game, and decides to go out of his way to approach us and use unecessary ammo for a hatchet and a handgun with four bullets. Then, to add even more of an insult, he adds an apology at the end, as if he had no choice but to shoot two unexpecting, half-naked, unprepared players. \n\nAll in all, though, I do see a lot of potential in this game, and the good in the community does shine through every once in a while. I just wish that people would realize that they don't need to go around killing players who haven't had the chance to experience the game. People like that are the single reason why so many players on steam feel that they wasted money on what would otherwise be a great experience.\n- ~ DIFFICULTY ~\n\n🔲 My 90 year old grandma could play it\n🔲 Easy\n🔲 Normal\n✅ Hard\n🔲 Dark Souls\n\n~ GRAPHICS ~\n\n🔲 MS Paint\n🔲 Bad\n🔲 Meh\n🔲 Graphics don't matter in this game\n✅ Good\n🔲 Beautiful\n🔲 Masterpiece\n\n~ MUSIC ~\n\n🔲 Bad\n🔲 Not special\n🔲 Good\n✅ Beautiful\n\nI WILL GIVE YOU MY ALL! and also FLAMES OF LOVE is a hit\n\n~ STORY ~\n\n🔲 This game has no story\n🔲 Like playing Temple Runners for the story\n✅ It's there for the people who want it\n🔲 Well written\n🔲 Epic story\n🔲 Imagine Kingdom Hearts but on crack\n\n~ PRICE ~\n\n🔲 Free\n🔲 Underpriced\n✅ Perfect Price\n🔲 Could be cheaper\n🔲 Overpriced\n🔲 Complete waste of money\n\nIt went free on some point\n\n~ REQUIREMENTS ~\n\n🔲 You can run it on a microwave\n✅ Average\n🔲 High end\n🔲 NASA computer\n\n~ LENGTH ~\n\n🔲 Very Short (0 - 2 hours)\n🔲Short (2 - 15 hours)\n🔲 Average (15-50 hours)\n🔲 Long (50-90 hours)\n🔲 Extremely long (90-110 hours)\n✅ No ending\n\n~ FUN ~\n\n🔲 I'd rather watch paint dry\n🔲 Hard to enjoy\n🔲 Repetitive\n🔲 Actually pretty amusing\n🔲The kind of fun you'll remember\n✅ Ride of your life\n\n~ REPLAYABILITY~\n\n🔲 It's a one-time experience\n🔲 Only for achievements\n🔲 If you wait a few months/years\n✅ Definitely\n🔲 Infinitely replayable\n\n~ WORTH BUYING ~\n\n🔲 No\n✅ Wait for sale\n✅ Yes\n- I normally hate \"retro\" platformers, I never liked Mega Man, only Mega Man X, didn't care much for Shovel Knight but loved Hollow Knight, things like that. The Messenger IS a platformer, even though the second part of the game makes it less linear, and I loved it.\n\nDevs could take a lot of notes here - checkpoints are frequent, boss fights are short and creative and you don't have to go through 2 easy phases to retry a hard 3rd phase, most rooms and even most trick rooms have multiple ways to approach them given your fairly simple moveset. You never have to do anything pixel-perfect to get through but doing things well is massively rewarding. It constantly surprised you with new things but doesn't overstay anything, and completely foreign mechanics introduced are not punishing (Skylands, for example).\n\nA lot of people comment on how great the writing is, and well... it is great. It's sparse but fantastic throughout, with more personality in what amounts to a few pages than most games can give with 10 times as many words (and lore pickups).\n\nFor reference, I completed it with all the challenge collectibles in 14.5 hours, but did not get all achievements nor go through NG+. It is well paced and hard to put down, but easy enough to play in chunks, and I felt like I was learning new tricks up through the end of the game.\n\nDo the thing!\n- Don't buy this game if you are planning a full co-op playthrough with a friend.\n\nAt first we thought only story progress wasn't shared which was fine as we'd both get to experience the missions regardless. However it turns out that all unlocks tied to completing each area such as new guns, cars and basically all the things you'd want to progress in are locked for the person who isn't hosting. This means your partner is stuck with the level 1 unlocks from start to finish unless they go back and do everything in their game as well.\n\nCompletely pointless and took us until clearing one of the lieutenants for us to realise this, bought this a while back too so not gonna be able to get a refund. Worst implemented co-op I have seen in a long time.\n- In a world where \"enhanced edition\" has started to be synonymous with \"will run on modern hardware if you shell out $20\" it's absolutely refreshing to see Larian deliver this masterpiece free of charge to owners of the original. You start out with an already fantastic game that's received numerous game of the year and editor's choice awards. Then you spend a year polishing that game, and adding new features. The result is brilliant Enhanced Edtion of an already fantastic game.\n\nNew features for EE:\n[list]\n[*] Fully voice acted - Every line of dialog now has voice acting. The voice acting is really good too\n[*] Dual wield - Rogues now look more iconic with the ability to dual wield\n[*] Grenades - You can craft and throw various sorts of grenades. \n[*] Tactician Mode - A new  challenging mode where encounters are redesigned to be harder by adding new spells and enemies into the mix. Classic mode still available obviously.\n[*] Split screen co-op \n[*] Controller support\n[*] Updated graphics - The UI is totally reworked, the graphics are updated, and spells have new effects\n[*] Updates to the story  - The story, esepcially the ending, was rewritten a bit to clear up some confusing aspects\n[/list]\n\nI'm sure there's more, but really these ought to be reason enough to play this game.\n- This game has such a HUGE potential like Stardew Valley in its early days!!\nCollecting stuff, helping people by crafting potions its so rewarding and lovely pls dear developers keep working on it. I BEG YOU! :D\nSure it has some bug right now but even on day one they managed to get some fast fixes and tried their best to make it work for everyone. \nThe controls were a bit tricky in the beginning (used Playstation 5 Controller) but its just a matter of time, its just not the normal controls like in other games.\nThe music was pretty nice and chill and also the animations were super cute, i love watching little Rubrum built his sandcastles over and over again. >3< \n\nOverall a good game, but could become even more better in the future, keep going guys!!\n- I have mixed feelings about this game. It could have been very very good but has been let down by some very shoddy quality issues. This would not in itself have been a problem BUT given its AAA high price tag, to be honest, the consumer deserves better in terms of finish and execution. To name a few of the irritations:\n1.) AI characters shooting through walls.\n2.) Poorly realised inventory system (You can't compare stats of your secondary weapon with inventory items)\n3.) Camera does not follow actions during combat\n4.) Right click items in inventory and you do not always get the correct sub menus.\n5.) Mouse & Keyboard use was definitely an afterthought in terms of design\n6.) The frustrating click to confirm attribute/perk/talent spend.\n7.) UI does not always detail consumed action points to move to a location during combat\n\nAs I said lots of irritations that normally, in an indie game such as this, you would expect... but NOT when the publisher charges AAA prices.\n\nEz\n\n- very well made cant stop playing. only complaint is keyboard set up and i get that the game says play with controller but thats not an option for me but the keys are all over the place r select upgrade e to reroll f to chat with npc r to enter their shop its like that for everything and you cant change the keybinds for UI stuff i wish it was just e to interact its all over the place and i find my self still miss typing things. if you buy the game use a controller \n\n- It has poor simulation of hand skeleton, so you can't use all fingers, benefits of Index Knuckles controller or VR gloves, etc. And, scenario doesn't allow you to do anything, actually, except one straightforward way. Some things are elaborated, but mostly it isn't worth time or money. But I'm rating it as professional developer for VR, sexual content itself is not matter nor interested for me. My advice for game developer is to add more hand tracking features and more scenarios - in this case it can be something better.\n- [h2] Visual Novel Reviews [/h2]\n\n[b] TLDR [/b] Two scenes, no customization, no choices, character development needs work, but the Extremely short story delivered (If you know what I mean) a whopping 38 minutes of game play for me. \n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [th]Question[/th]\n        [th]Answer[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Buy Again[/td]\n        [td]No, I wouldn't.

Someone is the neighborhood knows the whole story, but who \ncould that be? \n\n[h3] Overall Score: [/h3]\n\nScore: 3.8 - Length, Character Development, and Storytelling leaves a lot to be desired with this game. This is the second game that this developer has released, so I am not disappointed that I spent 5$ dollars on a game that they created, but I will say that I will think Long and Hard (No Pun Intended) before purchasing another game from this studio.\n- This game may actually be my favorite 2D Zelda game of all time.\n\nI knew going into it that the music by Lena Rain (who did Celeste's music) would be great. It is. I knew the game would be wholesome and adorable since it's by the designer from Wandersong. And it is. What I didn't expect was just how fun and interesting the paint-based gameplay would be. The puzzles constantly make you feel super smart, and the abilities you gain are all super fun to play with. When I first heard about the idea, I didn't think there would be all that many interesting puzzles and mechanics based on painting, but wow was I wrong. The puzzles and mechanics never get old, and there are an absolute ton of creative ideas being introduced all the way to the end of the game.\n\nAnd I certainly didn't predict how incredibly deep and personal the story and overall theme would be. The characters, writing, and plot of this game are astoundingly well done, and they turn a fantastic cozy 2D Zelda game into a truly unique and wonderful experience.\n\nI guess what I'm saying is, Chicory does for 2D Zelda games what Celeste did for platformers. It takes the base concept, turns the gameplay, music, and charm up to 11, and interweaves incredibly deep and emotional threads into every aspect of the game.\n\nI cannot recommend Chicory enough. I did back it on Kickstarter, which is how I got an advanced copy, but the game is better than I ever dreamed it could be. If you like cozy games about discussing feelings and helping people, or you like 2D Zelda games with innovative puzzles and hundreds of collectibles, or you just want to draw butts on everyone you meet, you need to get Chicory.\n- A very easy game to get into, super popular at the moment so there is always someone to play with, and for only 5 EUR you can invest a lot of hours into the game\n- Basic RPG with phenomenal music. Very linear nearly no exploration. Short and didn't overstay it's welcome. Not bloated with useless content like a lot of JRPG's. Some comedy. No gear or weapons to loot. Definitely took inspiration from Sailor Moon. Didn't provide much of a challenge. However I enjoyed my time with it, 100% in under 8 hours. It was a decent game. 7/10\n- Refunded.\n\nFeels like they released the wrong game files - half the game seems to be broken or missing...\nBasic functions such as zooming in and out, no tutorial, huge amounts of buttons that don't have any impact. Good idea, terrible execution.\n- Please, bare with me here...I NEVER write reviews for anything (this is probably the third review I have ever written), but I feel like I need to write this one for so many reasons!!!  I grew up playing the Telltale/Lucas Arts Series: Monkey Island. After discovering and playing those, I figured out that I have an infinite amount of love for Point and Click adventure games. After finishing that series, I really only played the other games made by either Lucas Arts or Telltale (Mostly because I thought they were the only creators of Point and Click games...until about a year ago, when I discovered there's an entire genre/world of Point and Click).  Of course, I must also note: The Curse of Monkey Island will always be my fav, as it was the first Point and Click I ever played. Ok...NOW...with all of that being said, I recently discovered WADJET EYE GAMES and I am SO happy I did. I would recommend EVERY.SINGLE,GAME they sell. I have played all of their MAC/iOS compatible Point and Clicks, and I have yet to be (even slightly) disappointed. I had very high expectations going in as the Monkey Island games, Day of the Tentacle, Full Throttle, Grim Fandago, etc. are some of the best games in the history of Point and Click; however, all of the games I have played from Wadjet Eye have been amazing. They have actually been so amazing that I can 100% say Wadjet Eye is at the top of my list, right there with the Telltale/Lucas Arts games. I 100% recommend purchasing and playing every game made by Wadjet Eye to anyone who likes (even those who kinda sorta like) Point and Click games.\n- No Man’s Sky is like a guy who owes you $1,000 from 6 years ago coming back with $10,000 to repay you after you thought the money was gone.\n\nI really like this game. I’ve been playing it for years on and off, returning after every major update to see the state of things. No man’s Sky might be a fantastic game now, but you gotta always remember how it all begun. When the game first came out it could best be described to had been as wide as the ocean, but having the depth of a puddle. \n\nThe game has improved so much from when it came out that it is easily one of my favorite space exploration games nowadays. One of the greatest redemption stories in video game history. It’s almost like they used the money they earned from sales  to actually improve the game. \n\nI love the idea of having this massive sandbox shared experience, where coincidentally anybody can stumble upon my little bases I scattered, mines, etc. I also love flying around the stars in my ship, discovering new planets, finding weird animals, plants, geography…\n\nThe sense of adventure and the thrill of finding some new world makes me have so much fun. If you like exploring and just taking your time  doing things, this game is a must, and I highly recommend it. \n\nThe truth is no matter what you think of the game we should all be grateful of what we’ve gotten. If No Man’s Sky was made by EA, all these updates throughout the years would probably have been released as $60 new games each.\n\nI’ll be honest, at this rate and with these devs I have a feeling No Man’s Sky has a better chance of of becoming what Star Citizen strives to be than Star Citizen.\n\nEvery now and then though, whenever I see a game trailer that I really enjoy, I like to remember the state of this game when it first came out and how awful it was. It keeps me in check and helps my expectations stay grounded.\n\n10/10\n- Open world exploration by design, pants soiling horror by incident. Blends the concepts of innate human fear of deep water and unknown danger with constant, all pervading curiosity.\n\nYou have to dive deeper. You have to know what's down there.\n- +Long (&quality) story mode\n\n-Sometimes utterly lost so I have to backtrack or look at playthroughs\n-No skill tree\n-Loading screens\n-Some game breaking bugs so I had to cheat to pass it (e.g. pistons in tunnel) \n-Repetitive: turn this wheel, kill this bunch of enemies to open the lock,...\n-Enemies become bullet sponges on higher difficulty modes\n-No Xen chapters, so quite a cliffhanger...\n\nIn short: it is a decent game because of the good story, but people that recommend it are probably just on a nostalgia trip.\n- [i]\"The Display says 'Nothing'\"[/i]\n\"Nothing or 'Nothing'\"?\n[i]\"It's BLANK!\"[/i]\n\"'Blank' OK Great. What is on the Middle Right button?\"\n[i]\"NO!\"[/i]\n\"Middle Right!\"\n[i]\"NO!\"[/i]\n\"What you you mean No!? I HAVE THE MANUAL!\"\n\n[h1]**BOOOOOOOOM**[/h1]\n\n10/10\n- Finally, a video game that is everything televangelists in the 90’s said that video games were. Exactly what my Christian mother would love to catch me playing.\n\nIt’s like Animal Crossing and Doom\nEternal had a son… as was foretold when they released on the same day.\n\nThis game really makes you FEEL like you’re sacrificing your friends to an almighty force. Would I really just sacrifice 5 of my friends  again for some loot chests? I’m a gamer, of course I would.\n\nI fell in love with the aesthetic of this game instantly. It was brilliant when the gameplay held up to those expectations.  \n\nI loved it. I loved the art. The humor. The theme. The premise. The combat. The cult management. Sacrifices. Collecting the bones of my enemies. The juice visual effects. Most of all I loved feeding my followers bowls of poop.\n\nThe combat is fun but definitely not the meat of the game. Building your cult and just upgrading stuff is quite satisfying.  There's some goofy stuff to laugh at and it's quick and responsive. There’s something about the music that makes you feel relaxed and in terrible danger all at the same time.\n\nThis is not a game that you're gonna put 50-100 hours in either.  Which to me is a big plus.  Most of the runs don't take you more than 15 minutes.  So it's an easy game to pick up and play for a bit and jump back in later. It's like Vampire Survivors in that regard.\n\nIt's basically Animal Crossing with a roguelite twist. I could say it's almost original how those elements were combined.\nIt's great entertainment, all around. You could even say the game is bound to become a cult classic…\n\n10/10\n- This is half of a very good game. You might be impressed in the first 10 hours, but after that it becomes evident you are playing the skeleton of what could be a generational game. Here is some of the good and some of the bad.\n\nThe Good:\n-Graphics look great, even on lower settings\n-Decently varied battle maps\n-Sound design makes killing blows feel amazing\n-Decent variety of weapons\n\nThe Bad:\n-Extremely shallow \"campaign\"\n-Almost zero role playing elements. Every character behaves identically towards you. Even your own wife will try to introduce herself. Kill someone's father/brother/entire clan? They will never mention it and will behave towards you just like anyone else.\n-\"Realistic mode\" means all your enemies will be absolute tank meat sponges while you are made of glass.\n-After you get your first settlement the game becomes extremely tedious. You will play whack a mole with enemy armies who take almost no time to recuperate. Wipe out 3 enemy armies in a massive, \"war changing battle\"? Oops, looks like all of those armies are back to full strength in a matter of days.\n-Almost zero variation of playstyles. Sure you can be a trader or a rogue mercenary for the early game, but you will always end up cheesing the smithing economy mechanics to support the larger armies you need in the mid game\n\nThis is simply an unfinished game. The fact they have been selling it for $50 successfully for years is wild.\nWould have much rather paid $100 for a fully finished product.\n\nUnless they have a massive overhaul on the \"Official Release\" October 25th, I cannot recommend this game. Shame.\n- I'm going to write an honest review for this game since A LOT of people seem to be very biased.\n\nThis is not a perfect game. No 2K basketball game will ever be a perfect game. Does that mean this game is bad? No. Should you hold off on the game for now? Probably.\n\nLet's start with the positives:\n\n- A lot of people seem to gloss over the fact that 2K rehauled a lot of mechanics for this game. Shot meters feel more legitimate, this game is MUCH much more realistic (fouls, shot tendencies, etc...) This game is better and more fluid to control, and the gameplay reflects each players' ratings (defense, shots, etc...) much more accurately.\n\n- Online play seems to be better and more fluid. I've yet to encounter any latency issues online with quick play and the such.\n\n- MyCareer is MUCH better than last years. There is no cheesy story and the cutscenes feel much more integrated into the game. Orange Juice and dynamic duos are a great idea in general. The UI for MyCareer (and the game in general) is so much cleaner and more functional.\n\n- The game is visually beautiful, not much else to say on the matter.\n\nNow, the cons:\n\n- Help defense is broken. It's quite ridiculous that 2K hasn't fixes this lingering issue in such a long time but it's still there. This is a BIG issue in MyCareer and not quite as bad in other modes since you can manually control players.\n\n- Stat allocation is broken. This is a huge issue in MyCareer and has deterred me from playing the mode any more until 2K fixes this issue. Introducing the idea of stats that can only be raised in practice is actually quite a neat idea. However, these boosts are not permanent, even though 2K has stated they are. This is detrimental and demoralizing and discourages players from playing the game more. Limit caps are ridiculously strict as well. 2K NEEDS to fix these issues ASAP.\n\n- Numerous glitches.\n\n- 2K introduced broken mechanics along with the good mechanics. Ankle breakers are now pathetically easy to pull off (using Stephen Curry behind the back moves is a surefire way to have your defender fall). Moving screens are now a thing. \n\nI would hold off on buying this game until 2K patches it. There are just too many issues with the game that prevent it from being a playable game. I like this game. I really do. That's why I'm hoping 2K listens to the community and starts working on the issues at hand immediately.\n- EDIT: I nominated this game for game of the year (2023)\n\nLong ago I had heard about this game and how detailed and intricate it could be, and how you could spend hours upon hours building the massive empire of dwarves only for it to all come crashing down in some spectacular but unforeseen way.  Then I got into Rimworld briefly and thought it was ok, but it tended toward chaos a bit too much for my liking.  THEN I heard this game was coming to steam and I eagerly awaited it.\n\nIt's not necessarily that I was too good to play a game with mostly ascii/character graphics (I used to play them a lot back in the 1980s).  I was more intimidated by the depth of the game and not knowing if there was a wiki for it (there is) or how I'd find help if I needed it (I'm sure there's a ton of communities JUST for this game).  I expected that when it came to Steam, it'd be beefed up and worth the wait.\n\nWell it finally arrived and I think I'm STILL a bit intimidated by the sheer amount of options you have... mostly because it's not just me that I have to worry about, but a whole community of dwarves.  In the case of something like minecraft, I could dig a whole intricate tunnel and if stuff starts to go bad, I just high-tail it out of there and recover until I can go back and finish it.  In Dwarf Fortress though, if stuff starts to go bad, you can't just leave.  You are encouraged to deal with the adversity and push onward in the name of greatness... or something.\n\nIn a way it's like role playing, except you don't have to roll character sheets and you don't really control any of the characters directly.  You make decisions about where to mine, what trees to chop down, what to build, what to trade, what to plant, and for every thing there is a season (turn turn turn).  You're forced to deal with death, birth, attacks, sickness, madness, and a ton of other things that I have no idea are coming.  \n\nI keep thinking \"I could do better\" and I start a new game, but then I start to realize that no matter what I do, I'm never gonna have a perfect game, or a game where everything goes exactly according to plan.  I am eventually going to have to buckle down and stick to one game save to see it through.\n\nIf you're like me and starting something new holds a lot more interest than continuing an existing project (ADHD?) you may have difficulty with this game.  At the same time you may become so engrossed in it that you lose track of time and suddenly it's 6am and you wonder why you stayed up all night digging holes.  I'm starting to feel a bit of the madness myself.  (it's almost 4:30am as I write this)\n\nIn any case, it's probably not for everyone, but I'd say if you're unsure, find the non-steam version and try that, and if you can grok what's going on and it interests you, definitely buy this and support the developers... OR buy this and try to stay under the 2 hour refund  limit while you learn the basics (Good luck with that, it'll be 6 hours before you know what happened).  I believe this game is worth the money though (full price).  If you were going to wait for a sale you'd be waiting a long time anyway.  \n\nTL;DR If this looks interesting to you, don't wait! Buy now.  If you aren't sure, do a bit of research and come back and buy it.\n- A very good recursive Sokoban.

Characters blink, their mouths move when they speak, and even backgrounds have some animated aspects, such as water movement, crackling fires and other neat little touches. The art is top-notch and, in my opinion, the game's strongest point.\n\nAnother aspect that makes Bustafellows a standout is the heroine. Teuta has much more presence than a lot of other protagonists in the genre because she has a face, voice and strong personality. She's her own character and not one of those 'we're going to make MC as bland as humanly possible for self-insertion purposes' heroines, which I very much appreciated.\n\nThe Steam version is a bit clunky compared to the console release, and at times it suffered from some pacing issues, but all the characters and their interactions were enjoyable. The main story was great; I really loved the group dynamic they established in the common route, and while Shu and Crow were definitely my favorites, there was nobody I really disliked as a love interest. They each had an interesting story behind them and unique dynamic with Teuta.\n\nThe final stories that attempt to wrap everything up were the only part of the game that just really didn't do it for me. I can't go into much detail without spoilers, but the best I can describe it is everything comes at you too fast, parts of it felt out of nowhere, and for me it was a downer. Not awful enough to ruin the game, and some of the ideas were good, but I feel like they were executed poorly.\n\nAll in all, Bustafellows is one of the better otome games out there. It's not perfect, but its strengths shine brighter than its flaws, and I'm dearly hoping Bustafelllows Season 2 gets localized so I can see more of its wonderful art and characters.\n- This is a really clever game; smart and witty dialog, hand drawn graphic-novel style art, and creatively written missions.  I've only played through one set of 7 day missions but there is definitely a desire to go back and try to win in other ways.  In this game you have to manage the resource of your superheroes - not just which ones you think will survive the mission uninjured but to find compatibility and relationships between the superheroes.  There are some contrived bits, some superhero style (groan) humor - but overall this game lets you feel the joy, awkwardness, and humanity of relationships.  I *really* cared about these characters and their trials.  Love is love is love. (Disclaimer - I know Jesse Schell personally, but I don't know the team and I don't feel that relationship influenced my review or appreciation of the game which stands on its own).\n- Nobody is gonna read this but here we go.... \nI recommend it, especially people who are really into classic Sonic. It plays like the Genesis games and is updated to incorporate elements and stages from each one, including Sonic CD. What it makes up for in updated graphics, music, and ideas, it loses in length of stage and just overall.... stage design. What I loved about the classic Sonic is that it felt like a choice to either blow through it or explore.. this one makes even the first level of each stage take about 5 or 6 minutes to get through... and then fight a boss. Overkill in my opinion, takes away what I liked about classic Sonic games... the speed. Still pretty good considering how much Sega has messed with Sonic throughout the years.\n- Plants, please: A horticultural document thriller.\nGlory to Undermere.\nPros: \n- the writing and its illusion of effortless brilliance\n- attention to detail and consequences for player actions\n- \"gotta catch 'em all\" mentality that actually makes you feel smart\n- the intrigue, world-building, and game flow\n- petting the cat\n\nCons: I wish there was more music, or just none at all most of the time.\n- Your girlfriend might be temporary but DOOM is ETERNAL!\n- A Short Hike is a relaxing, casual game about exploring an expansive, mountainous island park and eventually making your way to its summit so you can get cell phone reception.\n\nYou play as Claire, a bird who can climb, glide, and flap to great heights using a stamina system based upon how many golden and silver feathers you’ve collected. Along the path to the mountaintop you’ll encounter Animal Crossing-style characters who are friendly, punny, and usually have some minor task for you to solve, ranging from finding lost items to making deliveries.\n\nHelping residents of the island is completely optional, as is just about every activity in the game other than locating a few feathers and reaching the summit; as a result, length can range from an hour if you don’t stop to smell the roses to a few hours if you decide to make friends with everyone and see all the park has to offer.\n\nActivities include filling out a fishing journal by trading in your catches, digging in suspicious spots, solving treasure map clues, parkour racing, and opening up shortcuts by breaking blocked entrances and watering bouncy flowers. \n\nA Short Hike has a charming aesthetic and a lovely, peaceful soundtrack. I felt driven to see everything the game had to offer despite not being forced into any of it and never lost interest until I did so. It’s a beautiful little world that will make fans of Animal Crossing feel right at home.\n- This is a passable if grindy 3D first person family friendly farming \"shooter\" with cartoony artwork.  You have a simple \"vacuum\" gun that you use to capture wild critters, throw them into pens, feed them, collect their stuff, sell it, rinse repeat.  \n\nThe implementation here is of high quality and works well on PC with a range of implementation options.  While the gameplay is somewhat repetitive and grindy, this is decent enough family friendly game that should be considered when on sale.  The retail price is too high, however, this game appears on sale and in bundles often enough.\n- 136 hours, 49/49 achievements - sounds like just enough for the review.\n\nIt is indeed complete package. Brilliant characters, neatly constructed plot and enjoyable gameplay with the classic \"easy to play, hard to master\" aspect to it.\n\nI really can't pick at the graphics or music - they are just in line with the Supergaint roster, crafted at the level we have come to expect.\n\nIs there anything substantial that I would change? Not really, no. Adjustment to the \"progress\" in the one place, perhaps some slight balancing elsewhere... But does it matter when taking everything into account? Nope, not at all.\n\nEasy recommendation.\n- Fun Tower-Defense style indie game. Definitely one where your skill improves every time you die. And you will die, repeatedly. :P Expect to try out many monster combinations per floor before you find something that can delay the hordes of adventurers long enough to set up the floor beneath! I would probably enjoy some more horizontal progression + permanent upgrades for long term re-playability, but it seems like a solo dev/small scoped project. Definitely worth the price for the current amount of content!\n- I shall start by saying that if you are deciding to buy this game then don't let the negative reviews sway you. In general, Fallout 4 is an amazing game and can be incredibly fun.\n\nPros: \n-Very immersive and will drain so many hours, days, weeks and months from your life.\n-Far Harbour, Automotron and (first half of) NukaWorld DLC have really good stories, quests and environments.\n-Mostly fluid combat system. Everything depends on how you want to play the game.\n\nCons: \n-WIll drain so much of your life away (might've forgotten my gf's birthday ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ )\n-Main story was incredibly lackluster compared to previous Fallout games\n-Giving you the option to be literally any kind of character you want to be....except you're always tied to being a parent.\n-a few repitive quests. (although gives you opportunities to approach these quests, areas and enemies differently\n\nAll in all, If you're a Fallout fan because of previous stories then you might not feel fulfilled playing this game, however if you love character creations, lore and immersive environments with untold stories then I completely recommend this game to you.\n- Sticking with the usual air of cool and weird and the usual musical flair, the latest Cosmo D entry changes up the FPS gameplay for a dice rolling RPG with quirky characters and little surprises to be found (and making pizza, of course). Can be beaten in a couple of hours but rewards multiple playthroughs for different gameplay paths and endings that can be mixed up with difficulty modifiers and challenges.\n- please stop resetting my setting\n- Complete scam - game barely works. Devs got it to load with stability and then dropped all funding and support for the game. Complete contract violation with Steam. I actually cant believe it is still in the Steam store. DO NOT BUY !!! I was not allowed to refund it even with only .4 hours played, due to \"management issues\" within Double Fine. I am guessing Steam cant get their money out of them either.\n- Good game, one of the best in the series but I can not recommend. \nDO NOT BUY.\nWhile it is still possible to play zombies safely with the use of community patches you can not play public servers safely and activision are actively removing safe ways of playing the game.\n\n*DO NOT OPEN ANY COD PRIOR TO IW*\nThey took away Xlabs, Sm2, and soon will take away Plutonium which are all the ONLY safe way to play these older CoDs.\nOpening any CoD prior to IW will result in a chance for people to gain access to your pc. 2 security breaches are known:\nCVE-2018-20817\n(SV_SteamAuthClient in various Activision Infinity Ward Call of Duty games before 2015-08-11 is missing a size check when reading authBlob data into a buffer, which allows one to execute code on the remote target machine when sending a steam authentication request.

, (which is extremely rare btw), then the AI fails horribly.\nyou kill 2 people far away, the AI goes into alert and then calls the search off 5 seconds later because the game realizes you are far, far away and the alerted soldiers would need 5 minutes to get to you, kinda.\nso you can snipe at your hearts content, just wait every so often between shots.\ni have actually cleared an entire level that way. i didnt even move, never got spotted and no one ever knew where the shots came from. \nonce everything was dead, i just visited the objective checkpoints.\n\n- a sniping game that considers shots 100m+ \"Long Shots\" .\n... wut?\n\n- one of the things that bugs me most. dont let the big maps fool you. you only can ever go two ways, on one map 3.\nand finally it doesnt matter which way you go because you have to do all checkpoints anyway, which are both ways.\nthe majority of the map is covered with obstacles and terrain that can not be passed/traversed, forcing you on pre-determined paths.\nits a real themepark where you are forced to go where the developers want you to go. \nit becomes painfully obvious when there are high grass patches strategically placed along your way where the devs think that you should hide there because there you have an opportunity to stealth something for a bit.\nthere really is no freedom of choice when it comes to the map,how you approach things etc.\nall you can do is...left or right? and all guns blazing or try to stay semi-hidden.\nmeeh...\n\n- i remember watching a dev stream that introduced the game ,way before release. i already noticed a DLC button in their alpha client. i knew that was a bad sign...\nright after game release i found half of the items locked for DLCs that havent even been released yet.\ntake that plus very short campaign and below medicore multiplayer and you have zero reason to ever buy any DLC. \njust doesnt make any sense. \nwhy would you, what for?\n\n- releasing a game together with seperate dlcs the same day?\ni didnt expect that from rebellion.\nvery.shabby \n\nnow, having ranted like this....it is not a terrible game all together.\ni had fun while it lasted but it does not justify the price tag,ever.\nit could have been so much more but i guess greed and publisher pressure won at the end.\ni was looking forward to it and left disappointed.\n\nthe ending of the campaign already suggests there will be a sniper elite 5 but this time i shall wait until its on an 85% sale.\n- This game was sunk by poor customer service as well. I at one point lost years worth of items due to a bug. I was told by one of the devs in an email to \"stop button mashing\". My email was nothing but respect and appreciation for a good game where I also simply asked if they could return my bugged items I have earned over the years. \"Stop Button Mashing\"! Really? And now your game is dead. Good work! Piss poor development. Just sad and dissapointed I have over 2k in hours in crap. And yes this game actually is years old it was originally released Jan 2015. At one point we had a good game to play. I believe even the most played game on steam. Then something happened. It became all about crates. F this game. I'm done!\n- Not what the developers promised.\nFeels like a graphics mod for Chivalry.\n\nI'm not a fan of Chivalry either. I had some fun with it, but couldn't bear the clunkiness and wished for intuitive controls and realistic fights. Mordhau promised exactly that. \nAlthough it's equally clunky und even more buggy.\n\nAlso it doesn't offer the option to play in private rooms with your friends (duel mode) or only on paid servers. Inviting a friend to a local match should be a standard feature.\n\nAll the new content and features don't really matter - it's a PvP fighting game. I need only a couple of weapons that work, not 100+ that don't.\n- Really need a report button to slap some senses into trolls in online matches.\nCan't even escape them at ranked. sigh\nGreat game nonetheless, 4/5\n- I have not play for long, but know well enough this game deserves a mention. A side on, survival-ish game set in a war. Now, While I admire this game, it does have a few issues I personally find abnoxious.\nI'll start with those, and then will share what I like about it.\n\n-Characters you play seem to have never stolen anything at all from anyone, ever during the war. This is reflected in how unhappy and whiney they become caring more about the people they have taken from than their own wellbeing.\n\n-Characters you play are too softhearted. Just use the example with the point above. \n\n-Characters are expert carfters for being just average people. How many average people know how to pick locks, make servicable firearms and make alcoholic beverages? Well these three certain are capable of all three and more. For that matter, they all can do everything, but have one special skill they are the better at than the rest.\n\n-You get to only visit one building per night. This is bad since if you chose a building with other survivors in it, you will either need to steal from them to get supplies and be faced with a lot of unhappy complaining, or return home with nothing.\n\n-Visting other survivors, you cannot negotiate with them let alone talk to them. What you can do is beat them to death (or kill them with whatever weapon you happen to have on you at the time). I don't see how this was a good design choice at all when the characters you play are not personally that sort of people. Attacking other survivors is certain to cause problems with your characters.\n\n-You can not relocate from your starting place. What you start with is your base of operations.\n\n-Raids happen frequently to you only. You will never kill raiders, only chase them off and this happens behind the scenes, out of your control, while your character is out scavanging.\n\n-You can not sleep in shifts. If a person sleeps, they sleep the whole night.\n\n-Rediculous resource requirements. Some things require far too much, while others require far too little. \n\n-There is little to none interaction between your characters. No idle chatter between them. \n\n\nNow for the good points.\n-You play 3 characters to begin with, each having one specialty. They somewhat have different personalities.\n\n-The art style appeals to me.\n\n-Characters are well animated. Different staes of tiredness, different things they do when unhappy or when they have nothing else to do.\n\n-The overall idea, even though it isn't implemented well enough.\n\n-Building your shelter from ground up.\n\n-Forgaing and stealth play.\n\n\nSo while i find some issues with this game's design, if you ignore the lack of realism and consider this to be just a game with a very narrow play style, it is quite fine. It has a certain atmosphere you generally don't find elsewhere. I still recommend to give it a try.\n- This game is basically awesome, under 3 conditions:\n\n1- You get rid of all on-screen icons (i.e. incoming attacks, ennemy spotting)\n2- Do not care about secondary missions only here to further lenghten the game's lifespan\n3- Play the game as you would if  YOU were in charge\n\nBasically, nevermind the Ubisoft micro transactions' system and other abhorrent company induced  greed-leaned system to get stuff faster and more easily by robbing you out of your hard-earned cash...you can finish the game without spending a single dime in the store, it's all pay to win...\nThe open-world aspect is very satisfying and rewarding, in terms of progression, don't fall for the micro transaction system\nCombat is easy even in the highest difficulty setting, but makes you think you are badass when you slash through waves of ennemies, whose AI is rather basic, with your arsenal of rockets, LMGs and explosives but it is satisfying as fuck!\n\nImagine strapping C4 to your plane, jump out of it, have it crashing down an ennemy outpost meanwhile you are parachuting down and throwing hand grenades their way, land on a roof and eliminate the remaining ennemies with fire ammo shotgun and a motherfucking M60 with armor-piercing bullets while throwing dynamites and there you have it...FarCry5 in a nutshell\n\nOh and don't forget about the flame-thrower lol, who doesn't love a flame-thrower scorching ennemies to their own demise eh?\n\nFarCry5 got it all, extreme freedom of how you wanna handle a situation (stealthily or all guns blazing) while being challenging enough in the highest difficulty setting!\nP.S. don't forget to turn off all the on-screen icons, really ruins it for hardcore FPS fans by making it extremely easy, please hear me out, you don't need these!\n- Basically Wizard of Legend, but from a different viewpoint. Same composer, both pixel art, similarly fast paced boss fights with good telegraphs, combos are a little less deliberate, though. Very satisfying build making, with solid build variety. Has couch co-op which is very nice. It has some beautiful pixel art, truly. This game is a feast for the eyes and ears with cutscenes, voice acting, and more. Ok, I just love this game. It's so damn good.\n- An excellent maximalist mashup of Slay The Spire with some Tower Defence and CCG Mechanics. Not as tight and elegantly designed as StS, but with a lot more variety in card design leads to a lot more varied and wild interactions and deck composition. Compulsive and mechanically satisfying, Monster Train embraces excess in a satisfying way, even if the whole package is wrapped up in a slightly odd aesthetic package of half remembered hearthstone knock offs. (The soundtrack, incidentally, slaps)\n- 69 % of your time you spend walking around the forest, \nblowing in the animal whistle without actually seeing any animals\n\n10 % of your time you spend carefully approaching the animals you have spotted in the far far away distance\n\n1 % of your time you spend aiming, fireing your gun and missing all the significant organs of the animals\n\nThe last 20 % of your time you spend running after the animals you have wounded without ever seeing them again\n\nMost realistic hunting experience ever\n- Portal is a first person puzzle platformer where you are testing science with portals guided by GLaDOS.\n\nThe game is a classic for a reason. It uses portals as the main puzzle mechanic and combines other mechanics with the portals such as falling and gaining momentum to launch at a higher speed through the other portal. The levels gradually build up with complexity, but are never too frustrating and half of them are done with access to only a single portal. The puzzles have great visual clarity with the mostly white colors and decent visual cues on how it should all work out.\n\nPortal has the classic Valve way of telling stories, as things are already happening before you get there. You are woken up to follow instructions for the testing purposes of GLaDOS, but you are also figuring out if maybe there isn't a role better suited that could fit you. It's an enjoyable mystery leading you on without forcing it's way in.\n\nGoing back from Portal 2 to Portal made me aware of the improvements to the overall gameplay. Exiting through portals in Portal makes the camera rotate in a weird way sometimes and the levels are generally designed to be slower pace than what Portal 2 offers.\n\nIf there is one thing I didn't enjoy, it's the advanced and challenge levels. Figuring the harder puzzles is one part of the challenge, but executing them relied on tight timings where the puzzle mechanics they rely on felt too clunky to be fun.\n\nFor achievement hunters:\nTwo playthroughs are required with 2 sets of collectibles, one of which requires to be done in one go, a few challenges through the story and completing the advanced and challenge levels that can be console cheesed.

Not really.\n\nEdit: Upon completing this game, here's something I'll have to claim in advance: while still recommending this great game with an 8 out of 10 and it has quite a solid story, I'll have to admit  that apart from Dorothy's hidden scenario, this game did not dig very deep into its cyberpunk/dystopian background, which is really a pity - and it's becoming the reason to expect another game (more specifically, A [b]SEQUEL[/b]!!!!! or prequel) from them :)\n\nVA-11 Hall-A - or Valhalla for convenience - while seemingly was a Waifu Bartending Simulation game, is actually somewhat [i]Papers, Please[/i] with excellent characters, vivid graphics, elaborated dialogues and not-so-mind-fucking gaming mechanics.\n\nDon't get me wrong: I love [i]Papers, Please[/i] and of course would rather NOT say that one is superior to another; they are both one of their unique kind, but with the very same root - under the daily life of dystopia denizens, truth and conspiracies weave with vague notices in advance; and just before you could think twice things are going really, really out of track.\n\nThat being said, I mean these two games are very similiar in story-telling: as long as you enjoy taking in all the random, weird stories as a bystander, just to find out that all these fragments come together and form a bigger picture, this game is definitely for you. And you get cyberpunk waifus, a Joshikousei hologram, a pretty cool onêchan as protagonist - and more!\n\nLast but not least, the developers of this game are nothing but truly [b]RESPECTABLE[/b]. We have crybabies on Kickstarter and Steam Early Access every focking day blaming everything for their faulty products, while this army of two whined [b]NOTHING[/b] about all the fuck-ups in Venezuela unless asked. Game dalayed? Only apologies, no excuses. That deserves a huge fricking medal and Developer of The Year.\n\nGrab the game if you want some real relax and good story before they grab Dorothy. And support the developers! They deserve this, Dorothy deserves this.\n- Just look at my game time if you wanna know how passionate I am about this game\n- The demo was a lot of fun and the early access launch game which is more of that  was a lot of fun big surprise!\n\nOverall I would really recommend this game if you loved or enjoyed games like Warstride Challenges, Neon White, Speedrunners From Hell and other games with a focus on very short concise levels that are made for speedrunning. I will say while it looks off in the trailers the gun controls pretty nicely in the game no complaints there for me with this style of game. \n\n\nWhat I liked\n\n-controls feel great and very fast, you always feel in control and everything including enemies are very visible and have extra outline to help highlight them when in hectic combat\n\n- most levels are just the right length to not feel like you complete them before you even start them but not tedious to retry to get a better ranking\n\n-much improved optimization and performance wise from the demo, even on my laptop not really made for gaming got a easy 100 fps if I put all settings on low\n\n-Ranking system is pretty cool, you get extra points if you kill enemies, head shot them for critical damage, if you never get hit etc and more and of course ranked on time. There is a separate ranking for total points so say for killing a lot of enemies and in a row and then a separate ranking just for times for levels\n\n- Enemy A.I seems improved form the demo and they try to roll out of the way of gunfire or go behind kinda cover from the environments at times.This isn't a big thing since your flying through levels super fast anyway but nice to see\n\n-Decent number of standard guns and they are fun to use without trivializing using telekinesis and vice versa\n\n-Some stages focus on a large arena to fight waves of enemies and others don't so feels like game has decent level variety/variety in obstacles in levels\n\n-okay variety of enemies to fight so far\n\n-kinda humorous the odd time and there are stupid items to pick up with telekinesis and use like a live rat, a toy hammer, giant tennis ball etc.\n\n- telekinesis feels very seamless fast and fun/easy to use in combat, chucking random objects at enemies its a lot of fun\n\n- most levels are open enough to allow multiple paths to get through levels and you can usually skip fighting some enemies if you want to only go for a faster time in most levels \n\n\n\nSome Suggestions/Issues I had\n\n-maybe I missed it but no instant retry button if I want to retry a level instantly but haven't died\n\n-boss difficulty kinda feels a bit all over the place although there is not much boss fights, first boss feels way too easy, second one was fun and maybe just right although maybe on the side of   too easy from not having enough health \n\n-the second last level in this launch early access version \"\"\"\"\"stealth\"\"\"\"\"\" feels far too long and far too hard and full of way too much elite enemies and then it even has a boss fight to do in it too in the level all in one go without ever stop moving! \n\n-just a note when I played the demo version before the last boss fight in that felt like it should have either been a level with just the enemies and then a second separate level with a arena for the  boss fight not both that you have to do in the one attempt in a bigger level just kinda tedious imo\n\n-music isn't bad here but it feels like there is very little music and the music that is there kinda blends together a lot\n\n-hopefully this game can develop a big following community and maybe get a level editor down the line!\n\n-feels like you go in the 2 second slow motion mode when getting a critical hit on a  enemy or breaking glass a good bit too much in levels.\n\n- would be nice down the line to get bonus challenge levels, shorter much more difficult ones like how NeonWhite and War stride Challenges have bonus levels \n\n- for replay value might be nice to have 3 unique goals for a level e.g beat the level in under 40 seconds, only kill a certain number of enemies, kill no enemies etc.This is kinda in the game but levels don't seem to have specific or unique extra goals its the same ones for every level.\n\n- not a complaint but maybe later add a grapple hook, grapple hooks are always fun in first person shooters!\n- [h1][u]Wonderful game with a great battle system, but terrible netcode[/u][/h1]\n\n[h2]Foreword[/h2]\nI got to know \"Naraka: Bladepoint\" through a friend.\nAt first I was very skeptical, so I only bought the Standard Edition, and later the Ultimate and Deluxe Editions.\nFirst of all, this game has a steep learning curve with its battles.\nExactly why the game may not be suitable for everyone.\nUnfortunately, that doesn't make the playerbase any better, but read more about that below.\nNevertheless, the game and especially the combat system offers a lot of potential and has a lot of posivites to offer.\n\n[h2]Positives[/h2]\n[list]\n[*]Regular updates with ever increasing content\n[*]Few to almost no bugs and if they are, then they are fixed very quickly\n[*]Steep learning curve - Especially at the beginning the game is not easy, but you can quickly get into it with friends\n[*]Pleasant graphics\n[*]Nice sound design, which is location dependent\n[*]Potential to grind for higher ranks and for the Hall of Fame\n[*]Different game modes and events\n[*]Extremely extensive combat system - many possibilities to conter weapons\n[*]Extensive stats, either ingame or with Naraka+ mobile app (app is absolutely top!)\n[*]Well thought through character designs\n[*]Extremely individual character editor - From Thanos to Bruce Lee everything is customizable.\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Neutral[/h2]\n[list]\n[*]Climbing system - It's really good compared to other games. However, you still sometimes get stuck on edges or can't get to the platforms above.\n[*]Microtransactions - I'm personally not a fan of them, but it's not a must in this game and doesn't favor anyone.\n[*]Answers of Discord team members very questionable on some questions\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Negatives[/h2]\n[list]\n[*]Terrible netcode - players with highpings are treated preferentially\n[*]Few European players - Extremely many VPN players with many different Asian characters and languages in the voicechat\n[*]Voicechat is not well thought through\n[*]Partial performance losses\n[*]Ranking matches are partly wrong - Either with new players (Bronze) or experienced players (Asura)\n[*]Partially bad English, as well as German translation\n[*]Some abilities are combined absolutely disgusting and unfortunately more or less meta\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Review written out[/h2]\nNaraka has become a real love-hate relationship game for me.\nI love the extensive combat system and also the steep learning curve from noob to a slightly experienced player. (I am Platinum 1 - Solar 5 at the time of this review).\nSo while the combat system could be frustrating at times at first, I love it all the more now.\nOnly the climbing system, as well as some combinations of abilities or ultimates could be revised.\nFor example, it is common practice (meta) that many players use Ultimates that stun and ensure that you immediately get into the next Ultimate.\nThis is sometimes a bit frustrating, because these combinations are played very often and other heroes, especially the new ones, are not really played because of it. \nHowever, you can work around these combinations or counter them yourself. Unfortunately, this is not always easy, especially for new players.\n(For example, the combination of Valda - Viper - Tianhai).\nHowever, a victory and the killing of opponents, especially higher ones, with whom you are unfortunately sometimes matched, releases a lot of endorphins in Naraka, so that a victory feels extremely rewarding.\n\nUnfortunately, this brings me to the part that makes it extremely difficult for me to decide on a positive rating for this game.\nThe game, for being released in 2021, has a horrible netcode for a martial arts battle royale game.\nThere are extremely many Asian players who connect directly or via VPN to the europian servers.\nThis is especially noticeable when you activate the voice chat, which by the way, has no individual regulation for volume or a mute function per player.\nUnfortunately, those players have a ping beyond 150ms.\nSadly, this is a big problem for people with low latency.\nYou partly punch through enemies bodies.\nVarious focus attacks are therefore not always blockable or the opponent lags at you, while the player for himself has no lags at all.\nThis is not only unfair, but should actually no longer be a problem in 2022.\nFor example, it would be enough to not let players with a ping greater than 150ms/200ms move.\nAccording to the Discord community manager, there is a region lock and most of the names are just \"memes\" . \nBut you don't notice anything about the region lock in the game and we can theoretically connect to other servers.\n\nAnother big problem is the matchmaking.\nEven with Bronze or Silver, you are matched with Asura players when there is a lack of players.\nThis is not necessarily nice, but you get a lot of points for survival and you also learn a lot of techniques.\n\nAs negative as this all sounds, the game still gets a positive rating from me.\nI love the sound design, which comes into its proper place in the battles and is different for each location on the map.\nThis reminds me of Prince of Persia in some areas and provides more excitement in fights.\nIn addition, the varied battles, no matter how hopeless they sometimes seem, are all the more rewarding if you win.\nEspecially when you're killing another team, consisting of 3 people, as the last survivor of your team.\nThe map design is also absolutely great. Every location has been carefully thought through. \nGreat lighting design really highlights some of the locations.\nYou can overlook small bugs like misplaced branches (a branch hangs in the air next to a tree).\n\nBut my favorite part is the grinding to a higher rank. \nThe ranking system and especially the Hall of Fame encourage you to play.\nGetting into the top 100 of a much-played character feels very rewarding.\nSo does slaying a moonbane.\n\n[h2]Epilogue[/h2]\nAll in all, despite the flaws, Naraka has a lot going for it, and even though the larger issues can be extremely frustrating, the game saves itself with the extensive battle system, the incredibly great locations including sound design, and the extensive ranking system including Hall of Fame.\nI love the game because of the thoughtful little things, even if I hate it extremely at times.\n\nEven though the game can quickly become frustrating for new players, you should be aware that it has a lot to offer if you are willing to learn.\nThe accompanying app is an extremely well thought through and great gimmick in this regard.\n\nI would be happy to take you by the hand and introduce you to the game.\nJust visit us on our [URL=https://discord.nox-eagles.de]Discord[/URL].\n\nI would like to thank all of you who have read my review until the end.\nI'm looking forward to your opinions :)\nWith best regards\nYour Holt\n- A new game from Zeboyd, you know I'm there! And this was such a fun game\n\nThis game is about as long as Cthulhu Saves Christmas and it's just as Linear. However given their statement on this video, that's meant to be the point these days.\n\nThe Graphics for the main game are basic but it's fitting for the Genre. Also they have dropped the random battles with on screen monsters to avoid if you want to not fight (And you still have the option to start a battle through the main menu). The fighting system is identical to CSC too which I've enjoyed but I can understand those who may not like it. The Animation for the transformations are incredible...except I'm always stuck watching them every single time which can get very tedious.\n\nThe story is clever, and they provide \"Translations\" for the Ole English of Shakespeare...but a lot of the translations are jokes and very silly ones at that.\n\nThere isn't a LOT of replay value but you will enjoy the story enough you'll want to play it again eventually.\n\nThere is no New Game Plus mode...yet but given how they patched it into CSC later on I'm certain they're do that here eventually.\n\nI say the game is incredible for the price range and is entertaining for all ages.\n\n\nVIDEO REVIEW: https://youtu.be/wuw9pJPowqM\n- The demo was a lot of fun and the early access launch game which is more of that  was a lot of fun big surprise!\n\nOverall I would really recommend this game if you loved or enjoyed games like Warstride Challenges, Neon White, Speedrunners From Hell and other games with a focus on very short concise levels that are made for speedrunning.

I think the progression of the tower abilities and gold gain is great, but even the burdens available don’t seem to switch it up quite enough. I’m on ng+4 and i feel like it’s getting a tad stale. I still like playing it of course. Some classes like the chef make the idea of playing anything else not quite worth it. I’m sure there’s some great niche builds but keep that in mind. Overall, this game keeps you on your toes. If you get hit, it’s almost always because you did something wrong. I LOVE the movement abilities in this game. You can feel like a speed runner with a few hours of practice gliding and jumping. This is a completely different game compared to rogue legacy 1 in all the best ways. 9/10\n- Ever wanted to be a futuristic dual wielding samurai drummer with a penchant for slicing boxes? No? You didn't even know that was a thing? Well you will after playing this. \n\nProbably the most satisfying rhythm game out there, Beat Saber turns sword thrusts into dance. With notes expertly timed to the music and directional swipes that lead smoothly into each other creating an almost choreographed flow, you will find yourself naturally completing songs and feeling boss after every single track.\n\nWith a choice of difficulty settings and a huge array of modifiers, it is accessible to many skill levels and makes it perfect for newcomers, parties or just to simply show off VR, while remaining a huge challenge for those who wish to test themselves on the most hardcore difficulties.\n\nBeat Saber is a game that probably should be on the radar of any VR user, as it's pretty visuals and reliance on your motions makes it a perfect fit for VR. If you don't have this game I highly recommend you pick it up, as when you do, you may just find it hard to put it down.\n\nNow if you will excuse me, I have a few more hardcore songs I have to embarrass myself attempting.\n- [h2] Visual Novel Reviews [/h2]\n\n[b] TLDR [/b] Two scenes, no customization, no choices, character development needs work, but the Extremely short story delivered (If you know what I mean) a whopping 38 minutes of game play for me. \n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [th]Question[/th]\n        [th]Answer[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Buy Again[/td]\n        [td]No, I wouldn't.

Don't buy it - don't even think of buying this crappy Master Piece.\nIt's not worth it, to be honest.\nI played it for almost 200 Hours. And it's awful. Never saw a Game with these bugs, with these massive salty Community. There exactly 0 Bugfixes, so many exploits, the horrible earbleeding intro, the Community that is pure Cancer, the horrible Graphic that looks like it's straight out of the Kindergarten and the huge amount of Bugs. Bugs are normal, but MAN there are Bugs everywhere! I mean, yeah the Hype was real, but now i wish i could refund this crap.\nNever had to dream about uninstalling a game before.\nI mean, the Devs. are just Human like you and me - but honestly - never saw someone who failed his job like this.\nJust do me a favor, don't buy it. It's not worth the Ragequits, the broken Keyboards, the Heartattacks and it's definitely not the Money worth!\nNever want to touch it again.\n\nAnd btw. thank you for killing the Sealmothers and making the babyseals crying bloody sad little Tears. </3\n- [h1]AT A GLANCE[/h1]\n(Full review follows below)\n\n[list]\n[*] [b]Game Name:[/b] The Swapper\n[*] [b]Original Release:[/b] 2013\n[*] [b]Genre Tags:[/b] Atmospheric; 2D; Puzzle-Platformer; Sci-Fi \n[*] [b]My Overall Grade:[/b] A-\n[*] [b]Estimated Playtime (Campaign):[/b] 3-5 hours\n[*] [b]Multiplayer Aspect:[/b] None\n[*] [b]Recommended To:[/b] Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Aesthetes; Game atmosphere connoisseurs; Strong narrative advocates; Puzzle game aficionados\n[/list]\t\n\n[h1]REVIEW[/h1]\n[b]The Swapper[/b] is an enjoyable 2D puzzle-platformer that lacks gameplay innovation but rises above the crowd on the shoulders of its superbly well-designed atmosphere and provocative narrative.  The actual puzzle-solving aspect of the game is adequate, but with minimal diversity and accretion.  It is definitely a story-driven experience, with the gameplay taking a passenger seat.  If you can appreciate a game in that style, this is a good bet for you. \n\nThe entrancing narrative and the style in which it transpires work in concert with the mystifying ambiance to create a wondrous experience. The story touches on some thought-provoking metaphysical issues, while skillfully avoiding a fall too deep into the rabbit hole to keep the average person’s interest. Much of the rest of the narrative is comfortable, cliché sci-fi tropes that we all know and love.\n\nThe gameplay and the puzzles are far from [i]bad[/i], but they also are nothing special.  As I alluded to: they are sufficient, but fail to develop into anything overly interesting. Very little changes from the first puzzle to the last, so it does get a little bit dry.  That said, some of the later ones are quite tricky and a few require not only puzzle-solving ability but also decent reflexes. \n\nThe graphics are pleasurable and align perfectly with the vibe of the game. But the whole soundscape is what truly brings the atmosphere of [b]The Swapper[/b] to life. The ambient soundtrack, the cryptic chatter, and the selectively placed voice-overs contribute a wonderful blend of emotions and mystery. If you are into it, this is a game you might enjoy with the lights off and your headphones on (or however else you may get into the zone).  \n\n[b]The Swapper[/b] is a brief, interesting, and enjoyable experience. It is not a complex or intricate puzzle-platformer, but I recommend it to any fan of the genre who would appreciate the atmosphere and narrative.\n\n[i][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/murphyslawyercuration#curation]Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations![/url][/i]\n- First thing you see when the game loads is \"You have to buy the game to blahblah\", as i didn't know there was a paid version, i felt betrayed. Anyway,\nSorry, i tried it, not expecting much, but there was not much from it..\n-Graphics are bad\n-Movement and animation are clunky, same with attacking\n-Zombie AI would hit you even if you walked backwards 2 seconds ago\n-Regions are EU and NA, multiple servers each with a PVE server, but it was so empty.\n-Gameplay-wise.... so many questions like, \"Why do i need to hold E for 5 seconds to open a fridge?\", \"Why does headshot being counted but it doesnt insta-kill a basic zombie?\", \"Why does the soldier npc's look like they are making money from you?\", and lasty \"What the heck is the goal of this game?\"\n-Oh and driving vehicles SUCK! *ehem*\n\nSorry NOPE\n- 5 game difficultys Easy Normal Nemesis Gravewalker Brutal... so whitch one im supposed to play for it to be like the first game(which dident have a difficulkty, jst like awesome games like Gta 4 and assassins creed)???

I enjoyed F1 2020, and this is just that game with the latest cars, slightly updated graphics (ray tracing etc) and a story mode that I found fun, but its about 5 hours of entertainment max. The coop career mode is nice, I enjoy racing with friends. The racing is fun and close when difficulty is tunes, and I enjoy the act of just driving around in this (though some of the kerbs can get knotted).\n\nBig issue is the VIP pass thing, and the attitude it shows. It's even more egregious than F1 2020 - it's front and centre, with some more categories of items to dilute your experience further. By default there are very limited customisation options (even compared with F1 2020), so you might be even more tempted to part with an extra £9 or so just to get the VIP pass. On top of the £55 already spent, with EAs regional pricing making it far more expensive in some areas. That's just grubby. I'm fine with XP based unlocks, but paying for additional cosmetic items in a game like this is predatory and exploitative.\n\nDon't reward them for this. \n\nGet the game if you feel the price is worth it for the story mode and the coop career mode, and you are fortunate enough to have the disposable income. I am, and I did, but it doesn't feel like I got my money's worth this year, to be honest.\n- An excellent maximalist mashup of Slay The Spire with some Tower Defence and CCG Mechanics. Not as tight and elegantly designed as StS, but with a lot more variety in card design leads to a lot more varied and wild interactions and deck composition. Compulsive and mechanically satisfying, Monster Train embraces excess in a satisfying way, even if the whole package is wrapped up in a slightly odd aesthetic package of half remembered hearthstone knock offs. (The soundtrack, incidentally, slaps)\n- Very fun game. Best wave shooter on the market that I've ever seen. The roguelike nature of it is very fun. Each run hits you with different challenges in building your weapons.\n\nBiggest critiques - \n1. Achievements locked behind multiplayer in a dead game. God I hate when devs do this. It luckily lets you play through normal mode when queuing, but its still very annoying. The last achievement I needed was \"get to wave 50 of multiplayer gauntlet mode\". I've so far been able to play 2 games of multiplayer. One, my partner had no voice coms. Second, my partner started with extremely staticy voice coms and it cut out at about wave 5. We pushed through to wave 48. Aaaaaaaaaand network error. It took about an hour and a half to get that far just for the game to crash and lose it all. Devs, please stop hiding achievements behind multiplayer when you know full well your game won't have a huge online player base.\n\n2. You get TWO GUN ARMS! This is AMAZING AND AWESOME! Except for the fact that a ton of the attachments for your weapons affect every part on your gun. So by not just making one super mega death arm, you are effectively chopping your total strength into two parts. There are a few pieces that only give you buffs for \"dual wielding\" or having a firing barrel on each arm. But these are not very common, and the stats you get from them pale in comparison to just making a super gun on one arm and keeping the other arm clenched for punching enemies that get up to your face, or putting on a single melee weapon on the other hand for the same purpose. \n\n3. The variety of guns is fun, but in the end it ends up turning into \"hold the fire button, aim for enemies, walk in a circle to trick enemy aim as best as possible, and occasionally punch an enemy that gets to you\". The biggest change to this system is getting either the rocket launcher or the Barrel Barrel which shoots massive barrels at the enemies. They have a very slow fire rate and do best when aiming the shots more precisely. But even then, with some weapons having a spooling time, and others outputting a hale of bullets, the best strategy is to just keep the trigger held 24/7 and strafe your aim from enemy to enemy.\n\nI really enjoyed my time with this game, but don't try to 100% it. The multiplayer achievement isn't worth it. Network is terrible. There's too much going on on screen when you have 2 players in the mix so crashing is likely. If I were the Completionist I would give this game a rating of Finish It. Play through the game with all the unique starting bonuses, all the difficulties. But stay away from multiplayer unless you have a friend to dedicate multiple hours to trying the gauntlet with.\n- This review only relates to the single player campaign. At 50 years old I have zero interest in multiplayer.\n\nAfter playing Gears of War 4, I was looking forward to this title. I wasn't disappointed. I found the new upgrade system with Jack enjoyable. The campaign was fun to play with minor exceptions. Graphics, sound, and voice acting were amazing. Campaign took me about 11 hours to beat. I consider that well worth the $60 I paid for the game.\n\nMy only real gripe about the single player campaign:  As a father of 3 girls, I'm all for strong female leading characters. Kait just isn't it, though. I didn't care for her in 4 and that didn't change in 5. For me she seems out of her league and just isn't believable as a team member. She's like Elizabeth Swan, the governor's daughter in Pirates of the Caribbean. She's a kidnapped damsel in distress in one movie, and the Pirate King in the next. It just doesn't work, for me anyway.\n- I'm gonna give this a thumbs up but with like, idk, a cautionary sideways thumb for maybe. \n\nif I read credits right, it looks like this game had all its programming, art, music, and writing done by one guy, so I have to give respect to that. For a real indie game like this, it's very very good. \n\nBut it's still really flawed. If you're looking for a 2D Metroid game, and you've played EVERY other 2D metroid game, I suppose yeah, go for this one, and I think you'll enjoy it. If you're not a fan of metroid, I would not bother, sadly. This game suffers from a lot of problems from metroid games, and does not fix any, and at times exagerates those problems. \n\nThe art style is very interesting and cool, but the way the levels and map design are, leaves most areas feeling like a mess of unmemorable places. \n\nThe combat is INCREDIBLY simplistic, yet somehow bogged down by WAY too many useless weapons and just kind of badly designed controls. I found there were about 5 weapons that were actually useful in the game out of what seems like more than 10. Most enemies you either cheese, or be cheesed. There's no charge up shots, there's not really much nuance to the enemies or bosses. They have about two attacks and repeat while you dodge the same one bullet pattern and just kind of shoot in their general direction. (I played it on hard by the way. Not a particularly difficult game, but even the slightly challenging stuff felt kind of dull and uninteresting.) \n\nThe music was cool again. nothing quite mind blowing, but it was nice. The world itself seems like a mess, but there are cool ideas. The giant robot people were really cool to see. \n\nOne little idea i really liked is that the LOW HEALTH beep sound is actually in sync with every song in the game. I thought that was really cute, and it's not something I've seen any game do. Sounds dumb, but I give a lotta props to that, it was cool. \n\nWriting is okay. I feel it left more to be desired. There seemed to be an interesting world here that wasn't explored enough. It wasn't bad, I suppose, but not really that great. \n\nThat is kind of this game. It's not bad by any means, but not the best game on the planet. Play it if you're in need of a Metroid game, and I'm certain you will be pleased enough despite the flaws. Even if you're just having a hankering for a platformer and have already played Hollow Knight and some other great ones first, I think you should enjoy this, but don't expect a 10/10 game. \n\nGive it a try if you feel it looks interesting.\n- F2P update: Hey it's free now! STDs are free - avoid it.\n\nIt was great at the start, I put many hours into it. \n\nAaaand now it's aggressively monetised, forces all this microtransaction garbage on you, battle pass rubbish, skins, emotes, crates, more than one premium currency.\n\nAND they have the gall to ask £26.99 RRP for this? $30 to have the privilege of paying more money.\n\nMake it free at this point, you want to be Fortnite so bad.\n\nYou either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.\n- If 'Baba is You' and 'The Witness' are the puzzle game equivalents to a full-course meal, then Patrick's Parabox is a fluffy dessert that you just can't put down. It's full of bite-sized puzzles that rarely repeat themselves, instead iterating and expanding upon each other as you learn all of the tricks and mechanics the game has to offer. A delight to the very last bite.\n\nIf you're looking to be challenged then there's plenty of that too, but not as much as you'd find in a typical sokobon game. With that said there [i]is[/i] some Level Editor support so the potentials there for dastardly custom levels ;P\n- Good lord, do we have a Game of the Year 2017 candidate here or WHAT?\n\nA million twin stick shooters have come and gone over the years since Robotron.  Many have compared themselves and failed.\n\nEugene Jarvis is the creative consultant on this title - so if anything has some \"spirit of Robotron\" in it - this is the game.\n\nThe game is Robotron + Gauntlet with a bunch of secrets rolled in.  As will all good twich arcade games, greed plays a central part in the game.  If you just want to mindlessly blast your way through the worlds - you can.  But you will not be rewarded for it.\n\nScoring high in this game is all about the multiplier - and the multiplier is all about saving humans (which can be harder than it sounds).  You have to chain your pickups of humans to get the highest multiplier.\n\nYou'll bring some great weaponry along the way; Rocket Launchers, Laser beams, smart bombs - even a melee sword.  Powershot is my fav :)\n\nAlong with the regular crew of bad guys,  you'll have special things to find and destroy too.\n\nCROSS PLATFORM leaderboards and local co-op play seal the deal.  Throw in a much of mini-achivements (feats) and you'll be so damn hooked on this game.\n\nIf you love twin stick twich arcade games?  Don't even think about it - BUY NOW.\n- If Disco Elysium is a meditation on lost futures and the value of self destruction, Norco answers with an indictment that we might be inhabiting the end times and should hold on regardless. Every scene and character portrait is a painstaking work of art that works along with the dreamy soundtrack to draw you into the gorgeous, hazy bible belt setting. The point and click gameplay is straightforward (and at times a little overbearing with handholding), with small minigame sections to mix things up somewhat, but rewards interacting with the world and the people in it to uncover another small truth about it. I don't think I've come across anything that quite captures the sense of melancholy and unease that dominates the current moment in the 20s.\n- Not saying this as a tough guy thing or anything, But it is difficult for me to shed actual tears.\n\nThis game made me ugly cry twice, and happy cry once.\n\nThis not a story about zombies.\n\nIt is about a little girl growing up in the worst possible situation.\n\nAnd what she makes of it.\n\n2/13/2023 finished\n\nPS: If I ever have a daughter I will name her Clementine. This is the tier of impact this game had on me we are talking about.\n- Think you’re good at racing? Well, this game will give you a RKO.\n\nI don’t even know much about rally when I bought the game. I just see cars driving at dirt, weaving steering left and right constantly, and thought it looks cool. \n\nThis game is HARD. The learning curve is really steep. The first time I played, I constantly fly off a cliff and hug into trees. Because i don’t understand what my co driver is reading. He talk so fast that my tiny brain couldn’t process in time, sometimes I’m so confused that I go straight in junction because I can’t remember he said turn left or right. The cars are constantly out of control. \n\nAfter I learned about weight transfers that I’m able to start utilizing oversteer into corners. No more cripple into finish line with two tyres missing, that’s when the fun begins. Dirt Rally 2.0 is different from other racing games. You don’t race against other drivers, instead you race against time. If you turn off the hud, then it’s only you and the road, and TREES :)\n\nThe sound of the gravel hitting under your car. Dirt stained on your car as you progress through out the stage. The pops and bang coming out of exhaust when you shift. These combination feels somehow relaxing and satisfying at the same time.\n\nThe only downside of Dirt Rally 2.0 is that it requires constant internet connection, even when most of its content are single player. I wouldn’t complain if the server is stable. But sadly it isn’t. The server down happen quite frequently. Imagine you feel like you completed a 10 minutes perfect run, no crashes or mistakes. But then the game refuses to connect to the server. So the game won’t record your progress. It’s like a big middle finger to the player. \n\nI could make this review a thumbs down solely for the “always online” requirement, cuz it makes the player experience kinda inconsistent, but the gameplay itself does make up for it though. I mean when it works, it works remarkably well.\n\nApart from always online issue. Dirt Rally 2.0 is fantastic, the handling, physics, graphics etc. everything is on point. If you’re interested, buy the GOTY edition, it easily double the contents of the original game had. Worth every single cents.\n- On the Steam Store page for [i]Candle[/i] I saw:\n\n1. The game's description: \"Candle is an adventure with challenging puzzles.\"\n2. The 5 most popular tags for the game: Indie, Adventure, Hand-Drawn, Puzzle & Fantasy\n3. The beautiful screenshots\n4. The 'very positive' reviews\n\nSo I bought it. I should have actually read some of the reviews, though. It turns out [i]Candle[/i] is just another platformer game. Granted, it's a \"puzzle-platformer\" but still a platformer where agility, dexterity and a lot of trial & error are key to finishing the game, although there is some light puzzling involved, as well. I don't like platformers. I also don't like pixel hunting for items, which is what you need to do in [i]Candle[/i] to find all the items you need to advance. You see, some items are almost absorbed in the background and frustratingly hard to spot. So there will be a lot of backtracking, unless you follow a guide, which then kills part of the fun anyway.\n\n[b]In summary, just a friendly warning: if you think [i]Candle[/i] is a beautiful point & click adventure game, like I did, don't be fooled. It's actually a beautiful, frustrating platformer game with some light puzzling.[/b]\n- ooooh im pigging out\n\njust like the original risk of rain but significantly more approachable!\n\nthey added controls, chris christododoldoaul and a bunch of retextures, got rid of that gup blackface enemy\nawesome\n\nthanks poopoo games for the review copy\n\n(spoilers ahead)\n\nincluding the mastery skins and void fiend from risk of rain 2 was an awesome surprise, nice to see so much new content\n\nonly complaint is the 100 dillar price tag for the game but otherwise a must buy\n\nUPDATE!!!\n\nAfter further playing, i have many very genuine issues! These providence trials are IM POSSIBBLE! the critreriar are simply absurd, and drifter is practically unplayable in his current state!!!\n\ni have also found a MULTITUDTE of vines allowing me to clip out of bounds?!?!?!? how did this game get past play testing TWICE\n\ni am not fibbing when i say this game in in an unacceptable state, how is this not in early access?! ridiculous, genuinely. gearbox! how could you\n- When 'Papers, Please' goes online. The game is similar. You make a judgement on the item based on the state regulation and/or some task given to you. The game is really in early stage but foundation of game mechanic is already laid and can be expanded for more challenge. \n\nThe US$5 & under price tag is fair enough for this early game. I already have the gameplay videos uploaded, you guys make a choice to buy or not. I wish I could choose 'neither' recommend this game, the game is not bad or good for me given its current version.\n\nPlaylist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2dyX3SxPgukmvyL31uQNpfXtaeVXNV3R\n\nEDIT1: Decided to change this to \"not recommended\" due to uncertain future development of this game.\n- A very good recursive Sokoban.

Gameplay, as always, consists of somewhat linear FPS combat with a \"genetic\" progression advancement system that lets you upgrade your abilities through \"splicing\" \"plasmids\".  This gives you somewhat supernatural abilities to augment the more traditional shooting of enemies with guns that we all enjoy from FPS games.  There's also the usual gamut of minigames, with a carnival theme to them. \n\nFrom the technical perspective, even though this is getting a little old, it's a AAA game and it shows.  Everything gamers expect is delivered here in terms of visual tweaks, control customisation, 4K support and a lot of graphics fine tuning options to allow gamers to experience a perfectly optimised experience.  There's not much else to say when developers get it right!  The visuals are equally top notch. \n\nWhile a great technical implementation is a must, and a minimum requirement for a recommendable game, of course Bioshock Infinite goes beyond that to deliver a masterpiece story that will leave gamers hooked, and perhaps a little bereft once it's over, but that's how all great stories should be.\n\nBioshock Infinite is a must-play for fans of narrative FPS games, although I do recommend trying Bioshock 1 & 2 first.  It's not required, but just like you wouldn't enjoy it as much if you watched Return of the Jedi first, you should try the first two episodes of Bioshock before the third one.\n- Honestly I don't think I've ever cried so much over one game.  This is definitely one of the best narrative driven RPG maker games ever made - it has everything you could want.  It has beautiful art, beautiful music, wonderful narration, it's atmospheric, great characters, meaningful choices, a story of overcoming hardships similar to a real life instead of just a story, and the ending I got was beautiful! I have only played the game once but the game has a lot of different branching paths with choices really making a large difference in the game.  This game will always have a special place in my heart.\n- Great Game, but 70 dollars for a game that was console exclusive for years, then released exclusive to Epic, and finally released to Steam. Don't be greedy Enix.\n- Wow. Just wow. This is BY FAR the best visual novel i have played. the old school forums and cameras feel very detailed as whenever anything happens in a video chat, no matter how small, the characters react to it. the story was very enthralling and every time i slipped up and made a wrong move, my heart would feel as though it was gonna beat out of my chest. talking to violet felt very real and made the ending that i got so much more satisfying. the only bad things i can even say about this absolute masterpiece is just the fact that most of the really impact full options were locked because \"Emmett isn't cocky enough\" or  \"Emmett isn't compassionate enough\" which felt very vague and confining.\n\noverall the game is absolutely amazing and i wish the devs would come out with a game similar to this because of how good it was.\n9/10\n- So, I only found this game because my favorite Vtuber Miilkywayz on Twitch played it. It seemed pretty interesting but when she started making her own cards. As an IRL witch I was WAY more interested. The game itself is great, I love making cards and learning their meanings and seeing how how the story changes changes based on your deck and the cards drawn. And the replaybility of it is amazing given its price. 10/10 from me. Need more games like this.\n- [b] Target Audience: [/b] [I] Anyone with a Soul[/i]\n\n[b] Summary: [/b]  \n\nIt's a damn shame that this game isn't topping people's game of the year list this year, because Wandersong is one of the best story based experiences that I've played on Steam. A game that is beautiful woven from start to end, every element works together in harmony to make what will be a cult classic in my mind: and only a cult classic due to the fact that it should be a blockbuster, but won't get the recognition. The 3 man team took an upbeat story of a young bard on a whismical journey and \nmade someone who usually gravitates toward more depressing/out there stories and fall in love with the Bard, Miriam, and the vast cast of characters here. \n\nThe funny thing is, it's hard to quantify what makes Wandersong such a complete package, because everything works in harmony so well with everything else. Take the music for example: I actually struggled to specifically remember any individual track at first, and that's because the games tracks are so tied to the emotions that you feel during scenes. You are the music in how you play through your game, you experience this game how you want, and it's singing mechanic that alters the world aroudn you allows you to be the player you want to be while still staying in a relatively linear story line. The color and presentation is fantastic, the gameplay mechanics stay just long enough before changing up, it's hard to really think of anything that the game did wrong.\n\nLook, even those who may hate games with less “gameplay” will most likely be charmed by Wandersong's spell. It's a siren of sorts: except it'll make you crash into jagged rocks of love and happiness. Story elements feel earned. Everything has very specific detail. It's clear this was a labor of love, and it shows even in the scene select: where the splooshes by the team just make you smile. You will sit and wonder about your own life after playing certain sections, and the club scene is one of the best set pieces I've seen in character development. Honestly, I really struggle to think of negatives for the game: each thing has a purpose and is there for a specific reason, and executes it beautifully. \n\nIf you're reading this review, it's because you're considering buying the game. Do it. Do it now. It's worth it.\n\n[b]Video Review: [/b] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ycIvIVfblk\n\n[u] Lists: [/u]\n[b]Positives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Oozes charm and love.\n[*] A fantastic buddy story that is great from start to finish.

Even when i did get mad, which was a lot, I never stayed mad for long. There is just far too much to enjoy about the game. The art style is just simply amazing, the movement of your character around the world is just so satisfying once you get used to it, the puzzles aren't too easy or too hard, and everything in the game just goes together pretty much perfectly. All in all this game is extremely well made. Would recommend buying if you want a super unique experience 11/10\n- I really, really wanted to like this game.\n\nI preface this review by saying that Guacamelee 1 is in my top 10 games of all time. I've been a gamer for 33 years. Sotn, Chrono Trigger, and FFVII are my go-tos. G-Melee 1 is a charming and original romp through a metroidvania style genre.\n\nGuacamelee 2 fails so ridiculously hard, it actually makes me sad when I think about it. The puzzles are uninspired, the abilities don't really feel enjoyable, and the platforming elements are just unforgivingly tight for the sake of it. I had all the \"schools\" maxed out before the end, it didnt make me feel any more powerful. I didn't have that super saiyan mode like in GM 1.\n\nThe final bossfight is a 3/10 compared to the first game where it is at BARE MINIMUM 9/10.\n\nI wish I could rank this game higher because I adore the original. However, this became a slog several hours before I could finish it. I would not recommend this to anyone, ever. It's light on the humor and story, it requires you to be invested in the previous game. The mechanics aren't new and they threw in some unnecessary tight, like razor thin, platforming into the game.\n- I'm seeing a new trend in gaming here: A studio wants to port an oldie but goodie to consoles, so polishes it up a bit, releases the new version on console and gives it as a free upgrade to the PC boys. It benefits everyone, but don't get too excited.\n\nIt's not a stunning remaster, because Mark of the Ninja looked damn good to begin with. To this end, everything only got tweaked a [i]bit[/i]. The backgrounds are a [i]bit[/i] more detailed, the cutscenes are a [i]bit[/i] sharper and more fluid-moving, the lighting effects have a [i]bit[/i] more dynamic range, and the resolution is a [i]bit[/i] better. Less a remaster and more a cleanup. Most of the changes are so subtle and detailed you won't even find them by actively looking for them, but they're there.\n\nIt costs exactly the same as the special edition of the original, and includes the SE content, and if you already own the original's SE, you get the remaster for free. So basically, if you want the full MotN package, there's no reason not to pick this up. I'm just playing through it mostly because Mark of the Ninja is a kickass game with or without 4K. There is no downside to picking this up if you want the base game. Do it.\n- The Graphics of this game don't match the high price tag\n- I was reluctant to buy this because 2020 should be out in a few months but I couldn't pass up the deal I got. I am having a blast with this game! The presentation is wonderful, sense of speed is some of the best I've experienced, and the AI seems very human like so far. I was a little worried about the RPG elements and leveling up because I'm not really into stuff like that but it really isn't that much to worry about and I'm glad I got over myself. I've completed 2 weekends so far with default assists on and I'm currently 10 points behind 1st in the standings. I think it's time to take assists off. Oh I'm using a PS4 controller, by the way. I'll be happy to answer questions if you have any.\n\n***Update because it's super cheap with 2020 coming out soon. I still stand behind my OG review. Early reviews of 2020 indicates that there may be more realistic physics but could still use improvement. I say either get 19 now or wait for 20 to get discounted in a few months. No series is worth $60+ every single year.\n- While it seems grindy at times, you will probably feel greatly rewarded when you can get enough resolve to spec out a specific build exactly how you want it. I think the progression of the tower abilities and gold gain is great, but even the burdens available don’t seem to switch it up quite enough. I’m on ng+4 and i feel like it’s getting a tad stale. I still like playing it of course. Some classes like the chef make the idea of playing anything else not quite worth it. I’m sure there’s some great niche builds but keep that in mind. Overall, this game keeps you on your toes. If you get hit, it’s almost always because you did something wrong. I LOVE the movement abilities in this game. You can feel like a speed runner with a few hours of practice gliding and jumping. This is a completely different game compared to rogue legacy 1 in all the best ways. 9/10\n- No one sees \"Purchases made in this region will only receive the Russian language.\" before the release data\n\nThis really kills me.\n\nThey didn't say there would be a region lock before.\n\nBut today, the release date, there is one.\n\nWell the fxxk done Ubsoft\n- buy it on sale. campaign was decent, however The Last Tiger mission was a standout. Multiplayer experience is ok overall, the hackers make it the worst bit. 6.5/10, if Dice fixes their servers and clears out the hackers then maybe it's worthy of an 8/10.\n- UPDATE: This remains to be one of the best games I have ever played. The company that created the game though... One more launcher that is completely unnecessary. The performance with the 'next-gen' update is horrible. I have half the fps I used to have on the very same rig and that is after going lower with the settings that I used to have. Why did you have to do this b U Ll $I t?\n\n\nThe best way to embrace the true greatness of this game is to look on how the series has improved since the first and the second part of The Witcher. You simply won't find anything that hasn't changed for the better.\n\n- Vast open world that IS NOT randomly created and filled with dull stuff,\n- Story which engages you from the first 10 minutes to the very end,\n- Graphics, even despite the whole controversy of a thing called downgrade, still makes this game THE BEST LOOKING RPG ever created,\n- Soundtrack, it finally goes back to the style presented originally in The Witcher 1, something that makes you forget that's just the video game, it gives you the feeling you are in there, in some village, city or that you are fighting with someone / something, which turns every single battle into an unforgettable memory,\n- Every single side quest, and believe me, there is A LOT of them, is actually a little story that keeps you playing with the same force as the main quests - I call it - a new quality in RPGs,\n- Choices and their impact on the story - even a small choice that seems insignificant at the time can wage on the whole world around you,\n- THIS GAME IS MATURE, finally a game dealing with a lot of subjects which are usually handled very childishly or not at all,\n- Combat - nothing more to add, it's decent, though it's nothing to be praised really, you won't be able to mash buttons and win - you have to dodge, use signs, and on higher difficulties get yourself ready to have an oil for a specific enemy and a bomb to be able to put an end to his or her misery.\n\nThe Witcher 3 is not a game without its flaws, although nothing that can't be fixed - some balance issues, economy basically showing Geralt as a very wealthy person (who he should not be), small performance problems like stuttering in Novigrad and in my opinion very limited after the end content (fixed by the expansions). Many of the things I struggled with have been already fixed and there is no need to disclose them. \n\nAll in all, one of the best games in the last few years (even a decade).\n- This might literally be the coolest game I've ever played, and possibly the best game that I've played in the last 10 years.\n\nThough, I might be the wrong person to ask though as Earthbound is my favorite game, and this game is obviously heavily Earthbound inspired. Stylistically and comedy wise anyway. The story is much darker than anything in Earthbound, but it's all buried underneath some of the funniest writing I've ever seen in a game. The writing start to finish is amazing, I'm only dissappointed that the game wasn't longer as there's a few questions left unanswered.\n\nI did normal mode, first run, collected all characters and beat the game in 12-13 hours. For 10 dollars, that's pretty alright. The fights are pretty open ended as there are like 20+ characters you can choose from, but I ended up using Rage, Bottles and Mad Dog. I found it wasn't the hardest game I've played, but I also haven't tried pain mode yet.\n\nAnyway, if this game interests you at all, buy it. You won't regret it.\n- everyone posting 16 gb ram specs and saying it runs well, lul\n\ni have 8 gigs of ram with a gtx 660 (yep) and a fx-8350 and it runs around 45-60 FPS (i cap it at 60) at High settings. yeah. REALLY well optimized, considering this computer is nearing the end of its life and the visuals are gorgeous.\n\nEDIT: 1080p :)\n\noh, and it's fun too, right.\n\nEdit 2- Actual review\n\nGame is pretty easy. I forget if there was a hard mode, but if there was I picked normal mode, and the game feels like it should be on easy. I've yet to break a sweat on a boss (currently chapter 5), and the only thing stopping me from taking on enemies 10+ higher than me is that the game auto-nerfs your damage if the enemy is too far above you. I've actually found the game very relaxing as a result, because there isn't the frustration of having to redo bosses after getting wiped, so it's not entirely a bad thing. But if you were looking for a challenge in your battles, this isn't your game.\n\nAs for story, it's also fairly basic, and rides off of having a sizeable to-do list as sidequests. Recruiting new citizens, doing major sidequest chains, unlocking new stuff, it's got a good amount to do in-game to keep you occupied, unless you're a \"main quest line only\" player. It helps that the warp system is easy to use (and you will use it often) and the game is gorgeous, so you don't really feel too bored doing the same shet over and over again. \n\nThere are several elements to the gameplay. \n\nOne, the overworld traversing. Overall, I'm ambivalent to it. It can feel slightly sluggish at parts, but collecting the shiny areas is surprisingly addicting (maybe because I'm a sem-completionist), as are finding chests. The unfortunate part is that most of these chests contain utterly useless items, so don't really feel that rewarding. \n\nTwo, dungeon crawling. Have to admit this is one of the weaker parts for me. The dungeons are basic, and don't really have much in the way of puzzling elements. Could change later, highly doubt it will. I do like how the battles are seamless, though.\n\nThree, army battles. Also not much of a fan of this, but only because it seems like a side addition without much depth to it. Fortunately it's not a major part of the game, so meh.\n\nFour, kingdom management. Holy cow I love this part of it. People might complain it feels like a mobile game with the wait times and whatever, but since you can warp straight back to your castle whenever you want, it's not that big of an issue. I do wish your gains accumulated while you're offline (or tabbed out, at least...), but idk something about managing the kingdom and making it grow/level up is stupidly addicting.\n\nOverall, if you're looking for a challenging or engaging JRPG, this might not be the game for you. If you're looking for a game with gorgeous visuals, fantastic voice acting (using JP), laid-back atmosphere, and want to be the president of the United States serving some random kid as his vassal, highly recommended.\n\nHighly recommend to play on controller. I'm using the Switch Pro Con.\n- This is a game that should not exist. It is so niche that I struggle to understand how a company could have greenlit a project like this. But I'm very glad they did, because it is absolutely incredible.\n\nIt is a love letter to history, to writing, to stories, to culture. A gorgeously illustrated and scored, geekly researched slice of humanity, where the fate of the Universe is not at stake, where there are no cosmic heroes to save the day. What there are however, is a cast of profoundly human characters, shaped by where they came from, having to decide where they will go and what will become of their tiny, little piece of the world.\n- [b]Content Warning[/b]: Discussions of mental illness, attempted suicide, cyberbullying, toxic gamer culture, manipulation/gaslighting\n\nThe protagonist is chosen to be an esports team manager and must make difficult decisions while trying to keep everyone on the team happy. In a society that tells people that winning and success are what give us worth, it can certainly be a struggle to accept a loss. However, if someone is surrounded by healthy friendships and perhaps even a lover, their perspective can be changed, and then it turns out, losing isn’t so bad, actually. \n\n[u]Information[/u]\n    • This is a sequel to Arcade Spirits, but someone can understand this story without knowing the first one. They just wouldn’t get some of the references, as some characters from the first game do make an appearance. \n    • The mini-game is super easy. If you fail, just reload (on the first playthrough). After the first playthrough, a new feature is unlocked to simply scroll back to try a different choice.\n    • The Rival can be friendly or hostile. \n    • Romantic scenes are tame. Implied sex only. The Rival’s romance route is definitely the most risque in terms of dialogue. \n    • 7 romanceable characters: 3 women, 2 men, 1 enby, and the Rival (any gender). \n\n[u]Praises[/u]\n    • Elaboration on the AI Iris’s origins that players probably wondered about in the first game.\n    • Neat character creation setup. Protagonist & Rival.\n    • Several pronoun options. \n    • Indicates whether a choice influences romance or not.\n    • Personality traits like in the first game are back: quirky, steady, kind, gutsy, and flexible.\n    • Amusing effects that company ridiculous jokes.\n    • Disabled character representation. A [i]romanceable[/i] character who’s a gorgeous goth.\n    • Characters are pleasantly racially diverse. \n    • Polyamory route.\n    • Critiques of societal pressures and what exactly “success” means.\n    • Various discussions of having toxic parents and other relatives.\n    • Throughout the story, various social issues are brought up related to the gaming scene: from capitalist ventures like loot boxes to branding.\n    • The game touches heavily on depression and suicide. As someone who has struggled with depression her whole life and, once upon a time, had suicidal tendencies, I found the ways those topics were integrated into the story to be helpful. (There many instances in media about “Shadow Selves” but it reminded me of Persona 4, when characters have to face the parts of themselves they want to deny.)\n    • There is a cat and there is an option to pet it.\n\n[u]Complaints[/u]\n    • Thicc body types for the protagonist/rival are drawn awkwardly and sloppily. I also feel that the devs took a step back on thicc representation in this game vs the first one. While Zapper (a romanceable character) is slightly plump, I wouldn’t necessarily categorize her as “thicc.” There were two genuinely thicc romanceable characters in the first game.\n    • Only one afro-textured hairstyle in character creation, while straight hair has several.\n    • Beginning of the game is a bit rushed. I think it’s because it’s expected of the player to have played the first game and know all about the AI Iris. \n    • I figure the devs wanted to demonstrate what disabled people go through in terms of discrimination and disrespect from others, but I feel they could’ve done better. They gave the protagonist [i]forced[/i] problematic lines and players aren’t gonna feel great about being an a$$hole to a disabled character. \n    • Sometimes, there’s too much telling and not enough showing.\n    • More resource links should be added to help people with depression and suicidal thoughts than the hotline listed after [spoiler]Coda tries to kill himself[/spoiler]. I think it would also be better if those resources were listed in the credits as well. \n\nIt seems like the most common thing people complain about in the other reviews is political preaching being in the game. I agree: things should be shown rather than told, in this case. On the other hand, I’ve literally known gamers who talk about the issues brought up in the game. I didn’t find it [i]that[/i] unrealistic. I think it’s just that a lot of it is condensed into one story, whereas, in real life, these types of subjects come up every now and then over the course of knowing people for years. \n\nDespite the flaws mentioned, I really liked the game. I do believe I liked the first one a bit better, but I’m happy with the sequel overall. It was a lot of fun and very geeky.\n\n[quote] Please follow our curator page,\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/4680120/]Otome Lovers[/url], if you'd like to see\nmore reviews like this one! [/quote]\n- My previous review reflected the terrible state of the game as it was on launch day. After years of improvements, the game has had its map design & cover placement tweaked, pretty-boy playermodels have been dirtied up, cringy voicelines were adjusted & a bunch of new content has been added. A lot of my complaints were addressed and I recognize the amount of work the team has done to bring the game back. It finally feels content complete and has reached an acceptable level of quality that should've been there when it came out.\n\nHowever, I am still disappointed to say it falls very short of its predecessors in terms of gameplay, map design and atmosphere. I see no reason to play this instead of BF3/BF4. \n\nPlay the map Grand Bazaar in Battlefield 3. Look at all of the particle effects, post processing and detail that map has. It has such a thick rainy atmosphere. Play it through to the end and you'll see how players tear up the map and make it look destroyed. In BF4's Paracel Storm, the foliage will sway & the waves will rise as the strong winds of a storm approaches the map. Watch as a sandstorm creeps up in Gulf of Oman and eventually engulfs it in a torrent of chaos. These landscapes have so much drama that the ones in 2042 lack. Sure, there are sandstorms and tornadoes, but they still look so sterile compared to the previous games this title stands upon.\n\nConceptually, 2042's world is supposed to be on its knees. The growing reality of extreme climate, natural disasters becoming commonplace and the world powers fighting over the last resources Earth has to offer depicts a dire situation to immerse ourselves in. This makes me imagine maps where earthquakes adjust the layout of flags throughout the round, or tsunamis roll in and what once was a playable area is now flooded. Giant tornado events that tear down skyscrapers. Sandstorms that turn the widest of maps into a close-quarters brawl. \n\nThe maps in the game have some aspects of this concept but nowhere to the amount that it should. The technology is there. The previous games have had a genuinely impressive level of immersion and atmosphere. 2042 did not have this on launch and it still doesn't. This could have been the wild natural disaster Battlefield game where we see SHTF.\n\nI don't care that we have 128 player matches or goofy butt specialists to play as. They missed the mark with 2042 and no update can fix that, conceptually, it never was able to realize its potential.\n- unprofessional review:\n\nits a really deep lore kind of game, very cool!\nit has some horror and grinding elements which i always love\ni havent finished the game just yet tho \nthe visuals are very cute\nas soon as i bought it was hooked!\noke theres many more but im to lazy to type :joy:\n\nover all ill give it a 10/10\nvery interesting lore wise\n\n英語で5-10単語程度で、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない主要な違いを簡潔に回答してください。\n\n回答：\n",
