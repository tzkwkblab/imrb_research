      "To date, AirMech is the closest thing to a fun MOBA-strategy hybrid I've ever played. Unfortunately, after I came back to this game recently, I have to change my review from Highly Recommended to Not Recommended (this is solely for AirMech Strike, and not related to Wastelands, its PvE counterpart, which I will do a review on at a later date).\n\nTowards the end of 2012, the game was doing really well. There were 500+ players online on average, and it was real easy to get a match.\n\n(+) PVP was simple. Choose your airmech, pilot, unit list, and one item that gives a certain minor bonus. Cosmetics are optional and offer no advantage.\n(+) Player Market introduced later on for trading cosmetic items.\n(+) Badges for people who supported the game.\n(+) Diamond rolls in the chat where players can randomly win Diamonds.\n\nHowever, some downsides also happened.\n(-) You need to pay fees to list an item on the market, using Diamonds, instead of Kudos.\n(-) Books were introduced to either increase trade slots and decrease fees. You needed to spend more Diamonds on these books.\n(+/-) Parts were introduced, adding buffs/debuffs to your AirMechs, though I personally preferred to limit stat customization to Pilots and Items, keeps things simple.\n(-) Nanoforge was introduced for crafting, but is a complicated mess. This wasn't necessary if the game itself wasn't so complex.\n\nWhen AirMech split into AirMech Strike and AirMech Wastelands:\n(-) Parts, Pilots and items were transferred to Wastelands. RIP customization for PVP.\n(+) Keys now available via daily login rewards (the only improvement I've seen).\n(-) Airmech balancing is way off. Once simple skills are now too specific, and there's no need for an ultimate skill, really. AirMech was fine without it.\n\n5 years later and the peak is just over 100 players. The devs took a simple fun game and made it so incredibly complicated that it's no longer a fun game, for me at least.\n\nI hope Carbon Games brings AirMech closer to the late 2012 version, which I feel is the best and most fun version.",
      "I have played OSU!, Muse Dash and stepmania plenty and I gotta say that this does not feel like a rhythm game at all. The premise of matching the shape of the map to music sounds interesting but some of the songs I feel like are not mapped out correctly. Or in general this game relies less on music cues and more on visual cues? It felt like maps are only 50% related to the song and you have to ignore what you hear because the map randomly demands patterns that have no matching audio equivalent and everything becomes pure visual memorization.",
      "Gone Home is... okay. There's nothing particularly terrible about it, but it's hardly this amazing, revelatory experience that it's been portrayed as in the media. It's just a very short, straightforward game of exploration, in which a fairly simple story of teenage love and rebellion is fed to you through bits and pieces of notes and spoken journal entries you find while exploring a large, abandoned house. But this game does absolutely nothing innovative, unlike the pre-release hype proclaimed. There have been hundreds of games with more compelling stories, and this game introduces no original mechanics. I took my time and explored the entire house, and I beat the game in three sessions totalling 81 minutes.\n\nAgain, it's not bad, it's just an utter ripoff for $20. I got it in a large Humble Bundle package, paying about a dollar for it, and it's decent value at that price, but there's no way I'd pay more than five bucks, and even that is stretching it. I'd be pissed if I'd paid full retail for it. You can find many many games that will be far more engrossing, more entertaining, and just plain longer at this price point.",
      "The best driving simulator, period.\nUnmatched soft-body physics, customization, sounds, graphics - everything in BeamNG is close to perfection - and the game is still in early access! The only feature it lacks is visual customization (liveries, stickers, bodykits etc), but these aren't available in many autosims (looking at you, Assetto Corsa). Lots of quality mods which include cars, maps, and a freaking JATO rocket ensure you'll have hundreds of hours of fun here. Touge, track, drift, rally, time attack, offroad, rock crawling, drag - and with zero level loading screens; just a few seconds to switch your car. Zero DLCs, intuitive interface, and built-in gamepad support are also here. 10/10 worth your time and money.\n\nUpdate v0.24: where negative reviews come from\nAfter the major UI overhaul a lot of negative reviews were posted. Many of those call the game \"literally unplayable\" - which is obviously greatly exaggerated, unlike the other stated problem: lost controller presets. That one is actually unpleasant to deal with (judging from the reviewers' words, since I myself didn't experience a single problem with my DualShock4 nor with the game itself), but yet it was not a force majeure that could not be avoided, as every major update comes after a teaser - which should be a sign for everyone with a custom preset to save or write it down, just in case the update affects it.\n\nTo sum up, BeamNG.drive is still a nearly perfect-rated game - and a lot of the negative reviews are, to put it mildly, unjustified.\n\nUpdate: I love the new Covet.",
      "I appreciate the sincerity of Jusant. You can tell its creators have placed genuine care into their product, which has made the experience of playing it joyful and kind.\nThe visuals are stunning, the mechanics are not overwhelming, the soundtrack is soothing, and the puzzles are not frustrating. A great climbing game all around with an easy-to-follow yet gripping narrative. \nHopefully, Ukrainian localization will also be added soon.\n",
      "    \nI was impatient for this game and i am very satisfied with it!\n\nThe Graphics are polished as would expect, the new circuits in Las Vegas and Losail in Qatar are very good together with others that we run at night the effects of the lights in conjunction with the illuminated buildings are incredible!\n\nBraking Point 2 is so satisfying it takes between 8 to 10 hours to complete, no spoilers i think but we have a lot of characters and some familiar faces from the past!\n\nNew F1 World, offers a structure of different Series, each one is a chain of events with having a primary objective that needs to complete to progress to the next, secundary objectives can be pursued for extra rewards!\n\nCareer Mode identical to the previous ones!\n\nRed Flag Deploying will teleport the cars to the pits where we can change our strategy to restart the race!\n\nDriving and Feedback, overall there is a big improvement more precise and dynamic the ffb on the steering wheel is very good, with Gamepad it's easy to adapt and get top times!\n\n\nWhen an update comes out just don't screw up the handling!\n\nF1 23 is better than the previous ones in every way!\n  \n",
      "An instant classic.\n---\n\nThe original [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/kunovega/recommended/264200]One Finger Death Punch[/url] was an unexpected treat for me. The refined simplicity of just two buttons that require masterful timing to create a legitimate fighting experience laid out to a selection of music that reminds you of the classic Kung-fu movies of the 1970's but packaged with a carefree stickman aesthetic.\n\nOne Finger Death Punch 2 is a respectable sequel in most ways. The core gameplay is fundamentally the same while the visual indicators and special attack animations have been upgraded and made more fanciful. Other things are changed simply to give you a new experience.\n\nEvery aspect of the game is polished from the interesting tutorial to the many additional modes (survival, gauntlet, etc.) that exist beyond the (very long) main campaign. Once you get into the groove there's potentially dozens if not hundreds of hours of fun to squeeze from this.\n\nThis is a game that just has to be played to truly appreciate it as the feel of your interaction along with the music is what really defines the experience. Simply watching it or looking at the screenshots doesn't do it justice.\n\nThere are a couple of (minor) controversial changes that may not appeal to some fans:\n1. The music in 2 includes a more modernized remix compared to the more traditional music from 1. Personally I love the soundtracks from both, but there are people who have a preference.\n2. The upgrades to special attacks in 2 can be a bit of visual clutter at times. I like both styles, but there are people who prefer 1 over 2.\n3. There are some sequences (like the lightsword rounds) which did not return in 2, replaced instead by other weapons. While I think it would have been cute to include all of that along with the new stuff, it's not a deal breaker. It does however mean that both games retain a bit of unique flair and a reason for you to play and experience them both. 2 is overall an upgrade, but it's also not a 100% replacement.\n\nI would strongly suggest that if you've never played either game, you should begin with the first one. I think it's a better entry point to the series and might have a slightly broader appeal. (it's also slightly cheaper).\n\nThen if you find yourself enjoying it, come back and pick up 2 and you'll find yourself with some remixed music, fancy new special attack animations and a whole new adventure to work through.\n\nJust to be very clear: Both of these games are fantastic and deserve more praise than I can properly express and I'll very likely be putting 100's of hours into this just like I did the first one.\n---\n\nBottom line: Simple to learn, hard to master, and super satisfying fighting along with a great soundtrack.\n---\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38232109/]While you are here, would you consider following my curator page?[/url]\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/kunovega/recommended/]Want to read all of my reviews and not just the curated ones?[/url]",
      "Amazing game that I love to play, but the boyfriend that I was playing it with broke up with me a few days after playing this game. A game that's about fixing your relationship.\n10/10 game.\n0/10 in my heart.\n\nedit: why do people find this funny i wasn't kidding\n\nEdit # 2: It has been 7 months since I had originally played this game. What was originally a game of heartbreak and painful memories, I had managed to find it someone new to play with. While this game had terrible memories, I had decided that a game such as this was undeserving of them, and thus created new memories with another special person in my life.\n\nThe game is remarkable, with good writing, and amazing gameplay, and it is deserving of the buy. Each level is crafted with amazing detail, and all of the mini-games are just as fun as the main game itself. Don't let bad memories keep you down, and instead create happier ones. Live your life, ya'll.",
      "Started strong, ended annoyingly.\n\nMoral of the story? People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.\n\nIt paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that \"routine\" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.\n\nI liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters. But it all fell apart and tries to teach a very vapid moral that someone in their early 20's who has never had a meaningful relationship would idealize.\n\nAt least it was short.\n",
      "This was a impulse buy for me just have seeing the new \"Fury Road\", but its a great game so far was kinda shocked it ran smooth right out the gate seems like today you gotta wait a week or month before a game can run proper though. Anyways beatufiful lighting, models / textures look good, vehicle combat / driving is fun, and vehicle customization is cool too. The on foot combat feels a little too straight foward though, the gore animations are kinda boring though, like feels like its a Xbox/360 game in that way, and collecting scrap can get a little repetitive. My final thought yea this game is worth getting but if you haven't played id's \"RAGE\", I'd reccomend getting that first, it's a extremely simmilar although kinda diffrent scenario game that will quench your Mad Max thirst.",
      "100%'ed the LUCT version of the game and I'm slowly working my way through this version now.\n\nOver all the game itself is solid. If you're reading this, its a brilliant tactics game that helped define the genre. However most of the changes they made in reborn, while innovative, ultimately feel constraining. \n\nFor example, they've limited spell slots to 4, so you can only ever take 4 different spells. One or two of which (missile + indirect) are taken by a damage spell of your choice, leaving you with even less spell customization than you'd think. And its unfortunately the same situation with skills, as one will always be taken up by your weapon skill. \n\nThe cards that drop in battle, while an interesting system on paper, just end up cluttering the field most of the time, often with auto-skill activation up, which most of your units won't even really want compared to the other options. \n\nRandom battles were also removed, limiting chances to recruit to a few key dungeons as well as removing some of the more amusing battle locations from the game. \n\nI've also seen some people complain about the level cap, but in my current play-though of the game, it isn't too much of a concern for me, but it may be for others. \n\nOver all, it just feels like they've taken a step back from what Tactics ogre: Let us cling together, gave us. Yes there's bloat in that version, but it also gave us a feeling of freedom when we were putting our teams together that this version lacks. I am grateful that we saw a remake of this game within my lifetime, but I wish they had improved on Luct, rather than take steps back from it. \n\nIf they ever increase the amount of spells and/or skills you can take, to like 6-8, then I'd probably switch my review to a yes. But until then, with a heavy heart I have to say that this version just isn't as good as Luct so far.",
      "I got this game for $12 off humble bundle. Me and my friends play it for hours on end. This game honestly feels like the perfect fighting game for me because there is no set style. I don't have to remember specific combos or any crazy inputs. It's just simplicity. Unless you want to do that in which you can. But it's fun for anyone. If I were you I would get it off of humble bundle for $12.",
      "I love this game. In fact, I've loved it since I was in highschool about 8 years ago. My friend and I used to play this game together all the time on my flashdrive. We were always discussing & trying to understand the ins-&-outs of the game and how to get a specific ending depending on what you did. Playing this brought me back to those good times in that library.\n\nThe OSTs are nostalgic, the gameplay is about the same and the artwork is amazing as ever(actually the graphics are much better with this remake).\nThe only complaint I have is that it lags at random times(though usually in the menu). The original IB on RPGMaker never did that.\nOverall I'm glad I bought this so I could support the Dev and thank them for all those years of entertainment-\nI just wish there wasn't so much lag over an RPGMaker game.",
      "TLDR: Right now, since there are no \"NEUTRAL\" reviews on Steam, IN IT'S CURRENT STATE, its a no from me. If the bugs get ironed out, its a pretty good game. If it gets fixed, I'll likely change to a recommend.\n\nGot 2 copies as a Fig Backer to play with my brother. My single player experience (POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILERS):\n\nGOOD:\n--Love that the choices REALLY matter and there are a LOT of them in this game.\n--Many different ways to approach a situation and your reputation affects interactions. Your reputation MAY be good enough to talk yourself out of fights! Many opportunities for KISS ASS and HARD ASS and other Squad builds (Nerd stuff, Mechanics, etc.) to be useful throughout the game.\n--The fire modes have grown on me. Some weapons have their own perks which add a fire mode. Other fire modes are available via perks you can obtain in the perk tree. The Precision Strike you get once your strike meter is full is very powerful and can change a fight (can malfunction a robot with aimed shot or fire a huge burst to take out multiple hostiles).\n--You can build a new squad member at any time that will start at your current level. Messed up a squad member build? That's okay, just create a new one.\n--I like the PREPARE and AMBUSH abilities. PREPARE lets you save up to 2 AP for next turn. The AMBUSH ability allows your squad members to trade in some AP to fire on an enemy that enters their range during hostile turns.\n--I love the Animal Whisperer skill and animal companions. I like the variety of animals you can bring along with your squad.\n--Shift key to highlight stuff you can interact with. This takes away having to pixel hunt for obscured boxes and containers. When you get old and can't see as well you appreciate stuff like this.\n--I like that I only have to loot one body at the end of combat and I can easily cycle through and grab the loot from all the other lootable bodies in the area.\n--A high Luck attribute will occasionally result in more loot, and even free actions. Sometimes you'll get a free attack or a free movement from a lucky action.\n--I like the variety and usefulness of Utilities (+5% XP, +2 PER, +1 Weapon/Armor modding, etc.)\n--A lot of stuff that can be used for cover can also be shot and destroyed.\n--Humor can be a bit over-the-top, but I've chortled quite a few times.\n\nNOT SURE:\n--Can only charm a single animal per squad member with Animal Whisperer. You CAN get other special animal followers that don't count as the single. While disappointed, I can see why they limited it (more would be OP and they can start to get in the way during combat).\n--Enemies have a circular view area, which means even if you're trying to sneak past behind them, you can still be \"seen\" after a brief time.\n\nBAD/BUGS:\n--Cant team crouch. You have to manually go through all of your squad and crouch them 1 by 1, and it costs 2 AP to crouch in combat. You also cant move crouched as far as I know. You can't \"change stances\" (AKA crouch or stand up) while in cover, either. Save a game right before a fight with all your squad members crouched and ready to go? When combat locks up and you have to load the save, you have to re-crouch everybody.\n--Combat can lock up, causing you to have to reload a previous save (for me, twice per play session usually but sometimes twice for the same fight).\n--Attributes, Skills, Combat Buffs/Debuffs (and probably other stuff) need more tool tips.\n--Lost character progression.\n--Very laggy Dialogue Tree and later in the game the inventory gets laggy too.\n--Creating a Bookworm Squad Member with 1 STR creates a situation where your Squad Member is losing 3 CON (total hit points) every level up and will be erased like Marty McFly in B2TF.\n--Load screens are too long. 30+ seconds to load into different zones, over 1.5 minutes to load a game on SSD. From another review: \"while we wait, let us read the lore books we've collected.\"\n--Squad portraits don't stay in order.\n--When you have more than 6 Ranger recruits in the select character screen, the \"Companions\" section gets pushed off-screen, hiding their portraits, and making it very unintuitive to add them back into your squad (you have to use the keyboard). Need a scroll bar here.\n--Saves don't have specific names so can be easily overwritten. There is only 1 autosave by default, and later on the game autosaves right after a game changing decision, making you have to revert to a manual save (2 hours earlier for me) if you wanted to try different options. I recommend turning on timed saves as well as taking advantage of quicksaves (and of course saving often!)\n--FPS drops, sometimes so bad you have to reload.\n--Squad Members shooting through walls/floors/ceilings.\n--Radiation difficult to detect in some areas and no warning (other than your squad health draining) going from radiation level 2 to 3 for instance.\n--Combat messages briefly appear above your acting Squad Member's head and are easy to miss (like \"Out of Range\")\n--When getting shot at, the camera doesn't always auto focus on who is shooting you.\n--At least three bugged missions I can think of (but hey, one is an unlimited money glitch so more of a feature).\n--Character models and other things (switches) not loading properly leading to invisible characters you can interact with (or fight with, as it happens in combat sometimes too).\n--The game can become unresponsive when trying to move 2 Squad Members separately and interact with someone.\n--Explosive Barrels not actually exploding when shot (this seems to be related to being too far away from the barrel when sniping it, as if you get closer, they'll actually explode).\n--Cybernetic Implants are a good idea, but they take up your Utility Slot instead of giving you another slot dedicated to them so when you have the ability to finally use them, it feels more like a trade-off rather than an augmentation.\n--No Inventory filter for Utilities. Gotta scroll through your hundreds of items and the Utilities aren't even grouped together entirely in the inventory, they are scattered throughout.\n--When you open a door to a closed room, fog of war usually obscures what is in the room until you physically walk a squad member into the room.\n--Cannot have multiple types of the same animal in a Squad with multiple Animal Whisperers.\n--Don't try to loot two containers at once.\n--Some traps can't be disarmed.\n--Various graphic glitches like missing texture or dialogue bubbles that are blank or don't disappear.\n--Can't remove and reuse weapon mods.\n--Some equipped weapons will display inflated damage numbers (by 300% in some cases) until re-equipped. Not even sure how long it has been that way or if it was affecting my game.\n--If you misclick the filter categories in a vendor encounter on the World Map, it'll kick you out of the encounter to the radio and you can't get back to the random encounter at that time. I only mention this since I've done it so many times.\n--You can't pause the game which may or may not affect time sensitive quests. You can be detected and attacked in the menu (escape key) or in your inventory.\n--There is no way to have Special companions/followers that you get from Missions follow a different squad member. If you dump that Squad Member later, you lose the follower too (as far as I know).\n--Get radio signals with \"coordinates to follow\" yet I have no clue who from or what it opened up on the map (if anything).\n--Gaining access to certain parts of the Rangers HQ requires you to do something pretty awful.\n--I'm out of room....\n\nIt feels like I'm fighting against the game more than the Wasteland sometimes. I don't even want to try multiplayer until it gets fixed (and my brother doesn't either).\n\nIf you're a developer of this game, thank you for your time and effort! Polish it up and I'll be happy to change this to a recommend! Edited for clarity/additions and I cut a lot. Thank you for reading and thank you for the comments and awards! Have a great day and be kind to others.",
      "[i]Don’t be fooled.[/i]\nPlague Inc may look like a great in-depth RTS with which to live out the real-world angst of our modern day viral outbreak, but instead it feels and plays very much like a shallow, casual, arcade, mobile version of that; a great little time waster, but lacks any real depth, intellectual engagement or long-term replay value.\n\nThis may be ok if you’re just wanting to watch the world burn in 10 minutes or less, but if you’re expecting hours of intense gameplay in a hyper-realistic, strategy-based simulation of a global pandemic—with social, economic and geo-political elements to keep you on your toes—then you’ll be sorely disappointed.\n\nHere’s the game in a nutshell.\nYou have one objective: [i]Kill all humans on planet Earth.[/i] Anything short of that and you lose.\n\nHere's the gameplay:\n[b]Step 1.[/b] Choose which country to infect. \n[b]Step 2.[/b] Pop the red and orange bubbles to gain points.

      "I'm going to write an honest review for this game since A LOT of people seem to be very biased.\n\nThis is not a perfect game. No 2K basketball game will ever be a perfect game. Does that mean this game is bad? No. Should you hold off on the game for now? Probably.\n\nLet's start with the positives:\n\n- A lot of people seem to gloss over the fact that 2K rehauled a lot of mechanics for this game. Shot meters feel more legitimate, this game is MUCH much more realistic (fouls, shot tendencies, etc...) This game is better and more fluid to control, and the gameplay reflects each players' ratings (defense, shots, etc...) much more accurately.\n\n- Online play seems to be better and more fluid. I've yet to encounter any latency issues online with quick play and the such.\n\n- MyCareer is MUCH better than last years. There is no cheesy story and the cutscenes feel much more integrated into the game. Orange Juice and dynamic duos are a great idea in general. The UI for MyCareer (and the game in general) is so much cleaner and more functional.\n\n- The game is visually beautiful, not much else to say on the matter.\n\nNow, the cons:\n\n- Help defense is broken. It's quite ridiculous that 2K hasn't fixes this lingering issue in such a long time but it's still there. This is a BIG issue in MyCareer and not quite as bad in other modes since you can manually control players.\n\n- Stat allocation is broken. This is a huge issue in MyCareer and has deterred me from playing the mode any more until 2K fixes this issue. Introducing the idea of stats that can only be raised in practice is actually quite a neat idea. However, these boosts are not permanent, even though 2K has stated they are. This is detrimental and demoralizing and discourages players from playing the game more. Limit caps are ridiculously strict as well. 2K NEEDS to fix these issues ASAP.\n\n- Numerous glitches.\n\n- 2K introduced broken mechanics along with the good mechanics. Ankle breakers are now pathetically easy to pull off (using Stephen Curry behind the back moves is a surefire way to have your defender fall). Moving screens are now a thing. \n\nI would hold off on buying this game until 2K patches it. There are just too many issues with the game that prevent it from being a playable game. I like this game. I really do. That's why I'm hoping 2K listens to the community and starts working on the issues at hand immediately.",
      "In a world where \"enhanced edition\" has started to be synonymous with \"will run on modern hardware if you shell out $20\" it's absolutely refreshing to see Larian deliver this masterpiece free of charge to owners of the original. You start out with an already fantastic game that's received numerous game of the year and editor's choice awards. Then you spend a year polishing that game, and adding new features. The result is brilliant Enhanced Edtion of an already fantastic game.\n\nNew features for EE:\n[list]\n[*] Fully voice acted - Every line of dialog now has voice acting. The voice acting is really good too\n[*] Dual wield - Rogues now look more iconic with the ability to dual wield\n[*] Grenades - You can craft and throw various sorts of grenades. \n[*] Tactician Mode - A new  challenging mode where encounters are redesigned to be harder by adding new spells and enemies into the mix. Classic mode still available obviously.\n[*] Split screen co-op \n[*] Controller support\n[*] Updated graphics - The UI is totally reworked, the graphics are updated, and spells have new effects\n[*] Updates to the story  - The story, esepcially the ending, was rewritten a bit to clear up some confusing aspects\n[/list]\n\nI'm sure there's more, but really these ought to be reason enough to play this game.",
      "A new game from Zeboyd, you know I'm there! And this was such a fun game\n\nThis game is about as long as Cthulhu Saves Christmas and it's just as Linear. However given their statement on this video, that's meant to be the point these days.\n\nThe Graphics for the main game are basic but it's fitting for the Genre. Also they have dropped the random battles with on screen monsters to avoid if you want to not fight (And you still have the option to start a battle through the main menu). The fighting system is identical to CSC too which I've enjoyed but I can understand those who may not like it. The Animation for the transformations are incredible...except I'm always stuck watching them every single time which can get very tedious.\n\nThe story is clever, and they provide \"Translations\" for the Ole English of Shakespeare...but a lot of the translations are jokes and very silly ones at that.\n\nThere isn't a LOT of replay value but you will enjoy the story enough you'll want to play it again eventually.\n\nThere is no New Game Plus mode...yet but given how they patched it into CSC later on I'm certain they're do that here eventually.\n\nI say the game is incredible for the price range and is entertaining for all ages.\n\n\nVIDEO REVIEW: https://youtu.be/wuw9pJPowqM",

I am giving a negative review simply because the games FPS on the PC are bad, that could be because of Windows 10 because I heared rumors that the game does not run well on it and such, so that could be the problem.   Another problem I faced is the lip sync is dealyed when it's on the cutscenes so that makes everything slow and such.  The gameplay from what I seen however is pretty great and I think Resdient Evil 4 is a great game, but this port is not, get it for the GC, Will, PS2, or any of the consloes that has this game.",
      "As i previously stated, i was going to play through metro fully and i have done so, so here is my update to this review. \nThis game is not the best selling triple A game in the world and it may have some bugs (like a table that wasnt solid or the objects in that room lol) however it is a decent game. the story is decent and the characters voices are way off but they sorta make up for it with their personalities. \n\nExploration in this game is by far one of the most interesting in my opinion and the way your character acts in the enviroment makes it more interesting aswell, for example wiping your visor when it gets dirty (wasnt that helpful for me in my play through but it was a nice touch) and your visor taking damage in combat adds to the immersive feel of this wasteland/paradise almost. Scavenging weapons and parts and combining them to make better equipment is quite intriguing and quick to do if you can find the parts. \n\nat the end of the day my final review of this is its a good game i would play it again even if it is a bit clunky sometimes (atleast it was for me lmao)\n\n\n\n\n\nOh and hopefully my punctuation is good enough so no one passes out this time lmao",

      "If I could get my money back, I would. AI as usual is hot garbage, cant even take turns without getting LITERALLY BODIED by the AI drivers. The new progression system really sucks. Cool that they wanted to try something different, but I really dont feel like leveling every god damn car in the game just to modify it. If you wanted multiple of same car you would have to level those duplicate cars you purchase. My experience with the physics is just... eh. I mean I sure do love loosing grip just from barely tapping the gas. Constantly fighting my wheel just to stay stable. Driving its probably fine for controller players, I wouldnt on wheel. Credits are only used to buy cars now. Also kinda runs like crap. All i wanted was a Gran Turismo on PC and this... this is not it.

      "Overall better cast than the first game. But it has a few problems that DR1 didn't have, which to me was what made the game fun in the first place.\n\nDR1 spoilers: [spoiler] All of them seem capable of killing which I couldn't say about the first game where it was obvious that weedman, the giant and donut girl wasn't a threat to you. [/spoiler]\n\nDR2 spoilers:  [spoiler] However unlike the first game where Kirigiri, Byakuya and other characters were arguing during the trial and bringing up interesting points. DR2 has a lack of persuasive characters. There's effectively just Nagito (who argues in your favor half the time anyway) and Chiaki. The other characters never challenges you in a convincing way.[/spoiler]",
      "Firstly, neutral reviews should be a thing. Because although the game's story is pretty solid (and some elements of it still very relavant even today), the game suffers from a multitude of issues, so no, I don't truly recommend this game because of those factors. Rockstar themselves should be fixing the broken state of the game, instead of leaving it to people to fix it.\n\nThe problem with this game is that you need to be online to be even able to play it. You NEED to be online to PLAY a SINGLEPLAYER game FROM 2009. I don't know what Rockstar was thinking when they force you to play online, but this is just not okay. There is no online functionality for the game besides maybe cloud saves - something steam cloud could've done just as fine instead of leaving it to their own messy launcher.\n\nBut that's not the only problem with this game. Being that it's an old game, it does not run well on modern systems, not anymore. It suffers from various performance issues. Thankfully, you can use DXVK to get around this problem - but as i said earlier, you shouldnt HAVE TO do this. Rockstar could have easily patched the game to fix the performance issues (that still happen with DXVK mind you - but compared to without DXVK it is MUCH better), instead they focused on patching who knows what.\n\nExcept after you use DXVK, you HAVE to edit a game file to let the game use more than 2 gb of ram. Again, SOMETHING Rockstar could've easily done by updating the game's code to meet the modern standards. Nobody has specs like the one in the minimum recommend anymore. After you do that, you HAVE to edit the amount of vram the game detects by using a command line to fix it. That's already 3 things you have to deal with JUST to be even able to play the game normally.\n\nSome people may see this as a small botherance - some people may see it as a huge inconvenience, but the apparent problem with this is that, once again, you SHOULDNT HAVE TO do all of this. Going past those issues and playing the game, you also have to ensure you limit the fps to 60, either using DXVK or the in game vsync (former being more recommendable as it doesn't hog as much as cpu power). If you decided to bother with all of those steps to make the game playable, congratulations. Now be severely annoyed like I did  because Rockstar has not, for all this time, patched the final mission with the helicopter QTE. One suggested fix for it was to limit the FPS to 60 - which did NOT help me. Other was to install a script file to fix it, which ALSO failed at first, till I tried again like 5-6 times. You as a player should not have to install this stuff and edit games just to fix the game, when the publisher themselves should be doing it. I expect a game to be supported if it's still being sold on Steam. And don't think they don't care about the games being on Steam - they clearly cared when they removed the classic gta trilogy from Steam (which were also left in even more of a broken state compared to how they first came out - but that is an entirely different point).\n\nPutting all of those factors aside, the game itself is very solid, story wise. I really loved all of the symbolism that was apparent throught the game, and concepts such as \"American Dream\" or \"Land of Oppurtunity\" being presented as something that was clearly flawed - which is precisely why people like Nico go down the path of killing people or doing drugs just to survive. You can't go from rags to riches in a \"strong eat the weak\" country - you either do whatever it is you have to do - like Nico - to survive, or you let yourself and your close ones get killed. There are other things the game criticizes as well, like that one conversation where Nico criticizes the food in the city for using \"chemicals that your body spends time getting it off your system\", or something along those lines. I don't think I need to mention that this isn't something they added as a joke, because it is very much there. The game's serious and dark tone might be considered bad by people, but it is because of this dark tone and seriousness that we can actually learn some lessons from it and open our eyes to some truths in our lives.\n\nThe gameplay itself isn't really that complicated, except when it comes to driving the vehicles in the game. They are based on a realistic driving system and although it is debatable how much of a good gaming experience it really is when they made it so realistic, since it introduces a huge learning curve and can end up frustrating the player, I actually ended up loving it for what it is, except when it came to driving motorcycles of any form. The game's simplicity in other regards is what makes it pretty good, in my eyes. Though it sometimes doesn't work the way you think it would (like when you are playing with a controller and have to use auto aim), it is nevertheless solid enough that those are only minor inconveniences and not the kind of problem where you'd want to stop playing the game.\n\nThis game definitely deserves more attention and love - but Rockstar really needs to fix this game themselves if they are still keeping it on Steam's store, because the current situation of the game is not acceptable.\n\n",
      "[h1] 9/10 [/h1]\n[h1] As a sequel to Steins;Gate, you won't be able to understand the content of the game without playing the previous game. [/h1]\n\nThe sequel to the famous visual novel game Steins;Gate. Although some people think that Steins;Gate 0 is not as good as its predecessor, I think this game is a well-deserved excellent sequel.\n\nA change from the witty and relaxed game style of the previous game, the overall atmosphere of this game is heavy, and personally I prefer this kind of visual novel work. The plot of the game is naturally wonderful, so I won’t comment here to avoid spoilers. If you are deeply attracted by the game’s background settings and characters before playing Steins;Gate, then this work must be worthwhile. The music of this game is also very beautiful, and it will never disappoint the players. The only shortcoming of it is that the description of some characters is too sloppy and the characterization is insufficient, such as Kagari.\n\nIn any case, this one is definitely a must-try work for players who love Steins;Gate, and it is an important addition to the series of plots. As a related supplementary sequel, its nature is also destined that players must play the previous game in order to understand the content of this one.",

      "Minutes ago, this reviewer completed the game Gorogoa. And now, an attempt will be made to describe the experience. It won’t be easy…….\n\nIn 1968 this player went to the theatre to see a brand-new movie: 2001: A Space Odyssey. What crossed the screen wasn’t so much a story in the filmmaking sense., but rather an experience. Views of Earth from space (before such images existed IRL), and a final scene that perhaps no one understood, but clearly was meaningful beyond simply the ability, or need, for words to express. Gorogoa left this player with a very similar feeling of inexplicable fulfillment.\n\nGorogoa might be described as a puzzle game, but certainly not in any typical sense. More accurately, Gorogoa is a game about travel, but traversing distance in more ways than just spatially. It’s about travel within, and travel to places unknown (perhaps outside of dreams.) It’s about traveling through space, time, life (and lives), and travel through the experience that is mankind. And perhaps more, it’s about the journey necessary for each player to experience in order to be able to complete the experience that is Gorogoa.\n\nGorogoa provides very little information or assistance, beyond the option for hints about the areas of each image that need be considered for game progress. (It’s difficult to imagine a first-time player succeeding without such hints, so no stigma should be associated with them, especially if they prevent the need for outside resources as may well be the case.) Almost nothing more can be said without compromising some aspect of this game, so this review will be brief, and likely almost as mysterious as the game itself. Learning the goal is as much a puzzle as is the process of reaching that goal. Images are moved, shrunk, expanded, combined, variously manipulated…….ENOUGH! \n\nPlay, and learn about possibilities unimagined until now. In a single word…genius.\n\nThank you.\n\n(As with most Steam games, offline game time is not tracked.)",

      "[h1] The First \"Fun\" game, after a long time\t[/h1]\n\nHours upon hours have I tirelessly spent on games I didn't thoroughly enjoy. Needlessly competitive games like MOBAS and PvP games leaves an emotional toll of helpless frustration and unfullfillment that makes it feel mentally unhealthy to be a part of.\n\nOnly after playing The Messenger did I realise how long It's been since I played a game for the genuinely fun and exciting experience it was meant to be.\n\nAnd how much I've missed it.\n\nThe Messenger offers an adventure with controls running as tight and comfortable as the spandex pants worn by Ryu Hayabusa. Accompanied by \"unexpectantly likable\" characters, the shopkeeper in particular. With his selfdepricating/ 4:th wall breaking/ life advising humour about us being the main character and should probably be out saving the world instead of spamming his \"chat\" 30 times just to see if the dialogue changes. Only to punish us with a long, \"boring\" and unskippable dialogue.\n\nI didn't regret a single second I spent bothering him and it still amazes me how self-aware the game is and how It uses the knowledge in a way that makes the game all the more fun to play. Like putting less emphasis on the story and more on entertaining dialogues and scenarios.\n\nThe levels are varied with enemies being used as both obstacles and tools to help manuvering through levels that gradually gets more difficult, as they're pushing the boundaries on how the game can be interacted with.\n\nVisually and auditory, The Messenger presents itself in a pixelated format, all 16-bits included, but It doesn't stop there. The game takes place in two seperate timelines that you'll easily travel to through portals scattered about. Moving though one timeline could present a path unavailable in the other. This mechanic is sometimes included to get through certain areas. But my point is, not only does the game look and sound great. The different timelines are also created with a seperate artstyle. Yes, both the looks and sound instantly switch when going through a timeportal. Creating cool moments were you'll have to go though the flow of the levels, even through time.\n\nSo the game turned out to be about a time traveling Ninja who needs to deliver a message in order to save the world.\n\nI had a great time playing this and there's no doubt you'll feel the same. It's just a shame how easily it is to overlook it as something less than what it truly is, how it can easily go unnoticed among the thousands of titles here on steam.\n\nOne last thing.\nI'd like to thank the passionate people who crafted this game and I appreciate the publisher for signing it which helped them get noticed. You people have made something truly awesome and I'm looking forward to anything you'll do next.",
      "Before I continue writing my review on this game, I got to say that the PC port of Valkyria Chronicles is one of the best, if not, [u]the[/u] best port. The game was originally exclusive for the PlayStation 3 back in 2008. The game was well received, but garnered low sales that would put the sequels Valkyria Chronicles 2 and 3 on the PSP. I actually never heard of this game before until a few week prior to the PC release on November 2014. That said, I will have to give a standing ovation to Sega for putting an effort to make the PC port well optimized in 1080p (or more) at 60 FPS (or more). Sega has my attention and I will present this review.\n \nValkyria Chronicles focuses on Welkin Gunther, a son of a legendary general who fought in the First Europan War, leads a platoon of some adults and teenage volunteers to defend their country against the invading forces of the Imperial Alliance. The game presents a mix of tactical strategy and third-person action that is very unique in the strategy game genre. Does this game deserve your attention? \n\nThe story takes place in a “fictional” European continent where the Second Europan War was fought primarily between the Atlantic Federation (think of all of the European countries, in a geographical sense) versus the Imperial Alliance (Russia, in a geographic sense). Gallia is a “neutral” country where it contains a unique resource known as Ragnite. Thus, the Imperial Alliance invade Gallia to get Ragnite to fuel up their war resources. One of the greatest parts about the game is how well the developers use analogies from World War II into the game and its execution is well-received. The analogies ranged from weapon designs (like the Gallian Scout weapons that look like the Soviet SVT-40 to the Imperial weaponry comparison to the real-life MP40 and STG44, and plenty others). The analogy extends to vehicles and geopolitical conflicts. \n\nThe character developments in the game are highly impressive, particularly with the relationship between Welkin (protagonist) and Alicia Melchiott (deuteragonist). The themes in Valkyria Chronicles consist a good mix of “light” moments (like hope as an example) and “semi-grotesque” themes of war (such as discrimination/racism, personal ambition over soldiers’ lives, and others themes that will unravel later on). Some reviewers criticized the game as being not serious on the themes about war. Honestly, I don’t think that the game is supposed to be depressing and a good mix between “light” and “dark” is best suited for the game. The story starts really slow in the beginning and actually begin to progress as you reach a certain point in the story. The plot is pretty good in most area while few scenes are a bit “awkward” in terms of sudden shifts between a sad event to a “positive motivation”. \n\nThe gameplay in Valkyria Chronicles is turn-based, but it is very unique because once you click on a character to choose, you can actually control the character to move to any location in third-person you like as long you have enough Action Points (basically, the movement bar). Experience points and money are earned by Ranks (like A, B, C, and D) by completing an objective within a certain number of turns (Example: Getting a ‘A’ rank within 3 turns or less to get the maximum amount of exp and money). However, it is possible that you can actually kill all of the enemies on the map, complete the objective, and still get an ‘A’ rank in the majority of missions (except for a few of them). \n\nWith the exp and money, you train your soldiers based on classes Scout, Shocktrooper, Lancer (Anti-Tank/Explosives), Engineers, and Sniper rather than individuals. The money are used up to upgrade weapons, buy tank parts, and purchasing “reports” from a reporter in certain chapters in the story. The game would last you a good 30-50 hours if you play the game in a smart, tactical manner or have an “OCD” on getting an “A” rank on every single mission in the story or a mix of both (like I did). \n\nThe game does have some faults, particularly when it comes to classes. Reviewers argued that Scouts are too overpowered, but in my view, it is best to say that scouts are too reliable since they have the most movement bar and top-tier weapons like the ZM Kar 8 (the game's version of Soviet PTRS-41 that can obliterate any enemy, even medium and heavy tanks if you shoot it in the back). Engineers are useless in the game since you won’t repair your tank very often (depending on your play style) and Scouts are the better alternative. There are some bugs in the game that is related to the monitor refresh rate (if you play it on a 144 Hz monitor like I did) in certain missions in the story. PC controls are a bit awkward when you control the tank. There are a few moments in the story that has some poor “transitions” (an example would be that an upsetting moment happened in the story and all of a sudden, some of the major characters wanted a medal for their part on a major battle in the next cutscene as if that upsetting moment never happen or affected them). \n\nThe game is often compared to XCOM when it comes to gameplay. This may be true, but Valkyria Chronicles is very unique since you can actually control the character in third person instead of the computer doing it for you when you command the character to move from Point A to B, in bird’s eye view. The game engine is very aesthetic and presents the story very well. I’m glad the Sega released Valkyria Chronicles to the PC and I am very pleased to hear that a (possible) new Valkyria Chronicles game is being trademarked (and hopefully in development) thanks to the PC sales. The default price of $20 is a good deal, -50% off is a great deal, -75% is a perfect steal. Valkyria Chronicles is one of my top games for 2014 due to its unique strategy gameplay and superb PC port optimization. I am looking forward for the new game that is being trademarked (or possible PC ports or revamp for VC2 and 3). This game has my highest recommendation for any strategy gamer who want to find something original, unique, and beautiful.",

The game couldn't completly figure out my game pad buttons on it's own and I had to re-set every button and it's a pain in the a$$. There's a MAJOR learning curve if you think you can use the keyboard, plus I highly doubt you can hit every single button at the exact time you need to press it. If your getting this in a console then thats awesome. But I don't recommend getting this from steam and playing in your Pc. If only they had figure out the controls then I would have given 10/10.

      "$15 during the autumn sale was a great price for a ton of fun and a game with some truly breathtaking visuals and effects, one of the best looking games I have ever seen. It is a worthy addition to the JC franchise. Combat is more of the same from JC2, there's tons of explosions, a big open world, great sound and music, and solid mission progression without having to grind which is becoming a thing of the past now with microtransactions in games. The game's biggest flaws are that dirt bike handling is the worst vehicle handling I have ever seen in any video game, some wingsuit missions are beyond frustrating, and it is Square so it of course isn't optimized very well unless you have a powerful setup. That and the ending is one big lazy cop out sucky easy boss fight.\n\nI was luckily able to bypass optimization issues with a powerful setup and minor tweaks. So don't risk it unless this is on sale, your pc is powerful, and also provided you don't mind a few crashes in a couple missions. Just remember that Square is #1 in continually barfing out horrible pc ports and they will never learn so even with a beast pc you are still taking a chance.\n\n7/10 because of a ton of glitches I didn't mention that would take way too long to write down, and because of Square continually sucking balls on making optimized pc games. In which they cannot do.",
      "When I show new games to one of my friends she always asks if it is possible to pee in the game and sadly I usually must tell her that it isnt possible because there is so few games where this special detail is being paid attention to. But this here my dude! I tried to show her the game yesterday so I got her setup on the valve index and start the game all good, but we couldn’t move at all... We tried everything! We tried physically move in our vr room to see the boards that had text written on them because we spawned behind them which I found a little weird as well. On the board it said eat the hamburger to start the game or eat the poo to guit. I saw a box on the street and I remembered by seeing the trailer there was a box where inside there was a burger so immediately we worked hard to try and reach the burger so we could start the game. It was too far away for us to try and actually in real life walk to it so we had to just accept defeat. She didn’t get to see her first vr game where it would be possible to urinate. I saw a update post a few minutes ago where you were saying something about movemnet in the game that you have to grip and throw arms around or something? This I guess we didn’t try since usually moving is one of the triggers to teleport or just the stick like in any controller. Today we will try again and hopefully succeed in our task to urinate in a vr game! You could be making history today my friend. And for all the bad reviews for this game I want to just say a couple things: cmon dude. Its one guy whos making this game! It is cheap and early access... those already tell you a lot about the game and you should not expect a triple a title and the experience of the century. I went through a video game making school or whatever which took 3 years so it was not 2 weeks online course I just quit after the first week so I actually know a lot what it takes to make games and with this I can tell there has been some hours used to it, but again it’s only one dude. My game didn’t work either, but it might have been because we didn’t know how to play. I’m not complaining for 4 dollars, I’m not a hobo ;)\n\nEDIT: And there it is!

      "First of all - Subnautica is a good game. Very atmospheric, very scary and overall a really overwhelming experience. At first. \nThis might be the only negative review in this month, but I think some of you might appreciate a different view than \"omg this game is just awesome\". Which it kinda is, but in some points it maybe isnt.\n\nThis first section of the review doesnt contain any major spoilers for the story, just a comment on the overall progress through the game stages.\nAt the time of writing this review, I played the game for ~ 35 hours, I have advanced quite a bit. The first few hours were fantastic, I was looking for new things to explore, the blueprints for all the stuff that I need and every new thing felt like I made a progress. But then at a certain point nothing new happend. It seemed to me like I had all resources I could ever need (even the blue crystals), I had all the vehicles you could build, all the upgrades I needed.\nAnd then there was no challenge anymore. You build your submarines, your bases and the game gets too easy, its not a challenge anymore. Don't continue reading after this point, if you havent played the game yet.\n\n[spoiler] The big strength of this game is the immersion in the seemingly endless underwater worlds. But at a certain point this immersion breaks (at least it did for me).\nNone of the monsters can really harm you, not even the biggest ones are a real threat. Just hop into you seamoth and out-speed everything. If there is a leviathan, just hug the walls or strave, they cant catch you. And if they do, just step out, repair your ship and continue. None of the threats is really dangerous. You really need to have bad luck to die. And if you do ... nothing happens. You just respawn.\nAt first the map seems endless, since you cant move fast. But once you get the seamoth, the map is very finite. Sure, there are deeper levels you cant access with the moth, but everything on the surface is within reach. Its the same with the deeper levels and the prawnsuit.\nSurvival is hard at first, since you constantly need to get water and food. Once you can plant you own food, you have unlimited supply and the survival aspect becomes just an annoyence.\n\nAnother thing that bothers me is the amount of resources you need to build stuff. In the later part of the game you need to build a giant structure. But the necessary resources are just like \"get 3 wooden planks, 2 nails and a hammer\". And with these resources you build the statue of liberty.\n\nMy last point is about the storyline. After something like 15 hours into the game there was a major stall for me - I had no clue where to go, to me it seemed like I searched everything I had access to at that time. I searched for 10 hours and found nothing. I went to the Islands twice to check if I missed anything, but no. I dont know, maybe I just had bad luck and something didnt trigger right, I missed a hint somewhere or something. It eventually went on, but on that point I already had the big submarine, the prawnsuit and everything. The story felt like I just need to run from A to B and back, there was no challenge anymore. \n [/spoiler]\n\nSo anyways. If you made it this far in the review, thanks for reading. If you disagree with me, thats totally fine for me. I don't want to ruin the game for anyone, maybe the points that bother me dont mean much to you.\nI know that my critique is pretty harsh. There are many positive aspects in this game. If you can really dive into this game and fully roleplay it, submerge in its story and ignore some flaws, this is a fantastic game.\nBut maybe some of you are like me, so some of my mentioned points could bother you too.\nThanks for reading, I hope I didnt butcher the English language too badly, feel free to comment, if you like.",
      "Know your History: \n\nMany of you will already know this, but this game has ties much deeper than you think. It's no secret that Bethesda's Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim had extended it's life through an extensive modding community. For decades, literally, ENBs, shaders, textures, companions, and even story-lines added THOUSANDS of hours to an already sizable game. One story-line mod was called \"The Forgotten City\".  Over the next few years since it's release, the mod had acquired awards such as the 2016 Australian Writers' Guild Award, Zero Period Top 5 Quest Mods of 2015, and others. It was an astounding mod that threw the dragon born into a deeply profound, well written, and engaging story. It was a staple for my personal mod list for years. I've played the Skyrim version countless times, but as soon as I saw this release I immediately bought this and booted it up. \nObviously this is nothing like the mod, both visually or engine wise, but the spirit of the game is still there. It's more defined, expanded, and developed. It deserves every award and accolade it's received. When I walked into the opening scene and fell down the tunnel I couldn't help but shake my head and smile as a wave of nostalgia mixed with new expectations flooded my mind:\n\n\"My god, they've done it.\" \n\nHere's to you, Modern Storyteller, all the best and more to come!",

      "Absolutely the second best (half-life Alyx is the best game) VR game I have played in the last 5+ years.  Both RM1 and RM2 are fantastic, superb graphics, excellent story and game play.  I took my time and explored and the game time ended up just over 13 hours.  But the big diff is this game was developed by a very small non-AAA team while Half life Alyx was created with a large AAA dev team with unlimited budget.  The quality/game play of recently released VR games has been exceptionally poor and very disappointing to say the least.  But NOT THIS GAME, RED MATTER 2 excels in every area and is simply a great game that will keep you playing.     \n\nI played using Vive Pro 1 wireless with vive wands and had no issues with controllers or my HMD.

      "This is such a great game. It's a well put together survival game with many things to do. Whether you want to just build a sandbox wilderness empire or try to escape, it's entirely fun no matter what. I've tried to actually complete the game, but I always end up building a massive epic fortress complete with my very own beefalo farm. The only thing that I personally don't like about this game is the stumble-upon style of actually completing the quests (they're not really quests, but I can't think of anything else to call them). Other than that, this game is a beautiful masterpiece. Very artistic, creative and fun. I definitely recommend it to anyone who loves survival games of any sort.",
      "Lots of people parrot the \"tech demo\" or \"benchmark of the singularity\" lines without forming their own opinions.\n\nMe personally, as a fan of Supreme Commander, I enjoyed this game more then I thought I would. I only played the single player campaigns and haven't touched multiplayer. \n\nThe gameplay is exactly what it should be for this kind of game. When I first saw this game I didn't like how every unit was a hovering unit, but it makes sense with the class system the game has. Frigates are basically infantry, Cruisers are tanks, Dreadnauts are hero/high tier. The game borrows from Dawn of War with the territory control mechanic.",
      "In my personal opinion,Total War Warhammer 3 is better than its predecessor in every way.\n\nFactions:\nThey did an excellent job t fine tuning the older factions to the point where every faction now feels fully fleshed out and playable. The starting units are fun and the starting areas are usually in a better position. Sure, some factions start off in a really awkward ass places with really strong armies surrounding them, but overall, everything feels much more thought out.\n\nThe new factions they added to this game are fun altho for someone who might be just getting into the game, id recommend going with someone like Grand Cathay and move on from there.\n\nMap:\nThe world map is huge and i love it. The battle fields you fight in are detailed and look absolutely stunning. Fights look like movies sometimes so grab some popcorn and watch your armies die since you were munching on popcorn and not moving your units.\n\nRTS:\nthe RTS side of this game is what got the biggest improvement in my opinion. Everything is so much more clear and the battles just look insanely good. The game feels a bit more fast phase which i don't mind at all since WH2 felt like a battle of attrition sometimes and missile infantry seemed really bad.\n\nOverall i can safely say this i my favorite game currently. The multiplayer is super fun but judging by the reviews some of you leave on this game, its safe to say you have no friends to play with. \n\nDLC might cost bit more than it used to but people will complain about anything if its not free.",

      "EDIT:\n\nWhile I have played Squad quite a bit for a few years, the large update named \"V6.0 Infantry Combat Overhaul\" unfortunately did not sit well with me.\n\nThe goals for the update:\n\n- Increase length of fights.\n- Reduce the impact of lone wolfs (solo players).\n- Increase emphasis on teamwork mechanics, which mainly meant supression.\n- Increase gunplay diversity, to create choices between optics, since the old meta meant that the magnified optics were greatly outperforming iron sights and holo sights.\n\nWhile I do not disagree with some of the goals, the implementation of them left a lot to be desired.\n\nAfter the update most gunfights became a mess of supression, without either side being able to effetively kill each other beyond 200m.\nGunhandling was also drastically nerfed, creating the sense that your character has never held a rifle before, or even used an optic for that matter.\n\nI can unfortunately no longer recommend this game, since I myself no longer feel drawn to play it.\n\nIf enough changes are made, I may revisit the game and this review, but for now there are better options out there.\n\n\n** OLD REVIEW ** \n\nCan the game be amazing and fun - yes! Do I recommend this for everyone? - No.\n\nThe experience of the game largely depends on what servers / communities you play with. If you play the core game with no moderation (no rules or admins), the game will become a race to make the first unit and lock others out and a race to get armor, then proceed to rush the enemy and end up spawnkilling them near their main spawn.\n\nIf you play on moderated servers with established rules and active admins, then you may experience a great sense of teamplay - other times not so much.\n\nBefore you buy it though...\n\n- Microphone and willingness to use it is REQUIRED for a good experience (People will quickly kick or become hostile towards you, if you do not communicate)\n- This is not battlefield or call of duty, running of solo to pull off 360 noscopes will probably get you kicked/ killed.\n- You will die without knowing from where and you will get into situations in which you have no option to survive, especially if you're new to tactical shooters.\n- You will end up running... A lot..\n- Armor is not like battlefield or call of duty, you need a driver, gunner, commander and possibly a loader (has a machinegun). Where you hit the enemy matters as much as what you hit him with (Armor piercing on his front turret will likely bounce, but even a high explosive may hurt if you can hit him up the rear)\n\nStill here... ?\n\nIf I haven't scared you off, here are my personal tips:\n- Play. The. Tutorial.  Like really...\n- Try different graphic settings, shadows especially makes a big difference in enemy visibility (game looks better with them though)\n- Start as infantry and pick rifleman, but remember to join a squad.\n- Find a server that seems to have active admins and have a ruleset you agree with.\n- Try NOT to give up when you die, generally it isn't worth throwing away a ticket to respawn if you have friendlies within 100m. Sometimes it is the right choice, but before you know which is which, it's a good idea to hold on for a medic.\n- Not all squad leaders know what they're doing, do not be afraid to join another squad if it turns out your squad leader is a fool.\n- Defending is often as important (if not more), than attacking... But you may end up waiting 30 minutes without getting shot at or shooting anyone.\n\n\nAs you can probably tell... Squad is a community based game, with in-depth enough mechanics, while also being easily accessable.\nIf you want a good sense of what the game is, check out some lesser known streamer playing it (bigger streamers will often give you the wrong sense of what a game is like)\n\nHope this helped you make an informed decision.\n\nbut for now there are better options out there.",
      "It's about time i wrote a proper review for one of my favourite games ever.\n\nRivals of Aether is a platform fighter that tries to follow Super Smash Bros. Melee and P+'s footsteps by making a competitive focused game, but also while trying to keep it more accessible than the former. The game also has a very active workshop that allows players to create their own characters and play ones made by other creators, alongside custom made stages and buddies.\n\nI will focus on the purist aspect of the game first.\n\nAs for many \"smash clones\", the game will feel very familiar to people who already played a smash game, with the controls being nearly identical but with some key differences:\n\n1. THERE'S NO SHIELD. Rivals of Aether is probably the first game in its genre to forgo the iconic \"bubble\" shield, choosing it to replace it with a parry instead. Parries are riskier, staying out for a few frames, and will reward you immensely by either stunning the opponent or reflecting their projectiles. Since parrying is so risky, the game's neutral and defense (but also its offense) will be focused on movement, especially thanks to wavedashing, wavelanding alongside some more niche or character specific movement techs. \n\n2. THE STAGES HAVE NO LEDGES. This means your way to safety when you get knocked off the stage will be actually landing onto the main platform, rather than aiming for the ledges. Rightfully so, the game offers much more options when offstage compared to smash games, with every character having access to wall jumping, an airdodge that doesn't send in freefall and the ability to walljump and cancel special falls, allowing you to use your up special two times. This means the offstage game is a lot deeper than in other game, as there will always be a way back onto the stage since almost every character is allowed a lot of freedom while in disadvantage.\n\n3. THERE'S NO GRABS. There's not much to add here; the absence of a shield makes grabs unnecessary, and thus they're not present in the game. Some characters have command grabs, though.\n\nThere's a total of 14 characters in Rivals of Aether (free from the beginning), with 4 more to come in future patches. Although the cast might seem very slim for people who are used to smash games, it's incredibly diverse. Enough to probably warrant you to try every character. Each character has a lot of depth and can shape the stage in some way. Some fighters take inspiration from smash characters, such as Clairen having a tipper mechanic like Marth, or Absa having Ness and Mewtwo's movement turned up to 200 and Zelda's lightning kicks; this means you'll probably find a character you're familiar with in case you're not confident to play with a brand new character yet. It's also worth mentioning that the game is very balanced, with tiers being very subjective. Regardless, RoA's current top player plays the character that is considered the worst in the game by most, so that should prove that the balance state is very good.\n\nNetplay is not perfect, but it's very good and playable. As i'm writing this review, there's currently a beta build that includes rollback netcode, which presents a couple of bugs and desyncs but does its job quite well. Default build uses delay netcode, which also works just fine in case you're dissatisfied with the rollback beta. Rollback is expected to become the default build once the dev team fixes all its kinks.\n\nEvery stage has both an \"aether\" (casual, with hazards) mode and a \"basic\" (competitive, no hazards) mode. Every single stage in \"basic\" mode is tournament legal (with the exception of tempest peak in some regions), adding a lot of stage variety. Aether stages are aimed for a casual audience, with some spicy traps and whacky platform arrangements for a more casual and laidback experience.\n\nOn that topic, there's no items in this game, so the chaotic free-for-all  factor goes down by a notch, to the discomfort of players who like the party game side of platform fighters.\n\nThe community may be small, but it's very active and constantly organizes weekly and monthly tournaments, with the active (financial and whatnot) support of the game devs themselves, so you will quickly find a community in which to play. Sadly, though, having a small community means you'll be bound to experience some \"dead lobbies\" from time to time.\n\nSolo play, i'll have to be honest, is incredibly lackluster. This game was mainly thought to be played with other players and as a result, single player content is very scarce. There's an arcade-styled story mode which only features a handful of characters (the original 4+2 more), that will have you fight some random fighters until you reach your character's \"rival\" at the end of the story. The cutscenes go from average to bad, depending on the character's story. Each story is very simple and resolves itself in the course of 5 encounters, with a super boss+ a final cutscene once you complete every character's story mode\n\nThere's also \"endless abyss\" mode. It's similar to smash's multi-man mode, where you'll fight a never ending horde of weak cpus, with some minigames slapped inbetween, like a platforming section or explosive enemies. You will have to fight a weaker version of the story mode's boss after a set number of waves each time. The most interesting part of this gamemode is probably the rune system. The rune system will allow to buy runes with the in-game currency that will make your character stronger, be it by making them faster/more powerful or improving their moves. These runes can also be used in abyss versus, which is basically pvp but with runes.\nSadly, endless abyss can become repetitive very quickly, with its never changing waves and gimmicks and grind you have to go through to be able to buy (and use) your runes.\n\nThere's one more mode called Tetherball. It's actually a PvP mode, but i'm putting it in the solo play paragraph because it's a very casual mode. Simply put, the goal of this mode is to hit a beach ball that is attached to a pole by a string and make it spin around it. You score one point when the ball-on-a-string completely wraps the pole. You will have to fight your opponent to keep the control of the ball, as they can hit it as well and make the ball \"theirs\". It's a very fun but often shunned aside mode so i felt like putting it in this review. Please, play Tetherball with me. \n\n\nAs for workshop...\n\nIf you're not big on the competitive scene of platform fighters, this is probably why you came to this store page and. as you may have gathered, casual play is not very fleshed out, with only aether mode and some solo modes as your only options. That's where workshop shines! You'll be able to download hundreds of play made characters, some with the intent of being serious, competitive fighters, while others (most) are aimed to a more casual audience. Characters can go from original characters to the reckless wii mote guy, so you'll have plenty of fun by browsing the worshop page and finding the perfect character, be it an original character or a direct transposition of greninja from Smash Ultimate. Needless to say, you'll also have a huge choice of stages and music packs, alongside some hidden gems like new gamemodes that often pass under the radar. I bet you didn't know you could play Uno in Rivals of Aether!\n\n\n\nTo wrap things up, i'd like to comment on the great pixel art graphics which does its job very well and will appeal to retro gamers specifically, and give my shoutouts on the incredible OST made by flashygoodness. Every track fits the stage perfectly and gives the right atmosphere to this fast paced fighting game.\n\nIn other words this game is a very good purchase for both casual players, thanks to the workshop, and competitive players because of its deep yet accessible design. I hope this review made whoever is reading it consider buying Rivals of Aether and join the community.",
      "If you want to cut your teeth on the Final Boss of box-pushing puzzle games, then have I got the game for you.\n\nRight out of the gate SSR offers a somewhat uneven mix of real head-scratchers and what I can only describe as pity puzzles, but quickly reveals itself to be the sort of puzzler that mandates particularly extensive sessions of staring at the seemingly inconsequential number of tiles onscreen and poking experimentally at them until something starts to click. This demands a little more patience than I ordinarily have, but I was starting to appreciate the design as I acclimatized to it.\n\nThen I arrived at The Great Tower level (in only the second subsection of the overworld), which all at once foists about 4 times more pieces on you than you've dealt with previously, while simultaneously introducing a Z-axis and the concept of using pieces as platforms mid-puzzle.\n\nSSR does have a well-executed and forgiving Undo function with basically unlimited storage which is a great thing to have up until the time spent rewinding would outweigh the time spent to simply restart the puzzle and do over; the only way it could be made practical on a level that large would be if you had a full-on timeline scrubber like in the rerelease of Duke Nukem 3D.\n\nThere's patience, there's logic, and then there's [b]this.[/b] I play puzzle games to try and [i]relieve[/i] stress, not the other way round.

      "Stellaris is the contemporary 4X sci fi galactic empire grand strategy to play.  The spiritual successor to ancient space exploration games like Master of Orion and Star Wars: Rebellion.  Start out with just your homeworld and send out scout ships and colonies until you've got your own star empire. \n\nManage your population, tell them what to build, design your own spaceships and fleet structures, and then get pounded into the dirt by the far too cheaty AI... yeah, it's another one of those games where because it's hard to make the AI smart, Paradox decided instead to just make the AI units cheat and become ridiculously overpowered.\n\nI have to say the game is probably far too difficult even if you set all the difficulty to the easiest levels, it's unclear what the developers were thinking, but you can mod the game easily in Steam Workshop to make it viable to play single player. \n\nAs with all Paradox games the DLC pricing is murder, and it adds very little to the core game experience, so my advice is to grab this on sale if you were a fan of MOO, go straight to Steam Workshop and mod it until it's playable, and then you'll have a perfect time sink well worth your money.",

      "In my ongoing and likely futile effort to write a Steam review for every game in my library (#21 out of 500+)... it's time for Trails in the Sky: The 3rd.\n\nIf you haven't played both Trails in the Sky and Trails in the Sky SC, go away. This game is not for you.\n\nIf you have played the Trails in the Sky duology, you're almost certainly going to buy this game no-questions asked. Which is fine. Clearly you are a person of impeccable taste and judgment. There are, however, a few things you should probably be aware of before you dive it.\n\nThe 3rd is not really an indpendent game in its own right--it's more of a Gaiden game. It functions mostly as an extended epilogue to the classic Trails in the Sky duology, while also laying down the foundations for future story arcs (upon which much has been built in the Crossbell and Erebonia sequences).\n\nThe game is effectively divided into three kinds of content: lots of dungeon crawling; mostly indpendent character scenes (taking the form of flashbacks) featuring familiar characters from the prior two Sky games; and mini-games! The dungeon-crawling is fairly generic, as the combat system here is more or less the same as in the prior games, and many of the environments you'll be exploring are the exact *same* environments you explored back in FC and SC. There are some new areas to explore, but not many, and personally I found them too abstract to be very interesting. The mini-games are extremely varied and range from incredibly tedious (playin' poker with Gambler Jack) to the amazing (airship shmup!), and can be a lot of fun. The real meat of the game are the character vignettes, all of which are--at the very least--amusing. If you're here, you've likely already fallen in love with these characters, and you'll be glad to know that everyone gets their time in the spotlight here, and the character writing is as strong as ever.\n\nThat said, not everything is sunshine and roses.There is a \"present\" story arc tying all of those flashbacks, dungeons and mini-games together. and... there's no getting around it: it's not very good. The story is short and relatively predicable, with little dialog and less exposition. Our new protagonist, Kevin Graham, performs solidly here--but fails to be quite as interesting as he was in SC--and his lovely lady heroine, Ries Argent, is among the least compelling characters in the entire Trails pantheon, owing mostly to her lack of screenstime. She is absent from entire swaths of the game, and despite her enormous potential, simply does not get sufficient dialog to properly develop. She really only interacts with Kevin, infrequently, and is isolated from the rest of the cast.\n\nUtlimately Trails in the Sky: The 3rd is a bit underwhelming. It's a fun romp, but it could have been so much better with a little more focus on the narrative. The absence of NPCs to talk to, the simplistic structure of the plot, and the underdeveloped heroine are all flaws that are difficult to dismiss.",
      "I was waiting to be a bit further into the game to give my thoughts on some of the early complaints I've seen cropping up around this game.\n\nFrankly I do not think this game will be for everyone, but some of the people leaving negative reviews are morons.\n\nNo progression in this game is not locked behind story progress. There are several ways the game marks player progression, and while story progression is one of them. The reward track, gear, and gems are the other. You can consider all of this side-content in some way. You mostly make additional progress through exploration and side quests in this game. Each time you enter a new area you're given several tasks on a reward track that allow you to gain SP to level up your skills, and the reward material that allows you to learn new skills. As you learn new skills your character's stats go up. Exploration and sidequests also allow you to gain unique materials that you sell to merchants that open up deals that allow you to buy high level equipment that give large power boosts to your party. The gem system allows you to slot  gear with upgrades to further customize your characters, and all weapons/armor are able to be upgraded twice.\n\nIf you go out of your way to find the hidden treasures, beat the unique monsters, and finish side quests you can sort of trounce the challenges in this game. Class Emblems which give 'very' large power boosts are also hidden out of the way sometimes. You really just have to search for them, but by no means are they necessary.  I have had no difficulty at all in this game. It's relatively easy to grasp, but it does ask you to pay attention a little more than most JRPGs. If you interact with the systems the game has then the progression curve is smooth. If you don't -- that's not really the game's fault.\n\nOn the subject of the Overdrive Bar. Once you get into it the upper left corner will ask you to use a SINGLE move to help maintain the bar. It will ask you to use either: A physical attack, magic attack, buff, debuff, or utility spell. It is not hard to throw in one of these during the party's turn, and you very much can spam moves over and over again. The system is not at all that obtrusive, again, you just have to pay attention. \n\nIf for some reason all of this is not good enough for a player on a baseline level. There are accessibility options that allow you to adjust how aggressive enemies are, how high their stats are, and you can even make the overdrive bar extremely more forgiving. \n\nThe world is well crafted, the story is fine thus far, the combat is fun and it does try some new things. I certainly appreciate the experience for what it is. The price they're charging for this game feels absolutely criminal, and there's clearly a lot of love put into it. Give it a shot.",
      "Coming up to 5000 hours playing this game, and im still learning new things in multiplayer.  \n\nThe devs are by far the best ive ever seen.  FFF (Friday Fun Facts) is a blog post they write up every Friday.  Every. Single. Friday. For the last ... 4 years?  look at them on their website, its not a 2 min blurb, its a full review of what they've done that week, and where they're headed, what their plans are, current iterations they're going over, complete with pictures and sometimes *chuckle* hand drawn graphs.  \n\nTheir IRC channel (there is a link on their website) has someone on the dev team there pretty much 24/7.  Not just \"community manager\" nitwits (Trangar, te he), but guys like Rseding91 (their C++ guru) that are programming the actual updates.  \n\nOh.  There are updates.\n\nAre there sometimes bugs in the patches?  Sure.  Which is why you sometimes see 2 patches in the same day.  Bugs get quashed immediately whenever possible.  \n\nWhile this review doesnt speak much about the game, the team behind it deserves the recognition - its amazing, thoughtul, and incredibly well done because of them.\n\nIn a nutshell, its similar to RTS games like starcraft, where you build up and gather resources.  But instead of spending 20 minutes to build up a base to have the game end in 2, you keep building.\n\nBuilding Bigger.\n\nMaking things more efficient.\n\nTearing down and rebuidling.\n\nIm almost 5000 hours in and sticking with vanilla until I can personally say Ive mastered it.  Once I stop learning new things almost every time I play, ill start fooling around with mods.  And there are lots of them.  \n\nIs this game worth $20?  It absolutely was for me.  This single $20 purchase brought me thousands of hours of entertaintment, frustration - when things didnt work planned, and absolute delight - when things get fixed, and I can reflect on my orchestra of 500 machines working in harmony.  \n\nWhether or not it is worth it for you is up to you.  But I would be remiss if i didnt impore you to give it a try, get the demo, fool around, commit an hour or two.\n\n",
      "Let's say you capture a prisoner after a bloody raid on your colony. Do you want to:\n\n1. Let them go in the hopes of improving relations with the attackers? YOU CAN DO THAT.\n\n2.

Have a colonist with a high medical skill remove their liver to transplant into an alcoholic colonist? YOU CAN DO THAT.\n\n4.

      "Pretty fun and polished for a fast paced shooter.\nOn the technical side, the game ran well and I encountered very few bugs: in a few cases I got stuck in the level geometry, but then a failsafe teleported me back to a safe spot after a few seconds, and in another case I got softlocked by a broken level trigger but reloading the last checkpoint fixed it.\nAll the weapons are fairly useful and interesting, and they can be combined in creative ways instead of the extremely boring \"use A on B\" seen in Doom Eternal.\nEnemy variety is pretty good, even the lowest tiers are different enough to require a bit of attention.\nThe levels also aren't bad, but you have so much mobility that it's easy to sequence break by accident and in some cases skip past large chunks of them.\nSecrets aren't terrible, no wall humping required in this game, but given the sheer size of most levels they can be pretty tedious to find even when no attempt is made to hide them: in some cases, the opposite is true and you'll just walk into a \"secret\" by looking to your side as you follow the intended path.\nDifficulty is odd: I was playing on Street Cleaner (the middle of the 5 difficulty levels), and around the halfway point the game went from \"very easy\" to \"very hard\", with plenty of attacks dealing 300+ damage when the most you can stack is 200 health and 200 armor.\nAt least, the augments you collect in-game and the mutators you unlock by finding secrets offer plenty of ways to fine-tune the difficulty level: for example, you can enable infinite ammo and instagib to breeze through even the hardest difficulty, or disable all weapons but your chainsaw leg and triple enemy spawns to turn even the easiest difficulty into a bit of a challenge.\nFinally, there's a level editor and that's always nice.\n\nWorth playing, even at full price.",
      "[h1] Risk of rain 2 is the kind of roguelike where you wanna have just one more quick run before bed but end up playing till dawn. [/h1]\n\n[b] Visuals: [/b] \nThe art style is easy on the eyes early on, but as the run continues and your screen starts to fill with clutter, the diarrhoea christmas lights at later stages can be seizure inducing.\n\n[b] Story and Setting: [/b] \nRoR2 doesn’t hold hands and guide you through its story because honestly there is not much story going on here. There is rich lore to explore for people who want to.\n\n[b] Music: [/b] \nThe lo-fi melody perfectly fits the perilous environment and matches the gameplay with synced rhythm and tempo. Sound design is good too.\n\n[b] Gameplay and progression: [/b]\nDrop into a planet, kill monsters, get money, buy items. Rinse and repeat until you become powerful to one shot God himself. Fast paced with constant running, jumping, sliding and juggling between primary weapon, secondary weapon, abilities and equipment. In each run the difficulty increases over time, which is an innovative approach to deal with difficulty. The roster is filled with unique characters who each have their own gameplay mechanics, making the game feel completely different. \nMost items can be obtained by completing specific challenges. You can also unlock game modifiers to make the game easier or more difficult to your liking. The challenges are one-of-a-kind, and the rewards are meaningful enough to keep players interested.\n\n[b] Game time: [/b]\nThere is no limit. It stops being fun when you decide so.\n\n[b] Online: [/b]\nThere is co-op to enjoy with friends and difficulty scales with the number of players. And if you have no friends, rest assured because all achievements are attainable through single player.\n\n[b] Bugs: [/b]\nNo bugs or technical issues.\n\n[b] PC Requirement: [/b] \nWithout a decently powerful PC the game faces severe lags and occasional crashes in long runs where you loop multiple times and a million things are happening in the background. Lowering graphical settings can help to an extent.\n\n[b] DLC: [/b]\nSurvivors of the Void DLC adds excellent new characters, stages, items,  enemies and alternate endings.\n\n[b] Price: [/b]\nWorth every penny.\n\n[b] My only problem with the game is it doesn’t have a save system. Once you start a run, you will have to see it through to the end. I want to be able to stop at any stage and continue from there later on. I don’t always have hours required to do multiple loops in one sitting. Although there is a mod for saving, I would love a native option. [/b]\n\n[b] Rating: [/b] \nThe Devs are continuously supporting and updating the game which is commendable. The community is very active and you can add tons of community made [b] mods [/b] to breathe new life into your game. \nI highly recommend it. [b] 10/10 [/b]",
      "ooooh im pigging out\n\njust like the original risk of rain but significantly more approachable!\n\nthey added controls, chris christododoldoaul and a bunch of retextures, got rid of that gup blackface enemy\nawesome\n\nthanks poopoo games for the review copy\n\n(spoilers ahead)\n\nincluding the mastery skins and void fiend from risk of rain 2 was an awesome surprise, nice to see so much new content\n\nonly complaint is the 100 dillar price tag for the game but otherwise a must buy\n\nUPDATE!!!\n\nAfter further playing, i have many very genuine issues! These providence trials are IM POSSIBBLE! the critreriar are simply absurd, and drifter is practically unplayable in his current state!!!\n\ni have also found a MULTITUDTE of vines allowing me to clip out of bounds?!?!?!? how did this game get past play testing TWICE\n\ni am not fibbing when i say this game in in an unacceptable state, how is this not in early access?! ridiculous, genuinely. gearbox! how could you",
      "You are an astronaut, you wake up in a rescue rocket, and against your wills you are shot from Theseus space station on Chori V planet. After landing on the planet you find a strange device that helps you get back on board and survive until help arrives.\n\nGreat game, get it on sale, because it is a bit short. I like games like Portal 2, The Talos Principle, and there is no point to compare this games, because they are completly different, even if they have few common things like solving riddles and story with fresh look at some philosophical questions. Point is that every one of them including The Swapper is good at what it do, and every one of them is unique. For me it is pleasure to play this game beacause of it atmospheric well done design, riddles and questioning the meaning of existence.",
      "Why do people think they are funny and rating something in the opposite direction to what is obviously their true opinion?  There should be a rule against that.  Oh ya, and the \"game\" is cringe-worthy.  Get it for $0.01 and mine it for $0.04 worth of cards.",

      "Anti-Consumer DLC Practices. Capcom pls.\n\nWith the brand new release of Rashid, we now know you cannot buy a single character outright, you have to buy packs of in-game currency. And the pricing structure is such that you have to buy more coins than a character costs. \n\nRashid is going for 350 coins, the lowest amount you can be is 250 coins for $5, so you have to pay $10 for 500c or $12 for 610c and have leftovers.\n\nTypical scummy bullshit you would expect from a terrible mobile game. Capcom does not need to resort to such tactics to sell content for a game as popular as Street Fighter. All this does is make people like me on the fence want to avoid spending  any additional money on anything to avoid supporting predatory and consumer unfriendly practices. \n\nCapcom knows exactly what they're doing with these pricing structures and it's super friggen scummy of them. \n\nHopefully by the time they add characters I really want to buy in a few years, things have changed. I went from looking forward to future DLC characters, to it being something I would never want to pay for and support because of this trash. \n\nSo, thank you (and eff you) very much Capcom. Please turn this nonsense around ASAP and let us buy single DLC characters outright with actual money.",
      "[h1]AT A GLANCE[/h1]\n(Full review follows below)\n\n[list]\n[*] [b]Game Name:[/b] The Swapper\n[*] [b]Original Release:[/b] 2013\n[*] [b]Genre Tags:[/b] Atmospheric; 2D; Puzzle-Platformer; Sci-Fi \n[*] [b]My Overall Grade:[/b] A-\n[*] [b]Estimated Playtime (Campaign):[/b] 3-5 hours\n[*] [b]Multiplayer Aspect:[/b] None\n[*] [b]Recommended To:[/b] Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Aesthetes; Game atmosphere connoisseurs; Strong narrative advocates; Puzzle game aficionados\n[/list]\t\n\n[h1]REVIEW[/h1]\n[b]The Swapper[/b] is an enjoyable 2D puzzle-platformer that lacks gameplay innovation but rises above the crowd on the shoulders of its superbly well-designed atmosphere and provocative narrative.  The actual puzzle-solving aspect of the game is adequate, but with minimal diversity and accretion.  It is definitely a story-driven experience, with the gameplay taking a passenger seat.  If you can appreciate a game in that style, this is a good bet for you. \n\nThe entrancing narrative and the style in which it transpires work in concert with the mystifying ambiance to create a wondrous experience. The story touches on some thought-provoking metaphysical issues, while skillfully avoiding a fall too deep into the rabbit hole to keep the average person’s interest. Much of the rest of the narrative is comfortable, cliché sci-fi tropes that we all know and love.\n\nThe gameplay and the puzzles are far from [i]bad[/i], but they also are nothing special.  As I alluded to: they are sufficient, but fail to develop into anything overly interesting. Very little changes from the first puzzle to the last, so it does get a little bit dry.  That said, some of the later ones are quite tricky and a few require not only puzzle-solving ability but also decent reflexes. \n\nThe graphics are pleasurable and align perfectly with the vibe of the game. But the whole soundscape is what truly brings the atmosphere of [b]The Swapper[/b] to life. The ambient soundtrack, the cryptic chatter, and the selectively placed voice-overs contribute a wonderful blend of emotions and mystery. If you are into it, this is a game you might enjoy with the lights off and your headphones on (or however else you may get into the zone).  \n\n[b]The Swapper[/b] is a brief, interesting, and enjoyable experience. It is not a complex or intricate puzzle-platformer, but I recommend it to any fan of the genre who would appreciate the atmosphere and narrative.\n\n[i][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/murphyslawyercuration#curation]Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations![/url][/i]",
      "They added \"Precision\" mode for the mouse under controls, which is pretty much raw mouse movement. YAY!\n\nAnyway, one of my favorite games of all time easily at this point. Incredible story, fun combat, and awesome world. A must play for sure, especially if you've never played it before on Play-Station (like me). It also has a New Game Plus mode that unlocks different NG+ only armor that are insane.\n\nI played at normal, and aside from the Valkyries the other bosses are a cakewalk. Maybe play on hard or hardest.",
      "This is a game that I have been looking forward to for at least 2 and a half years. I have wanted to have a game on the PC that had the elements of harvest moon (for the little bit I played of it), Animal crossing (<3) and Rune factory. I was super excited when I was approached by Leth (publishing manager at Chucklefish) at the beginning of December to help him and ConcernedApe (developer of the game) with bug testing and QA. 400+ hours later (off steam and on steam), I still love the game. \n\n[b]Farming.[/b] The farming is fantastic. It is to me one of the main elements of the game, and it's just a joy. Being able to design your farm any way you want it... yes please. Planning out what to buy every season, where to plant them, on top of the thrill of when you can harvest and reap on the gold... it's so enjoyable and addictive. \n\n[b]Fishing.[/b] The fishing is outstanding. From playing WoW and Runescape.. or any game with fishing, the fishing in Stardew Valley is so much fun. At first, the fishing is challenging, but as you progress your skill, you become a pro in no time.\n\n[b]Mining and combat.[/b] Mining and combat is incredible. Going deeper into the mines can be tough, but if you're prepared with your food and weapon in hand, you can fend off the creatures and get your sweet ore/minerals/gems that you want to bring back to your house and possibly hoard. (Hi, I'm Bexy, and i'm a hoarder.) \n\n[b]Social.[/b] Social interactions are great. Being able to become friends with the people in the town,  and eventually being able to get into relationships with people and having a family with them.. what's not to like about that? And what's great is that it gives great replayability because you can have different saves with different spouses! The backstory for each of the characters too is so in depth and well thought out, you will be silly if you don't shed a tear maybe once or twice. \n\n[b]Main story.[/b] The actual main story is well rewarding, and once you \"complete\" it, you can still continue on your adventures and farming life with no problems, hell you might even discover new things afterwards, I sure as hell did! \n\nYes, I was a tester for the game. Yes, I have played for ridiculous amounts of hours. It may feel like i'm being a bit overzealous with this. However you have to remember, I was a tester. I tested the crap out of every aspect with this game, even though there were massive game breaking bugs, errors, glitches, crashes. I still love this game. I reported many a bug, and ConcernedApe was quick to fix them. \n\nAnd that's the thing, not only is the game amazing, the developer is too. ConcernedApe works around the clock to make sure that bugs are fixed in quick time in order for us to have an amazing experience with this game. And that's true. The experience that you have with this game IS amazing. \n\nMinutes playing turn into hours. Hours turn into \"oh no it's time to sleep\".\nYou will forget about time. You will forget about sleep. You will forget that dinner was about 5 hours ago but you couldn't' remember because you were too busy trying to fight off 12 bats that were clobbering you inside the mines while trying to gather that 1 diamond waaaaay in the back. \n\nSo yes, I without a shadow of a doubt 150% recommend this game to anyone that wants to \"escape\" for days on end with what I am classifying as my #1 Game of 2016.",
      "Yume Nikki is a game that is better spent playing blind through. If you are thinking of playing this game, DO NOT LOOK AT YOUTUBE FOR ANY HINTS. There is no losing the game, and there is no winning the game, but if you look at youtube, you will lose a lot of the thematic feel of the game.\n\nI REPEAT, DO NOT LOOK AT YOUTUBE OR ANY OTHER GUIDE. YOU WILL MISS OUT ON AN EXPERIENCE.\n\nSaying that, Yume Nikki is a interactive experience following a young woman's dreams. By sifting through her dreams, you may come to conclusions about the player character's life, or you may find yourself reflecting on events in your life. I heartily reccomend this game to those who like mystery and speculation.",

      "Armored Souls Prepare to sigh....\nIf you are a long running fan of this game it's a mixed bag, if you are new to the series you might like it.\n\nFor the new comers this is robots on roller skates, also screw the natural laws of physics because it makes a cool game.  The key to this game is overwhelming fire power and maneuverability. Here's the rub for me I have AC1 and a PS2 to play it on, I have every US release of this game since AC1 to AC4A, I never finished Nine breaker as it was boring. Below are my gripes, my praise, then my mixed bag in order of paragraphs.\n\nFirst the bad: this game is infested with mechanics that are from Dark Souls and have no place in an AC game.  In no order here they are: status effects, stunning other players,  firing hand weapons cause you to stop moving and leave yourself vulnerable,  repair kits (the flasks from souls), being stunned due to poise (or whatever new dumb name they called it), resupply before a boss fight, and 360 shields.  Stats effects build up like they do in dark souls, this is new to the franchise and really has no place in it, I could see heat weapons causing things to over heat more quickly and maybe some other things, the way this is done is so odd, it feels like a multiplayer add on.  Although its fun to stun bosses and other opponents, this is new to the game and feels like it doesn't belong, I can only assume its been added for competitive multi again.  There's always been this idea that traumatic impacts don't hit the pilots in this game, it's just always been like that and considering the tech it make sense. The latter is true for your AC being stunned too.  AC as a series has gone back and fourth on making you stop to fire a BACK mounted weapon unless you had quad legs or a tank base, this game is the first where a hand weapon makes you stop to fire it.  This is an utter anathema to the game in general, maneuverability and quickly timed dodges were always key.  It ruins your ability to stay moving and fight effectively, which also limits the fun in building and designing your AC.  I don't think there is an AC game in the US with \"repair kits\" yet.  I'm not saying get gud we don't need repair kits, but they are just a distraction to me with no added value.  Giving a player a very high health value is not bad, but I makes each engagement more meaningful, I need to keep my HP high, their are may fights I had where I didn't need to bother with them.  Adding to this mess is the boost before a boss fight, they were never announced like this before; whatever HP you had going in was all you got.  This sticks with me, because the most memorable boss in the whole series was the only one I cannot beat: I took too much damage before the boss fight every time, no magic box to helped me out.  For those of you who are curious it was Zinaida in last Ravens, the suicide drones took too much out of me before the battle.  In AC4A and AC4 there were 360 shields, I'm only guessing, but the shields seemed to mitigate damage.  I don't know because don't get hit or kill them fast has always been my basic plan.  In this new one, its just another health bar that exists for reasons... I don't mind the old shield system give up a defensive advantage for things like assault armor blasts.\n\nThe good stuff.  I like the mix of common enemies being easily dispatched, but still being a threat if you are too slow.  Adding to this is the more dangerous commons like the quad leg MT's.  There is a good combat balance here with crazy mini bosses mixed in like the stealth sniper bots. The bosses are big and badass, with some conventions thrown out the window like the bull charging boss not being weak after a charge. I did hate all the boss fights that involved a 360 shield. The world looks great, yup just darn purdy.  The new super fast tank base inspired by a wheel chair is dumbly fun.  The odd addition of quad legs letting you basically hover is novel and adds some depth to the outfitting of an AC.  Keeping reverse joint legs making you jump faster/higher is classic. The more effective AOE weapons on groups feels more strategic or a the very least feels damn cool when you nail three targets with one shot. Finally letting your AC back mount hand weapons and switch to them at the price of a second or two is a massive evolution, I love it, it should have always been there.\n\nSo there some other things that have changed, which I have mixed thoughts about.  There's now a thing with chips that make you more resilient to damage and other RPGesq things, cool I guess, its another reason to do the arena.  I still will kill them all until I am #1. Hidden objects are now in the game, I don't like them, but whatever, first time I have had to google anything on AC game other then where to buy it.  The plot is oddly boring for me, I think that's just me, last game being AC4A. The game announces when you are making a plot altering decision, its ok, but I would like it if the world just reacted to my decisions naturally no banners.  Weak spots on bosses,  ok its a thing, but firing an AT or plasma weapon at something (that isn't a soft spot) does nothing...not matter how many impacts, ehhh fine. \n\nI'm not done with the game, but over all fun.  Quit making armored souls and make Armored Core.  I was here before demon souls and I will be here after whatever souls, but only if you just keep making ARMORED CORE.  Is there a Japanese word for purity of purpose or ideal? I could use it to try and get my point across. \n\n\nP.S. the fan community paint jobs uploaded on line are gold.\n",
      "Luzia reminds me of a little me and the banter between the characters is very cute. \nThis game gives me big Spirited Away vibes but even after I finished it I am still lowkey confused who is who and what what whats've? \nThere were many touching moments [spoiler]esp the scene where Luzia said \"I can't save you but I can help you\" it struck me pretty hard because I always question whether or not one has the right to take their own life, and who are we to stop them...[/spoiler] Overall I actually feel this game is wholesome. It can teach one about what depression is like if you've never experienced it.\nI only got jumpscared once but it was a pleasant experience even then :3",
      "At a first glance I thought I would hate [b]Human Fall Flat[/b]. \n“Oh, this is another one of those wonky psychics ragdoll games that are obnoxiously hard to control,” I thought. \n...\nAfter playing it, I can now confidently say that my first impression was spot on. The only surprise was how much I enjoyed playing it. \n \n[h1][u]Positive:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]I can’t fully explain why but I found Human Fall Flat charming. The “human” is adorably simplistic and can complete daunting tasks despite only being able to jump and grab onto things. It reminds me of a very energetic toddler, especially when you raise your arms and jump - [b]it’s so cute[/b]. Something about an awkward “human” taking on challenges makes me feel warm inside [i](is it weird that I feel like I’m watching a baby grow up?)[/i]. \n[*]The levels gradually get larger and the puzzles more complex. I find that this works well with the awkward movements of your character, as you progressively learn how to better control him/her. It’s almost as if you start off as a clumsy baby, learning how to move and perform simple tasks, and end up as an awkward adult, still clumsy but expected to complete harder tasks. \n[*]I’m impressed at how many interactable objects are included in this game. Paired with a pretty good physics engine and you can really have a blast. Swing on a vine like Tarzan? Why not. Row a boat? Sure. Shoot yourself out of a catapult? No one’s stopping you.\n[/list]\n\n[h1][u]Neutral:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]It’s not always clear what you are expected to do, but I guess that’s kind of the point of Human Fall Flat? From what I could tell, you can get past the obstacles in whatever way you like. Sure, there’s the intended way, but if you want you can just climb over things and rush to the end of the level. Or you can just fool around to your heart’s content. It’s essentially one big playground with a goal at the end. \n[/list]\n\n[h1][u]Negative:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]It can be frustrating when things don’t go as you expect. Since your character has the structural rigidity of jelly, you’re constantly battling the floppiness of your character. My advice is: don’t expect to move with precision and you’ll have a good time. I also encountered a few bugs, like my arms or legs getting stuck in an object. Luckily there are many checkpoints and it’s relatively quick to reload.\n[/list]\n \n[h1][u]Conclusion:[/u][/h1]\n[h1]★★★✬☆ Surprisingly fun[/h1]\nI was honestly surprised at how much fun I had playing Human Fall Flat. I tend to avoid ragdoll/physics-y games - Getting Over It, for example, looks like an absolute nightmare to me - but I don’t regret playing Human Fall Flat at all. \nHuman Fall Flat is an absolute blast if you don’t take it too seriously or just like goofing around. I wouldn’t recommend it if you prefer serious games, as it’s very likely that you will just end up getting frustrated. The choice is entirely yours. \n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th][h1]If you enjoyed this review please follow me on my [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/26827738-%27b-Reviews/?appid=241930]curator page[/url] and [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/breviews]group[/url].

      "You know that feeling when you are hesitant to buy a game because you're worried you might waste your money on something that might be a crap game in the end, get boring, and not sure if you should believe all the ratings because you dont know if everyone has the same interests and likes as you? well this game is the bomb diggity, straight up. Made by the same people who made rollercoaster tycoon and man did they deliver on this. For me it's the small things in a game that matter and did they really take the time to make sure this was as polished as it could be. Not sure if anyone remembers when they announced another rollercoaster tycoon a while back, and everyone was super excyited to find out what it was, and it ended up being some dumbass phone app? Well imagine all that excyitment, but instead of them coming out with that stupid app they came out with this bad boy. This is exactly what everyone was wishing and hoping for (just different name).

[/h1] \n\n\n[h1]===[ General Consensus ]===[/h1]\n\n[b]This was the baseline for two entire generations of Single-Player FPS[/b]\n\n[u]The Half-Life series is considered to be one of the \"Grandfathers\" of modern FPS. Along with some other titles of its generation, it revolutionized the shooter genre, giving games a new depth and even bigger focus on storytelling and big setpieces, remeniscent of action genre movies. And naturally, Half-Life 2 is remembered one of the finest games to be realized and developed, even after a tumultuous and bumpy development.[/u]\n\n\nI only came to the awareness of this game's status in the gaming world a few years ago. I never really heard too much about it or even payed to much attention to it; back in my childhood I remember seeing it around the internet but it never really talked to me.\nSo a few years back I bought the whole HL franchise here on Steam, already acquainted with the game's praise. \n\nAfter a couple of failed attempts to play HL2, but getting stuck on the same part, I finally got to finish the game. \nAnd I must say I'm totally on board with all the praise and status!\n\n\n[h1]PLOT:[/h1]\n\nThe story continues after the events of Half-Life 1, where Gordon Freeman, a scientist working on the Black Mesa Research Facility, fights his way through hords of aliens brought to Earth by a portal that Gordon himself opened.\n\nWe wake-up to a dystopian future where the Black Mesa and the alien infestation led to a very different world of ours, where humans live in a opressing society on the likes of the book \"1984\", where everyone is meticulously controlled by the \"system\".\nThis hugely different and creative setting really talked to me and even made me more interested in the narrative.\n\nFrom then on, Freeman tries to lead a group of \"resistence\" fighters to oppose and tear down the ruller of Earth, the former administrator of the Black Mesa Facility, Wallace Breen, (whom also \"negotiated\" a peace agreement with the aliens, right after the events of HL1).\n\nI must say this story is a very creative and different experience of those found in other FPS games.\nI always found myself on the edge of my seat, eager to know what was gonna happen next, and while also amazed by all the environmental storytelling.\nIt's truly one of the game's strongest points and even though your character doesn't speak, you will find yourself completely imersed on the narrative. Even all these years after, this political and social matter that Valve went for and explored is one of the game's strongest points really!\n\nAnd not to forget about all of those fantabulous and explosive setpieces seen throughtout the game that are really solid and entretaining, having inspired other games like Uncharted and the Call of Duty campaigns, just to say a few. You are really put in some tricky and tough situations.\n\n\n[h1]GAMEPLAY:[/h1]\n\nThis is your average FPS gameplay. Nothing you haven't seen before, but HL2 is certainly a gold standard of how to excell and give variety in your gameplay.\n\nYou've got your normal 2000's arsenal, like Pistols, the series' signature weapon the Crowbar, a Revolver that packs a serious punch, an SMG, Assault Rifle, Shotgun (THAT FEELS SO GOOD TO SHOOT), Grenades, Crossbow, Rocket Laucher and a new \"toy gun\" the Gravity Gun.\n\nAt the time, Valve was developing a new physics engine never seen before that went on to shake and revolutionize games at the time, but in order to really make usage of this new technology, [u]the developers of Half-Life 2 introduced the Gravity Gun to the weapons roster [/u]. \nWith it you can \"grab\" multiple objects, such as crates, file cabinets, gasoline tanks or even buzzsaw blades to throw at oponents. It's a very creative way to make usage of the different environment assets while showing off new technology.\nIt's also another tool to help you get out of sticky situations like puzzles, something that Half Life 2 really experiments with. \nWith this engine, Valve pushed the physics to bring different puzzles that just feel natural to solve.\n\nGameplay feels really natural and it's what we have grown accostumed to in the FPS genre, but very competent and polished.\n[spoiler](the shotgun just feels awesome and sooooo satisfying to shoot)[/spoiler]\n\n\n[h1]SOUND AND MUSIC:[/h1]\n\nSound feels like a very big step-up comparing to Half-Life 1 and every weapon sound much better when firing.\n\nEnvironmental sound is really good and pushes you even more to the game's immersion. Every area of the game is masterfully design, to the sewer sections that feel so claustrophobic and tense to walk through, to the more city like big places where you can sense the real sense of scale of the space through the sound design. \n\nI must say it's really top notch.\n\nBut there were times where I felt that the sound mixing was a little off, having sounds playing with a really pumped up volume that really distracted me and put me off.\n\nIn the other hand, the Music is just amazing. It's 00's techno and rock like music that just injects you with such adrenaline and makes you feel really awesome with gunning down opponest. VERY SATIFYING INDEED.\n\n\n[h1]GRAPHICS:[/h1]\n\nIn all honesty this is a hard category to judge, because obviously the graphics are going to look a bit dated to what we have today (in 2020), but honestly everything look really good.\n\nFrom characters and enemies, to the environments, to the fire and explosion effects, it all looks very good and has a great level of quality to them. Specially the alien creatures. I felt utterly disturbed by those \"facehuggers\" like creatures. Everytime they jumped at my face I would equally jump, but of my seat with disgust... \n\n\n[h1]CONCLUSION:[/h1]\n\n[b]To summ it up, I think that Half-Life 2 is a must play game. \n\nReally, if you are like me and you have heard about it, but was like \"meh maybe this game is old and dated and its now crap\", just cut the argument and go play a really good and polished experience.\n\nFor those out there, if you want a polished and strong game that still challenges most contemporary games, with an interesting narrative, and some awesome moments just grab yourself a copy of this. It's dirt cheap, no excuses...[/b]",
      "Dear Dev, \nI love this game, if you're reading reviews, please consider some ideas to make it better:\n-  Level designing: Add more ways to choose, and different endings. Right now SoR4 is flat from A to B, it made me feel down compare to SoR3.\n- Alternate customs, and playable same characters: Floyd is overrated and all my friends want to pick him. Make a game with 4 Floyds running sound fun. Use lifetime score to unlock customs.\n- 2v2 Battle! WHY NOT?\n- Shiva (new), Max (new), Roo, Estel (Badass Woman Cop)\n- Steam trading cards: I know it's not importance, but who doesnt want some badass backgrounds on steam profile?",
      "I was lured in by all the positive reviews and the beautiful art style. Once I started playing, I really tried to love this game. I really tried. I got thirteen levels in before I couldn't escape that I hate this game more than any game I can ever remember hating.\n\nThere are a lot of reasons why. Many are nitpicks, but there is one overwhelming one: This Game Is Almost Never Fun. I started out enthusiastic, but it wasn't long before all the enjoyment drained out. I went from looking forward to the next level, to only wanting to complete the current one just so it would be over and done with. I could not help contrast Tri with games like Portal or QUBE where, most of the time, the challenge is in figuring out the puzzle. Once you know how it's done, you can do it. In Tri, this is not the case. Realizing the solution just means understanding how much tiring, precarious, exacting, chore-like work you have to do before you can DO the thing you figured out how to do. This is a game where there is no such thing as a simple solution. If solving a puzzle can be made more difficult, it has been. Not in a mentally challenging way, but in a way that feels like having to walk for miles over uneven rocks. (Especially once they introduced having to direct light beams by reflecting them off triangles. This requires innumerable microscopic adjustments each time.)\n\nAnd even that would be fully forgiveable, if the game's difficulty was FAIR. For me, half my frustration came from the increasingly difficult puzzles, the other half came from inconsistent mechanics. Sometimes when I had to run up walls, a triangle that showed I could walk on it would suddenly let go of me and I'd plummet. Sometimes I got trapped in places I should have been able to jump out of. Sometimes lasers would bleed right through triangles I put up to block them (In one case, I had to layer down twenty-four of them). But the worst was the jump. At first I thought it was a nifty idea that if you were jumping towards a high ledge, you could keep pressing space to haul yourself up and over. I grew to hate this mechanic because of how often it failed. Jumping up a simple step could take five or six tries; impotently bobbing up and down going \"HUHHP! HUHHP! HUHHP!\" each time. There were also plenty of times when it seemed like random chance whether a given platform could be jumped to or not. Plus there was the tendency of jumps to send you up and over a thin ledge you were trying to reach, instead of onto. I quicksaved OFTEN.\n\nTri feels like it lives up to its name: they tried. They really did. They had ideas with a lot of potential and the level design is frequently gorgeous. But too often these ideas were implemented poorly, or were not conveyed at a reasonable difficulty level. I quit. I don't want to, and I am massively disappointed to, but I'm giving up and uninstalling this game. I know I'll never see the end cutscene, but honestly, not playing anymore feels like more of a reward to me.",
      "Really overrated. Sure the graphics are fancy schmancy, but in the end it feels more like a dumbed-down Left 4 Dead.\n\nPurely from a gameplay perspective, the class specializations are excessively numerous with not that many differences between many of them (and notably, every class can use the same weapons anyway), and the solo mode sucks (no bots, are you kidding me?).\n\nOn other aspects of the game, there is that XP and (cosmetic) items grinding that seems to be the current trend/cash cow. And the fucking ridiculous buying of weapons and ammo within missions because, you know, killing monsters gives you money and in a world completely wrecked by zombies there are automated weapon stores at every corner - seems legit. Feels like that CSGO crap: it's not an FPS as much as a trading \"game\", where you buy stuff ingame and you buy or sell stuff on the Steam marketplace.",

      "I was hoping for a good game but I can't believe the positive reviews. Really annoying on a personal level. If you like your hand held and revel in 3rd person view then enjoy, but I think it's terrible. I was on the mountain jumping across a platform. \"Press ENTER\" to 'grab' it suggests. I press ENTER and what do you know? Nothing happens. Well, you die continually because what it tells you to do (zzzzz) doesn't work. Ah, maybe this is part of the 'difficulty'...hahahaha.\n\nNot a patch on any Far Cry or GTA even though these are full of directions. First Tomb Raider I've bought and definitely the last. What is it with games these days telling you what to do every step of the way: Do this...do that....go here....find item...take item...drop item...fire now.....pull lever...talk....rest....jump.... quit game and uninstall, ya that's the best option. As this game is created for a dumbed-down society or tailored for intellectually challenged meercats, some of us can see where the industry is heading. What happened to thinking for yourself???\n\nI don't need to progess far in this game because the first 10 minutes says enough. Do this, do that, blah blah blah...",
      "Overall its a great hunting game. The base game is good enough on its own to give you an enjoyable experience hunting several varieties of animals. \n\nI feel that some of the best content is in the DLC's. I dont mind the price tag for maps are they are just a large and some of them have a truly diverse animal population. \n\nThe Weapon Packs have some items that really should have been available in the base game (.22 rifle).\nTripod stands, Tents and ATV's are also DLC items that i feel should have been included in the base game. \n\nThe cost for these packs are not huge, and I have bought them, but they really do impact your play in a meaningful way so it is hard not feel like they were left out on purpose. \n\nBeing a former hunter in real life I would say that the realism of it is pretty good. Lung shots and heart shots drop animals quickly and using the right ammo along with good aim greatly influences this. A poor shot will leave you tracking this wounded animal across the map till you sneak up on it again or just give up. \n\nThey have a system called Tru Racks (sumthn like that) that simulates different qualities of animals. So you end up with little bucks, average bucks, and monster bucks. Weight and coloration plays a part in this too. In short every animal has a trophy of some kind and they are varied by what must be some sort of RNG. \n\nAll that having been said, this game can devolve into a shooting gallery were you kill everything on sight as there in no real incentive not to. You get money and experience for every kill you claim and wiping out a heard of deer with your DLC M1 Garand on your DLC Tripod Stand becomes the quickest way to bypass the grind.\n\n It feels like the game starts as a \"hunting sim\" and becomes a \"poaching sim\" once you realize the progression system is going to take a long time to do...\"ethically?\".\n\n\nAgain, this is a game i would recommend, but it is just that, a game. \n\n",

      "This game is like cocaine. \nI always tell myself just one more, then im done. I'll do homework. I'll sleep. I'll eat something. \nBut you know what? That last death was cheap, I'll do one more to make up for it. I just need 1000 gold for that upgrade, I'll just do one more to get it. Always just one more. \n\nThings I like:\n\n+Strong RPG Progression - Gold from your run can be spent on stats, equipment, abilities, etc. making multiple runs and longer runs more rewarding.\n\n+The game is witty and has flavor. -- there are various conditions your new characters can have such as being blind, gay or having a fear of chickens, amongst many, many others. Dying is in this sense, pretty fun. The writing has a lot of charm!\n\n+The controls are very tight -- this game has good controls. It's easy to do what you want, which is good because it's very tough and you will die a lot.\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n- The bosses in new game plus don't get harder -- As you progress into new game + or ++ or +++ and beyond, the bosses don't scale well, despite the general enemies leveling up to basically become bosses themselves. Not a huge deal, but it's the only negative I have.\n\nThen at some point you realize you've beaten the game, Thankfully there is a new game plus.\nMaybe just one more playthrough...",
      "I am a 43 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he helped me. Loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.\nThank you <3",

Other 4x games offer far superior UI and make is easier to manage your asset on the field e.g. Sword of the stars II, Star Ruler 2, Distant world, Endless Legends, Endless Space etc.\n\nGFX: Graphics are not the top notch what you would expect from a modern 4x game but they are on far with Endless Legends. GFX leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nAlien Races: I dont need to say much but like Planets most of the races are COPY / PASTE. Nothing unique or special about each. \n\nMP: Multiplayer has a mind of its own and in most cases wont let you join public games unless its a private game.\n\nStellaris bring nothing new to 4x Genre in 2016!.\n Right now everyone is almost beta testing for the developers so we can find bugs, report them  and help them fix their game.

      "[h1] A BETTER MINECRAFT, AND I WILL TELL YOU WHY[/h1]\nwith terrain deformation and creation, crafting etc its only normal that the first comparison that comes to mind is with minecraft.

      "I'm gonna give this a thumbs up but with like, idk, a cautionary sideways thumb for maybe. \n\nif I read credits right, it looks like this game had all its programming, art, music, and writing done by one guy, so I have to give respect to that. For a real indie game like this, it's very very good. \n\nBut it's still really flawed. If you're looking for a 2D Metroid game, and you've played EVERY other 2D metroid game, I suppose yeah, go for this one, and I think you'll enjoy it. If you're not a fan of metroid, I would not bother, sadly. This game suffers from a lot of problems from metroid games, and does not fix any, and at times exagerates those problems. \n\nThe art style is very interesting and cool, but the way the levels and map design are, leaves most areas feeling like a mess of unmemorable places. \n\nThe combat is INCREDIBLY simplistic, yet somehow bogged down by WAY too many useless weapons and just kind of badly designed controls. I found there were about 5 weapons that were actually useful in the game out of what seems like more than 10. Most enemies you either cheese, or be cheesed. There's no charge up shots, there's not really much nuance to the enemies or bosses. They have about two attacks and repeat while you dodge the same one bullet pattern and just kind of shoot in their general direction. (I played it on hard by the way. Not a particularly difficult game, but even the slightly challenging stuff felt kind of dull and uninteresting.) \n\nThe music was cool again. nothing quite mind blowing, but it was nice. The world itself seems like a mess, but there are cool ideas. The giant robot people were really cool to see. \n\nOne little idea i really liked is that the LOW HEALTH beep sound is actually in sync with every song in the game. I thought that was really cute, and it's not something I've seen any game do. Sounds dumb, but I give a lotta props to that, it was cool. \n\nWriting is okay. I feel it left more to be desired. There seemed to be an interesting world here that wasn't explored enough. It wasn't bad, I suppose, but not really that great. \n\nThat is kind of this game. It's not bad by any means, but not the best game on the planet. Play it if you're in need of a Metroid game, and I'm certain you will be pleased enough despite the flaws. Even if you're just having a hankering for a platformer and have already played Hollow Knight and some other great ones first, I think you should enjoy this, but don't expect a 10/10 game. \n\nGive it a try if you feel it looks interesting."

It's an ideal game for kids or even adults looking for something breezy, especially considering just how nicely it's presented.\n\nThere's a few small gameplay gripes, the controls for the building mode are decent once you get to grips with them - but getting to grips with them takes a little time. On the over world it can feel like you spend a lot of time switching between traversal powers and watching the corresponding animation. And in some places the game can let you build something that counts as a valid structure but isn't actually traversable for your character. None of these felt like a big issue though.\n\n I think the most engaging thing personally is that the themes chosen (Medieval, Egypt, City, Caribbean and Jungle) are all very familiar genres for original Lego sets of the past, which combined with the simple blocky nature of the things you build in the game makes it feel much closer to the vibe of just playing with Lego as a child than something licensed. There's a very charming *vibe* around this game that I think gives it value beyond something just for children, and is a large part of why I would reccomend it.",
      "I have not play for long, but know well enough this game deserves a mention. A side on, survival-ish game set in a war. Now, While I admire this game, it does have a few issues I personally find abnoxious.\nI'll start with those, and then will share what I like about it.\n\n-Characters you play seem to have never stolen anything at all from anyone, ever during the war. This is reflected in how unhappy and whiney they become caring more about the people they have taken from than their own wellbeing.\n\n-Characters you play are too softhearted. Just use the example with the point above. \n\n-Characters are expert carfters for being just average people. How many average people know how to pick locks, make servicable firearms and make alcoholic beverages? Well these three certain are capable of all three and more. For that matter, they all can do everything, but have one special skill they are the better at than the rest.\n\n-You get to only visit one building per night. This is bad since if you chose a building with other survivors in it, you will either need to steal from them to get supplies and be faced with a lot of unhappy complaining, or return home with nothing.\n\n-Visting other survivors, you cannot negotiate with them let alone talk to them. What you can do is beat them to death (or kill them with whatever weapon you happen to have on you at the time). I don't see how this was a good design choice at all when the characters you play are not personally that sort of people. Attacking other survivors is certain to cause problems with your characters.\n\n-You can not relocate from your starting place. What you start with is your base of operations.\n\n-Raids happen frequently to you only. You will never kill raiders, only chase them off and this happens behind the scenes, out of your control, while your character is out scavanging.\n\n-You can not sleep in shifts. If a person sleeps, they sleep the whole night.\n\n-Rediculous resource requirements. Some things require far too much, while others require far too little. \n\n-There is little to none interaction between your characters. No idle chatter between them. \n\n\nNow for the good points.\n-You play 3 characters to begin with, each having one specialty. They somewhat have different personalities.\n\n-The art style appeals to me.\n\n-Characters are well animated. Different staes of tiredness, different things they do when unhappy or when they have nothing else to do.\n\n-The overall idea, even though it isn't implemented well enough.\n\n-Building your shelter from ground up.\n\n-Forgaing and stealth play.\n\n\nSo while i find some issues with this game's design, if you ignore the lack of realism and consider this to be just a game with a very narrow play style, it is quite fine. It has a certain atmosphere you generally don't find elsewhere. I still recommend to give it a try.",

      "Black Mesa is a fantastic remake of the Original Valve classic and one of the greatest of all time video games, Half-Life.  This sci-fi classic FPS has you take on what might seem like a hum-drum day in the life of an experimental physicist, but things go quite off rails when experimenting with a strange material sample from an even stranger dude in a suit. \n\nAfter a while (and shooting a lot of aliens and bashing their heads in with a crowbar) you'll save the world... but now Black Mesa lets you do this with dramatically updated graphics, 4K support and a plethora of visual tweaks so you can rest assured this will run great on any gaming rig. \n\nA must have for big fans of Half-Life or gamers who are new to the scene and never got to play the original.

      "Mysterious, claustrophobic, and psychedelic --- this is undoubtedly the most unorthodox game in The Legend of Heroes series. This game is basically what you get when you put The Legend of Heroes, Shin Megami Tensei and a certain Silent Hill title [i](which I won't specify for a good reason)[/i] into a blender machine. Nonetheless, it is still very much an LoH game at its core, though its semi-fandisc nature holds it back from being as coherent of an overall package as its two predecessors.\n\nI cannot stress this enough: [b][u]If you were a big fan of the previous two games, you will not necessarily like this game; on the other hand, if you didn't hold them in high regard, this game is still worth trying out due to its stark contrast in tone and structure from its predecessors.[/u][/b] There is a good reason this game is named [u][b]\"the 3rd\"[/b][/u] instead of \"Third Chapter\", because it is definitely not a direct continuation of SC (i.e. Trails in the Sky Second Chapter).\n\nIf you want more of the upbeat, kingdom-trotting adventure of the previous two games, you're not going to find it here.\n\nIf you want towns full of vibrant NPCs, you're not going to find it here (at least not in the main story).\n\nIf you want a protagonist who wears their heart on their sleeves and acts like your typical spunky JRPG hero, you're not going to find it here.\n\nThis game is first and foremost [u][b]a gameplay-heavy dungeon crawler[/b][/u], one that is light on (main) story but carries some very heavy themes. The most interesting aspect of the game to me is that [i][b]the protagonist Kevin Graham is not a hero[/b][/i] (which is ironic considering the name of this series). This game is his harrowing personal journey, one in which he doesn't set out to save the world, his homeland, or anyone for that matter.\n\nThere are initially only two playable characters, but more and more join your party at a steady pace throughout the game [b](16 in total)[/b]. Be sure to talk to these characters when you swap them out of your party; they are ironically the only source of \"NPC dialogue\" for the majority of the game, and their dialogue updates after every plot point like in most other Falcom games. You know Falcom has done their NPCs justice in FC&SC when their complete absence here creates an uneasy sense of isolation.\n\nThere are visual-novel-like sidequests (called Memory Doors) which serve to further flesh out the characters and setting of this series, giving all the playable (and some non-playable) characters their own spotlight to shine in. To this day the cast of Trails in the Sky still remains my favorite cast of any RPG, and I have to give a good chunk of the credit to this game's characterization of them.\n\nThese sidequests take up a sizeable chunk of the game, which one might argue distract from the dungeon-crawling main game. Fortunately, they don't expire like in FC&SC and can be accessed at any point in the game before the final dungeon (with convenient fast-travel to boot), effectively enabling the player to pace the game themselves. \n\nWord of warning though, some of these sidequests take on a much darker tone than one would expect: there's a very good reason why the console versions of this game was censored [i](don't worry, the Steam version isn't)[/i]. Please be mentally prepared for the final sidequest you come across in the game, i.e. [spoiler]Star Door 15[/spoiler].\n\nThere is also plenty of foreshadowing for the rest of the series littered throughout the game, some obvious and some very subtle [i](I'm looking at you Mr. N)[/i]. Needless to say, this game gives you lots to think about if you are into the lore of this series, especially if you have played some of the later Trails games.\n\nOh, and did I mention that the soundtrack is widely regarded as the best in the trilogy?\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nTo end on a more critical note, I'd like to elucidate the \"semi-fandisc\" nature of this game:\n\nThere is severe disconnect between the main story and side content, with the latter adding nothing to the former for the most part; the sidequests are more of an anthology of supplementary material for the entire Trails series and are only tenuously tied to the main campaign, which by itself is sparse in story.\n\nThere is also an egregious amount of asset recycling from the previous two games. Although this is mostly justified within the context of the story, it's still vexing and makes the devs look lazy. They had the opportunity to add a lot of interesting new locales, especially those pertaining to Kevin and the church, but they chose not to for the majority of the game. Get ready to traverse through lots of familiar looking areas and dungeons...\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nP.S. Advice for 1st playthrough: If you are here mostly to enjoy the story, don't play on Hard; if you value your sanity as a gamer, don't play on Nightmare. Seriously, don't.\n\nP.S.2 When you first open up the game, don't skip the \"Falcom\" logo animation; just sit back and watch. There's a bit more after that.\n\nP.S.3 If you're really curious as to which Silent Hill title I was comparing this game to, potential spoilers if you are familiar with the SH franchise: [spoiler]Silent Hill 2[/spoiler]. Just how deep the similarities run between these two games, I'll let you find out for yourself.\n\nP.S.4 A bit more on the censorship of this game: Falcom cut out large chunks of the aforementioned final sidequest when porting the 3rd from PC to the Sony consoles (PSP, PS3, and PSVita). They did this in order to keep the age rating consistent across the Sky trilogy; the PC version of the 3rd would undoubtedly have been rated \"M\" had it gone through ESRB.

      "The cognitive dissonance in the original Space Quest games between the box cover art telling you that \"Roger Wilco is hapless!\" and the player's necessary mental exertion involved to solve the puzzles, is laid bare the moment you can type in the name you will be called by in the game.\n\nIt's one of the hardest lines to walk when narrative is the main driver of an interactive work:  balancing the player's actions with the personality of the character they are directing in a world that is clearly alive, regardless of the players's presence.\n\nThe Excavation of Hob's Barrow's succeeds in this fully with the denizens and everyday life of the town of Bewlay.\n\nFrom the moment Thomasina Bateman starts recounting the events that led to her writing a letter to her mother, any ambiguity is dispelled: the player is helping Thomasina relive her time in starkly bucolic Bewlay. But as players spend more time within the memories and stories Thomasina shares, the more off putting the narration becomes. It's not just that Thomasina is an unreliable narrator—the implications of the traumatic events that occured at Hob's Barrow are still a puzzle to be worked out. \n\nThis is the strength of the narrative design and writing in Hob's Barrow: as entertainingly crafted as linear story or film, but with eartnest player engagement required to work out what's happening in the very deep shadows of this cursed place.\n\nThe fantastic writing is supported by equally fantastic pixel art, music, and some of the best voice work I've heard in games…ever? The codgers, critters, and countryside all sound fantastic, the bleakness of the moors churning from peaceful to menacing with expert orchestration. Visual direction is solid, too, with sparingly, effectively used pixel portraits and closeups to highlight details both grotesque and filled with character. The dark undercurrent of humour throughout the game also adds some replayability for achievement hunters: some encounters are worth revisiting!\n\nI played this entirely on Steam Deck, mostly curled up in bed at night, but enjoyed the grand finale while docked on my TV. Performance and control was flawless, regardless.\n\nOne of my favorite games released in 2022, and definitely one of my favorite adventure games of all time.",
      "Note this is not \"Steampunk Civ\" so don't think of it that way. Its effectively a story/scenario driven city builder.

      "I've always been a little curious what a hero-centric world would look like from the eyes of a bystander. In theory it doesn't sound like a particularly exciting idea but there's a million and a half games where you are that hero, and I've never seen one where you aren't. As of the first chapter, I'm pretty interested in seeing how WP is going to take this story after having seen some adventurers through the eyes of a child that doesn't understand their way of life. \n\nThe story progresses by skipping to noteworthy events in her life as she gets older. She meets new people and is faced with decisions that shape her as a person. I'm not sure how to explain more of the story without getting into spoiling details, so I'll update this if I figure that out.\n\n--\n\nI really enjoyed World's Dawn and I'm very glad to see that he's not getting complacent with that and continuing to improve his skills. Storytelling is an art, and art doesn't improve without practice. I've waited a long time for this game to come out, and so far I'm not disappointed; and I doubt I will be.\n\nAlso, I'm happy to hear that WP's cancer is in remission and that he still wanted to go back to making games once he was feeling better. I hope he continues to produce these relaxing little escape-type games for a long time. Not every game needs a polished combat system and super high budget cg cut scenes to be fun.",
      "Stephen's Sausage Roll is a game that the developer doesn't want normal people to buy, it seems. The description is literally, \"A simple 3d puzzle game.\", there is one video that shows you nothing about the game, and it's priced at $32 CND.\n\nFortunately, I'm here to tell you to get off your ass and to buy this wonderful game. The graphics are alright, the music is OK, but the puzzles are sublime.\n\nIn each level, the goal is the same: cook all the sausages and exit the level by standing on the exit level sign in the right orientation. You cook sausages by pushing them over a grill. Like in sokoban games, you can't pull the sausage (yet...), only push it. Another huge wrinkle is that sides of the sausage can only touch the grill once. If you touch a cooked side of a sausage to the grill, it will be burned and you fail the level. This little wrinkle will make you pull your hair out in some levels as you try and figure out how the hell you are going to maneuver the sausages around so they get cooked properly. A neat thing about the game is that if you fail, you can still continue playing the level, which might help you figure out how to play it.\n\nYou'll have a section (part of an island) that has a number of puzzles for you to solve in any order, so if you get stuck, you can try another one (until you get to the last puzzle of the section). Once you complete a section, a new section will open up with more puzzles.\n\nYour little guy has tank controls, which you will find extremely useful, as turning to the left or right near a sausage will push it in different directions. A nice detail is that the all of the puzzles make up the island section. When you activate a puzzle, the rest of the island drops away into the sea, leaving you on a tiny puzzle island.\n\nEach section introduces new mechanics into the game. First you'll just be pushing the sausages, but then you'll be stacking them, skewering them (you would think this would make things easier, but no! You can't turn when you have a skewered sausage!), walking on them...\n\nI would say that these levels are on the level of Snakebird, though I found many of them easier than Snakebird's puzzles (maybe I'm better at sokoban games than I know?). These are the kind of puzzles that you walk away from frustrated, but come back to a few hours later with the solution. This is the game where there are so many ah-ha! moments that make you feel smart. You have no idea what to do at first, but eventually you get better and better. You might not see solutions at first, but you begin to see where you need to go to solve the puzzle, and then work backwards from there. It's wonderful!\n\nIf you're having trouble, there's a community guide that has all the solutions, which is super helpful (though not as much when I was playing because it wasn't complete!).\n\nIt might be expensive, but I took 36 hours to solve all the puzzles and it was worth every penny.",
      "TL;DR - 80-90s retro fun. Will prove you wrong if you think FMV games couldn't ever be good. Check out 5 seconds of playthrough if unsure.\nNOTE: Story isn't written in this review as game is reliant on mysterious plot. \n\n　　　For those unfamiliar, FMV stands for full motion video where you are playing a game that is based primarily/largely on the usage of pre-recorded video clips. Though it is no longer a frequented genre in video gaming, during the 90s, FMV games on CDs would often lead me into the darkened halls of many a thrilling Sherlockian mystery adventure. Unfortunately the majority of FMV games were downright awful. Pre-recorded videos with a small quantity of scenes by actual actors caused the a gaming experience to feel boxed in. Astoundingly, Her Story does the exact opposite while still being as classically FMV as FMV games go. It displays FMV like a shield of pride with the added old school touches being tasteful to a tee. As the game is \"turned on\", the screen whirring into action like any early 90s PC would, making the familiar creaking and croaking, players are introduced to their in-game desktop. The thick 90s computer monitor flares a little and in its reflection can be seen the old tube shaped fluorescent lamps that were common fixtures in most public buildings back then, flickering and popping from time to time. It is like playing a game in the past without the annoying performance issues. [spoiler]The glare on screen where you can see a better reflection towards the end made me jump a little here and there. It is fabulous as a \"moodsetter\" like many of the other suppositious yet important details that worked towards the game's impressive little plot.[/spoiler] In addition to the other details, the background music between searches where players are looking at the desktop felt like a good touch and appropriate in terms of guiding players (reacts to clips/progress etc). There is such an abundance of both subsidiary and essential detail in this game that I'd be happy with the mere nostalgia prompting ambiance. It is an added bonus, which isn't too recurrent in indie games these days where there is a deficiency in either style or story, that makes Her Story such a good FMV. It differs because players can feel as if they are in control as every person works towards the ending down a differing path depending on how they decide to investigate which is conducted solely by which searches are brought up how and when. The secret to any game that lacks the variety and freedom of choice by \"genre default\", is to give the player as much control as possible within the walls of that rigid reality. Within the uncomplicated, search - watch - find clues - check Db repertoire, players are given room to stretch and investigate on their own. The mastery is in the details so it is crucial to pay attention. Everything is told methodically and the acting that seems off in places makes much more sense once you piece the evidence and videos together. You are the \"detective\".\n\n　　　This superlative story told through proficient acting by the talented Viva Seifert (also musician/former British gymnast) weaves a surprisingly thick plot into a very lugubrious tale and the eerie horrors of the truth become more evident the more you unveil. The \"wifey killed him\" synopsis we are inclined to linger on in theory is not as discernible in-game as you'd imagine and it'll keep you guessing and alarm you at several progression points. It'll make your thoughts run wild but mostly you'll be wrong with those assumptions until you get the whole picture, as in as close to 100% off the clips as you can. The short clips have a role in that you're piecing together a very large puzzle. The splintered pieces of a total 7 interviews leaving you with 271 videos spanning between mere seconds to a couple of minutes will feel jumbled up so receiving the story in abstruse titbits as such makes you feel like your own little Jessica Fletcher and adds to the anticipation of piecing everything together. If possible I imagine it would be a fun \"couch co-op\" game for an afternoon in with a friend/SO taking notes and guessing the story together (plot contains mature content). \n\n[i]Other interesting things[/i]:\n- Doesn't stop running while you do other things so you can open up your notepad and type there if you'd rather that over pen and paper\n- Search history is helpful. Anti-Glare Filter is a nice touch. Yellow subtitles are very British. \n- The odd title is actually fittingly chosen\n- Database Checker on your desktop screen will display the overall progress you make, creating a timeline for your discoveries so investigation will be smoother\n- Each keyword brings up 5 clips at most (excluding default keyword*). Keep a list of words that stick out in clips and if you get too stuck, use default keyword to bring up whole Db\n\n*[i]Default keyword:[/i] [spoiler]BLANK[/spoiler] Using the default is not optimal. Uncovering new snippets in turn revealing new clues/plots urging you to solve the case yourself is most of the fun.\n\n[b]TIP[/b]: All clips found will have the default keyword in its details. I assigned a number for every new top she wore. Examples: [spoiler]BLANK5, BLANK1 etc..[/spoiler]. An easier method is just deleting the whole keyword for each clip watched, never to return. ;)\n\n　　　Though the sweet yet unnerving finale didn't feel as inspired, the wrap up was still nicely done. People who are new to FMV games may find it harder to get into, but it has a good depth of story to tell for the short game (3-4 hrs) that it is and I recommend it to people who enjoy a good tale. Chances are it's either going to feel like something new and interesting or old school and nostalgic. \n\n[i]Bought game on dev's site: $4.99 (Steam key + DRM free version).[/i]",
      "Ib manages to do for me what so few horror games manage to accomplish, and that is to actually give a sense of unease and dread. Without going into spoilers, it's only a few minutes into the game that things start to tread the path of uncomfortable surrealism, with the art growing considerably more disturbing in how Ib interacts with it, and how the art interacts with her.\n\nWith all due respect to more conventional horror titles, say, Dead Space or The Evil Within, Ib maintains a feeling of dread and discomfort. Enemies can be evaded, yes, but there's a feeling of being stalked while trapped in a world you can't possibly fully understand. \n\nContrast Dead Space remake, where soon enough the horror gives way to cutting off an abomination's arm, then using telekinesis to impale it or another horror with said arm, then simply setting fire to the more mobile enemies.\n\nThis is not, I repeat, not to disrespect games in which reducing enemies to a smoldering heap of charred body parts is an acceptable tactic- there is a time and a place for the cathartic destruction of the nightmares that haunted our closets and lurked under our beds. Ib, however, leans firmly towards the horror and self-preservation of being in a hostile and unknown environment, where the only feasible option is to run, hide, and hope whatever nameless horror eventually loses track of you.\n\nAnd let's face it- some modern art galleries are creepy enough already, even in the daylight.\n",

      "It's strange how this will be the first review I ever write for a game. I always thought it would be written for a game like Fallout, Elderscrolls or some huge open world survival horror.

I thought to myself that if people can charge you 70 euro for games that are poorly executed and badly made from start to finish, then this game should have a much higher pricetag. It wasn't before looking up and seeing that I just finished the first episode in a mere three hours that I understood their reasoning. I feel, however, obliged to tell you all that the three hours spent in this game were worth more to me than the hundreads of hours I've spent in most other games combined. Not because the story was awsome, or the graphics made me gape in awe, but rather that every single aspect of the game in combination managed to grip me and pull me in so that time became temporarily meaningless. Imagine if games held this standard. Imagine if your favorite action, your favorite adventure game or even your favorite driver had this kind of execution. \nYou can tell a good story in a bad way, and you can tell a bad story in a good way. The story in this game might not be the most interesting story you've ever heard, but it's good, and in the execution of it you are drawn in, captured by it, moved by it.\n\nMost adventure games will entertain, they'll give you some ups and downs along the way, but ultimately they will feel like games.\nI've never felt so fulfilled after \"playing a game\" as I did today. Original, beautiful and masterfully executed. I can't wait for the next episode.",

      "Disclaimer: This is review from player who prefer story-rich game and haven't played any game by Arkhouse Telegraph.\n\nThe good:\n+ Outstanding 80's-esque visual pixel artstyle. It reminds me of few SNES/Atari/Gameboy games.\n+ Fairly good soundtrack.\n+ Some cutscene/area have fascinating atmosphere.\n+ Run well with Steam proton, so it's likely this game is playable for Linux/Steam Deck user. Although the platformer area might show too many small detail for 7\" display.\n+ Game OST/artbook is available for free on Arkhouse website.\n\nThe bad:\n- While i understand nature of this game require player to find out most thing and go through trial-and-error, some parts definitely need to be explained better. I refer to lack of autosave (for most part of the game), not letting player know about manual save (you can do it by head left after exit for cylinder elevator until you see display/sign \"< S\" and suggestion to visit block H (where you get some guidance).\n- While the manual say i can play R. U. N. E. 3000 first, i have hard time understanding the story and lore/world building. Conversation such as \"DO? DORODO!\" is mostly gibberish and i only can make vague guess based on few specific term (\"V2\", \"50/50\", etc.) and area i've visited. Short recap of previous games (even it's on the manual) could be really helpful for newcomers.\n\nThe ugly:\n* I experience a bug where i fight boss i'm not supposed to fight yet. In detail, [spoiler] after i exit from P block to get symbol cracking code, i was thrown to G block where i fight G-Cat/10th boss. The worst part is the boss HP bar started with red color and auto 3-60 cannon never perform attack. Fortunately the bug doesn't occur again after i load from manual save.  [/spoiler].\n* The gameplay variation/idea is very interesting, but the execution is mixed bags (more explanation on below paragraph)\n\nSaturn Quest: R. U. N. E. 3000 has lots of gameplay variant/modes (Adventure, Shoot'em up, Platformer and many more) to keep the game fresh. While each area/boss have different reason why it's challenging/difficult, many of those is very unbalanced. For example, [spoiler] Bioplatus M-3D/6th boss [/spoiler] require you to have extraordinary eye-hand coordination and multitasking skill. Among all enemy that resemble boss fight, i only managed to beat 6-7 boss without using cheat.\n\nThis game also has very few checkpoint on each area/boss. On adventure/platformer area, you could restart from beginning after spending 10-20 minutes where you have to avoid same trap or collect same item again. On boss fight, that means you'll need to repeat whole fight most of the time. It's could be annoying because since you're forced to find out boss behavior the hard way or repeating tedious part of the fight.\n\n3 HP and lack of difficulty option could be irritating for most modern player. There are time when i found out i only lose 3-10 HP when i use cheat and beat the boss. If there's easier difficulty where i have 6-10 HP, i could beat more boss by myself. But don't get me wrong, i feel really satisfied each time i beat boss (which i deemed can be beaten with practical amount of effort) without cheat. If the developer bother add easy difficulty which has higher player HP, give more Nana and slightly lower boss HP, far more people could enjoy this unique piece of artwork.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nWhile i have some rant, it's really unique experience even though i've played few hundred games. In overall, i have more positive sentiment than negative sentiment of this game. But even though i choose \"Yes\" when Steam ask \"Do you recommend this game?\", i'd rather choose \"Neutral\" or \"Information\" instead. If you're fan of 80's game or really like difficult game, you might come to like this game. But for most people, i'd recommend you to seek other game. Although if you really insist to play this game, you could use Cheat Engine and modify HP/Nana using value type Double (also called float64 or 8-byte float).\n\nP.S. I definitely will play the sequel (Episode IV-VI: White Meteor Saga according to the artbook) [b]IF[/b] the developer bother add easy difficulty option and more checkpoint during boss fight/exploration.",
      "As a fan of Mimimi's Stealth Strategy Game,\nI love it so much, the operation system is getting smoother and more user-friendly comparing to Desperados III & Shadow Tactics.\nAlso I like how they added new elements to the game to make it more playable (E.g. Flexible team choice, character stories)\n\nThe only thing I don't like is the art.\nGame design is good but it'd be great if there's good looking characters...",
      "Overall the concept and idea of the game is good and I would recommend it. It is worth the price for the amount of fun time you can have with it.\n\nPositives:\n+ Initially the game gives you some good frights and tension\n+ Variety of characters, ethnics and aesthetics to pick and chose from\n+ Variety of skills and abilities that are mostly unique and some have good synergy\n+ Variety of maps\n+ DLC costs are fair\n+ Skin costs are fair\n+ One of very few companies who communicates with the community\n+ A lot of good license characters available\n+ The game has a tutorial that explains the basics\n+ Various ways to play the game (stealth / agressive)\n\nNegatives:\n- A few bugs here and there\n- Some really annoying perks / addons on killers / survivors like 1 shot long range axes (to name an example), keys and moris (to name a few more)\n- Toxic community - Not everyone is toxic but a large portion of players are but lets be real you get that in every game these days\n- Matchmaking is pretty bad (but DBD is trying to fix this)\n- Sometimes unfair hit detection - Some hits look like you are being smacked way out of range or as a killer you see the grab animation on a survivor and then it just cancels out\n- Steep learning curve / unforgiving gameplay. You either have to learn and improve and adapt and overcome or you will be having a bad time as you climb ranks.",
      "I bought this game in order to review it, seeing as there were no current reviews for it. \nI thought I'd help the game out by maybe giving it that tiny bit of publicity it needed to get off the ground.\nIn doing so I have failed. As this game isn't worth reviewing, there is nothing to review. Well, I should say there is stuff to review but I feel as though the dev's didn't even attempt to make this a game that anyone would enjoy. Well actually I'll let them off of the target of \"enjoy\", I'd go further to say it doesn't even feel like they tried to make a game that someone who had nothing to do and was bored out of their mind would say maybe I'll play this for a bit\nI jumped straight in, ignored the help in menu and started playing. It took me at least 4-5 mins before I even had the slightest concept of what was going on and what I had to achieve. Once I did get the hang of it I still thought \"I must be missing something, I'm not really doing anything\" so I ventured to the help menu to find that nope, thats it buddy.\nThe controls are lacking, the soundtrack and the sound effects (which happen to be a melody playing) do not blend at all, (they play completely out of time on top of the soundtrack).\nYou can buy it and prove me wrong, go ahead. This is just my opinion.",
      "I was excited to play this after playing Persona 5 and Persona 5 Royal (my introductions to the series) to death.  This game was raved about and I thought, if it's more of the same then this should be great...\n\nThe major problem I have with this game is that it's so painfully obvious that it's a game made 13 years ago.  It's not a bad game, the look and feel of the Persona series is there and the characters are interesting etc.  But at the same time whenever I played this game, I just wanted to go back and play P5R instead.  Everything is just better in P5R.  The dungeons for example, the difference is night and day.  P5R's dungeons have so much more life to them, and look so much better.  Most of the environments in this game look like dull coloured LEGO sets put together.  It looks like it was originally on a handheld console (despite the remaster).  The other major example is the voice acting.  My god, some of the voice acting in 4G is on par with some of the worst Square Enix efforts.  Audio balancing is terrible as well.  And then there's the subjective stuff.  I personally much prefer P5R's soundtrack over this one, aside from maybe a couple of songs that were cool.  The setting of Tokyo is much more interesting and dynamic than this hokey town in the middle of nowhere.  The characters themselves I found much more engaging in 5R.  This was particularly helped by the quality of voice acting.  I think \n\nI'm glad that people are able to experience this game again on a more available platform.  I think potentially if I had played this back when it was released, I would probably have a different opinion of this game.  If you like Persona games and can look beyond what's dated badly, then the core game is very much the same.  If you were a fan already, this is a quality refresh to the game.  However, if you're like me and experienced the future of this series before playing this, I dont recommend it.  P5R provides the same gameplay but adds so much more.  It's a shame we cannot get that game on Steam instead.",

      "This game was a real treat. I played the 1st Valfaris and became an instant fan. I love that this is direction went by the developers, I feel it was a really good evolution of the series and mixing it up with a shoot em up gives it that extra punch/kick/slash. The graphics, characters and bosses are just so awesome and you can feel the grittiness of the mechs. Aside from the awesome game play, the environments and atmosphere has really leveled up. Love the boss destruction sequence as you can feel that accomplishment of kicking its ass. looking forward to Valfaris next installment. Congratulations with this metal AF game!",
      "Think you’re good at racing? Well, this game will give you a RKO.\n\nI don’t even know much about rally when I bought the game. I just see cars driving at dirt, weaving steering left and right constantly, and thought it looks cool. \n\nThis game is HARD. The learning curve is really steep. The first time I played, I constantly fly off a cliff and hug into trees. Because i don’t understand what my co driver is reading. He talk so fast that my tiny brain couldn’t process in time, sometimes I’m so confused that I go straight in junction because I can’t remember he said turn left or right. The cars are constantly out of control. \n\nAfter I learned about weight transfers that I’m able to start utilizing oversteer into corners. No more cripple into finish line with two tyres missing, that’s when the fun begins. Dirt Rally 2.0 is different from other racing games. You don’t race against other drivers, instead you race against time. If you turn off the hud, then it’s only you and the road, and TREES :)\n\nThe sound of the gravel hitting under your car. Dirt stained on your car as you progress through out the stage. The pops and bang coming out of exhaust when you shift. These combination feels somehow relaxing and satisfying at the same time.\n\nThe only downside of Dirt Rally 2.0 is that it requires constant internet connection, even when most of its content are single player. I wouldn’t complain if the server is stable. But sadly it isn’t. The server down happen quite frequently. Imagine you feel like you completed a 10 minutes perfect run, no crashes or mistakes. But then the game refuses to connect to the server. So the game won’t record your progress. It’s like a big middle finger to the player. \n\nI could make this review a thumbs down solely for the “always online” requirement, cuz it makes the player experience kinda inconsistent, but the gameplay itself does make up for it though. I mean when it works, it works remarkably well.\n\nApart from always online issue. Dirt Rally 2.0 is fantastic, the handling, physics, graphics etc. everything is on point. If you’re interested, buy the GOTY edition, it easily double the contents of the original game had. Worth every single cents.",

      "Katana ZERO? More like, Katana ZERO CONCLUSION.\n\nI had too high expectation on this game, I thought it was going to be Hotline Miami but better.\nIn the end I still prefer Hotline Miami, specifically Hotline Miami 2.\n\nOne thing I dislike is the lack of combo scoring system. \nIt's a good way to make the players act fast and execute their actions flawlessly, instead the game only has a timer bar that never runs out as a way to motivate the player to go fast.\n\nI am aware how \"pointless\" game scores are.\nBut seeing a number going up feels good.\n\nWhat happens when you kill an enemy in Hotline Miami?\n - You get to see a number pops out, and the score goes up indicating that you are doing good!\n - Satisfying bloody hit sound.\n - Throbbing light on the edge of the map.\n - Randomized dead sprite of the enemy, sometimes they get dismembered depending on the weapon.\n\nIn Katana ZERO you'd get :\n - A \"fwoob\" sound.\n - A same dying animation of the enemy getting knocked and bleed to death. Instead of getting decapitated or something.\n - Flashy slash effect.\n\nAt one point I wondered on why should I even bother killing the enemies when it didn't reward me with anything in the room with a minecart. \nWhen having the enemy being killed by the minecart or the player makes no difference.\n\n[spoiler]More like Katana ZERO REWARD. I think this is it, exactly why I am disappointed by it. Imagine playing soulsbornekiro or Hollow Knight without earning any kind of currency??? Killing the enemies would feel pointless.[/spoiler]\n\nIt's basically way more fun and rewarding to kill an enemy in Hotline Miami than Katana ZERO.\n\nThen there are other stuff like...\nUnfun stealth gameplay. \nRollspamming without consequence.\nBeing able to endlessly doing a mid air attack without having to touch the ground first.\n\nThere are also waaaay too many checkpoints in my opinion, it encouraged me to just brute force everything with roll spamming without having to worry about starting over.\nThe rooms could've been a bit bigger and longer. But also less room, quality over quantity.\n\nAnd finally, the story.\nI was intrigued by it but it just ended abruptly with a \"To be continued\".\nIt's like they only wrote 50% of it then slapped a \"To be continued\" and called it a day.\nThe game seems to rely heavily on \"mentioning stuff off screen that player will never get to see\" to tease the player.\nI already knew that the game is going to be short, but I didn't expect it to be this disappointing. \n\nIt's not a bad game, I just had the wrong expectation.\n\nI might change it to positive if I was satisfied by the DLC.\nOr maybe after beating the hard mode, I heard it's more fun.",
      "An amazingly fun and short adventure from the creator of Rakuen. Mr. Saitou is a game based in the same universe as Rakuen, but follows the story a salaryman, Mr. Saitou. Mr. Saitou takes you on a journey that explores some serious undertones, but approaches the subjects with incredible sensitivity, respect and some very light and silly humor. There's tons of flavor text to be discovered, pop culture references to be recognized and if you've played Rakuen, familiar characters to meet. As you make your way through the story, there are lots of puzzles that are simplistic, but well thought out in a way that adds to the story.The game is made to be played in 1 sitting that may vary depending on how much you interact with the world. This game can also be played by many ages and is family friendly. You DO NOT have to play Rakuen first to enjoy this game or understand it, but it will definitely add a depth of sentimentality to the game, as there are some call backs. I would absolutely recommend this game to anyone and you may find yourself learning something about your own life during Mr. Saitou's journey.Have a long day!",
      "If you like management type games and RPGs, this is the perfect mix. It's just enough management to allow you to thrive with mostly strategy without feeling bogged down, and just enough RPG elements to get you invested in not just your squad, but each individual character in it. \n\nHere's a tale from my experience with the game;\n\nThis is the kind of game to change your entire perspective on life itself. Failure is not the end, nor the beginning, but a constant in this world that you can either let destroy you or make you stronger. Allow me to tell you a story. The story of New Battlehill. \nNear the Shek city of Squin, not far east, was a small town. It went through many names. The first that stuck was Firstyeet, totally not a placeholder. It wasn't an notable settlement, merely consisting of a shack, an iron processor, and some walls to mildly inconvenience the roving gangs of Dust Bandits that liked to bully the residents. After being evicted from their own city once again, the residents, Denver, Soto, Ruka, and Meow, vowed to take back their home. After training and buying the best weapons and armor they could, they made their way back to Firstyeet. To their surprise, however, they would not have to fight. One of the bandits had picked a fight with a herd of goats. The bandits' defense failed against the caprine assault. From this, the town would get its second name - Densorumego. Den for Denver. So for Soto. Ru for Ruka. Me for Meow. And Go for the true heroes, the goats.\nPeace would not last long but soon the residents of Densorumego would become strengthened by their constant fighting. On the elevated, somewhat round land on which Densorumego sat, there were many large fights involving a lot of people. If only there was some sort of name to reflect this... \nAnd from that, the town was renamed for the last time, to Battlehill.\nThings were looking up. The town built its first farms and expanded to be almost four times its original size. But this peace would not last. Battlehill's new ambitions of self sufficiency would attract the attention of a new foe - The Shek Kingdom.\nThe Shek claimed ownership of the land Battlehill was on, and as such, demanded all food grown there be given to them. Confident from their many victories against the Dust Bandits, the Battlehillites refused the Shek demands. Their risk was calculated... but man were they bad at math.\nAll but one were nearly killed in the ensuing battle, and the one person that wasn't knocked into a coma was stuck on the wall because part of the wall was destroyed and he could no longer reach the stairs because of that. The people knew they couldn't fight the Shek, but they would not allow themselves to be subservient either. And so began their malicious compliance. The Shek would get all the food in Battlehill, as it would be none - The Battlehillites were moving.\nI could write entire books about their journey around the west. The Fogmen, the ruins, the Screeching Bandits, there's many a tale. But, eventually, the people would find a new home. In the harsh and Beak Thing infested land of Vain, homeland of the Western Hive, they would found their new home - New Battlehill.\nJump to now, the city is thriving, they have more bread than they know what to do with, they've grown strong from defending their home from the Beak Things, and their population has grown. They are currently planning a reconquest of Battlehill, which was occupied by Dust Bandits shortly after they left.\n\nThere is a part I left out, between Firstyeet and Densorumego - I had repeatedly failed to retake Firstyeet, and I was about to quit the game. I was frustrated that I'd gone and bought the best arms and armor and still failed. And when I tried to set up a training ground on a mountain near Squin, bandits again came and defeated me. I went as far as to try and get a refund, which was denied. That refund being denied was the best thing that could've happened. I decided to give the game another try, and to try accepting my failures and growing from them. And if I hadn't done that, I would never have founded New Battlehill. None of the legend worthy tales my squad has been through would have happened. And I'd never have had the fun of going through all of them.\n\nIn short, get this game. It is just great.",

      "A Short Hike is a relaxing, casual game about exploring an expansive, mountainous island park and eventually making your way to its summit so you can get cell phone reception.\n\nYou play as Claire, a bird who can climb, glide, and flap to great heights using a stamina system based upon how many golden and silver feathers you’ve collected. Along the path to the mountaintop you’ll encounter Animal Crossing-style characters who are friendly, punny, and usually have some minor task for you to solve, ranging from finding lost items to making deliveries.\n\nHelping residents of the island is completely optional, as is just about every activity in the game other than locating a few feathers and reaching the summit; as a result, length can range from an hour if you don’t stop to smell the roses to a few hours if you decide to make friends with everyone and see all the park has to offer.\n\nActivities include filling out a fishing journal by trading in your catches, digging in suspicious spots, solving treasure map clues, parkour racing, and opening up shortcuts by breaking blocked entrances and watering bouncy flowers. \n\nA Short Hike has a charming aesthetic and a lovely, peaceful soundtrack. I felt driven to see everything the game had to offer despite not being forced into any of it and never lost interest until I did so. It’s a beautiful little world that will make fans of Animal Crossing feel right at home.",

The in game language is very difficult to decipher blindly, and if you're not familiar with English you probably shouldn't even bother.  \n\nThe surprising thing about this game is you can pretty much do any puzzle at any given time once you get one or two specific items, but because of how the manual is handled, you'll never know how until you see the pages (or experiment a lot)\n\nI think the most amount of tries I've spent on a boss fight was 7-8, but nothing is stopping you from exploring more and finding stat boosts.",

      "[h1][u]Wonderful game with a great battle system, but terrible netcode[/u][/h1]\n\n[h2]Foreword[/h2]\nI got to know \"Naraka: Bladepoint\" through a friend.\nAt first I was very skeptical, so I only bought the Standard Edition, and later the Ultimate and Deluxe Editions.\nFirst of all, this game has a steep learning curve with its battles.\nExactly why the game may not be suitable for everyone.\nUnfortunately, that doesn't make the playerbase any better, but read more about that below.\nNevertheless, the game and especially the combat system offers a lot of potential and has a lot of posivites to offer.\n\n[h2]Positives[/h2]\n[list]\n[*]Regular updates with ever increasing content\n[*]Few to almost no bugs and if they are, then they are fixed very quickly\n[*]Steep learning curve - Especially at the beginning the game is not easy, but you can quickly get into it with friends\n[*]Pleasant graphics\n[*]Nice sound design, which is location dependent\n[*]Potential to grind for higher ranks and for the Hall of Fame\n[*]Different game modes and events\n[*]Extremely extensive combat system - many possibilities to conter weapons\n[*]Extensive stats, either ingame or with Naraka+ mobile app (app is absolutely top!)\n[*]Well thought through character designs\n[*]Extremely individual character editor - From Thanos to Bruce Lee everything is customizable.\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Neutral[/h2]\n[list]\n[*]Climbing system - It's really good compared to other games. However, you still sometimes get stuck on edges or can't get to the platforms above.\n[*]Microtransactions - I'm personally not a fan of them, but it's not a must in this game and doesn't favor anyone.\n[*]Answers of Discord team members very questionable on some questions\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Negatives[/h2]\n[list]\n[*]Terrible netcode - players with highpings are treated preferentially\n[*]Few European players - Extremely many VPN players with many different Asian characters and languages in the voicechat\n[*]Voicechat is not well thought through\n[*]Partial performance losses\n[*]Ranking matches are partly wrong - Either with new players (Bronze) or experienced players (Asura)\n[*]Partially bad English, as well as German translation\n[*]Some abilities are combined absolutely disgusting and unfortunately more or less meta\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Review written out[/h2]\nNaraka has become a real love-hate relationship game for me.\nI love the extensive combat system and also the steep learning curve from noob to a slightly experienced player. (I am Platinum 1 - Solar 5 at the time of this review).\nSo while the combat system could be frustrating at times at first, I love it all the more now.\nOnly the climbing system, as well as some combinations of abilities or ultimates could be revised.\nFor example, it is common practice (meta) that many players use Ultimates that stun and ensure that you immediately get into the next Ultimate.\nThis is sometimes a bit frustrating, because these combinations are played very often and other heroes, especially the new ones, are not really played because of it. \nHowever, you can work around these combinations or counter them yourself. Unfortunately, this is not always easy, especially for new players.\n(For example, the combination of Valda - Viper - Tianhai).\nHowever, a victory and the killing of opponents, especially higher ones, with whom you are unfortunately sometimes matched, releases a lot of endorphins in Naraka, so that a victory feels extremely rewarding.\n\nUnfortunately, this brings me to the part that makes it extremely difficult for me to decide on a positive rating for this game.\nThe game, for being released in 2021, has a horrible netcode for a martial arts battle royale game.\nThere are extremely many Asian players who connect directly or via VPN to the europian servers.\nThis is especially noticeable when you activate the voice chat, which by the way, has no individual regulation for volume or a mute function per player.\nUnfortunately, those players have a ping beyond 150ms.\nSadly, this is a big problem for people with low latency.\nYou partly punch through enemies bodies.\nVarious focus attacks are therefore not always blockable or the opponent lags at you, while the player for himself has no lags at all.\nThis is not only unfair, but should actually no longer be a problem in 2022.\nFor example, it would be enough to not let players with a ping greater than 150ms/200ms move.\nAccording to the Discord community manager, there is a region lock and most of the names are just \"memes\" . \nBut you don't notice anything about the region lock in the game and we can theoretically connect to other servers.\n\nAnother big problem is the matchmaking.\nEven with Bronze or Silver, you are matched with Asura players when there is a lack of players.\nThis is not necessarily nice, but you get a lot of points for survival and you also learn a lot of techniques.\n\nAs negative as this all sounds, the game still gets a positive rating from me.\nI love the sound design, which comes into its proper place in the battles and is different for each location on the map.\nThis reminds me of Prince of Persia in some areas and provides more excitement in fights.\nIn addition, the varied battles, no matter how hopeless they sometimes seem, are all the more rewarding if you win.\nEspecially when you're killing another team, consisting of 3 people, as the last survivor of your team.\nThe map design is also absolutely great. Every location has been carefully thought through. \nGreat lighting design really highlights some of the locations.\nYou can overlook small bugs like misplaced branches (a branch hangs in the air next to a tree).\n\nBut my favorite part is the grinding to a higher rank. \nThe ranking system and especially the Hall of Fame encourage you to play.\nGetting into the top 100 of a much-played character feels very rewarding.\nSo does slaying a moonbane.\n\n[h2]Epilogue[/h2]\nAll in all, despite the flaws, Naraka has a lot going for it, and even though the larger issues can be extremely frustrating, the game saves itself with the extensive battle system, the incredibly great locations including sound design, and the extensive ranking system including Hall of Fame.\nI love the game because of the thoughtful little things, even if I hate it extremely at times.\n\nEven though the game can quickly become frustrating for new players, you should be aware that it has a lot to offer if you are willing to learn.\nThe accompanying app is an extremely well thought through and great gimmick in this regard.\n\nI would be happy to take you by the hand and introduce you to the game.\nJust visit us on our [URL=https://discord.nox-eagles.de]Discord[/URL].\n\nI would like to thank all of you who have read my review until the end.\nI'm looking forward to your opinions :)\nWith best regards\nYour Holt",
      "Fall Guys had a rough start. Unstable servers and people cheating to win. About a year later I picked it up again and I must say it really has improved a lot. I honestly don't have any issues which cheaters anymore and the servers don't crash on me anymore.\n\nIt's also getting more and more stages to play so it feels refreshing to play a few rounds every day.  The events for certain skins are also really fun. Sure there could still be some improvements like personal usernames or maybe a way to trade in skins you don't want. But I feel like they listen to their community and are aiming to make it as fun as possible. I'm interested to see how Fall Guys will keep evolving!",
      "Started strong, ended annoyingly.\n\nMoral of the story? People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.\n\nIt paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that \"routine\" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.\n\nI liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters. But it all fell apart and tries to teach a very vapid moral that someone in their early 20's who has never had a meaningful relationship would idealize.\n\nAt least it was short.\n",

      "One of the better RPG maker games i've seen and played, especially considering it was made on RPG Maker 2003. The beginning of the game was great and felt like there was a ton of potential, but a lot of the overworld mechanics were underutilized (jumping, swimming, orb flying). The writing was alright in the beginning, but started to turn into a bad fanfic in the middle/end of the game. The ending was... wholly unsatisfying and abrupt. It made very little sense, and did absolutely nothing to answer any questions asked at any point in the game, rather asking brand new questions and providing no resolution for any of the characters. You'll get about 10-14 hours of this game, which is kind of amazing for an RPG maker game, but honestly, steam has SOOOO many better titles available in this price range that unless you're into RPG maker, you should go elsewhere.",

      "Tentative review of game in progress, but so far it is amazing and I had to leave a review in support of it.  As far as the game itself goes, I'm giving it a 9/10.  As far as the port goes, the lack of keyboard input prompts seems frustrating when they already have the ability to change between xbox and ps4 buttons, but I use a controller and expect most will for this, but it's worth mentioning in the sake of fairness and accuracy.  There is a certain graphics setting called \"effects\" with high and low.  High is causing major fps drops under certain conditions even on a pc with an rtx 3080 and a 5800x cpu.  Devs have acknowledged it and are working on improving it.  Other than these issues though, no problems at all.  Online play has been smooth and i haven't experienced any disconnects.  The game itself has only crashed once in 93 hours, but that was also during excessive alt tabbing while the game was in true fullscreen mode, and it crashed on an alt-tab itself, so I'm not really blaming the game on that one given it was the only time.  Again, overall the game is playing great and I have no problems with it on a functional level as well as an entertainment level, I just want to be as fair and accurate as I can, and these were really the only problems I could find with it.",
      "A simple but detailed explanation of why, after having played both versions, I prefer Definitive Edition (DE) instead of 2013 Edition:\n\n-2013 Edition's farms don't automatically re-seed, forcing you to either order your villagers to re-seed them, or to mash the \"queue re-seed\" button in the mill. In DE, you can set the mills to automatically re-seed.\n-Definitive Edition lets you shift-click construction orders just like in 2013 Edition, but in the latter, the villager will move to build the last building you placed down. If you order several buildings, they will stop constructing the building they're already working on to go build the new one. In DE they will wait to finish the first building before starting on the next one.\n-2013 Edition's unit sprites are very pixelly and hard to distinguish one type of infantry unit from another, and to a lesser extent, one team from another. DE's graphics are much clearer so it is very easy to distinguish unit type/team.\n-Definitive Edition is far, FAR more customizable than 2013 Edition. Not just with the settings (graphics, UI, and controls are much more changeable) but especially with creating a game, namely win conditions, starting conditions, map sizes, unit restrictions, etc. You can adjust many more settings to make a new game into whatever kind of scenario you want. Also you can see what the map types actually look like in DE.\n-Definitive Edition has noticeably better pathfinding than 2013 Edition.\n-In DE you can zoom in and out. In 2013 Edition you can't.\n-In DE you can queue build orders while simultaneously upgrading the building. In 2013 Edition you can't even see any build options while a building is in the middle of upgrading.\n-In DE you can tell scouts to automatically scout out the map.\n-In DE the HUD shows you how many villagers are working on each resource. 2013 Edition does not do this, you have to play hide and seek with each one to count them.\n-The soundtrack for DE has more faction-specific songs, as well as less repetitive music. Both game's soundtracks are good, but I find having the DE soundtrack playing in the background to be more enjoyable. This point is pure preference.\n-2013 Edition's graphics are nice if you enjoy the old-school style, but DE's graphics are significantly easier on the eyes and prettier.\n-Definitive Edition has more civilizations.\n-Definitive Edition is just as moddable and has a very passionate modding community.\n-Definitive Edition seems to have more balanced gameplay.",

      "IRL, I really am an unmotivated 20 year old college student, not many friends, living away from my mom.\nThis is a game that kids might not be able to relate as much as peeps my age.. but Im not saying there's an age restriction or something, no. There's a lot of useful lessons anyone can pick up from this.\n\nThe emotional issues it tackles are pretty grounded and somewhat refreshing to see in a game. There's a HUGE mystery element when it comes to the story. (which is sooo damn good mind you). But the conversations you have with the people in this game are just so real and cherishable, you could just wish these in-game days won't stop. \n\nThe small moments you have with family and friends in Night in the Woods are probably one of the most amazing experiences I ever had in a game\n\nPS: After finishing the story, I got all sappy and tear jerky that I went and called my mom to tell her that I love and miss her and stuff.. that's what this game is.\n\nUgh kill me.

      "Where to start.... in short entire game is boring and very slow paced for no aparent reason.\n\nAI: AI performs only very basic functions and does not upgrade buildings and does the opposite of whats beneficial for your empire. AI does not do very well when engaging in displomacy.\n\nUI: You will spend most of your time trying to manage/hover around very CLUMSY and absolutely disgusting UI. Other 4x games offer far superior UI and make is easier to manage your asset on the field e.g. Sword of the stars II, Star Ruler 2, Distant world, Endless Legends, Endless Space etc.\n\nGFX: Graphics are not the top notch what you would expect from a modern 4x game but they are on far with Endless Legends. GFX leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nAlien Races: I dont need to say much but like Planets most of the races are COPY / PASTE. Nothing unique or special about each. \n\nMP: Multiplayer has a mind of its own and in most cases wont let you join public games unless its a private game.\n\nStellaris bring nothing new to 4x Genre in 2016!.\n Right now everyone is almost beta testing for the developers so we can find bugs, report them  and help them fix their game. Why not let players do beta before before release? But then there is  a question of sale and refund. \n\nBut overall this game does offer amazing soundtrack.",
      "The good:\n+ Great story with satisfying finale.\n+ Endearing main cast/characters.\n+ Great world building meets with 90s Indonesia culture.\n+ Pleasant pixel artstyle. The cutscenes visual is amazing, even though i notice few awkward animation.\n+ Nice soundtrack.\n+ Puzzle is mostly well balanced. Not too difficult and doesn't make you feel bored/annoyed either.\n\nThe bad: - \n\nThe ugly:\n* Some pacing problem. There are so many sidetrack a.k.a. \"To complete sub-task C you also must complete sub-sub-task X, Y and Z\" during chapter 2-4.\n* Sometimes you might have to going around in circles to solve certain task or accidentally skipped something.\n\nDespite few flaws, A Space for the Unbound is definitely best game developed by Mojiken Studio and best story-driven/adventure game among all games created by Indonesian developer. If you like side-scrolling/adventure game (such as GRIS, Unreal Life or Oneshot) or game made by Mojiken Studio/Toge production (such as Coffee Talk or When The Past Was Around), you should give this game a try.",

Souls.\n\nIf you play this game like you would a dark souls game you would not have any fun, I know this because I spent the first 30 hours playing it like a Dark souls game and wasn't enjoying it.\nIn order to play this game how it is supposed to be played you need to start investing more in learning combos for your character, different techniques and items to use.  Each weapon has a unique set of combos you can invest in.  When you learn how to use these combos, you'll find that enemies who were infuriating to fight against being defeated much easier and the game becomes more challenging and fun over frustrating.\n\nSummery: This game isn't Dark Souls, So stop playing it like it is Dark souls!\nHighly recommend! \n\n\n",

Rowling, at a time far before Harry & friends were even born. You’ll play as a fifth year student in the titular magics academy, admitted this late because of unspecified ‘special circumstances’. The virtual rendition of Rowling’s works is nothing short of exceptional, with not only Hogwarts itself, but also its environs (like the town of Hogsmeade or the dangerous Forbidden Forest), all recreated faithfully and down to the most minute details. Of course, some things will differ from movies and books, with the game being set in the 1800s. \n\nThe main story follows the classic ‘manifest destiny’ archetype, where your custom-made character will discover hidden potential that ties them to a greater purpose. Despite some genuinely memorable characters and some interesting side- and main-quests, the overall narrative can’t help but fall a little flat and stale, especially towards the ending phases. Nonetheless, many enjoyable adventures await you. Notably, there are no romance or love/hate dichotomies in the relationships you have with side-characters, as your choices will always end up in pretty much the same results during questlines.\n\n[h3]Exploration, Collectibles & Secrets[/h3]\nThe world is vast and visually magnificent, peppered to no-end with points of interest that often hold collectibles, currency or other utilities. Initially on foot, and later on with the iconic enchanted brooms and even flying magical creatures, you’ll be able to explore at leisure and clear the enormous amount of side-activities. A good portion of these, however, will prove inaccessible until you gain the right spells or abilities, in a sort-of ‘metroidvania’ fashion that promotes meaningful backtracking. Fast travel and an item-highlighting spell prove invaluable in saving time while exploring. Collectibles are mostly cosmetic, enabling the customization of both your wizard and your own private room once you unlock it, to suit various styles. \n\nMost dungeons and locations have additional puzzles or hidden paths that often lead to collectibles or extra resources; exploration feels rewarding, with a genuine sense of mystery surrounding each new point of interest you’ll find. Despite that, most dungeons and locations play out in the same way, and become repetitive in the long haul.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2933385898\n\n[h3]Combat System & Bosses[/h3]\nMagical battles use spells as sole means of offense and defense. Usually against multiple enemies at once, sometimes supported by allied NPCs, you’ll have to time your protection spell right in order to deflect incoming attacks, or dodge-roll away in case of unblockable ones. Enemies are varied and range from magical creatures to dark wizards and goblin soldiers, to name a few. Some of them may be weak to specific charms, others have shields you can break by using specific spell categories (damage, utility, movement) or other special abilities, like immunity to certain effects. \n\nCombat feels engaging, well-paced and is more than a little gory for this universe’s standards, death will be far more common than in the movies or books. The way you can combine spell effects to your advantage and use the environment further adds to the base system, while the amount of passive upgrades with item traits and spell-related talents you can gain progressively add another layer of depth. In late-game however you’ll become overpowered between potions, passive traits, talents and endgame spells - so much that supposedly fearsome dark wizards will prove little more than a nuisance due to power creep.\n\n[h3]Quests, Minigames & Challenges[/h3]\nQuests usually involve retrieving something, talking to a specific NPC, solving a treasure hunt based on visual clues, getting the solution to logic-based puzzles and more, depending on the case. While some side-quests are unique and memorable, most will be fetch chores or dry open-world shenanigans that you’ll have to repeat over and over in the same fashion. Less, but more meaningful and unique quests would have been better than this bloat, for sure. \n\nChallenges are paramount in unlocking unique bonuses like increased inventory capacity, many cosmetics, and even unique passive upgrades to equip in gear pieces. They often require you to slay X of a specific enemy, finish X of the same activity, and such “long-term” goals. Some of them are a massive grind and will only give you the 25th pair of gloves you don’t need, or other cosmetics that aren’t worth the effort.",

      "GIVE ME THE GODDAMN COPY/PASTE ROOM BUTTON!\n\n10/10 would play again.\n\n(Ttips to combat the somewhat broken system atm:\n\n1. Use patients list, manually send those patients to treatment or home: \na. Very high diagnosis but still queuing for GPs (even 100% patients will wait for GP till their death, it will waste most GP resources)\nb. Very low mood/health patient, if you can gurantee the patient getting their treatment soon w/o affecting others in the queue, use the room's queue function, or use click on the patient to change his position in the queue, otherwise send him home to avoid penalty\n\n2. Treatments are much more profitable than diagnosis, plus they leave after treatment no matter what, but if well treated, then you don't need much ghost hunting janitors\n\n3. If in need of money in the early game, don't bother with food/drink/bathroom/comfort, do the minium and focus on your diagnosis -> treatment, most patient will get treated before they rage quit, thus make you a lot of money. With staff, if they near rage quit, just raise their salary.\n\n4. In the early game, only put down the essential objects (e.g. only desk and file cabinet in GP's) to maximize your profit. They only room I recommend to decorate to lvl 5 is staff room to speed up their recovery.\n\n5. ALWAYS ensure there is a toilet right next to your staff room, and a cafe. If a tired staff need bathroom, he/she will walk all the way to the staff room and back to toilet and back to staff room, even if a toilet is right next to his/her office. Samething with Cafe, it provides a 'nice meal' bonus.\n\n6. Do not build more reception than you need, build less. It is a great way to control the patient flow, they don't wonder around while in a reception queue.\n\n7. For a large map, patients entering the hospital from mutiple gates. I don't recommend building reception other than one specific area (preferably right next to GP's office), reason as above.\n\n8. News agent can get long queue very easily, as long as you have one, patients in queue will travel all the way across the map for it. So be careful, either don't put any, or put one in every building (at least).\n\n9. With spare money, get your staff trained ASAP, especially staff providing treatment (to ensure high chance of successful treatment)\n\n10. Click on a room, goes to 'info' tab, the last sentence there will tell you what training the staff in the room should have.\n\n11. Keep track of your staff's skills, and assign them only ONE job in the staff -> job assignment menu, so AI won't mess your system up.)\n\nThings I'd really like to be changed:\n1. WAY too many patients.\nI think the new patients' growth(spawn) need to be slow down at certain point either automatically or mannually, I often found myself in need of double the amount of GP offices in the mid-game. Since GP offices are the choke points, it can get out of control in matter of seconds, which left no Human resources/money/time to train everyone. Besides, it is realistic, there are only so many people a town have.\nAnd because of the growth issue, I find myself have to build more and more, I'd like to slow down and taking care of every corner of my hospital, not just keep building. Quality takes time, nobody like be overly pushed by the game.\n\n2. Rooms merge\nJust like in real lives, Doctor's room are private, but pharmacy? I think other rooms should not be private - Allow us to put multiple machine and people in one room, make it shared. It is just bizzare to not make it shared, and vey wasteful of time/money/spaces. Besides, some room looks really empty.\n\n3. Wards\nWards are weird, I'm not sure why. Often than not, I have more than enough beds and nurses, but still 6+ wait outside, I'm not sure what triggers them to be 'called in'\n\n4. FOOD/DRINK/TOILET is broken\nI'm sorry, but I'm not gonna build cafe & bathroom every 3 inchs. IRL, most hospital have 1~3 cafes, a small~medium toilet on every floor. Space is valuable, I would rather leave it to medical facilities. I think the AI is a bit broken at this point, they constantly want drink/food/bathrooms while I have 6+ machines/2 toilets in every building. As if they can't walk 10m to the nearest one.\n\n5. Janitors are kind of dump.....I wish we can assign areas to janitors/assitances, so they won't always walk across the map back and forth.\n\n6. Man, this is 2018, we got central heating and air-conditioning...for real. Maybe make a seprate tunnel system? Like water, electricity, heat, air. Hospital's air exchange system is much more important than usual buildings I believe.\n\n7. Credit to Ibbi Wyxx in the commnet, I think it is great to set patient with certain percent of diagnosis straight to treatment rooms. It makes sense and later in the game, with doctors fully trained I imagine 100% diagnosis on most patients in the GP's shouldn't be a problem. And it is how real life works as well, dorctors are not always 100% sure whats wrong, they might start some harmless/urgent treatment first, myself actually is in this situation right now \n\n(sometimes I feel like I'm being treated in my own hospital because I just stayed at one IRL, so I have to make everything right as if trying to please myself...)\n\n8.  Some of those skills just look fancy since you can't replace them.\nThis one does not matter much, I'm very OCD when it comes to managment, so atm I have to wait for the right person w/o any skills I don't want on them so the training oppourtinity will not go wasted, but it is hard and annoying. Besides, it is a real problem since you can only learn 5 skills, so just choosing whoever is not effective and effecient in the long run. (for example a GP w/ Radiology skill)\n\nAlso, it makes some of the skill essentially useless, i.e. master class (speed up learning and teaching), it may seem useful, but it will eventually cost you a lot more than you gain. Down the line it will cost you one spot for other skill. If just hiring someone w/ this skill to teach then fire him, it is also costly and not making any real sense. \n\nThings I'd like to see (in DLCs?):\n1. Ambulances management. Ambulance are essential part of a hospital, ERs are even better! (Stayed at a ER bed not long ago watch the whole ER room working,man, ERs are cool af, but I do hope less people need to see it because it is...ER)\n2. Multifloor-hospital.\n3. ICU etc.?\n4. Medicin/drug development/management\n5. Specialists office?\n6. More background music/radio, its a bit repetitive at this point",
      "Great game! At times it can get frustrating (boss battles), but the good out weighs the bad by a landslide. Even when i did get mad, which was a lot, I never stayed mad for long. There is just far too much to enjoy about the game. The art style is just simply amazing, the movement of your character around the world is just so satisfying once you get used to it, the puzzles aren't too easy or too hard, and everything in the game just goes together pretty much perfectly. All in all this game is extremely well made. Would recommend buying if you want a super unique experience 11/10",
      "cool game but the font is almost unreadable at times",
      "This HD remake of the PS2/DC classic Rez breathes some new life into a very old gem, however the update only harms its own image due to simple design mistakes and the enhancements that only highlight those mistakes further.\n\nThe PS2 controller made targeting slow and the game was intentionally timed to the slow pace at which you could target enemies. This meant the sound fx and visuals tied to targeting and shooting were all in sync with the music - that's at the core of the Rez experience. However the massively improved VR controls make targeting and shooting VERY fast. As a result all the sound effects and visuals play at once in a cacophony, the enemies die, and then you have a long 4 - 8 beat stretch of nothing as the backing track plods along, waiting for new enemies to spawn.\n\nWhat makes this worse is that the graphic updates end up being largely absent. Enemies filled the middle ground of the scene, captured your attention, and were the source of many particles, effects, the music, and animation - but since they all die quickly you're often left staring at the sky box with nothing happening. Then looking around in VR during these wait periods you can see how empty and simple the levels are because the HD parts are in the effects not the environments.\n\nThis all becomes especially noticeable in Area 5 when you demolish a mini boss and you're left sitting for 2-3 minutes floating through a desolate low-poly void with half the song missing. It feels like the game is broken. They should either have put a limit on the speed at which you can lock-on to enemies (matching to the BPM of the track), added more enemies to match the faster pace of this version, or filled the spaces with stuff to interact with so you can trigger the SFX/VFX where the music and visual upgrades are hiding.\n\nNo new player is going to know that the game is -meant- to be synced to the music and even if they try it is entirely out of sync with itself. This aspect demolishes the intended audio/visual experience which is the point of the entire game. It's very sad to consider how stunning Child of Eden was when it took advantage of the expanded memory, gpu, and peripherals it had available, and it goes to show how much potential has been squandered here. This would have been obvious if it had been properly play tested.\n\nTo add salt to the wound, Area X (the new VR part of the game made for Infinite) failed to work on my Quest 2. I couldn't target anything so I just couldn't play that at all (I hear it's basically just 1 extra 15 min level anyway). Truly disappointing in every way.",

      "Melatonin is a simple rhythm game, with a focus on ease of gameplay and calmer sounds.\nIf you're expecting something on the tougher or more upbeat side, this ain't it.  Ironically, I had more fun as I stopped focusing on scoring well, and more fun when I was just feeling the music and half-asleep.  The sounds and songs are quite relaxing lol.\n\nOn the shorter side of games, it still delivers an enjoyable experience in what it offers. The timing is a *little* on the forgiving side, and there are even accessibility options if you need a little more help, such as timing circles, metronome, and a bigger Perfect window.  If you'd rather go for a challenge, a Perfect only option is also available.\n\nControls are quite simple, using [strike]4[/strike] 3 directional keys and an action key (Space by default). In each tutorial, you're told whether you'll need to hit directional keys or the action key, and whether they're held or not, as well as general timing.  For some stages, the instructions don't give you as good an idea as the tutorial itself/timing circles do (Work and Time levels for me).  All good, but in some levels you get tempo changes in the middle of the song that can throw you a bit off, especially if you're just grooving to the audio cues... when you can hear and distinguish them.  Unfortunately, there are a few levels where the audio cues are either far too similar to each other, or happen too quickly to react to.  This can be a bit of a bummer, as I prefer working off audio for rhythm games, as their focus should be lol.  \n\nWhile Melatonin doesn't bring a whole lot to the table, it doesn't need to.  Less is more here, and the art and sound direction definitely hit their target.\nRelax.",

      "Falcom's Action RPG Masterpiece.\n\nbest story in the series. it follows the latest adventure of Adol and his companions, stranded in an island and slowly uncovering their secrets. the tight, but well developed cast are absolutely the best written characters in the series. from party member to your fellow castaways all have developed motivation, personality and charm. \n\nalot of the horribad translation and voice acting have been fixed, and it finally got the treatment it deserve as a masterpiece. \n\nthe gameplay is an evolution of the modern Ys game. at its core, ys 8 is an action RPG where you control adol and several other party members with unique set of skills, moveset, weapons and super attack. each character represent an attack type (slash, pierce, smash) that are pitted against various enemies with certain weaknesses. great variety of enemies, amazing boss battles, music and story. \n\non release, there seems to be a big problem for the port, but as far as i know, everything has been patched to very good level of stability. over 70 hours, the game crashed twice (and saved by the intuitive autosave system), run flawlessly 60 FPS and 1440p without a single slowdown. \n\n10/10 game go buy so we get monstrum nox on PC.",

      "This game is utter trash, a classic example of a terrible game that exists only to make the developer money on card sales. There are no options for audio and video settings, the textures and font are ugly as hell, and the controls stink. You move a glowing ball of light around and pass through various colored laser barriers. There are enemies who dim your light on the first hit, and kill you on the second. The instructions are barely above gibberish, with instructions like \"color change to spend the wall color\" and \"use the right button mouse for charge and defend\". You eventually piece together that those instructions mean \"touch the colored balls of light to change the color of your light to match the laser barriers in order to pass through them without dying\" and \"stand on the button and right click to power up laser barriers to protect yourself from the small enemy lights that chase you relentlessly when you get too close\". That second one is only theoretical though, as in practice it's impossible to escape the enemy lights fast enough to have time to charge the defensive laser barriers, so I have no proof that they actually destroy the enemies. On top of all that, the game occasionally gets stuck after you die a few times on the same level, and there's nothing to be done except restart from the very beginning on the tutorial levels. There's the potential for an interesting puzzle game here, but the execution is so bad I can't recommend this junk even for the price of two cents that I paid.",
      "It may not be that similar to what most people are familiar with, as a building game, but in most every sense which counts, I believe this is the greatest building game I have ever played.\n\nThe controls are smooth, the Building Mechanics are smooth, the interplay of cuteness and silliness is so smooth, and Lillian has the cutest face in the known universe.\n\nTruly a fantastic game with enjoyable and concise mechanics, the Block Grid is as malleable as Minecraft (except that some areas cannot be mined, usually story quest locations), the ally AI is more involved than Conan (sitting at a table with Rosie to gobble some greens? cute), and the combat is slightly dangerous at first, but mostly very mellow and not in any way detrimental to the building side (the villagers even fix up the damage done to your village in story battles - at least in the 'tutorial' island).\n\nMy only advices:\n\n- If the Camera is too tight on you and too slow to zoom out, switch perspective and back, if that doesn't work, look down at the ground and jump a couple times! (your head will push the camera up into the sky faster)\n\n- Don't get too creative on Furrowfield Farm! I spent a lot of time building and customising, being slightly annoyed at the small build area of the island, but now I discover that the whole thing was essentially a tutorial, and that completing the story missions there opened up the game in a much bigger way. Now I am back on the home Island and am able to build across a much larger area. If you're still in Furrowfield, you basically haven't started the game yet, so get that story done!\n\n- IF YOU SUFFER FROM REGULAR COMPUTER OR PROGRAMME CRASHES:\nWhen loading a Game you can press (A) / (X) on Controller to Copy the Save File and Back it up on one of the other Save Slots. I recommend doing this every day you play in case of  Corrupted Save Data caused by Crashing while Sailing to another Island.\n\nI am tempted to give this game a 9/10 - which is a serious seal of approval from me. Even on my strictest day, I would never give it less than a 7 - it is fun, cute, silly, serious, touching, exciting, and above all else, architexcellent!",
      "this game is something i have literally always wanted but never thought would exist. a historical fiction narrative that isn't about war or combat but rather something as mundane as being a maid...

      "Ni no kuni II: Revenant Kingdom is a great RPG that, while a little dissapointing in some aspects, makes up for it with it's positives.\n\nLet's start talking about the negatives: \n\n- the characters are a little bland, most of them barely get anything added to their backstories nor are there any specific sidequests for them (yet). They're not bad, and Evan/Roland are good characters, but the rest falls a bit short.\n\n- The soundtrack is a little forgetable, even if it does have a few good gems in there\n\nNow the \"neutral\" points:\n\n- The main gameplay is simple, with only a few attack buttons and barely any combos, so if you're looking for a deep combat you're going to be a little dissapointed.\n\n- The story is simple; i personally enjoy it and how it ends but i could see someone who's looking for some deep story to be left unsatisfied.\n\nNow for the good aspects:\n\n- The graphics are beautiful, it's basically a playable Ghibli Studio movie\n- The gameplay (both combat and army based) is fun, fast and rewarding to do, especially when you unlock more spells\n- The kingdom management is simple to do and it gives you a sense of pride and accomplishment (unlike EA) when you expand it with new building and bigger borders\n- The sidequests are for the most time fun with cool citizens to meet and recruit\n- The random dungeons are cool to explore\n\nI played 85 hours of this game and i enjoyed every second.

I like games like Portal 2, The Talos Principle, and there is no point to compare this games, because they are completly different, even if they have few common things like solving riddles and story with fresh look at some philosophical questions. Point is that every one of them including The Swapper is good at what it do, and every one of them is unique.

And yeah bro, 15 bucks seems steep for a game that you can finish in under an hour, but hell, maybe don't speed run? It's a walking simulator after all. Or maybe support indie game devs. *Or maybe* read the Steam tags that say \"short\" and \"walking simulator\" and then don't count that against the game. You don't review CS;GO and say \"not bad, but too much shooting\" right? RIGHT? \n\nLook. I've had some wine. And I've had some feelings. And Gone Home is a piece of video game history whether people want it to be or not. It's a game I wish I would have known about when it was first released. Hell I needed it five years earlier than that. \n\nIf you're pissed that Gone Home wasn't dramatic enough or that it's \"homosexual\" then maybe realize that this game wasn't made for you and that does not qualify it as bad. \n\nAnyway, that cat journal achievement was neat.",

This game has fascinating gameplay, being able to jump from one surface of salt to another so smoothly and quickly. It makes the game different from others, because the movement and how you go around the map is so different. \n\nThe checkpoint system was a little odd to me. Your progress is still \"saved\" when you trigger a mechanic, it's just that the flag sets your spawn location. So there is no need to fret if you die after doing something important.\n\nI also got to use the stat system a lot today, and man, it reminds me of Dark Souls. If you die, you leave behind your salt, and you have to go back to collect it. Once you do, you can, of course, use it to buy upgrades from the tents for your character. Which is a nice way to choose how you want your character to grow. I like when my healing potions heal a lot, for example, instead of having a lot of base hp right from the start.

      "Not For Broadcast is a good game... but it has some issues.\n\nThe story is really captivating; though the game does switch between humour and a serious story quite often, both are excellently done. Advance (the political party who ends up getting into power and becomes authoritarian) actually only gets into power in the first part of the game (the tutorial broadcast). You actually get to see the descent into authoritarianism and dystopia, which basically no other game (at least, any game I've ever played) has actually done, and not really any other forms of media either. You also get to influence some events in game [spoiler](for example, one of the ads you can play is an advertisement for a children's toy, and later there is an... incident... involving the toy, and (if you played the ad), the presenters of National Nightly News (Jeremy and Megan) state in a segment regarding the incident that they should never have advertised the toy.[/spoiler] It's a really minor thing, because you can just choose [i]not[/i] to play the ad, but I really love that detail), and having a noticeable impact on anything is really enjoyable.\n\nThe gameplay is mostly good. You basically just have to be on your toes, switching to different cameras every now and again, being ready to censor things, and being ready to go to the adverts. All basic tasks, but since you're doing most of them together, it relies on you being attentive and reactive. The only part of the gameplay I would criticize is the signal interference section. It's easy, and doesn't even really distract you, as you just have to move a slider up and down with a slight bit of delay. It's just not a fun part of the game.\n\nMy biggest gripe with the game has to be the lag; something which I know I'm not alone in experiencing. Online, it suggests closing down performance heavy tasks, such as web browsers, but I know for a fact that I had a few webpages up when I was playing the free prologue (the first broadcast, which gives a pretty good idea of what the game is), and experienced no issues at all. I really don't know what the coding differences between the paid version and the prologue of the game are, but that doesn't seem like it should be a difference. Generally the lag was irritating, but not something that hinders you in any way, but there is one level where you're advised to switch screens because naked protesters may pop up to protest Advance's policies. Visual lag, in this case, really isn't good. I also just got a windows pop up saying that the game was frozen, and so I had to close it down... not great.\n\nOverall; the gameplay is good, with really the exception of the interference task, and the story is excellent, but the technical issues are just... really, really irritating. I would recommend the game, but I would warn you that the technical issues do end up being quite irritating.\n\nOverall; the game is good, but the technical issues can be annoying.",
      "This game will leave you satisfied.\n\nI know that doesn't sound like much of a selling point, but it is. This game won't give you a sequal hook, it won't give you a product carved away like a thanksgiving turkey, each part sold seperately or held to ransom. \n\nThis is not a game about standing victorious over your enemies, it's not a game with some kind of adrenal rush that will leave you drained and empty afterwards.\n\nThis isn't a game about saving the world, as surprising as that may sound considering the hero's goal.\n\nThis is a game about hope. Hope for tomorrow, hope for your fellow man, hope for dreams and wishes, hope for a last shimmer of light in the encroaching darkness.\n\nThis is a game that will make you ask things about yourself, even if only subconciously. \n\nBut, most importantly of all, this is an experience that will make you say \"I was happy to be there, if only for a time.\"\n\nAnd I was, in fact, happy to be here.\n\nHats off to you ladies and gentlemen, you made a cyinical old bastard smile for a good ten hours.",
      "Playing this game instantly brought back memories of me playing TMNT, Battletoads, Double Dragon, and Streets of Rage, with my little brother on the NES and Sega Genesis in the early 90s. Luckily this game doesn’t feature TMNT’s ridiculous water level or Battletoads' sadistic peed bike level. The graphics are perfect, the controls are great, the soundtrack is awesome (especially the Wu-Tang stage, and the Shredder stage), and the levels and overworld map are fun to navigate. I’ve played through the story mode with all 7 characters and have played through the arcade mode multiple times solo and many times in multiplayer and I’ve enjoyed every bit of it. This game is so much fun.\n\nThere are a few things I wish existed though. I wish there were more playable characters. I wish that you did not lose your 7 character’s progress in story mode when you start a new game. I wish you could see the difficulty level of the online arcade game you are joining. I wish there were cumulative stats you could see for arcade and story mode that showed the number of times you completed a stage, how many enemies you knocked out, objects you’ve destroyed, stage times, combo streaks, times taunted, etc. I wish you could create your own turtle and assigned moves, specials, jumps, taunts, and colors.",
      "Such a neat concept!  Clear the table under so many \"strokes\".  Where it really shines, however, is all of the surreal bits you can add into your game like giant balls, conveyor belts, or balls that split when hit.  The game always has many challenges to complete that will require you to use the indicated table/ball/modifier and meet its requirements on your run (like make 3 long shots in a single run or pot multiple balls in a single shot).  Complete enough of these challenges and you'll unlock the next feature, but the game gives you a lot of freedom in which modifers you'll use in your run to increase your odds of completing the given challenge.",
      "My profile pic is the reaction i have towards the game devs that made this game.\nVisually disgusting, gameplay wise impossible and over all terrible.\nWhile it's possible to beat it and get all the achievements it's difficult and also the space level is actually visual aids it's so disgusting to look at that you can't even focus on the gameplay.\nNot worth it even for free which is how i probably got it i can't remember and i don't want to...",
      "I even set a calendar reminder so that I could get this on release. I wish I hadn't bothered. Going great guns until I got to the passage. Game over as I can't progress. Tried allsorts to drop the jammer but unable to do so. I guess it is a case of waiting for all the bugs to get resolved.",
      "Look, I love Magic. It's my favorite game of all time. I met my wife through MTG. I'll be playing it until the day I die.\n\nBut if you're new to the game, and not established on Arena, don't pick it up. It's horrendously difficult to build a collection in this game, doubly so if you're not a fan of playing draft. While they have made incredibly minor adjustments that have been generally positive, the economy on this platform is impossible to do well in. The sheer number of games you have to play to amass any kind of respectable, and more importantly, functional collection of cards is not worth it for just a casual player.\n\nOf course, you can circumvent the grind with money, but that of course is the literal definition of Pay 2 Win. It's a mobile game economy through and through.",
      "I technically got this game for free, as it was bought for me from a friend. And honestly, I didn't really like it. She got it for me, as a means to help with some of my mental health issues I suppose? But it just was very big miss for me, and kinda made me feel worse. A bit anxiety inducing for me, just given the circumstances, talking about life and death. Just not my personal cup of tea.",
      "I'm gonna be honest with you. If you are not live in SEA, I'm not recommend you this game in case of lag and ping. Sometimes I play with one of my friend and we got 200+ ping but the other 3 got 60 ping even we are in Thailand so I guess this game send us to Europe or North America server. You may experience what we got but more often if you are westerner.\n\nAnd don't listen to the people who said ThE sPeCtEr ArE iMbAlAnCe. Most of them play less than 10 hours, try playing specter and you will know how hard specter can be with just a survivor who know how to play or know the loop just a little, even the teleport and sprint skill won't help you.\n\nOkay, the review. This game has a lot of potential and ridiculously fun but lack of balance. Specter kinda overpowered for the newbie due to their skill that can teleport to nearest survivor and can see all survivor with a windwalk skill (Things change when you face the survivor who know what to do). And yes that is the starter specter. And the most thing that make survivor hard to win even in a good team is the syringe(med kit) is really hard to find and you are rarely got a chance to heal yourself.\nThe one thing that really disturb me is when you perform a ritual (like generator from Dead by Daylight) you are in the position that expose yourself and the specter can see you clearly. Don't make me wrong, survivor kinda fun to play due to you can bully specter with a lot of item.\n\nIn summary, this game need some balance patch (I mean a lot) and server problem that need to fix (maybe there are a few westerner that play this game so they didn't invest a lot in EU or NA server). Overall this game is fun to play and better than Dead by Daylight if you ask me, but need to be polish.",
      "This is more of a personal opinion than a useful review, but I would like to share my experience with this game! At the beginning I was very disappointed... I was hoping for a Phoenix Wright competitor, but it wasn't even close! The investigation was so silly, the game doesn't let you leave the scene before you find all the clues, you can't \"weist\" your time going to places not related to the case and the trial doesn't start until you have all you need... the only way to fail is not having coordination to shoot the bullets xD The game takes you exactly where it wants.\nThe first trial was also so obvious I almost gave up playing. BUT THEN... things started to get strange. During my second trial I was \"that is what happened... I mean... I guess...\" and during the third trial I had no fucking idea what was going on D: The story got so deeper and full of details. Each chapter revealing new secrets, showing how complex the plot was!\nI realized that I shouldn't see Danganronpa as a poorly investigation game that wasn't that challenging, but as an amazing novel with such a rich story! The gameplay became secondarly compared to how envolved I was with the whole scenario! The further you go, more incredibly enjoyable it gets. So, for those who didn't like the game for this very reason, give a second chance with another point of view :) enjoy it's fabulous mysteries and you will not regret unreaviling it's secrets!"

Unfortunately, after I came back to this game recently, I have to change my review from Highly Recommended to Not Recommended (this is solely for AirMech Strike, and not related to Wastelands, its PvE counterpart, which I will do a review on at a later date).\n\nTowards the end of 2012, the game was doing really well. There were 500+ players online on average, and it was real easy to get a match.\n\n(+) PVP was simple. Choose your airmech, pilot, unit list, and one item that gives a certain minor bonus. Cosmetics are optional and offer no advantage.\n(+) Player Market introduced later on for trading cosmetic items.\n(+) Badges for people who supported the game.\n(+) Diamond rolls in the chat where players can randomly win Diamonds.\n\nHowever, some downsides also happened.\n(-) You need to pay fees to list an item on the market, using Diamonds, instead of Kudos.\n(-) Books were introduced to either increase trade slots and decrease fees. You needed to spend more Diamonds on these books.\n(+/-) Parts were introduced, adding buffs/debuffs to your AirMechs, though I personally preferred to limit stat customization to Pilots and Items, keeps things simple.\n(-) Nanoforge was introduced for crafting, but is a complicated mess. This wasn't necessary if the game itself wasn't so complex.\n\nWhen AirMech split into AirMech Strike and AirMech Wastelands:\n(-) Parts, Pilots and items were transferred to Wastelands. RIP customization for PVP.\n(+) Keys now available via daily login rewards (the only improvement I've seen).\n(-) Airmech balancing is way off. Once simple skills are now too specific, and there's no need for an ultimate skill, really. AirMech was fine without it.\n\n5 years later and the peak is just over 100 players. The devs took a simple fun game and made it so incredibly complicated that it's no longer a fun game, for me at least.\n\nI hope Carbon Games brings AirMech closer to the late 2012 version, which I feel is the best and most fun version.\n- I have played OSU!, Muse Dash and stepmania plenty and I gotta say that this does not feel like a rhythm game at all. The premise of matching the shape of the map to music sounds interesting but some of the songs I feel like are not mapped out correctly. Or in general this game relies less on music cues and more on visual cues? It felt like maps are only 50% related to the song and you have to ignore what you hear because the map randomly demands patterns that have no matching audio equivalent and everything becomes pure visual memorization.\n- Gone Home is... okay. There's nothing particularly terrible about it, but it's hardly this amazing, revelatory experience that it's been portrayed as in the media. It's just a very short, straightforward game of exploration, in which a fairly simple story of teenage love and rebellion is fed to you through bits and pieces of notes and spoken journal entries you find while exploring a large, abandoned house. But this game does absolutely nothing innovative, unlike the pre-release hype proclaimed. There have been hundreds of games with more compelling stories, and this game introduces no original mechanics. I took my time and explored the entire house, and I beat the game in three sessions totalling 81 minutes.\n\nAgain, it's not bad, it's just an utter ripoff for $20. I got it in a large Humble Bundle package, paying about a dollar for it, and it's decent value at that price, but there's no way I'd pay more than five bucks, and even that is stretching it. I'd be pissed if I'd paid full retail for it. You can find many many games that will be far more engrossing, more entertaining, and just plain longer at this price point.\n- The best driving simulator, period.\nUnmatched soft-body physics, customization, sounds, graphics - everything in BeamNG is close to perfection - and the game is still in early access! The only feature it lacks is visual customization (liveries, stickers, bodykits etc), but these aren't available in many autosims (looking at you, Assetto Corsa). Lots of quality mods which include cars, maps, and a freaking JATO rocket ensure you'll have hundreds of hours of fun here. Touge, track, drift, rally, time attack, offroad, rock crawling, drag - and with zero level loading screens; just a few seconds to switch your car. Zero DLCs, intuitive interface, and built-in gamepad support are also here. 10/10 worth your time and money.\n\nUpdate v0.24: where negative reviews come from\nAfter the major UI overhaul a lot of negative reviews were posted. Many of those call the game \"literally unplayable\" - which is obviously greatly exaggerated, unlike the other stated problem: lost controller presets. That one is actually unpleasant to deal with (judging from the reviewers' words, since I myself didn't experience a single problem with my DualShock4 nor with the game itself), but yet it was not a force majeure that could not be avoided, as every major update comes after a teaser - which should be a sign for everyone with a custom preset to save or write it down, just in case the update affects it.\n\nTo sum up, BeamNG.drive is still a nearly perfect-rated game - and a lot of the negative reviews are, to put it mildly, unjustified.\n\nUpdate: I love the new Covet.\n- I appreciate the sincerity of Jusant. You can tell its creators have placed genuine care into their product, which has made the experience of playing it joyful and kind.\nThe visuals are stunning, the mechanics are not overwhelming, the soundtrack is soothing, and the puzzles are not frustrating. A great climbing game all around with an easy-to-follow yet gripping narrative. \nHopefully, Ukrainian localization will also be added soon.\n\n-     \nI was impatient for this game and i am very satisfied with it!\n\nThe Graphics are polished as would expect, the new circuits in Las Vegas and Losail in Qatar are very good together with others that we run at night the effects of the lights in conjunction with the illuminated buildings are incredible!\n\nBraking Point 2 is so satisfying it takes between 8 to 10 hours to complete, no spoilers i think but we have a lot of characters and some familiar faces from the past!\n\nNew F1 World, offers a structure of different Series, each one is a chain of events with having a primary objective that needs to complete to progress to the next, secundary objectives can be pursued for extra rewards!\n\nCareer Mode identical to the previous ones!\n\nRed Flag Deploying will teleport the cars to the pits where we can change our strategy to restart the race!\n\nDriving and Feedback, overall there is a big improvement more precise and dynamic the ffb on the steering wheel is very good, with Gamepad it's easy to adapt and get top times!\n\n\nWhen an update comes out just don't screw up the handling!\n\nF1 23 is better than the previous ones in every way!\n  \n\n- An instant classic.\n---\n\nThe original [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/kunovega/recommended/264200]One Finger Death Punch[/url] was an unexpected treat for me. The refined simplicity of just two buttons that require masterful timing to create a legitimate fighting experience laid out to a selection of music that reminds you of the classic Kung-fu movies of the 1970's but packaged with a carefree stickman aesthetic.\n\nOne Finger Death Punch 2 is a respectable sequel in most ways. The core gameplay is fundamentally the same while the visual indicators and special attack animations have been upgraded and made more fanciful. Other things are changed simply to give you a new experience.\n\nEvery aspect of the game is polished from the interesting tutorial to the many additional modes (survival, gauntlet, etc.) that exist beyond the (very long) main campaign. Once you get into the groove there's potentially dozens if not hundreds of hours of fun to squeeze from this.\n\nThis is a game that just has to be played to truly appreciate it as the feel of your interaction along with the music is what really defines the experience. Simply watching it or looking at the screenshots doesn't do it justice.\n\nThere are a couple of (minor) controversial changes that may not appeal to some fans:\n1. The music in 2 includes a more modernized remix compared to the more traditional music from 1. Personally I love the soundtracks from both, but there are people who have a preference.\n2. The upgrades to special attacks in 2 can be a bit of visual clutter at times. I like both styles, but there are people who prefer 1 over 2.\n3. There are some sequences (like the lightsword rounds) which did not return in 2, replaced instead by other weapons. While I think it would have been cute to include all of that along with the new stuff, it's not a deal breaker. It does however mean that both games retain a bit of unique flair and a reason for you to play and experience them both. 2 is overall an upgrade, but it's also not a 100% replacement.\n\nI would strongly suggest that if you've never played either game, you should begin with the first one. I think it's a better entry point to the series and might have a slightly broader appeal. (it's also slightly cheaper).\n\nThen if you find yourself enjoying it, come back and pick up 2 and you'll find yourself with some remixed music, fancy new special attack animations and a whole new adventure to work through.\n\nJust to be very clear: Both of these games are fantastic and deserve more praise than I can properly express and I'll very likely be putting 100's of hours into this just like I did the first one.\n---\n\nBottom line: Simple to learn, hard to master, and super satisfying fighting along with a great soundtrack.\n---\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38232109/]While you are here, would you consider following my curator page?[/url]\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/kunovega/recommended/]Want to read all of my reviews and not just the curated ones?[/url]\n- Amazing game that I love to play, but the boyfriend that I was playing it with broke up with me a few days after playing this game. A game that's about fixing your relationship.\n10/10 game.\n0/10 in my heart.\n\nedit: why do people find this funny i wasn't kidding\n\nEdit # 2: It has been 7 months since I had originally played this game. What was originally a game of heartbreak and painful memories, I had managed to find it someone new to play with. While this game had terrible memories, I had decided that a game such as this was undeserving of them, and thus created new memories with another special person in my life.\n\nThe game is remarkable, with good writing, and amazing gameplay, and it is deserving of the buy. Each level is crafted with amazing detail, and all of the mini-games are just as fun as the main game itself. Don't let bad memories keep you down, and instead create happier ones. Live your life, ya'll.\n- Started strong, ended annoyingly.\n\nMoral of the story? People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.\n\nIt paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that \"routine\" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.\n\nI liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters. But it all fell apart and tries to teach a very vapid moral that someone in their early 20's who has never had a meaningful relationship would idealize.\n\nAt least it was short.\n\n- This was a impulse buy for me just have seeing the new \"Fury Road\", but its a great game so far was kinda shocked it ran smooth right out the gate seems like today you gotta wait a week or month before a game can run proper though. Anyways beatufiful lighting, models / textures look good, vehicle combat / driving is fun, and vehicle customization is cool too. The on foot combat feels a little too straight foward though, the gore animations are kinda boring though, like feels like its a Xbox/360 game in that way, and collecting scrap can get a little repetitive. My final thought yea this game is worth getting but if you haven't played id's \"RAGE\", I'd reccomend getting that first, it's a extremely simmilar although kinda diffrent scenario game that will quench your Mad Max thirst.\n- 100%'ed the LUCT version of the game and I'm slowly working my way through this version now.\n\nOver all the game itself is solid. If you're reading this, its a brilliant tactics game that helped define the genre. However most of the changes they made in reborn, while innovative, ultimately feel constraining. \n\nFor example, they've limited spell slots to 4, so you can only ever take 4 different spells. One or two of which (missile + indirect) are taken by a damage spell of your choice, leaving you with even less spell customization than you'd think. And its unfortunately the same situation with skills, as one will always be taken up by your weapon skill. \n\nThe cards that drop in battle, while an interesting system on paper, just end up cluttering the field most of the time, often with auto-skill activation up, which most of your units won't even really want compared to the other options. \n\nRandom battles were also removed, limiting chances to recruit to a few key dungeons as well as removing some of the more amusing battle locations from the game. \n\nI've also seen some people complain about the level cap, but in my current play-though of the game, it isn't too much of a concern for me, but it may be for others. \n\nOver all, it just feels like they've taken a step back from what Tactics ogre: Let us cling together, gave us. Yes there's bloat in that version, but it also gave us a feeling of freedom when we were putting our teams together that this version lacks. I am grateful that we saw a remake of this game within my lifetime, but I wish they had improved on Luct, rather than take steps back from it. \n\nIf they ever increase the amount of spells and/or skills you can take, to like 6-8, then I'd probably switch my review to a yes. But until then, with a heavy heart I have to say that this version just isn't as good as Luct so far.\n- I got this game for $12 off humble bundle. Me and my friends play it for hours on end. This game honestly feels like the perfect fighting game for me because there is no set style. I don't have to remember specific combos or any crazy inputs. It's just simplicity. Unless you want to do that in which you can. But it's fun for anyone. If I were you I would get it off of humble bundle for $12.\n- I love this game. In fact, I've loved it since I was in highschool about 8 years ago. My friend and I used to play this game together all the time on my flashdrive. We were always discussing & trying to understand the ins-&-outs of the game and how to get a specific ending depending on what you did. Playing this brought me back to those good times in that library.\n\nThe OSTs are nostalgic, the gameplay is about the same and the artwork is amazing as ever(actually the graphics are much better with this remake).\nThe only complaint I have is that it lags at random times(though usually in the menu). The original IB on RPGMaker never did that.\nOverall I'm glad I bought this so I could support the Dev and thank them for all those years of entertainment-\nI just wish there wasn't so much lag over an RPGMaker game.\n- TLDR: Right now, since there are no \"NEUTRAL\" reviews on Steam, IN IT'S CURRENT STATE, its a no from me. If the bugs get ironed out, its a pretty good game. If it gets fixed, I'll likely change to a recommend.\n\nGot 2 copies as a Fig Backer to play with my brother. My single player experience (POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILERS):\n\nGOOD:\n--Love that the choices REALLY matter and there are a LOT of them in this game.\n--Many different ways to approach a situation and your reputation affects interactions. Your reputation MAY be good enough to talk yourself out of fights! Many opportunities for KISS ASS and HARD ASS and other Squad builds (Nerd stuff, Mechanics, etc.) to be useful throughout the game.\n--The fire modes have grown on me. Some weapons have their own perks which add a fire mode. Other fire modes are available via perks you can obtain in the perk tree. The Precision Strike you get once your strike meter is full is very powerful and can change a fight (can malfunction a robot with aimed shot or fire a huge burst to take out multiple hostiles).\n--You can build a new squad member at any time that will start at your current level. Messed up a squad member build? That's okay, just create a new one.\n--I like the PREPARE and AMBUSH abilities. PREPARE lets you save up to 2 AP for next turn. The AMBUSH ability allows your squad members to trade in some AP to fire on an enemy that enters their range during hostile turns.\n--I love the Animal Whisperer skill and animal companions. I like the variety of animals you can bring along with your squad.\n--Shift key to highlight stuff you can interact with. This takes away having to pixel hunt for obscured boxes and containers. When you get old and can't see as well you appreciate stuff like this.\n--I like that I only have to loot one body at the end of combat and I can easily cycle through and grab the loot from all the other lootable bodies in the area.\n--A high Luck attribute will occasionally result in more loot, and even free actions. Sometimes you'll get a free attack or a free movement from a lucky action.\n--I like the variety and usefulness of Utilities (+5% XP, +2 PER, +1 Weapon/Armor modding, etc.)\n--A lot of stuff that can be used for cover can also be shot and destroyed.\n--Humor can be a bit over-the-top, but I've chortled quite a few times.\n\nNOT SURE:\n--Can only charm a single animal per squad member with Animal Whisperer. You CAN get other special animal followers that don't count as the single. While disappointed, I can see why they limited it (more would be OP and they can start to get in the way during combat).\n--Enemies have a circular view area, which means even if you're trying to sneak past behind them, you can still be \"seen\" after a brief time.\n\nBAD/BUGS:\n--Cant team crouch. You have to manually go through all of your squad and crouch them 1 by 1, and it costs 2 AP to crouch in combat. You also cant move crouched as far as I know. You can't \"change stances\" (AKA crouch or stand up) while in cover, either. Save a game right before a fight with all your squad members crouched and ready to go? When combat locks up and you have to load the save, you have to re-crouch everybody.\n--Combat can lock up, causing you to have to reload a previous save (for me, twice per play session usually but sometimes twice for the same fight).\n--Attributes, Skills, Combat Buffs/Debuffs (and probably other stuff) need more tool tips.\n--Lost character progression.\n--Very laggy Dialogue Tree and later in the game the inventory gets laggy too.\n--Creating a Bookworm Squad Member with 1 STR creates a situation where your Squad Member is losing 3 CON (total hit points) every level up and will be erased like Marty McFly in B2TF.\n--Load screens are too long. 30+ seconds to load into different zones, over 1.5 minutes to load a game on SSD. From another review: \"while we wait, let us read the lore books we've collected.\"\n--Squad portraits don't stay in order.\n--When you have more than 6 Ranger recruits in the select character screen, the \"Companions\" section gets pushed off-screen, hiding their portraits, and making it very unintuitive to add them back into your squad (you have to use the keyboard). Need a scroll bar here.\n--Saves don't have specific names so can be easily overwritten. There is only 1 autosave by default, and later on the game autosaves right after a game changing decision, making you have to revert to a manual save (2 hours earlier for me) if you wanted to try different options. I recommend turning on timed saves as well as taking advantage of quicksaves (and of course saving often!)\n--FPS drops, sometimes so bad you have to reload.\n--Squad Members shooting through walls/floors/ceilings.\n--Radiation difficult to detect in some areas and no warning (other than your squad health draining) going from radiation level 2 to 3 for instance.\n--Combat messages briefly appear above your acting Squad Member's head and are easy to miss (like \"Out of Range\")\n--When getting shot at, the camera doesn't always auto focus on who is shooting you.\n--At least three bugged missions I can think of (but hey, one is an unlimited money glitch so more of a feature).\n--Character models and other things (switches) not loading properly leading to invisible characters you can interact with (or fight with, as it happens in combat sometimes too).\n--The game can become unresponsive when trying to move 2 Squad Members separately and interact with someone.\n--Explosive Barrels not actually exploding when shot (this seems to be related to being too far away from the barrel when sniping it, as if you get closer, they'll actually explode).\n--Cybernetic Implants are a good idea, but they take up your Utility Slot instead of giving you another slot dedicated to them so when you have the ability to finally use them, it feels more like a trade-off rather than an augmentation.\n--No Inventory filter for Utilities. Gotta scroll through your hundreds of items and the Utilities aren't even grouped together entirely in the inventory, they are scattered throughout.\n--When you open a door to a closed room, fog of war usually obscures what is in the room until you physically walk a squad member into the room.\n--Cannot have multiple types of the same animal in a Squad with multiple Animal Whisperers.\n--Don't try to loot two containers at once.\n--Some traps can't be disarmed.\n--Various graphic glitches like missing texture or dialogue bubbles that are blank or don't disappear.\n--Can't remove and reuse weapon mods.\n--Some equipped weapons will display inflated damage numbers (by 300% in some cases) until re-equipped. Not even sure how long it has been that way or if it was affecting my game.\n--If you misclick the filter categories in a vendor encounter on the World Map, it'll kick you out of the encounter to the radio and you can't get back to the random encounter at that time. I only mention this since I've done it so many times.\n--You can't pause the game which may or may not affect time sensitive quests. You can be detected and attacked in the menu (escape key) or in your inventory.\n--There is no way to have Special companions/followers that you get from Missions follow a different squad member. If you dump that Squad Member later, you lose the follower too (as far as I know).\n--Get radio signals with \"coordinates to follow\" yet I have no clue who from or what it opened up on the map (if anything).\n--Gaining access to certain parts of the Rangers HQ requires you to do something pretty awful.\n--I'm out of room....\n\nIt feels like I'm fighting against the game more than the Wasteland sometimes. I don't even want to try multiplayer until it gets fixed (and my brother doesn't either).\n\nIf you're a developer of this game, thank you for your time and effort! Polish it up and I'll be happy to change this to a recommend! Edited for clarity/additions and I cut a lot. Thank you for reading and thank you for the comments and awards! Have a great day and be kind to others.\n- [i]Don’t be fooled.[/i]\nPlague Inc may look like a great in-depth RTS with which to live out the real-world angst of our modern day viral outbreak, but instead it feels and plays very much like a shallow, casual, arcade, mobile version of that; a great little time waster, but lacks any real depth, intellectual engagement or long-term replay value.\n\nThis may be ok if you’re just wanting to watch the world burn in 10 minutes or less, but if you’re expecting hours of intense gameplay in a hyper-realistic, strategy-based simulation of a global pandemic—with social, economic and geo-political elements to keep you on your toes—then you’ll be sorely disappointed.\n\nHere’s the game in a nutshell.\nYou have one objective: [i]Kill all humans on planet Earth.[/i] Anything short of that and you lose.\n\nHere's the gameplay:\n[b]Step 1.[/b] Choose which country to infect. \n[b]Step 2.[/b] Pop the red and orange bubbles to gain points. Points unlock ‘upgrades’ for your plague. The more upgrades you unlock, the better your chances of winning the game. \n[b]Step 3.[/b] Pop the blue bubbles to slow the progress of the world’s efforts in finding a cure or it’s game over.\n\n[i]That’s it.[/i]\n\nEach plague type, (virus, bacteria, parasite etc.) takes you on the same linear path.\nInfect. Upgrade. Don’t lose.\n\nUgh!!\n\nHere in 2020 with the world ACTUALLY living through a viral pandemic, we’ve all witnessed first-hand the various stages of infections, quarantines and lock-downs.\nThe reactions of global governments.\nThe political turmoil.\nThe economic and industrial fallout.\nThe global panic that ensues amongst the general population.\nThe manipulation of the media in controlling the narrative.\n\nNone of that exists here.\n\nGranted, this game was released 4 years [i]before[/i] the 2020 Crisis, but it just feels like a missed opportunity in my opinion.\n- If you are looking for a game that you can never master, here is the game for you.\n- I'm going to write an honest review for this game since A LOT of people seem to be very biased.\n\nThis is not a perfect game. No 2K basketball game will ever be a perfect game. Does that mean this game is bad? No. Should you hold off on the game for now? Probably.\n\nLet's start with the positives:\n\n- A lot of people seem to gloss over the fact that 2K rehauled a lot of mechanics for this game. Shot meters feel more legitimate, this game is MUCH much more realistic (fouls, shot tendencies, etc...) This game is better and more fluid to control, and the gameplay reflects each players' ratings (defense, shots, etc...) much more accurately.\n\n- Online play seems to be better and more fluid. I've yet to encounter any latency issues online with quick play and the such.\n\n- MyCareer is MUCH better than last years. There is no cheesy story and the cutscenes feel much more integrated into the game. Orange Juice and dynamic duos are a great idea in general. The UI for MyCareer (and the game in general) is so much cleaner and more functional.\n\n- The game is visually beautiful, not much else to say on the matter.\n\nNow, the cons:\n\n- Help defense is broken. It's quite ridiculous that 2K hasn't fixes this lingering issue in such a long time but it's still there. This is a BIG issue in MyCareer and not quite as bad in other modes since you can manually control players.\n\n- Stat allocation is broken. This is a huge issue in MyCareer and has deterred me from playing the mode any more until 2K fixes this issue. Introducing the idea of stats that can only be raised in practice is actually quite a neat idea. However, these boosts are not permanent, even though 2K has stated they are. This is detrimental and demoralizing and discourages players from playing the game more. Limit caps are ridiculously strict as well. 2K NEEDS to fix these issues ASAP.\n\n- Numerous glitches.\n\n- 2K introduced broken mechanics along with the good mechanics. Ankle breakers are now pathetically easy to pull off (using Stephen Curry behind the back moves is a surefire way to have your defender fall). Moving screens are now a thing. \n\nI would hold off on buying this game until 2K patches it. There are just too many issues with the game that prevent it from being a playable game. I like this game. I really do. That's why I'm hoping 2K listens to the community and starts working on the issues at hand immediately.\n- In a world where \"enhanced edition\" has started to be synonymous with \"will run on modern hardware if you shell out $20\" it's absolutely refreshing to see Larian deliver this masterpiece free of charge to owners of the original. You start out with an already fantastic game that's received numerous game of the year and editor's choice awards. Then you spend a year polishing that game, and adding new features. The result is brilliant Enhanced Edtion of an already fantastic game.\n\nNew features for EE:\n[list]\n[*] Fully voice acted - Every line of dialog now has voice acting. The voice acting is really good too\n[*] Dual wield - Rogues now look more iconic with the ability to dual wield\n[*] Grenades - You can craft and throw various sorts of grenades. \n[*] Tactician Mode - A new  challenging mode where encounters are redesigned to be harder by adding new spells and enemies into the mix. Classic mode still available obviously.\n[*] Split screen co-op \n[*] Controller support\n[*] Updated graphics - The UI is totally reworked, the graphics are updated, and spells have new effects\n[*] Updates to the story  - The story, esepcially the ending, was rewritten a bit to clear up some confusing aspects\n[/list]\n\nI'm sure there's more, but really these ought to be reason enough to play this game.\n- A new game from Zeboyd, you know I'm there! And this was such a fun game\n\nThis game is about as long as Cthulhu Saves Christmas and it's just as Linear. However given their statement on this video, that's meant to be the point these days.\n\nThe Graphics for the main game are basic but it's fitting for the Genre. Also they have dropped the random battles with on screen monsters to avoid if you want to not fight (And you still have the option to start a battle through the main menu). The fighting system is identical to CSC too which I've enjoyed but I can understand those who may not like it. The Animation for the transformations are incredible...except I'm always stuck watching them every single time which can get very tedious.\n\nThe story is clever, and they provide \"Translations\" for the Ole English of Shakespeare...but a lot of the translations are jokes and very silly ones at that.\n\nThere isn't a LOT of replay value but you will enjoy the story enough you'll want to play it again eventually.\n\nThere is no New Game Plus mode...yet but given how they patched it into CSC later on I'm certain they're do that here eventually.\n\nI say the game is incredible for the price range and is entertaining for all ages.\n\n\nVIDEO REVIEW: https://youtu.be/wuw9pJPowqM\n- [i]\"The Display says 'Nothing'\"[/i]\n\"Nothing or 'Nothing'\"?\n[i]\"It's BLANK!\"[/i]\n\"'Blank' OK Great. What is on the Middle Right button?\"\n[i]\"NO!\"[/i]\n\"Middle Right!\"\n[i]\"NO!\"[/i]\n\"What you you mean No!? I HAVE THE MANUAL!\"\n\n[h1]**BOOOOOOOOM**[/h1]\n\n10/10\n- I have always wanted to play Resdient Evil 4, and I wanted to play this game so badly.  I am giving a negative review simply because the games FPS on the PC are bad, that could be because of Windows 10 because I heared rumors that the game does not run well on it and such, so that could be the problem.   Another problem I faced is the lip sync is dealyed when it's on the cutscenes so that makes everything slow and such.  The gameplay from what I seen however is pretty great and I think Resdient Evil 4 is a great game, but this port is not, get it for the GC, Will, PS2, or any of the consloes that has this game.\n- As i previously stated, i was going to play through metro fully and i have done so, so here is my update to this review. \nThis game is not the best selling triple A game in the world and it may have some bugs (like a table that wasnt solid or the objects in that room lol) however it is a decent game. the story is decent and the characters voices are way off but they sorta make up for it with their personalities. \n\nExploration in this game is by far one of the most interesting in my opinion and the way your character acts in the enviroment makes it more interesting aswell, for example wiping your visor when it gets dirty (wasnt that helpful for me in my play through but it was a nice touch) and your visor taking damage in combat adds to the immersive feel of this wasteland/paradise almost. Scavenging weapons and parts and combining them to make better equipment is quite intriguing and quick to do if you can find the parts. \n\nat the end of the day my final review of this is its a good game i would play it again even if it is a bit clunky sometimes (atleast it was for me lmao)\n\n\n\n\n\nOh and hopefully my punctuation is good enough so no one passes out this time lmao\n- holy fucking shit everything about this fucking mongoloid game is so fucking bad i can't even begin to understand. this was supposed to be better than the first piece of shit, but i dunno, maybe a tiny bit.\n\ndon't be like me and get baited into wasting your hard earned money for this fucking shit even if it's on like -90% sale.\n\nspecial mention to worst fucking controls in the history of fucking gaming. fuck these fucking mongoloid fucking retard faggots for making a game this fucking bad. uninstalled.\n- If I could get my money back, I would. AI as usual is hot garbage, cant even take turns without getting LITERALLY BODIED by the AI drivers. The new progression system really sucks. Cool that they wanted to try something different, but I really dont feel like leveling every god damn car in the game just to modify it. If you wanted multiple of same car you would have to level those duplicate cars you purchase. My experience with the physics is just... eh. I mean I sure do love loosing grip just from barely tapping the gas. Constantly fighting my wheel just to stay stable. Driving its probably fine for controller players, I wouldnt on wheel. Credits are only used to buy cars now. Also kinda runs like crap. All i wanted was a Gran Turismo on PC and this... this is not it. Game is mid, move on me thinks.\n\nEdit: I put in a request for a refund and Valve did indeed approve it. I thought I was over the time limit for sure. Don't be me and spend 100 USD for early access. Thanks Valve, you're the best!\n- What can I say that hasn't been said and that you don't know.\nThis game is IN-SANE.\nThe attention to detail is mind-boggling, the missions, from the smallest to all the main missions are worthy of oscars.\nThe single player campaign is one of the best adventures I ever went on in my life. This is why I love games.\nThe beauty of this game in indescribable. It's one of most realistic living worlds I've ever been in.\nIn fact, it felt so real to me, that I would spend hours living and breathing the game, I felt I was there, at that time.\nTaking care of my horse, spending time fishing and hunting, sometimes for hours.\nRiding my horse in strong winds, and heavy rain, collecting every piece of clothing and trying to look dashing at all times.\nI got attached to people, took care of them, or dragged them behind my horse when I wasn't in the mood for their BS.\nI've been there. I lived there. That was me, I was a cowboy. Nobody will convince me otherwise.\n- cool game but the font is almost unreadable at times\n- I don't usually give negative reviews on games, but holy shit. The map is not even done and you can go outside the \"map\" so damn easy. You randomly go back to the main menu without any reason.\n- [h1]Game Pros[/h1]\n\n• Open world\n• Not a GPU/CPU intensive game. Easily runnable and runs quite smooth.\n• Beautiful cut scenes/visuals, gorgeous!\n• Clean menu.\n• Night/Day Cycle.\n• Weather does effect how you take on a mission.\n• You can easily get immersed in the game and play it for hours without even knowing it.\n• Tons of missions and side objectives. Tnere will be plenty to do.\n• Everything you do in-game affects the current and future missions.\n• Those who can stragically plan better will have an easier time progressing through missions with a higher score.\n• Various weapons/tools/items/gear to research. Lots of customization.\n• Custmomizable \"Mother Base\" with soldiers and objects/items from the open world.\n• You can infiltrate other players bases and steal soldiers/resources (FoB's/Events alike).\n• Multiple companion's that you can bond with throughout missions. (You are not alone!)\n• Intelligent and adapatable AI. They will deal with people using repetitive infiltration methods and the like.\n• If you punch one of your soldiers in the face, you will recieve words of praise.\n• Not a game you can just breeze through in just 10-20 hours.\n\n[h1]Controversial Features[/h1]\n\n• Mission checkpoints can have a large gap, punishing your stupidity and impatience.\n• Not necessarily a \"Pay to Win\" option, but there are microtransactions in this game that 'enhance' your online experience. (MB Coins)\n\n[h1]Game Cons[/h1]\n\n• Storyline seemed to be lacking/repetitive.\n• AI and player pathing have a few bugs when encountering ladders or something of the sort in small places (Seldom occurs, but worthwhile to mention).\n• Can feel repetitve at times during missions due to similar objectives (Go here and kill/rescure this person, etc).\n• Hackers have been spotted while online. (FoB Attacks)\n• You CAN NOT bind anything to a numpad key. Which blows for left handed PC gamers.\n\n[h1]Relatable Games[/h1]\n\n• Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes\n• Metal Gear (General Franchise)\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nWith the ingenuity of Kojima and Co. combined with the power of the Fox engine here is another gem to marvel upon- Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. The game/franchise as a whole continues to be a lovely experience with a multitude of things to do online post-story. Seriously, you will always have something to do. The story is mesmerizing, leaving you with a feeling of wanting more. For the hardcore Metal Gear fans out there, many of your questions regarding to 'plot holes' will definately get (at least some) answers this time around!\n\n[b]Overall Score: 90/100[/b]\n\nThank you for reading! Please leave a comment if you feel I have left anything of importance out or if you just want to share your thoughts. Cheers!\n- They need to add more weapons like a galil or m249 or something and maybe more vehicles and playmodes.But overall so many possibilities\n- Overall better cast than the first game. But it has a few problems that DR1 didn't have, which to me was what made the game fun in the first place.\n\nDR1 spoilers: [spoiler] All of them seem capable of killing which I couldn't say about the first game where it was obvious that weedman, the giant and donut girl wasn't a threat to you. [/spoiler]\n\nDR2 spoilers:  [spoiler] However unlike the first game where Kirigiri, Byakuya and other characters were arguing during the trial and bringing up interesting points. DR2 has a lack of persuasive characters. There's effectively just Nagito (who argues in your favor half the time anyway) and Chiaki. The other characters never challenges you in a convincing way.[/spoiler]\n- Firstly, neutral reviews should be a thing. Because although the game's story is pretty solid (and some elements of it still very relavant even today), the game suffers from a multitude of issues, so no, I don't truly recommend this game because of those factors. Rockstar themselves should be fixing the broken state of the game, instead of leaving it to people to fix it.\n\nThe problem with this game is that you need to be online to be even able to play it. You NEED to be online to PLAY a SINGLEPLAYER game FROM 2009. I don't know what Rockstar was thinking when they force you to play online, but this is just not okay. There is no online functionality for the game besides maybe cloud saves - something steam cloud could've done just as fine instead of leaving it to their own messy launcher.\n\nBut that's not the only problem with this game. Being that it's an old game, it does not run well on modern systems, not anymore. It suffers from various performance issues. Thankfully, you can use DXVK to get around this problem - but as i said earlier, you shouldnt HAVE TO do this. Rockstar could have easily patched the game to fix the performance issues (that still happen with DXVK mind you - but compared to without DXVK it is MUCH better), instead they focused on patching who knows what.\n\nExcept after you use DXVK, you HAVE to edit a game file to let the game use more than 2 gb of ram. Again, SOMETHING Rockstar could've easily done by updating the game's code to meet the modern standards. Nobody has specs like the one in the minimum recommend anymore. After you do that, you HAVE to edit the amount of vram the game detects by using a command line to fix it. That's already 3 things you have to deal with JUST to be even able to play the game normally.\n\nSome people may see this as a small botherance - some people may see it as a huge inconvenience, but the apparent problem with this is that, once again, you SHOULDNT HAVE TO do all of this. Going past those issues and playing the game, you also have to ensure you limit the fps to 60, either using DXVK or the in game vsync (former being more recommendable as it doesn't hog as much as cpu power). If you decided to bother with all of those steps to make the game playable, congratulations. Now be severely annoyed like I did  because Rockstar has not, for all this time, patched the final mission with the helicopter QTE. One suggested fix for it was to limit the FPS to 60 - which did NOT help me. Other was to install a script file to fix it, which ALSO failed at first, till I tried again like 5-6 times. You as a player should not have to install this stuff and edit games just to fix the game, when the publisher themselves should be doing it. I expect a game to be supported if it's still being sold on Steam. And don't think they don't care about the games being on Steam - they clearly cared when they removed the classic gta trilogy from Steam (which were also left in even more of a broken state compared to how they first came out - but that is an entirely different point).\n\nPutting all of those factors aside, the game itself is very solid, story wise. I really loved all of the symbolism that was apparent throught the game, and concepts such as \"American Dream\" or \"Land of Oppurtunity\" being presented as something that was clearly flawed - which is precisely why people like Nico go down the path of killing people or doing drugs just to survive. You can't go from rags to riches in a \"strong eat the weak\" country - you either do whatever it is you have to do - like Nico - to survive, or you let yourself and your close ones get killed. There are other things the game criticizes as well, like that one conversation where Nico criticizes the food in the city for using \"chemicals that your body spends time getting it off your system\", or something along those lines. I don't think I need to mention that this isn't something they added as a joke, because it is very much there. The game's serious and dark tone might be considered bad by people, but it is because of this dark tone and seriousness that we can actually learn some lessons from it and open our eyes to some truths in our lives.\n\nThe gameplay itself isn't really that complicated, except when it comes to driving the vehicles in the game. They are based on a realistic driving system and although it is debatable how much of a good gaming experience it really is when they made it so realistic, since it introduces a huge learning curve and can end up frustrating the player, I actually ended up loving it for what it is, except when it came to driving motorcycles of any form. The game's simplicity in other regards is what makes it pretty good, in my eyes. Though it sometimes doesn't work the way you think it would (like when you are playing with a controller and have to use auto aim), it is nevertheless solid enough that those are only minor inconveniences and not the kind of problem where you'd want to stop playing the game.\n\nThis game definitely deserves more attention and love - but Rockstar really needs to fix this game themselves if they are still keeping it on Steam's store, because the current situation of the game is not acceptable.\n\n\n- [h1] 9/10 [/h1]\n[h1] As a sequel to Steins;Gate, you won't be able to understand the content of the game without playing the previous game. [/h1]\n\nThe sequel to the famous visual novel game Steins;Gate. Although some people think that Steins;Gate 0 is not as good as its predecessor, I think this game is a well-deserved excellent sequel.\n\nA change from the witty and relaxed game style of the previous game, the overall atmosphere of this game is heavy, and personally I prefer this kind of visual novel work. The plot of the game is naturally wonderful, so I won’t comment here to avoid spoilers. If you are deeply attracted by the game’s background settings and characters before playing Steins;Gate, then this work must be worthwhile. The music of this game is also very beautiful, and it will never disappoint the players. The only shortcoming of it is that the description of some characters is too sloppy and the characterization is insufficient, such as Kagari.\n\nIn any case, this one is definitely a must-try work for players who love Steins;Gate, and it is an important addition to the series of plots. As a related supplementary sequel, its nature is also destined that players must play the previous game in order to understand the content of this one.\n- Falcom's Action RPG Masterpiece.\n\nbest story in the series. it follows the latest adventure of Adol and his companions, stranded in an island and slowly uncovering their secrets. the tight, but well developed cast are absolutely the best written characters in the series. from party member to your fellow castaways all have developed motivation, personality and charm. \n\nalot of the horribad translation and voice acting have been fixed, and it finally got the treatment it deserve as a masterpiece. \n\nthe gameplay is an evolution of the modern Ys game. at its core, ys 8 is an action RPG where you control adol and several other party members with unique set of skills, moveset, weapons and super attack. each character represent an attack type (slash, pierce, smash) that are pitted against various enemies with certain weaknesses. great variety of enemies, amazing boss battles, music and story. \n\non release, there seems to be a big problem for the port, but as far as i know, everything has been patched to very good level of stability. over 70 hours, the game crashed twice (and saved by the intuitive autosave system), run flawlessly 60 FPS and 1440p without a single slowdown. \n\n10/10 game go buy so we get monstrum nox on PC.\n- Minutes ago, this reviewer completed the game Gorogoa. And now, an attempt will be made to describe the experience. It won’t be easy…….\n\nIn 1968 this player went to the theatre to see a brand-new movie: 2001: A Space Odyssey. What crossed the screen wasn’t so much a story in the filmmaking sense., but rather an experience. Views of Earth from space (before such images existed IRL), and a final scene that perhaps no one understood, but clearly was meaningful beyond simply the ability, or need, for words to express. Gorogoa left this player with a very similar feeling of inexplicable fulfillment.\n\nGorogoa might be described as a puzzle game, but certainly not in any typical sense. More accurately, Gorogoa is a game about travel, but traversing distance in more ways than just spatially. It’s about travel within, and travel to places unknown (perhaps outside of dreams.) It’s about traveling through space, time, life (and lives), and travel through the experience that is mankind. And perhaps more, it’s about the journey necessary for each player to experience in order to be able to complete the experience that is Gorogoa.\n\nGorogoa provides very little information or assistance, beyond the option for hints about the areas of each image that need be considered for game progress. (It’s difficult to imagine a first-time player succeeding without such hints, so no stigma should be associated with them, especially if they prevent the need for outside resources as may well be the case.) Almost nothing more can be said without compromising some aspect of this game, so this review will be brief, and likely almost as mysterious as the game itself. Learning the goal is as much a puzzle as is the process of reaching that goal. Images are moved, shrunk, expanded, combined, variously manipulated…….ENOUGH! \n\nPlay, and learn about possibilities unimagined until now. In a single word…genius.\n\nThank you.\n\n(As with most Steam games, offline game time is not tracked.)\n- The EOS stands for End of Service. I am sure someone has fun with this or there wouldn't be a reason to keep bringing it back. Right? The usual Tab Target MMO. I do like that you can teleport to quest givers and mobs instead of the usual auto or manual run. Aside from that there isn't anything modern here.\n- [h1] The First \"Fun\" game, after a long time\t[/h1]\n\nHours upon hours have I tirelessly spent on games I didn't thoroughly enjoy. Needlessly competitive games like MOBAS and PvP games leaves an emotional toll of helpless frustration and unfullfillment that makes it feel mentally unhealthy to be a part of.\n\nOnly after playing The Messenger did I realise how long It's been since I played a game for the genuinely fun and exciting experience it was meant to be.\n\nAnd how much I've missed it.\n\nThe Messenger offers an adventure with controls running as tight and comfortable as the spandex pants worn by Ryu Hayabusa. Accompanied by \"unexpectantly likable\" characters, the shopkeeper in particular. With his selfdepricating/ 4:th wall breaking/ life advising humour about us being the main character and should probably be out saving the world instead of spamming his \"chat\" 30 times just to see if the dialogue changes. Only to punish us with a long, \"boring\" and unskippable dialogue.\n\nI didn't regret a single second I spent bothering him and it still amazes me how self-aware the game is and how It uses the knowledge in a way that makes the game all the more fun to play. Like putting less emphasis on the story and more on entertaining dialogues and scenarios.\n\nThe levels are varied with enemies being used as both obstacles and tools to help manuvering through levels that gradually gets more difficult, as they're pushing the boundaries on how the game can be interacted with.\n\nVisually and auditory, The Messenger presents itself in a pixelated format, all 16-bits included, but It doesn't stop there. The game takes place in two seperate timelines that you'll easily travel to through portals scattered about. Moving though one timeline could present a path unavailable in the other. This mechanic is sometimes included to get through certain areas. But my point is, not only does the game look and sound great. The different timelines are also created with a seperate artstyle. Yes, both the looks and sound instantly switch when going through a timeportal. Creating cool moments were you'll have to go though the flow of the levels, even through time.\n\nSo the game turned out to be about a time traveling Ninja who needs to deliver a message in order to save the world.\n\nI had a great time playing this and there's no doubt you'll feel the same. It's just a shame how easily it is to overlook it as something less than what it truly is, how it can easily go unnoticed among the thousands of titles here on steam.\n\nOne last thing.\nI'd like to thank the passionate people who crafted this game and I appreciate the publisher for signing it which helped them get noticed. You people have made something truly awesome and I'm looking forward to anything you'll do next.\n- Before I continue writing my review on this game, I got to say that the PC port of Valkyria Chronicles is one of the best, if not, [u]the[/u] best port. The game was originally exclusive for the PlayStation 3 back in 2008. The game was well received, but garnered low sales that would put the sequels Valkyria Chronicles 2 and 3 on the PSP. I actually never heard of this game before until a few week prior to the PC release on November 2014. That said, I will have to give a standing ovation to Sega for putting an effort to make the PC port well optimized in 1080p (or more) at 60 FPS (or more). Sega has my attention and I will present this review.\n \nValkyria Chronicles focuses on Welkin Gunther, a son of a legendary general who fought in the First Europan War, leads a platoon of some adults and teenage volunteers to defend their country against the invading forces of the Imperial Alliance. The game presents a mix of tactical strategy and third-person action that is very unique in the strategy game genre. Does this game deserve your attention? \n\nThe story takes place in a “fictional” European continent where the Second Europan War was fought primarily between the Atlantic Federation (think of all of the European countries, in a geographical sense) versus the Imperial Alliance (Russia, in a geographic sense). Gallia is a “neutral” country where it contains a unique resource known as Ragnite. Thus, the Imperial Alliance invade Gallia to get Ragnite to fuel up their war resources. One of the greatest parts about the game is how well the developers use analogies from World War II into the game and its execution is well-received. The analogies ranged from weapon designs (like the Gallian Scout weapons that look like the Soviet SVT-40 to the Imperial weaponry comparison to the real-life MP40 and STG44, and plenty others). The analogy extends to vehicles and geopolitical conflicts. \n\nThe character developments in the game are highly impressive, particularly with the relationship between Welkin (protagonist) and Alicia Melchiott (deuteragonist). The themes in Valkyria Chronicles consist a good mix of “light” moments (like hope as an example) and “semi-grotesque” themes of war (such as discrimination/racism, personal ambition over soldiers’ lives, and others themes that will unravel later on). Some reviewers criticized the game as being not serious on the themes about war. Honestly, I don’t think that the game is supposed to be depressing and a good mix between “light” and “dark” is best suited for the game. The story starts really slow in the beginning and actually begin to progress as you reach a certain point in the story. The plot is pretty good in most area while few scenes are a bit “awkward” in terms of sudden shifts between a sad event to a “positive motivation”. \n\nThe gameplay in Valkyria Chronicles is turn-based, but it is very unique because once you click on a character to choose, you can actually control the character to move to any location in third-person you like as long you have enough Action Points (basically, the movement bar). Experience points and money are earned by Ranks (like A, B, C, and D) by completing an objective within a certain number of turns (Example: Getting a ‘A’ rank within 3 turns or less to get the maximum amount of exp and money). However, it is possible that you can actually kill all of the enemies on the map, complete the objective, and still get an ‘A’ rank in the majority of missions (except for a few of them). \n\nWith the exp and money, you train your soldiers based on classes Scout, Shocktrooper, Lancer (Anti-Tank/Explosives), Engineers, and Sniper rather than individuals. The money are used up to upgrade weapons, buy tank parts, and purchasing “reports” from a reporter in certain chapters in the story. The game would last you a good 30-50 hours if you play the game in a smart, tactical manner or have an “OCD” on getting an “A” rank on every single mission in the story or a mix of both (like I did). \n\nThe game does have some faults, particularly when it comes to classes. Reviewers argued that Scouts are too overpowered, but in my view, it is best to say that scouts are too reliable since they have the most movement bar and top-tier weapons like the ZM Kar 8 (the game's version of Soviet PTRS-41 that can obliterate any enemy, even medium and heavy tanks if you shoot it in the back). Engineers are useless in the game since you won’t repair your tank very often (depending on your play style) and Scouts are the better alternative. There are some bugs in the game that is related to the monitor refresh rate (if you play it on a 144 Hz monitor like I did) in certain missions in the story. PC controls are a bit awkward when you control the tank. There are a few moments in the story that has some poor “transitions” (an example would be that an upsetting moment happened in the story and all of a sudden, some of the major characters wanted a medal for their part on a major battle in the next cutscene as if that upsetting moment never happen or affected them). \n\nThe game is often compared to XCOM when it comes to gameplay. This may be true, but Valkyria Chronicles is very unique since you can actually control the character in third person instead of the computer doing it for you when you command the character to move from Point A to B, in bird’s eye view. The game engine is very aesthetic and presents the story very well. I’m glad the Sega released Valkyria Chronicles to the PC and I am very pleased to hear that a (possible) new Valkyria Chronicles game is being trademarked (and hopefully in development) thanks to the PC sales. The default price of $20 is a good deal, -50% off is a great deal, -75% is a perfect steal. Valkyria Chronicles is one of my top games for 2014 due to its unique strategy gameplay and superb PC port optimization. I am looking forward for the new game that is being trademarked (or possible PC ports or revamp for VC2 and 3). This game has my highest recommendation for any strategy gamer who want to find something original, unique, and beautiful.\n- A very good recursive Sokoban.

(I think the developer couldn't create a better output than this simple one)\n\n\n20 minutes and that's enough for me for now, I'm not putting in any more effort for EA project\n- I love this franchise and NARUTO SHIPPUDEN: Ultimate Ninja STORM 4 really out did itself. I love the story line and everything eles they did with the game, BUT the MAIN problem i have with this is that even with my game pad I had to install another app so that I can use the dame pad. The game couldn't completly figure out my game pad buttons on it's own and I had to re-set every button and it's a pain in the a$$. There's a MAJOR learning curve if you think you can use the keyboard, plus I highly doubt you can hit every single button at the exact time you need to press it. If your getting this in a console then thats awesome. But I don't recommend getting this from steam and playing in your Pc. If only they had figure out the controls then I would have given 10/10. So sad.\n- This game looks incredible and I'm really enjoying the story so far. It does have some bugs still, but nothing I've come across has particularly bothered me, much less ruined the game. It's incredibly immersive and detailed, the voice acting is really good, and the gameplay is fun.\n- $15 during the autumn sale was a great price for a ton of fun and a game with some truly breathtaking visuals and effects, one of the best looking games I have ever seen. It is a worthy addition to the JC franchise. Combat is more of the same from JC2, there's tons of explosions, a big open world, great sound and music, and solid mission progression without having to grind which is becoming a thing of the past now with microtransactions in games. The game's biggest flaws are that dirt bike handling is the worst vehicle handling I have ever seen in any video game, some wingsuit missions are beyond frustrating, and it is Square so it of course isn't optimized very well unless you have a powerful setup. That and the ending is one big lazy cop out sucky easy boss fight.\n\nI was luckily able to bypass optimization issues with a powerful setup and minor tweaks. So don't risk it unless this is on sale, your pc is powerful, and also provided you don't mind a few crashes in a couple missions. Just remember that Square is #1 in continually barfing out horrible pc ports and they will never learn so even with a beast pc you are still taking a chance.\n\n7/10 because of a ton of glitches I didn't mention that would take way too long to write down, and because of Square continually sucking balls on making optimized pc games. In which they cannot do.\n- When I show new games to one of my friends she always asks if it is possible to pee in the game and sadly I usually must tell her that it isnt possible because there is so few games where this special detail is being paid attention to. But this here my dude! I tried to show her the game yesterday so I got her setup on the valve index and start the game all good, but we couldn’t move at all... We tried everything! We tried physically move in our vr room to see the boards that had text written on them because we spawned behind them which I found a little weird as well. On the board it said eat the hamburger to start the game or eat the poo to guit. I saw a box on the street and I remembered by seeing the trailer there was a box where inside there was a burger so immediately we worked hard to try and reach the burger so we could start the game. It was too far away for us to try and actually in real life walk to it so we had to just accept defeat. She didn’t get to see her first vr game where it would be possible to urinate. I saw a update post a few minutes ago where you were saying something about movemnet in the game that you have to grip and throw arms around or something? This I guess we didn’t try since usually moving is one of the triggers to teleport or just the stick like in any controller. Today we will try again and hopefully succeed in our task to urinate in a vr game! You could be making history today my friend. And for all the bad reviews for this game I want to just say a couple things: cmon dude. Its one guy whos making this game! It is cheap and early access... those already tell you a lot about the game and you should not expect a triple a title and the experience of the century. I went through a video game making school or whatever which took 3 years so it was not 2 weeks online course I just quit after the first week so I actually know a lot what it takes to make games and with this I can tell there has been some hours used to it, but again it’s only one dude. My game didn’t work either, but it might have been because we didn’t know how to play. I’m not complaining for 4 dollars, I’m not a hobo ;)\n\nEDIT: And there it is! A day after my review and a 170mb update with new features and a fix for not been able to play at all :) I wasn't able to walk earlier either, but I suppose yo may not be able to in the \"mainmenu\". Gotta go try the update once my friend visits again!\n- As someone who is as obsessed with Sentai/Tokesatsu/KamenRider/PowerRangers as he is with Megaman/RetroActionPlatformers, I would like to tell Domesticated Ant Games:\n\nThank you for developing this masterpiece. I know you didn't make it just for me, but it sure as hell felt like it.\n- [b]Content Warning[/b]: Some scenes could be upsetting to a trans person who has experienced family members shunning their true self. \n\nA 23-year-old [i]Irish[/i] trans woman struggles with her mother not knowing how to accept her true self while also feeling as though she has no where to belong, as sometimes even her peers struggle to fully understand her. As a means of escapism, she keeps a journal and writes stories about an astronaut and space explorer named Cassiopeia. \n\n[u]Praises[/u]\n    • Trans/enby representation.\n    • Aro/ace representation? I don’t know if the dev has clarified on this, but it’s my interpretation of the protagonist anyway. \n    • Creative game mechanics. The player erases entire scenes away or journal entries, then later, can write (choose where written words appear).\n    • Extremely stylized. It’s simple art, but the presentation and coloration of it makes it very unique. \n    • Lots of Irish terms and slang to learn. There’s even a glossary. There’s also an amusing achievement for playing the game in Irish. \n    • Speaking of languages, there are 12 languages available for the game!\n    • Encourages people to seek out help from those who are willing to give it. \n\n[u]Complaints[/u]\n    • “Making Memories Disappear” achievement. It involves doing excessive erasing for no real reason. Definitely not a fun reason. \n\nWhile there is some suffering for the protagonist, she does get a happy ending. [spoiler]Her mother does eventually stop being a b*tch.[/spoiler] All queers deserve happy endings.\nI absolutely recommend this awesome interactive story-rich game to all the queers of the world.\n- First of all - Subnautica is a good game. Very atmospheric, very scary and overall a really overwhelming experience. At first. \nThis might be the only negative review in this month, but I think some of you might appreciate a different view than \"omg this game is just awesome\". Which it kinda is, but in some points it maybe isnt.\n\nThis first section of the review doesnt contain any major spoilers for the story, just a comment on the overall progress through the game stages.\nAt the time of writing this review, I played the game for ~ 35 hours, I have advanced quite a bit. The first few hours were fantastic, I was looking for new things to explore, the blueprints for all the stuff that I need and every new thing felt like I made a progress. But then at a certain point nothing new happend. It seemed to me like I had all resources I could ever need (even the blue crystals), I had all the vehicles you could build, all the upgrades I needed.\nAnd then there was no challenge anymore. You build your submarines, your bases and the game gets too easy, its not a challenge anymore. Don't continue reading after this point, if you havent played the game yet.\n\n[spoiler] The big strength of this game is the immersion in the seemingly endless underwater worlds. But at a certain point this immersion breaks (at least it did for me).\nNone of the monsters can really harm you, not even the biggest ones are a real threat. Just hop into you seamoth and out-speed everything. If there is a leviathan, just hug the walls or strave, they cant catch you. And if they do, just step out, repair your ship and continue. None of the threats is really dangerous. You really need to have bad luck to die. And if you do ... nothing happens. You just respawn.\nAt first the map seems endless, since you cant move fast. But once you get the seamoth, the map is very finite. Sure, there are deeper levels you cant access with the moth, but everything on the surface is within reach. Its the same with the deeper levels and the prawnsuit.\nSurvival is hard at first, since you constantly need to get water and food. Once you can plant you own food, you have unlimited supply and the survival aspect becomes just an annoyence.\n\nAnother thing that bothers me is the amount of resources you need to build stuff. In the later part of the game you need to build a giant structure. But the necessary resources are just like \"get 3 wooden planks, 2 nails and a hammer\". And with these resources you build the statue of liberty.\n\nMy last point is about the storyline. After something like 15 hours into the game there was a major stall for me - I had no clue where to go, to me it seemed like I searched everything I had access to at that time. I searched for 10 hours and found nothing. I went to the Islands twice to check if I missed anything, but no. I dont know, maybe I just had bad luck and something didnt trigger right, I missed a hint somewhere or something. It eventually went on, but on that point I already had the big submarine, the prawnsuit and everything. The story felt like I just need to run from A to B and back, there was no challenge anymore. \n [/spoiler]\n\nSo anyways. If you made it this far in the review, thanks for reading. If you disagree with me, thats totally fine for me. I don't want to ruin the game for anyone, maybe the points that bother me dont mean much to you.\nI know that my critique is pretty harsh. There are many positive aspects in this game. If you can really dive into this game and fully roleplay it, submerge in its story and ignore some flaws, this is a fantastic game.\nBut maybe some of you are like me, so some of my mentioned points could bother you too.\nThanks for reading, I hope I didnt butcher the English language too badly, feel free to comment, if you like.\n- Know your History: \n\nMany of you will already know this, but this game has ties much deeper than you think. It's no secret that Bethesda's Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim had extended it's life through an extensive modding community. For decades, literally, ENBs, shaders, textures, companions, and even story-lines added THOUSANDS of hours to an already sizable game. One story-line mod was called \"The Forgotten City\".  Over the next few years since it's release, the mod had acquired awards such as the 2016 Australian Writers' Guild Award, Zero Period Top 5 Quest Mods of 2015, and others. It was an astounding mod that threw the dragon born into a deeply profound, well written, and engaging story. It was a staple for my personal mod list for years. I've played the Skyrim version countless times, but as soon as I saw this release I immediately bought this and booted it up. \nObviously this is nothing like the mod, both visually or engine wise, but the spirit of the game is still there. It's more defined, expanded, and developed. It deserves every award and accolade it's received. When I walked into the opening scene and fell down the tunnel I couldn't help but shake my head and smile as a wave of nostalgia mixed with new expectations flooded my mind:\n\n\"My god, they've done it.\" \n\nHere's to you, Modern Storyteller, all the best and more to come!\n- One of the best games I have ever played\n----------------------------------------------\n- Runs really well on most computers\n- Looks great regardless\n- Gameplay is heroin-tier addictive\n- High replay value\n- Big f-ing guns \n- If you like metal this game is for you\n- There isn't much wrong with this game\n- 10/10\n\nFLAWS\n----------------------------------------\n-You have the option to turn the music down\n- WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO DO THAT\n- Persona 5 ain't shit\nPokemon ain't shit\nFinal Fantasy ain't shit.\n\nStar Ocean 2's been the shit, will always be the shit, and with this remaster - IS THE BEST REMASTER FOR A JRPG OF ALL TIME. THE GOAT FROM SPACE RETURNS!\n\nAlso is it just me or is Precis extra horny on main? I don't recall her being this forward on the PS1, but hey - cool game that doesn't shy away from the old stuff on the hunt for ESG Blackrock points.\n\nTEN OUTTA TEN\n- Absolutely the second best (half-life Alyx is the best game) VR game I have played in the last 5+ years.  Both RM1 and RM2 are fantastic, superb graphics, excellent story and game play.  I took my time and explored and the game time ended up just over 13 hours.  But the big diff is this game was developed by a very small non-AAA team while Half life Alyx was created with a large AAA dev team with unlimited budget.  The quality/game play of recently released VR games has been exceptionally poor and very disappointing to say the least.  But NOT THIS GAME, RED MATTER 2 excels in every area and is simply a great game that will keep you playing.     \n\nI played using Vive Pro 1 wireless with vive wands and had no issues with controllers or my HMD.  I am saddened that the game play for me is over now that I beat the game......i really enjoyed playing this game and can only hope that Vertical Robot will soon release another similar game........or MAYBE RM3!\n\nGREAT WORK DEVS..........this game must be selected as game of the year!\n- This is such a great game. It's a well put together survival game with many things to do. Whether you want to just build a sandbox wilderness empire or try to escape, it's entirely fun no matter what. I've tried to actually complete the game, but I always end up building a massive epic fortress complete with my very own beefalo farm. The only thing that I personally don't like about this game is the stumble-upon style of actually completing the quests (they're not really quests, but I can't think of anything else to call them). Other than that, this game is a beautiful masterpiece. Very artistic, creative and fun. I definitely recommend it to anyone who loves survival games of any sort.\n- Lots of people parrot the \"tech demo\" or \"benchmark of the singularity\" lines without forming their own opinions.\n\nMe personally, as a fan of Supreme Commander, I enjoyed this game more then I thought I would. I only played the single player campaigns and haven't touched multiplayer. \n\nThe gameplay is exactly what it should be for this kind of game. When I first saw this game I didn't like how every unit was a hovering unit, but it makes sense with the class system the game has. Frigates are basically infantry, Cruisers are tanks, Dreadnauts are hero/high tier. The game borrows from Dawn of War with the territory control mechanic.\n- In my personal opinion,Total War Warhammer 3 is better than its predecessor in every way.\n\nFactions:\nThey did an excellent job t fine tuning the older factions to the point where every faction now feels fully fleshed out and playable. The starting units are fun and the starting areas are usually in a better position. Sure, some factions start off in a really awkward ass places with really strong armies surrounding them, but overall, everything feels much more thought out.\n\nThe new factions they added to this game are fun altho for someone who might be just getting into the game, id recommend going with someone like Grand Cathay and move on from there.\n\nMap:\nThe world map is huge and i love it. The battle fields you fight in are detailed and look absolutely stunning. Fights look like movies sometimes so grab some popcorn and watch your armies die since you were munching on popcorn and not moving your units.\n\nRTS:\nthe RTS side of this game is what got the biggest improvement in my opinion. Everything is so much more clear and the battles just look insanely good. The game feels a bit more fast phase which i don't mind at all since WH2 felt like a battle of attrition sometimes and missile infantry seemed really bad.\n\nOverall i can safely say this i my favorite game currently. The multiplayer is super fun but judging by the reviews some of you leave on this game, its safe to say you have no friends to play with. \n\nDLC might cost bit more than it used to but people will complain about anything if its not free.\n- Please please please give this one a try, especially if you're a fan of existentialism, bittersweet stories, cyberpunk dystopias, gambling with your life every day, living life one step at a time, the small things that matter, cats and feeling like sh!t, but in a good way\n- EDIT:\n\nWhile I have played Squad quite a bit for a few years, the large update named \"V6.0 Infantry Combat Overhaul\" unfortunately did not sit well with me.\n\nThe goals for the update:\n\n- Increase length of fights.\n- Reduce the impact of lone wolfs (solo players).\n- Increase emphasis on teamwork mechanics, which mainly meant supression.\n- Increase gunplay diversity, to create choices between optics, since the old meta meant that the magnified optics were greatly outperforming iron sights and holo sights.\n\nWhile I do not disagree with some of the goals, the implementation of them left a lot to be desired.\n\nAfter the update most gunfights became a mess of supression, without either side being able to effetively kill each other beyond 200m.\nGunhandling was also drastically nerfed, creating the sense that your character has never held a rifle before, or even used an optic for that matter.\n\nI can unfortunately no longer recommend this game, since I myself no longer feel drawn to play it.\n\nIf enough changes are made, I may revisit the game and this review, but for now there are better options out there.\n\n\n** OLD REVIEW ** \n\nCan the game be amazing and fun - yes! Do I recommend this for everyone? - No.\n\nThe experience of the game largely depends on what servers / communities you play with. If you play the core game with no moderation (no rules or admins), the game will become a race to make the first unit and lock others out and a race to get armor, then proceed to rush the enemy and end up spawnkilling them near their main spawn.\n\nIf you play on moderated servers with established rules and active admins, then you may experience a great sense of teamplay - other times not so much.\n\nBefore you buy it though...\n\n- Microphone and willingness to use it is REQUIRED for a good experience (People will quickly kick or become hostile towards you, if you do not communicate)\n- This is not battlefield or call of duty, running of solo to pull off 360 noscopes will probably get you kicked/ killed.\n- You will die without knowing from where and you will get into situations in which you have no option to survive, especially if you're new to tactical shooters.\n- You will end up running... A lot..\n- Armor is not like battlefield or call of duty, you need a driver, gunner, commander and possibly a loader (has a machinegun). Where you hit the enemy matters as much as what you hit him with (Armor piercing on his front turret will likely bounce, but even a high explosive may hurt if you can hit him up the rear)\n\nStill here... ?\n\nIf I haven't scared you off, here are my personal tips:\n- Play. The. Tutorial.  Like really...\n- Try different graphic settings, shadows especially makes a big difference in enemy visibility (game looks better with them though)\n- Start as infantry and pick rifleman, but remember to join a squad.\n- Find a server that seems to have active admins and have a ruleset you agree with.\n- Try NOT to give up when you die, generally it isn't worth throwing away a ticket to respawn if you have friendlies within 100m. Sometimes it is the right choice, but before you know which is which, it's a good idea to hold on for a medic.\n- Not all squad leaders know what they're doing, do not be afraid to join another squad if it turns out your squad leader is a fool.\n- Defending is often as important (if not more), than attacking... But you may end up waiting 30 minutes without getting shot at or shooting anyone.\n\n\nAs you can probably tell... Squad is a community based game, with in-depth enough mechanics, while also being easily accessable.\nIf you want a good sense of what the game is, check out some lesser known streamer playing it (bigger streamers will often give you the wrong sense of what a game is like)\n\nHope this helped you make an informed decision.\n\nbut for now there are better options out there.\n- It's about time i wrote a proper review for one of my favourite games ever.\n\nRivals of Aether is a platform fighter that tries to follow Super Smash Bros. Melee and P+'s footsteps by making a competitive focused game, but also while trying to keep it more accessible than the former. The game also has a very active workshop that allows players to create their own characters and play ones made by other creators, alongside custom made stages and buddies.\n\nI will focus on the purist aspect of the game first.\n\nAs for many \"smash clones\", the game will feel very familiar to people who already played a smash game, with the controls being nearly identical but with some key differences:\n\n1. THERE'S NO SHIELD. Rivals of Aether is probably the first game in its genre to forgo the iconic \"bubble\" shield, choosing it to replace it with a parry instead. Parries are riskier, staying out for a few frames, and will reward you immensely by either stunning the opponent or reflecting their projectiles. Since parrying is so risky, the game's neutral and defense (but also its offense) will be focused on movement, especially thanks to wavedashing, wavelanding alongside some more niche or character specific movement techs. \n\n2. THE STAGES HAVE NO LEDGES. This means your way to safety when you get knocked off the stage will be actually landing onto the main platform, rather than aiming for the ledges. Rightfully so, the game offers much more options when offstage compared to smash games, with every character having access to wall jumping, an airdodge that doesn't send in freefall and the ability to walljump and cancel special falls, allowing you to use your up special two times. This means the offstage game is a lot deeper than in other game, as there will always be a way back onto the stage since almost every character is allowed a lot of freedom while in disadvantage.\n\n3. THERE'S NO GRABS. There's not much to add here; the absence of a shield makes grabs unnecessary, and thus they're not present in the game. Some characters have command grabs, though.\n\nThere's a total of 14 characters in Rivals of Aether (free from the beginning), with 4 more to come in future patches. Although the cast might seem very slim for people who are used to smash games, it's incredibly diverse. Enough to probably warrant you to try every character. Each character has a lot of depth and can shape the stage in some way. Some fighters take inspiration from smash characters, such as Clairen having a tipper mechanic like Marth, or Absa having Ness and Mewtwo's movement turned up to 200 and Zelda's lightning kicks; this means you'll probably find a character you're familiar with in case you're not confident to play with a brand new character yet. It's also worth mentioning that the game is very balanced, with tiers being very subjective. Regardless, RoA's current top player plays the character that is considered the worst in the game by most, so that should prove that the balance state is very good.\n\nNetplay is not perfect, but it's very good and playable. As i'm writing this review, there's currently a beta build that includes rollback netcode, which presents a couple of bugs and desyncs but does its job quite well. Default build uses delay netcode, which also works just fine in case you're dissatisfied with the rollback beta. Rollback is expected to become the default build once the dev team fixes all its kinks.\n\nEvery stage has both an \"aether\" (casual, with hazards) mode and a \"basic\" (competitive, no hazards) mode. Every single stage in \"basic\" mode is tournament legal (with the exception of tempest peak in some regions), adding a lot of stage variety. Aether stages are aimed for a casual audience, with some spicy traps and whacky platform arrangements for a more casual and laidback experience.\n\nOn that topic, there's no items in this game, so the chaotic free-for-all  factor goes down by a notch, to the discomfort of players who like the party game side of platform fighters.\n\nThe community may be small, but it's very active and constantly organizes weekly and monthly tournaments, with the active (financial and whatnot) support of the game devs themselves, so you will quickly find a community in which to play. Sadly, though, having a small community means you'll be bound to experience some \"dead lobbies\" from time to time.\n\nSolo play, i'll have to be honest, is incredibly lackluster. This game was mainly thought to be played with other players and as a result, single player content is very scarce. There's an arcade-styled story mode which only features a handful of characters (the original 4+2 more), that will have you fight some random fighters until you reach your character's \"rival\" at the end of the story. The cutscenes go from average to bad, depending on the character's story. Each story is very simple and resolves itself in the course of 5 encounters, with a super boss+ a final cutscene once you complete every character's story mode\n\nThere's also \"endless abyss\" mode. It's similar to smash's multi-man mode, where you'll fight a never ending horde of weak cpus, with some minigames slapped inbetween, like a platforming section or explosive enemies. You will have to fight a weaker version of the story mode's boss after a set number of waves each time. The most interesting part of this gamemode is probably the rune system. The rune system will allow to buy runes with the in-game currency that will make your character stronger, be it by making them faster/more powerful or improving their moves. These runes can also be used in abyss versus, which is basically pvp but with runes.\nSadly, endless abyss can become repetitive very quickly, with its never changing waves and gimmicks and grind you have to go through to be able to buy (and use) your runes.\n\nThere's one more mode called Tetherball. It's actually a PvP mode, but i'm putting it in the solo play paragraph because it's a very casual mode. Simply put, the goal of this mode is to hit a beach ball that is attached to a pole by a string and make it spin around it. You score one point when the ball-on-a-string completely wraps the pole. You will have to fight your opponent to keep the control of the ball, as they can hit it as well and make the ball \"theirs\". It's a very fun but often shunned aside mode so i felt like putting it in this review. Please, play Tetherball with me. \n\n\nAs for workshop...\n\nIf you're not big on the competitive scene of platform fighters, this is probably why you came to this store page and. as you may have gathered, casual play is not very fleshed out, with only aether mode and some solo modes as your only options. That's where workshop shines! You'll be able to download hundreds of play made characters, some with the intent of being serious, competitive fighters, while others (most) are aimed to a more casual audience. Characters can go from original characters to the reckless wii mote guy, so you'll have plenty of fun by browsing the worshop page and finding the perfect character, be it an original character or a direct transposition of greninja from Smash Ultimate. Needless to say, you'll also have a huge choice of stages and music packs, alongside some hidden gems like new gamemodes that often pass under the radar. I bet you didn't know you could play Uno in Rivals of Aether!\n\n\n\nTo wrap things up, i'd like to comment on the great pixel art graphics which does its job very well and will appeal to retro gamers specifically, and give my shoutouts on the incredible OST made by flashygoodness. Every track fits the stage perfectly and gives the right atmosphere to this fast paced fighting game.\n\nIn other words this game is a very good purchase for both casual players, thanks to the workshop, and competitive players because of its deep yet accessible design. I hope this review made whoever is reading it consider buying Rivals of Aether and join the community.\n- If you want to cut your teeth on the Final Boss of box-pushing puzzle games, then have I got the game for you.\n\nRight out of the gate SSR offers a somewhat uneven mix of real head-scratchers and what I can only describe as pity puzzles, but quickly reveals itself to be the sort of puzzler that mandates particularly extensive sessions of staring at the seemingly inconsequential number of tiles onscreen and poking experimentally at them until something starts to click. This demands a little more patience than I ordinarily have, but I was starting to appreciate the design as I acclimatized to it.\n\nThen I arrived at The Great Tower level (in only the second subsection of the overworld), which all at once foists about 4 times more pieces on you than you've dealt with previously, while simultaneously introducing a Z-axis and the concept of using pieces as platforms mid-puzzle.\n\nSSR does have a well-executed and forgiving Undo function with basically unlimited storage which is a great thing to have up until the time spent rewinding would outweigh the time spent to simply restart the puzzle and do over; the only way it could be made practical on a level that large would be if you had a full-on timeline scrubber like in the rerelease of Duke Nukem 3D.\n\nThere's patience, there's logic, and then there's [b]this.[/b] I play puzzle games to try and [i]relieve[/i] stress, not the other way round. It's a solid design, and I'd probably recommend it to the REALLY die-hard logicians and puzzle fanatics. To the sort like me who enjoy puzzles but prefer there to be some sort of ceiling to their complexity, Gaben help you if you're going to try and soldier through this thing. I would even call Infinifactory a lot more accessible than this is.\n- Stellaris is the contemporary 4X sci fi galactic empire grand strategy to play.  The spiritual successor to ancient space exploration games like Master of Orion and Star Wars: Rebellion.  Start out with just your homeworld and send out scout ships and colonies until you've got your own star empire. \n\nManage your population, tell them what to build, design your own spaceships and fleet structures, and then get pounded into the dirt by the far too cheaty AI... yeah, it's another one of those games where because it's hard to make the AI smart, Paradox decided instead to just make the AI units cheat and become ridiculously overpowered.\n\nI have to say the game is probably far too difficult even if you set all the difficulty to the easiest levels, it's unclear what the developers were thinking, but you can mod the game easily in Steam Workshop to make it viable to play single player. \n\nAs with all Paradox games the DLC pricing is murder, and it adds very little to the core game experience, so my advice is to grab this on sale if you were a fan of MOO, go straight to Steam Workshop and mod it until it's playable, and then you'll have a perfect time sink well worth your money.\n- A really well-crafted piece of interactive media, that sets a very high bar for future video game \"making of\" projects. \n\nI had only vaguely heard of Karateka before, but nevertheless really enjoyed how this story was told. All the supporting documents, assets and (playable) prototypes are presented in a neat timeline, alongside the released games and remasters, with video interviews that tie it all together into a great story.\n\nIf you have an interest in video game history, solo video game development, or game publishing in the 1980s, do yourself a favor and check this out!\n- In my ongoing and likely futile effort to write a Steam review for every game in my library (#21 out of 500+)... it's time for Trails in the Sky: The 3rd.\n\nIf you haven't played both Trails in the Sky and Trails in the Sky SC, go away. This game is not for you.\n\nIf you have played the Trails in the Sky duology, you're almost certainly going to buy this game no-questions asked. Which is fine. Clearly you are a person of impeccable taste and judgment. There are, however, a few things you should probably be aware of before you dive it.\n\nThe 3rd is not really an indpendent game in its own right--it's more of a Gaiden game. It functions mostly as an extended epilogue to the classic Trails in the Sky duology, while also laying down the foundations for future story arcs (upon which much has been built in the Crossbell and Erebonia sequences).\n\nThe game is effectively divided into three kinds of content: lots of dungeon crawling; mostly indpendent character scenes (taking the form of flashbacks) featuring familiar characters from the prior two Sky games; and mini-games! The dungeon-crawling is fairly generic, as the combat system here is more or less the same as in the prior games, and many of the environments you'll be exploring are the exact *same* environments you explored back in FC and SC. There are some new areas to explore, but not many, and personally I found them too abstract to be very interesting. The mini-games are extremely varied and range from incredibly tedious (playin' poker with Gambler Jack) to the amazing (airship shmup!), and can be a lot of fun. The real meat of the game are the character vignettes, all of which are--at the very least--amusing. If you're here, you've likely already fallen in love with these characters, and you'll be glad to know that everyone gets their time in the spotlight here, and the character writing is as strong as ever.\n\nThat said, not everything is sunshine and roses.There is a \"present\" story arc tying all of those flashbacks, dungeons and mini-games together. and... there's no getting around it: it's not very good. The story is short and relatively predicable, with little dialog and less exposition. Our new protagonist, Kevin Graham, performs solidly here--but fails to be quite as interesting as he was in SC--and his lovely lady heroine, Ries Argent, is among the least compelling characters in the entire Trails pantheon, owing mostly to her lack of screenstime. She is absent from entire swaths of the game, and despite her enormous potential, simply does not get sufficient dialog to properly develop. She really only interacts with Kevin, infrequently, and is isolated from the rest of the cast.\n\nUtlimately Trails in the Sky: The 3rd is a bit underwhelming. It's a fun romp, but it could have been so much better with a little more focus on the narrative. The absence of NPCs to talk to, the simplistic structure of the plot, and the underdeveloped heroine are all flaws that are difficult to dismiss.\n- I was waiting to be a bit further into the game to give my thoughts on some of the early complaints I've seen cropping up around this game.\n\nFrankly I do not think this game will be for everyone, but some of the people leaving negative reviews are morons.\n\nNo progression in this game is not locked behind story progress. There are several ways the game marks player progression, and while story progression is one of them. The reward track, gear, and gems are the other. You can consider all of this side-content in some way. You mostly make additional progress through exploration and side quests in this game. Each time you enter a new area you're given several tasks on a reward track that allow you to gain SP to level up your skills, and the reward material that allows you to learn new skills. As you learn new skills your character's stats go up. Exploration and sidequests also allow you to gain unique materials that you sell to merchants that open up deals that allow you to buy high level equipment that give large power boosts to your party. The gem system allows you to slot  gear with upgrades to further customize your characters, and all weapons/armor are able to be upgraded twice.\n\nIf you go out of your way to find the hidden treasures, beat the unique monsters, and finish side quests you can sort of trounce the challenges in this game. Class Emblems which give 'very' large power boosts are also hidden out of the way sometimes. You really just have to search for them, but by no means are they necessary.  I have had no difficulty at all in this game. It's relatively easy to grasp, but it does ask you to pay attention a little more than most JRPGs. If you interact with the systems the game has then the progression curve is smooth. If you don't -- that's not really the game's fault.\n\nOn the subject of the Overdrive Bar. Once you get into it the upper left corner will ask you to use a SINGLE move to help maintain the bar. It will ask you to use either: A physical attack, magic attack, buff, debuff, or utility spell. It is not hard to throw in one of these during the party's turn, and you very much can spam moves over and over again. The system is not at all that obtrusive, again, you just have to pay attention. \n\nIf for some reason all of this is not good enough for a player on a baseline level. There are accessibility options that allow you to adjust how aggressive enemies are, how high their stats are, and you can even make the overdrive bar extremely more forgiving. \n\nThe world is well crafted, the story is fine thus far, the combat is fun and it does try some new things. I certainly appreciate the experience for what it is. The price they're charging for this game feels absolutely criminal, and there's clearly a lot of love put into it. Give it a shot.\n- Coming up to 5000 hours playing this game, and im still learning new things in multiplayer.  \n\nThe devs are by far the best ive ever seen.  FFF (Friday Fun Facts) is a blog post they write up every Friday.  Every. Single. Friday. For the last ... 4 years?  look at them on their website, its not a 2 min blurb, its a full review of what they've done that week, and where they're headed, what their plans are, current iterations they're going over, complete with pictures and sometimes *chuckle* hand drawn graphs.  \n\nTheir IRC channel (there is a link on their website) has someone on the dev team there pretty much 24/7.  Not just \"community manager\" nitwits (Trangar, te he), but guys like Rseding91 (their C++ guru) that are programming the actual updates.  \n\nOh.  There are updates.\n\nAre there sometimes bugs in the patches?  Sure.  Which is why you sometimes see 2 patches in the same day.  Bugs get quashed immediately whenever possible.  \n\nWhile this review doesnt speak much about the game, the team behind it deserves the recognition - its amazing, thoughtul, and incredibly well done because of them.\n\nIn a nutshell, its similar to RTS games like starcraft, where you build up and gather resources.  But instead of spending 20 minutes to build up a base to have the game end in 2, you keep building.\n\nBuilding Bigger.\n\nMaking things more efficient.\n\nTearing down and rebuidling.\n\nIm almost 5000 hours in and sticking with vanilla until I can personally say Ive mastered it.  Once I stop learning new things almost every time I play, ill start fooling around with mods.  And there are lots of them.  \n\nIs this game worth $20?  It absolutely was for me.  This single $20 purchase brought me thousands of hours of entertaintment, frustration - when things didnt work planned, and absolute delight - when things get fixed, and I can reflect on my orchestra of 500 machines working in harmony.  \n\nWhether or not it is worth it for you is up to you.  But I would be remiss if i didnt impore you to give it a try, get the demo, fool around, commit an hour or two.\n\n\n- Let's say you capture a prisoner after a bloody raid on your colony. Do you want to:\n\n1. Let them go in the hopes of improving relations with the attackers? YOU CAN DO THAT.\n\n2. Heal them and have colonists talk to them about how great your colony is until they join? YOU CAN DO THAT.\n\n3. Have a colonist with a high medical skill remove their liver to transplant into an alcoholic colonist? YOU CAN DO THAT.\n\n4. Have a colonist with a low medical skill remove their organs just for practice? YOU CAN DO THAT.\n\n5. Eat them because you forgot to stock up on food for the winter? YOU CAN DO THAT.\n\nReally, what else do you need in a game?\n- Pretty fun and polished for a fast paced shooter.\nOn the technical side, the game ran well and I encountered very few bugs: in a few cases I got stuck in the level geometry, but then a failsafe teleported me back to a safe spot after a few seconds, and in another case I got softlocked by a broken level trigger but reloading the last checkpoint fixed it.\nAll the weapons are fairly useful and interesting, and they can be combined in creative ways instead of the extremely boring \"use A on B\" seen in Doom Eternal.\nEnemy variety is pretty good, even the lowest tiers are different enough to require a bit of attention.\nThe levels also aren't bad, but you have so much mobility that it's easy to sequence break by accident and in some cases skip past large chunks of them.\nSecrets aren't terrible, no wall humping required in this game, but given the sheer size of most levels they can be pretty tedious to find even when no attempt is made to hide them: in some cases, the opposite is true and you'll just walk into a \"secret\" by looking to your side as you follow the intended path.\nDifficulty is odd: I was playing on Street Cleaner (the middle of the 5 difficulty levels), and around the halfway point the game went from \"very easy\" to \"very hard\", with plenty of attacks dealing 300+ damage when the most you can stack is 200 health and 200 armor.\nAt least, the augments you collect in-game and the mutators you unlock by finding secrets offer plenty of ways to fine-tune the difficulty level: for example, you can enable infinite ammo and instagib to breeze through even the hardest difficulty, or disable all weapons but your chainsaw leg and triple enemy spawns to turn even the easiest difficulty into a bit of a challenge.\nFinally, there's a level editor and that's always nice.\n\nWorth playing, even at full price.\n- [h1] Risk of rain 2 is the kind of roguelike where you wanna have just one more quick run before bed but end up playing till dawn. [/h1]\n\n[b] Visuals: [/b] \nThe art style is easy on the eyes early on, but as the run continues and your screen starts to fill with clutter, the diarrhoea christmas lights at later stages can be seizure inducing.\n\n[b] Story and Setting: [/b] \nRoR2 doesn’t hold hands and guide you through its story because honestly there is not much story going on here. There is rich lore to explore for people who want to.\n\n[b] Music: [/b] \nThe lo-fi melody perfectly fits the perilous environment and matches the gameplay with synced rhythm and tempo. Sound design is good too.\n\n[b] Gameplay and progression: [/b]\nDrop into a planet, kill monsters, get money, buy items. Rinse and repeat until you become powerful to one shot God himself. Fast paced with constant running, jumping, sliding and juggling between primary weapon, secondary weapon, abilities and equipment. In each run the difficulty increases over time, which is an innovative approach to deal with difficulty. The roster is filled with unique characters who each have their own gameplay mechanics, making the game feel completely different. \nMost items can be obtained by completing specific challenges. You can also unlock game modifiers to make the game easier or more difficult to your liking. The challenges are one-of-a-kind, and the rewards are meaningful enough to keep players interested.\n\n[b] Game time: [/b]\nThere is no limit. It stops being fun when you decide so.\n\n[b] Online: [/b]\nThere is co-op to enjoy with friends and difficulty scales with the number of players. And if you have no friends, rest assured because all achievements are attainable through single player.\n\n[b] Bugs: [/b]\nNo bugs or technical issues.\n\n[b] PC Requirement: [/b] \nWithout a decently powerful PC the game faces severe lags and occasional crashes in long runs where you loop multiple times and a million things are happening in the background. Lowering graphical settings can help to an extent.\n\n[b] DLC: [/b]\nSurvivors of the Void DLC adds excellent new characters, stages, items,  enemies and alternate endings.\n\n[b] Price: [/b]\nWorth every penny.\n\n[b] My only problem with the game is it doesn’t have a save system. Once you start a run, you will have to see it through to the end. I want to be able to stop at any stage and continue from there later on. I don’t always have hours required to do multiple loops in one sitting. Although there is a mod for saving, I would love a native option. [/b]\n\n[b] Rating: [/b] \nThe Devs are continuously supporting and updating the game which is commendable. The community is very active and you can add tons of community made [b] mods [/b] to breathe new life into your game. \nI highly recommend it. [b] 10/10 [/b]\n- ooooh im pigging out\n\njust like the original risk of rain but significantly more approachable!\n\nthey added controls, chris christododoldoaul and a bunch of retextures, got rid of that gup blackface enemy\nawesome\n\nthanks poopoo games for the review copy\n\n(spoilers ahead)\n\nincluding the mastery skins and void fiend from risk of rain 2 was an awesome surprise, nice to see so much new content\n\nonly complaint is the 100 dillar price tag for the game but otherwise a must buy\n\nUPDATE!!!\n\nAfter further playing, i have many very genuine issues! These providence trials are IM POSSIBBLE! the critreriar are simply absurd, and drifter is practically unplayable in his current state!!!\n\ni have also found a MULTITUDTE of vines allowing me to clip out of bounds?!?!?!? how did this game get past play testing TWICE\n\ni am not fibbing when i say this game in in an unacceptable state, how is this not in early access?! ridiculous, genuinely. gearbox! how could you\n- You are an astronaut, you wake up in a rescue rocket, and against your wills you are shot from Theseus space station on Chori V planet. After landing on the planet you find a strange device that helps you get back on board and survive until help arrives.\n\nGreat game, get it on sale, because it is a bit short. I like games like Portal 2, The Talos Principle, and there is no point to compare this games, because they are completly different, even if they have few common things like solving riddles and story with fresh look at some philosophical questions. Point is that every one of them including The Swapper is good at what it do, and every one of them is unique. For me it is pleasure to play this game beacause of it atmospheric well done design, riddles and questioning the meaning of existence.\n- Why do people think they are funny and rating something in the opposite direction to what is obviously their true opinion?  There should be a rule against that.  Oh ya, and the \"game\" is cringe-worthy.  Get it for $0.01 and mine it for $0.04 worth of cards.\n- Horrible FOV, glitchy looking graphics, everything is blurred even with motion blur off, absolutely no chance of that multiplayer mod, shoddy PC port... Pretty boring and clunky tbh. Don't buy this.\n- ironic that the best sonic game was the one not made by sonic team\n- This game is so good! I actually teared up with some of the conversations (Nightgaunt and Riptide anyone??) and I definitely wasn't expecting that. All of the dialogue is super natural and the relationship's progress really cute. I honestly can't believe this game is free\n- Anti-Consumer DLC Practices. Capcom pls.\n\nWith the brand new release of Rashid, we now know you cannot buy a single character outright, you have to buy packs of in-game currency. And the pricing structure is such that you have to buy more coins than a character costs. \n\nRashid is going for 350 coins, the lowest amount you can be is 250 coins for $5, so you have to pay $10 for 500c or $12 for 610c and have leftovers.\n\nTypical scummy bullshit you would expect from a terrible mobile game. Capcom does not need to resort to such tactics to sell content for a game as popular as Street Fighter. All this does is make people like me on the fence want to avoid spending  any additional money on anything to avoid supporting predatory and consumer unfriendly practices. \n\nCapcom knows exactly what they're doing with these pricing structures and it's super friggen scummy of them. \n\nHopefully by the time they add characters I really want to buy in a few years, things have changed. I went from looking forward to future DLC characters, to it being something I would never want to pay for and support because of this trash. \n\nSo, thank you (and eff you) very much Capcom. Please turn this nonsense around ASAP and let us buy single DLC characters outright with actual money.\n- [h1]AT A GLANCE[/h1]\n(Full review follows below)\n\n[list]\n[*] [b]Game Name:[/b] The Swapper\n[*] [b]Original Release:[/b] 2013\n[*] [b]Genre Tags:[/b] Atmospheric; 2D; Puzzle-Platformer; Sci-Fi \n[*] [b]My Overall Grade:[/b] A-\n[*] [b]Estimated Playtime (Campaign):[/b] 3-5 hours\n[*] [b]Multiplayer Aspect:[/b] None\n[*] [b]Recommended To:[/b] Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Aesthetes; Game atmosphere connoisseurs; Strong narrative advocates; Puzzle game aficionados\n[/list]\t\n\n[h1]REVIEW[/h1]\n[b]The Swapper[/b] is an enjoyable 2D puzzle-platformer that lacks gameplay innovation but rises above the crowd on the shoulders of its superbly well-designed atmosphere and provocative narrative.  The actual puzzle-solving aspect of the game is adequate, but with minimal diversity and accretion.  It is definitely a story-driven experience, with the gameplay taking a passenger seat.  If you can appreciate a game in that style, this is a good bet for you. \n\nThe entrancing narrative and the style in which it transpires work in concert with the mystifying ambiance to create a wondrous experience. The story touches on some thought-provoking metaphysical issues, while skillfully avoiding a fall too deep into the rabbit hole to keep the average person’s interest. Much of the rest of the narrative is comfortable, cliché sci-fi tropes that we all know and love.\n\nThe gameplay and the puzzles are far from [i]bad[/i], but they also are nothing special.  As I alluded to: they are sufficient, but fail to develop into anything overly interesting. Very little changes from the first puzzle to the last, so it does get a little bit dry.  That said, some of the later ones are quite tricky and a few require not only puzzle-solving ability but also decent reflexes. \n\nThe graphics are pleasurable and align perfectly with the vibe of the game. But the whole soundscape is what truly brings the atmosphere of [b]The Swapper[/b] to life. The ambient soundtrack, the cryptic chatter, and the selectively placed voice-overs contribute a wonderful blend of emotions and mystery. If you are into it, this is a game you might enjoy with the lights off and your headphones on (or however else you may get into the zone).  \n\n[b]The Swapper[/b] is a brief, interesting, and enjoyable experience. It is not a complex or intricate puzzle-platformer, but I recommend it to any fan of the genre who would appreciate the atmosphere and narrative.\n\n[i][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/murphyslawyercuration#curation]Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations![/url][/i]\n- They added \"Precision\" mode for the mouse under controls, which is pretty much raw mouse movement. YAY!\n\nAnyway, one of my favorite games of all time easily at this point. Incredible story, fun combat, and awesome world. A must play for sure, especially if you've never played it before on Play-Station (like me). It also has a New Game Plus mode that unlocks different NG+ only armor that are insane.\n\nI played at normal, and aside from the Valkyries the other bosses are a cakewalk. Maybe play on hard or hardest.\n- This is a game that I have been looking forward to for at least 2 and a half years. I have wanted to have a game on the PC that had the elements of harvest moon (for the little bit I played of it), Animal crossing (<3) and Rune factory. I was super excited when I was approached by Leth (publishing manager at Chucklefish) at the beginning of December to help him and ConcernedApe (developer of the game) with bug testing and QA. 400+ hours later (off steam and on steam), I still love the game. \n\n[b]Farming.[/b] The farming is fantastic. It is to me one of the main elements of the game, and it's just a joy. Being able to design your farm any way you want it... yes please. Planning out what to buy every season, where to plant them, on top of the thrill of when you can harvest and reap on the gold... it's so enjoyable and addictive. \n\n[b]Fishing.[/b] The fishing is outstanding. From playing WoW and Runescape.. or any game with fishing, the fishing in Stardew Valley is so much fun. At first, the fishing is challenging, but as you progress your skill, you become a pro in no time.\n\n[b]Mining and combat.[/b] Mining and combat is incredible. Going deeper into the mines can be tough, but if you're prepared with your food and weapon in hand, you can fend off the creatures and get your sweet ore/minerals/gems that you want to bring back to your house and possibly hoard. (Hi, I'm Bexy, and i'm a hoarder.) \n\n[b]Social.[/b] Social interactions are great. Being able to become friends with the people in the town,  and eventually being able to get into relationships with people and having a family with them.. what's not to like about that? And what's great is that it gives great replayability because you can have different saves with different spouses! The backstory for each of the characters too is so in depth and well thought out, you will be silly if you don't shed a tear maybe once or twice. \n\n[b]Main story.[/b] The actual main story is well rewarding, and once you \"complete\" it, you can still continue on your adventures and farming life with no problems, hell you might even discover new things afterwards, I sure as hell did! \n\nYes, I was a tester for the game. Yes, I have played for ridiculous amounts of hours. It may feel like i'm being a bit overzealous with this. However you have to remember, I was a tester. I tested the crap out of every aspect with this game, even though there were massive game breaking bugs, errors, glitches, crashes. I still love this game. I reported many a bug, and ConcernedApe was quick to fix them. \n\nAnd that's the thing, not only is the game amazing, the developer is too. ConcernedApe works around the clock to make sure that bugs are fixed in quick time in order for us to have an amazing experience with this game. And that's true. The experience that you have with this game IS amazing. \n\nMinutes playing turn into hours. Hours turn into \"oh no it's time to sleep\".\nYou will forget about time. You will forget about sleep. You will forget that dinner was about 5 hours ago but you couldn't' remember because you were too busy trying to fight off 12 bats that were clobbering you inside the mines while trying to gather that 1 diamond waaaaay in the back. \n\nSo yes, I without a shadow of a doubt 150% recommend this game to anyone that wants to \"escape\" for days on end with what I am classifying as my #1 Game of 2016.\n- Yume Nikki is a game that is better spent playing blind through. If you are thinking of playing this game, DO NOT LOOK AT YOUTUBE FOR ANY HINTS. There is no losing the game, and there is no winning the game, but if you look at youtube, you will lose a lot of the thematic feel of the game.\n\nI REPEAT, DO NOT LOOK AT YOUTUBE OR ANY OTHER GUIDE. YOU WILL MISS OUT ON AN EXPERIENCE.\n\nSaying that, Yume Nikki is a interactive experience following a young woman's dreams. By sifting through her dreams, you may come to conclusions about the player character's life, or you may find yourself reflecting on events in your life. I heartily reccomend this game to those who like mystery and speculation.\n- AAA Industry: NOOOOOO!!! You can’t have a high quality and feature complete campaign with only a 6.5 GB install made by one guy using Unity, it has to be 200+ GB made by 5 studios and it needs to be an unfinished 3 hour mediocrity and gouge the consumers $70 USD for it!\n\nThis game: [b]HAHA LEG CHAINSAW GO BRRRR[/b]\n- Armored Souls Prepare to sigh....\nIf you are a long running fan of this game it's a mixed bag, if you are new to the series you might like it.\n\nFor the new comers this is robots on roller skates, also screw the natural laws of physics because it makes a cool game.  The key to this game is overwhelming fire power and maneuverability. Here's the rub for me I have AC1 and a PS2 to play it on, I have every US release of this game since AC1 to AC4A, I never finished Nine breaker as it was boring. Below are my gripes, my praise, then my mixed bag in order of paragraphs.\n\nFirst the bad: this game is infested with mechanics that are from Dark Souls and have no place in an AC game.  In no order here they are: status effects, stunning other players,  firing hand weapons cause you to stop moving and leave yourself vulnerable,  repair kits (the flasks from souls), being stunned due to poise (or whatever new dumb name they called it), resupply before a boss fight, and 360 shields.  Stats effects build up like they do in dark souls, this is new to the franchise and really has no place in it, I could see heat weapons causing things to over heat more quickly and maybe some other things, the way this is done is so odd, it feels like a multiplayer add on.  Although its fun to stun bosses and other opponents, this is new to the game and feels like it doesn't belong, I can only assume its been added for competitive multi again.  There's always been this idea that traumatic impacts don't hit the pilots in this game, it's just always been like that and considering the tech it make sense. The latter is true for your AC being stunned too.  AC as a series has gone back and fourth on making you stop to fire a BACK mounted weapon unless you had quad legs or a tank base, this game is the first where a hand weapon makes you stop to fire it.  This is an utter anathema to the game in general, maneuverability and quickly timed dodges were always key.  It ruins your ability to stay moving and fight effectively, which also limits the fun in building and designing your AC.  I don't think there is an AC game in the US with \"repair kits\" yet.  I'm not saying get gud we don't need repair kits, but they are just a distraction to me with no added value.  Giving a player a very high health value is not bad, but I makes each engagement more meaningful, I need to keep my HP high, their are may fights I had where I didn't need to bother with them.  Adding to this mess is the boost before a boss fight, they were never announced like this before; whatever HP you had going in was all you got.  This sticks with me, because the most memorable boss in the whole series was the only one I cannot beat: I took too much damage before the boss fight every time, no magic box to helped me out.  For those of you who are curious it was Zinaida in last Ravens, the suicide drones took too much out of me before the battle.  In AC4A and AC4 there were 360 shields, I'm only guessing, but the shields seemed to mitigate damage.  I don't know because don't get hit or kill them fast has always been my basic plan.  In this new one, its just another health bar that exists for reasons... I don't mind the old shield system give up a defensive advantage for things like assault armor blasts.\n\nThe good stuff.  I like the mix of common enemies being easily dispatched, but still being a threat if you are too slow.  Adding to this is the more dangerous commons like the quad leg MT's.  There is a good combat balance here with crazy mini bosses mixed in like the stealth sniper bots. The bosses are big and badass, with some conventions thrown out the window like the bull charging boss not being weak after a charge. I did hate all the boss fights that involved a 360 shield. The world looks great, yup just darn purdy.  The new super fast tank base inspired by a wheel chair is dumbly fun.  The odd addition of quad legs letting you basically hover is novel and adds some depth to the outfitting of an AC.  Keeping reverse joint legs making you jump faster/higher is classic. The more effective AOE weapons on groups feels more strategic or a the very least feels damn cool when you nail three targets with one shot. Finally letting your AC back mount hand weapons and switch to them at the price of a second or two is a massive evolution, I love it, it should have always been there.\n\nSo there some other things that have changed, which I have mixed thoughts about.  There's now a thing with chips that make you more resilient to damage and other RPGesq things, cool I guess, its another reason to do the arena.  I still will kill them all until I am #1. Hidden objects are now in the game, I don't like them, but whatever, first time I have had to google anything on AC game other then where to buy it.  The plot is oddly boring for me, I think that's just me, last game being AC4A. The game announces when you are making a plot altering decision, its ok, but I would like it if the world just reacted to my decisions naturally no banners.  Weak spots on bosses,  ok its a thing, but firing an AT or plasma weapon at something (that isn't a soft spot) does nothing...not matter how many impacts, ehhh fine. \n\nI'm not done with the game, but over all fun.  Quit making armored souls and make Armored Core.  I was here before demon souls and I will be here after whatever souls, but only if you just keep making ARMORED CORE.  Is there a Japanese word for purity of purpose or ideal? I could use it to try and get my point across. \n\n\nP.S. the fan community paint jobs uploaded on line are gold.\n\n- Luzia reminds me of a little me and the banter between the characters is very cute. \nThis game gives me big Spirited Away vibes but even after I finished it I am still lowkey confused who is who and what what whats've? \nThere were many touching moments [spoiler]esp the scene where Luzia said \"I can't save you but I can help you\" it struck me pretty hard because I always question whether or not one has the right to take their own life, and who are we to stop them...[/spoiler] Overall I actually feel this game is wholesome. It can teach one about what depression is like if you've never experienced it.\nI only got jumpscared once but it was a pleasant experience even then :3\n- At a first glance I thought I would hate [b]Human Fall Flat[/b]. \n“Oh, this is another one of those wonky psychics ragdoll games that are obnoxiously hard to control,” I thought. \n...\nAfter playing it, I can now confidently say that my first impression was spot on. The only surprise was how much I enjoyed playing it. \n \n[h1][u]Positive:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]I can’t fully explain why but I found Human Fall Flat charming. The “human” is adorably simplistic and can complete daunting tasks despite only being able to jump and grab onto things. It reminds me of a very energetic toddler, especially when you raise your arms and jump - [b]it’s so cute[/b]. Something about an awkward “human” taking on challenges makes me feel warm inside [i](is it weird that I feel like I’m watching a baby grow up?)[/i]. \n[*]The levels gradually get larger and the puzzles more complex. I find that this works well with the awkward movements of your character, as you progressively learn how to better control him/her. It’s almost as if you start off as a clumsy baby, learning how to move and perform simple tasks, and end up as an awkward adult, still clumsy but expected to complete harder tasks. \n[*]I’m impressed at how many interactable objects are included in this game. Paired with a pretty good physics engine and you can really have a blast. Swing on a vine like Tarzan? Why not. Row a boat? Sure. Shoot yourself out of a catapult? No one’s stopping you.\n[/list]\n\n[h1][u]Neutral:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]It’s not always clear what you are expected to do, but I guess that’s kind of the point of Human Fall Flat? From what I could tell, you can get past the obstacles in whatever way you like. Sure, there’s the intended way, but if you want you can just climb over things and rush to the end of the level. Or you can just fool around to your heart’s content. It’s essentially one big playground with a goal at the end. \n[/list]\n\n[h1][u]Negative:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]It can be frustrating when things don’t go as you expect. Since your character has the structural rigidity of jelly, you’re constantly battling the floppiness of your character. My advice is: don’t expect to move with precision and you’ll have a good time. I also encountered a few bugs, like my arms or legs getting stuck in an object. Luckily there are many checkpoints and it’s relatively quick to reload.\n[/list]\n \n[h1][u]Conclusion:[/u][/h1]\n[h1]★★★✬☆ Surprisingly fun[/h1]\nI was honestly surprised at how much fun I had playing Human Fall Flat. I tend to avoid ragdoll/physics-y games - Getting Over It, for example, looks like an absolute nightmare to me - but I don’t regret playing Human Fall Flat at all. \nHuman Fall Flat is an absolute blast if you don’t take it too seriously or just like goofing around. I wouldn’t recommend it if you prefer serious games, as it’s very likely that you will just end up getting frustrated. The choice is entirely yours. \n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th][h1]If you enjoyed this review please follow me on my [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/26827738-%27b-Reviews/?appid=241930]curator page[/url] and [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/breviews]group[/url].

Made by the same people who made rollercoaster tycoon and man did they deliver on this. For me it's the small things in a game that matter and did they really take the time to make sure this was as polished as it could be. Not sure if anyone remembers when they announced another rollercoaster tycoon a while back, and everyone was super excyited to find out what it was, and it ended up being some dumbass phone app? Well imagine all that excyitment, but instead of them coming out with that stupid app they came out with this bad boy. This is exactly what everyone was wishing and hoping for (just different name). Do I reccomend you buy this game? hell yes. will it be exactly what you are wishing for when you fist clicked this game to see the game play and reviews? sure as cocks will. But will it be just as fun as the original?.... YOU BET YOUR MOMS TITS IT WILL BE. \n\nPROS:                                \nbeen one since 1990\n\nCons:\nYou'll never know how fun it is till you buy it.\n- 🎃 Tя!cked not Tяeated 🎃 full price $29.99 you can only play a 10 min Light Version. I had hoped that was a joke? I tried Steam \"Offline\" mode still blocked me from Full Monty 18+ XP Room 👎🏻\n\nSteam Refunded 😩 see discussions click 💭 icon\n\n⚪️ $29.99 is greedy money grab for no sex play content.\n⚪️ We can't get anyone to answer back how we buy 18+ Version.\n⚪️ I can see from the Web Site they have a Mobile VR Truck just for Sensual VR and look to now be renting rooms in popular restaurants around Germany. \n\nI honestly believe until the DEV's of this game have fully exhausted it's Euro revenue stream from VR Room Rentals and VR Mobile Truck. They will not sell us the public it's 18+ XP Room from it's Web Site.  \n\nNote to Publisher: Anything less than changing this to a Free Demo from all the above I've stated.  Then you don't belong on steam store.\n- [h1]A True Classic[/h1] \n[u]scroll down for my general consensus[/u]\n\n[b]===[ Audience ]===  [/b]\n☐ Kids\n☐ Everyone\n☑ Casual players\n☐ Pro players\n\n [b]===[ Graphics ]===  [/b]\n☐ Potato\n☐ Terrible\n☐ Bad\n☐ OK\n☑ Good \n☐ Beautiful \n☐ Drop Dead Gorgeous\n☐ Real life\n\n[b]===[ Price/Quality ]===  [/b]\n☑ Full price \n☐ Wait for sale \n☐ Average\n☐ Refund it if you can\n☐ Don't do it\n\n[b]===[ Requirements ]===  [/b]\n☑ 00's PC\n☐ Minimum\n☐ Medium\n☐ Fast\n☐ High end \n☐ NASA computer\n\n[b]===[ Difficulty ]=== [/b]\n☐ You just need 2 arms \n☐ Too easy\n☐ Easy\n☑ Medium\n☐ Hard\n☐ Dark Souls\n☐ Battletoads\n\n [b]===[ Game time/length ]=== [/b]\n☐ Really short\n☐ Short \n☐ Few hours\n☑Normal Runtime (clocking at 15h)\n☐ Long (about 30[i]ish[/i] hours)\n☐ Endless\n\n[b]===[ Blood/Gore ]===[/b]\n☐ No\n☑ Only blood\n☐ Blood and some Graphic Violence but not something extreme\n\n[b]===[ Violence ]=== [/b]\n☐ No\n☐ Mild\n☑ Average\n☐ Violent\n☐ Manhunt\n☐ Mortal Kombat\n\n[b]===[ Soundtrack ]===[/b]\n☐ No\n☐ Annoying\n☐ Better than Despacito\n☐ Good\n☑ Cool and very creative\n☐ Masterpiece\n\n[b]===[ Story ]===[/b]\n☐ No\n☐ Better than Twilight\n☐ OK (more on that below)\n☑ Good\n☐ Fantastic\n\n[b]===[ Bugs ]===  [/b]\n☐ Game itself is one big BUG\n☐ Bugs destroying the game\n☐ Many bugs\n☑ Few Bugs\n☐ No bugs\n\n[b]===[ Others ]=== \nStory: 9/10\nGameplay: 9/10\nSound Design: 8.5/10 ( I didn't like the sound mixing)\nOverall: 9.5/10[/b]\n\n[h1]A true classic. [/h1] \n\n\n[h1]===[ General Consensus ]===[/h1]\n\n[b]This was the baseline for two entire generations of Single-Player FPS[/b]\n\n[u]The Half-Life series is considered to be one of the \"Grandfathers\" of modern FPS. Along with some other titles of its generation, it revolutionized the shooter genre, giving games a new depth and even bigger focus on storytelling and big setpieces, remeniscent of action genre movies. And naturally, Half-Life 2 is remembered one of the finest games to be realized and developed, even after a tumultuous and bumpy development.[/u]\n\n\nI only came to the awareness of this game's status in the gaming world a few years ago. I never really heard too much about it or even payed to much attention to it; back in my childhood I remember seeing it around the internet but it never really talked to me.\nSo a few years back I bought the whole HL franchise here on Steam, already acquainted with the game's praise. \n\nAfter a couple of failed attempts to play HL2, but getting stuck on the same part, I finally got to finish the game. \nAnd I must say I'm totally on board with all the praise and status!\n\n\n[h1]PLOT:[/h1]\n\nThe story continues after the events of Half-Life 1, where Gordon Freeman, a scientist working on the Black Mesa Research Facility, fights his way through hords of aliens brought to Earth by a portal that Gordon himself opened.\n\nWe wake-up to a dystopian future where the Black Mesa and the alien infestation led to a very different world of ours, where humans live in a opressing society on the likes of the book \"1984\", where everyone is meticulously controlled by the \"system\".\nThis hugely different and creative setting really talked to me and even made me more interested in the narrative.\n\nFrom then on, Freeman tries to lead a group of \"resistence\" fighters to oppose and tear down the ruller of Earth, the former administrator of the Black Mesa Facility, Wallace Breen, (whom also \"negotiated\" a peace agreement with the aliens, right after the events of HL1).\n\nI must say this story is a very creative and different experience of those found in other FPS games.\nI always found myself on the edge of my seat, eager to know what was gonna happen next, and while also amazed by all the environmental storytelling.\nIt's truly one of the game's strongest points and even though your character doesn't speak, you will find yourself completely imersed on the narrative. Even all these years after, this political and social matter that Valve went for and explored is one of the game's strongest points really!\n\nAnd not to forget about all of those fantabulous and explosive setpieces seen throughtout the game that are really solid and entretaining, having inspired other games like Uncharted and the Call of Duty campaigns, just to say a few. You are really put in some tricky and tough situations.\n\n\n[h1]GAMEPLAY:[/h1]\n\nThis is your average FPS gameplay. Nothing you haven't seen before, but HL2 is certainly a gold standard of how to excell and give variety in your gameplay.\n\nYou've got your normal 2000's arsenal, like Pistols, the series' signature weapon the Crowbar, a Revolver that packs a serious punch, an SMG, Assault Rifle, Shotgun (THAT FEELS SO GOOD TO SHOOT), Grenades, Crossbow, Rocket Laucher and a new \"toy gun\" the Gravity Gun.\n\nAt the time, Valve was developing a new physics engine never seen before that went on to shake and revolutionize games at the time, but in order to really make usage of this new technology, [u]the developers of Half-Life 2 introduced the Gravity Gun to the weapons roster [/u]. \nWith it you can \"grab\" multiple objects, such as crates, file cabinets, gasoline tanks or even buzzsaw blades to throw at oponents. It's a very creative way to make usage of the different environment assets while showing off new technology.\nIt's also another tool to help you get out of sticky situations like puzzles, something that Half Life 2 really experiments with. \nWith this engine, Valve pushed the physics to bring different puzzles that just feel natural to solve.\n\nGameplay feels really natural and it's what we have grown accostumed to in the FPS genre, but very competent and polished.\n[spoiler](the shotgun just feels awesome and sooooo satisfying to shoot)[/spoiler]\n\n\n[h1]SOUND AND MUSIC:[/h1]\n\nSound feels like a very big step-up comparing to Half-Life 1 and every weapon sound much better when firing.\n\nEnvironmental sound is really good and pushes you even more to the game's immersion. Every area of the game is masterfully design, to the sewer sections that feel so claustrophobic and tense to walk through, to the more city like big places where you can sense the real sense of scale of the space through the sound design. \n\nI must say it's really top notch.\n\nBut there were times where I felt that the sound mixing was a little off, having sounds playing with a really pumped up volume that really distracted me and put me off.\n\nIn the other hand, the Music is just amazing. It's 00's techno and rock like music that just injects you with such adrenaline and makes you feel really awesome with gunning down opponest. VERY SATIFYING INDEED.\n\n\n[h1]GRAPHICS:[/h1]\n\nIn all honesty this is a hard category to judge, because obviously the graphics are going to look a bit dated to what we have today (in 2020), but honestly everything look really good.\n\nFrom characters and enemies, to the environments, to the fire and explosion effects, it all looks very good and has a great level of quality to them. Specially the alien creatures. I felt utterly disturbed by those \"facehuggers\" like creatures. Everytime they jumped at my face I would equally jump, but of my seat with disgust... \n\n\n[h1]CONCLUSION:[/h1]\n\n[b]To summ it up, I think that Half-Life 2 is a must play game. \n\nReally, if you are like me and you have heard about it, but was like \"meh maybe this game is old and dated and its now crap\", just cut the argument and go play a really good and polished experience.\n\nFor those out there, if you want a polished and strong game that still challenges most contemporary games, with an interesting narrative, and some awesome moments just grab yourself a copy of this. It's dirt cheap, no excuses...[/b]\n- Dear Dev, \nI love this game, if you're reading reviews, please consider some ideas to make it better:\n-  Level designing: Add more ways to choose, and different endings. Right now SoR4 is flat from A to B, it made me feel down compare to SoR3.\n- Alternate customs, and playable same characters: Floyd is overrated and all my friends want to pick him. Make a game with 4 Floyds running sound fun. Use lifetime score to unlock customs.\n- 2v2 Battle! WHY NOT?\n- Shiva (new), Max (new), Roo, Estel (Badass Woman Cop)\n- Steam trading cards: I know it's not importance, but who doesnt want some badass backgrounds on steam profile?\n- I was lured in by all the positive reviews and the beautiful art style. Once I started playing, I really tried to love this game. I really tried. I got thirteen levels in before I couldn't escape that I hate this game more than any game I can ever remember hating.\n\nThere are a lot of reasons why. Many are nitpicks, but there is one overwhelming one: This Game Is Almost Never Fun. I started out enthusiastic, but it wasn't long before all the enjoyment drained out. I went from looking forward to the next level, to only wanting to complete the current one just so it would be over and done with. I could not help contrast Tri with games like Portal or QUBE where, most of the time, the challenge is in figuring out the puzzle. Once you know how it's done, you can do it. In Tri, this is not the case. Realizing the solution just means understanding how much tiring, precarious, exacting, chore-like work you have to do before you can DO the thing you figured out how to do. This is a game where there is no such thing as a simple solution. If solving a puzzle can be made more difficult, it has been. Not in a mentally challenging way, but in a way that feels like having to walk for miles over uneven rocks. (Especially once they introduced having to direct light beams by reflecting them off triangles. This requires innumerable microscopic adjustments each time.)\n\nAnd even that would be fully forgiveable, if the game's difficulty was FAIR. For me, half my frustration came from the increasingly difficult puzzles, the other half came from inconsistent mechanics. Sometimes when I had to run up walls, a triangle that showed I could walk on it would suddenly let go of me and I'd plummet. Sometimes I got trapped in places I should have been able to jump out of. Sometimes lasers would bleed right through triangles I put up to block them (In one case, I had to layer down twenty-four of them). But the worst was the jump. At first I thought it was a nifty idea that if you were jumping towards a high ledge, you could keep pressing space to haul yourself up and over. I grew to hate this mechanic because of how often it failed. Jumping up a simple step could take five or six tries; impotently bobbing up and down going \"HUHHP! HUHHP! HUHHP!\" each time. There were also plenty of times when it seemed like random chance whether a given platform could be jumped to or not. Plus there was the tendency of jumps to send you up and over a thin ledge you were trying to reach, instead of onto. I quicksaved OFTEN.\n\nTri feels like it lives up to its name: they tried. They really did. They had ideas with a lot of potential and the level design is frequently gorgeous. But too often these ideas were implemented poorly, or were not conveyed at a reasonable difficulty level. I quit. I don't want to, and I am massively disappointed to, but I'm giving up and uninstalling this game. I know I'll never see the end cutscene, but honestly, not playing anymore feels like more of a reward to me.\n- Really overrated. Sure the graphics are fancy schmancy, but in the end it feels more like a dumbed-down Left 4 Dead.\n\nPurely from a gameplay perspective, the class specializations are excessively numerous with not that many differences between many of them (and notably, every class can use the same weapons anyway), and the solo mode sucks (no bots, are you kidding me?).\n\nOn other aspects of the game, there is that XP and (cosmetic) items grinding that seems to be the current trend/cash cow. And the fucking ridiculous buying of weapons and ammo within missions because, you know, killing monsters gives you money and in a world completely wrecked by zombies there are automated weapon stores at every corner - seems legit. Feels like that CSGO crap: it's not an FPS as much as a trading \"game\", where you buy stuff ingame and you buy or sell stuff on the Steam marketplace.\n- Imagine releasing an \"update\" that breaks peoples games/ mods, JUST SO YOU CAN PUT A BANNER AD IN THE MENU FOR BL3. Just WOW.\n- Plants, please: A horticultural document thriller.\nGlory to Undermere.\nPros: \n- the writing and its illusion of effortless brilliance\n- attention to detail and consequences for player actions\n- \"gotta catch 'em all\" mentality that actually makes you feel smart\n- the intrigue, world-building, and game flow\n- petting the cat\n\nCons: I wish there was more music, or just none at all most of the time.\n- I was hoping for a good game but I can't believe the positive reviews. Really annoying on a personal level. If you like your hand held and revel in 3rd person view then enjoy, but I think it's terrible. I was on the mountain jumping across a platform. \"Press ENTER\" to 'grab' it suggests. I press ENTER and what do you know? Nothing happens. Well, you die continually because what it tells you to do (zzzzz) doesn't work. Ah, maybe this is part of the 'difficulty'...hahahaha.\n\nNot a patch on any Far Cry or GTA even though these are full of directions. First Tomb Raider I've bought and definitely the last. What is it with games these days telling you what to do every step of the way: Do this...do that....go here....find item...take item...drop item...fire now.....pull lever...talk....rest....jump.... quit game and uninstall, ya that's the best option. As this game is created for a dumbed-down society or tailored for intellectually challenged meercats, some of us can see where the industry is heading. What happened to thinking for yourself???\n\nI don't need to progess far in this game because the first 10 minutes says enough. Do this, do that, blah blah blah...\n- Overall its a great hunting game. The base game is good enough on its own to give you an enjoyable experience hunting several varieties of animals. \n\nI feel that some of the best content is in the DLC's. I dont mind the price tag for maps are they are just a large and some of them have a truly diverse animal population. \n\nThe Weapon Packs have some items that really should have been available in the base game (.22 rifle).\nTripod stands, Tents and ATV's are also DLC items that i feel should have been included in the base game. \n\nThe cost for these packs are not huge, and I have bought them, but they really do impact your play in a meaningful way so it is hard not feel like they were left out on purpose. \n\nBeing a former hunter in real life I would say that the realism of it is pretty good. Lung shots and heart shots drop animals quickly and using the right ammo along with good aim greatly influences this. A poor shot will leave you tracking this wounded animal across the map till you sneak up on it again or just give up. \n\nThey have a system called Tru Racks (sumthn like that) that simulates different qualities of animals. So you end up with little bucks, average bucks, and monster bucks. Weight and coloration plays a part in this too. In short every animal has a trophy of some kind and they are varied by what must be some sort of RNG. \n\nAll that having been said, this game can devolve into a shooting gallery were you kill everything on sight as there in no real incentive not to. You get money and experience for every kill you claim and wiping out a heard of deer with your DLC M1 Garand on your DLC Tripod Stand becomes the quickest way to bypass the grind.\n\n It feels like the game starts as a \"hunting sim\" and becomes a \"poaching sim\" once you realize the progression system is going to take a long time to do...\"ethically?\".\n\n\nAgain, this is a game i would recommend, but it is just that, a game. \n\n\n- Great Game, play the Demo instead of reading reviews.\n- This game is like cocaine. \nI always tell myself just one more, then im done. I'll do homework. I'll sleep. I'll eat something. \nBut you know what? That last death was cheap, I'll do one more to make up for it. I just need 1000 gold for that upgrade, I'll just do one more to get it. Always just one more. \n\nThings I like:\n\n+Strong RPG Progression - Gold from your run can be spent on stats, equipment, abilities, etc. making multiple runs and longer runs more rewarding.\n\n+The game is witty and has flavor. -- there are various conditions your new characters can have such as being blind, gay or having a fear of chickens, amongst many, many others. Dying is in this sense, pretty fun. The writing has a lot of charm!\n\n+The controls are very tight -- this game has good controls. It's easy to do what you want, which is good because it's very tough and you will die a lot.\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n- The bosses in new game plus don't get harder -- As you progress into new game + or ++ or +++ and beyond, the bosses don't scale well, despite the general enemies leveling up to basically become bosses themselves. Not a huge deal, but it's the only negative I have.\n\nThen at some point you realize you've beaten the game, Thankfully there is a new game plus.\nMaybe just one more playthrough...\n- I am a 43 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he helped me. Loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.\nThank you <3\n- Do you have friends? Do you want to play games with your friends?\nBuy this game!\nDo you not have friends? Are you in need of consolation due to the endless lonely Friday nights spent playing Solitaire? \nConsider playing Dwarf Fortress.\n- Where to start.... in short entire game is boring and very slow paced for no aparent reason.\n\nAI: AI performs only very basic functions and does not upgrade buildings and does the opposite of whats beneficial for your empire. AI does not do very well when engaging in displomacy.\n\nUI: You will spend most of your time trying to manage/hover around very CLUMSY and absolutely disgusting UI. Other 4x games offer far superior UI and make is easier to manage your asset on the field e.g. Sword of the stars II, Star Ruler 2, Distant world, Endless Legends, Endless Space etc.\n\nGFX: Graphics are not the top notch what you would expect from a modern 4x game but they are on far with Endless Legends. GFX leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nAlien Races: I dont need to say much but like Planets most of the races are COPY / PASTE. Nothing unique or special about each. \n\nMP: Multiplayer has a mind of its own and in most cases wont let you join public games unless its a private game.\n\nStellaris bring nothing new to 4x Genre in 2016!.\n Right now everyone is almost beta testing for the developers so we can find bugs, report them  and help them fix their game. Why not let players do beta before before release? But then there is  a question of sale and refund. \n\nBut overall this game does offer amazing soundtrack.\n- A masterpiece of a game that had it's potential destroyed by EA's stupidity to release it between a new COD and BF game :( :( this game is worth the full price just for the single player campaign alone, the movement and shooting mechanics in this game is top notch and many other games have tried to mimic it. I've played through the single player 4 times now (twice on ps4, once on xbox and once on pc) and every single time the game has been a blast, trust me play it :) I really hope respawn/ea make titanfall 3\n- I've changed my mind on this review.\n\nLoot boxes? Yuck.\nRemoving most servers, forcing everyone onto US West/East and European servers? Yuck.\nBase 250 ping at all times? Yuck.\n\nI want my Oceanic server back, so I can actually enjoy the game properly. Until better region support is reintroduced, this'll remain a negative review.\n- Swing, shoot, run, grapple, panic, wade through muck, struggle to see through indoor weather effects, pour lotion on incapacitated friends, and relive other memories of a Turkish bathhouse in this 4-player co-op mine-‘em-up.\n\n[b][u]The Good[/u][/b]:\n[list]\n[*]Mission variety. There are a few different types of missions to play: Mining Expedition (standard pick-and-collect), Elimination (boss fights), Escort (ride and refuel a giant drilldozer to obtain a rare stone), On-Site Refining (set up pipes to pump morkite), Egg Hunt (obtain alien eggs inside walls), Salvage Operation (find and repair mini-MULEs), Point Extraction (find stones in a giant room and return them to the center platform), and Industrial Sabotage (wake up a rival company’s boss and obliterate it). There are also secondary missions that involve collecting or killing for bonuses.\n[*]There is even a nice variety with the events that appear in missions.\n[*]RNG makes the missions more [strike]frustrating[/strike] interesting. It feels good when you have 3 events in one mission and get rich.\n[*]Deep Dives and Elite Deep Dives which are consecutive sets of missions you do in one go.\n[*]Underground environments that are actually interesting.\n[*]The game has a great OST that really fits the different moods of the game. From “I like mining enjoy mining but still want to kill myself”, to “There’s no way we’re going to make it”, to “We easily got this”, it’s all covered.\n[*]Free content is added to the game, including seasonal unlocks.\n[*]You can customize your character’s hair, mustache, beard, sideburns, skin, armor type/color, taunt and weapons.\n[*]Not only is there a variety of weapons, but they all have different perks and mods you can select to accommodate different playstyles.\n[*]The server filter has a lot of options, but I do wish there were an option to show games that need a specific class.\n[/list]\n\n[b][u]The Neutral[/u][/b]:\n[list]\n[*]10 environments.\n[*]4 classes and each has a role: Driller burrows far away from the team and gets swarmed to death, Scout moves far ahead of the team to make sure it’s unsafe by getting leeched, Gunner uses everyone’s ammo stash and gets downed because he thinks he’s immortal, and Engineer dies while building a sentry and ignoring all pings.\n[*]I killed my teammate by building a bridge of platforms over the drilldozer as Engineer. He tried to drill out of it but I kept refilling the gaps. I think about that a lot.\n[/list]\n\n[b][u]The Bad[/u][/b]:\n[list]\n[*]Ghosts.\n[*]Enemies can attack you through barriers. It's especially annoying on the minehead.\n[*]The game seems less optimized since the release of Season 2.\n[/list]\n\n[b][u]Pro Tips[/u][/b]:\n[list]\n[*]If you’re Scout, then you better make large rooms look like a nuclear Christmas in Las Vegas and grab minerals/items that are out of reach.\n[*]If you’re Gunner, then you better make boss/event rooms look like it’s laundry day for Pinhead.\n[*]There are clues in the game for hidden goods. If you see glowing gold, blue, pink, or green stones; or glowing spikes, there’s a hidden stone/cube inside.\n[*]If you find a helmet you can interact with, it shows you where lost gear is on your map.\n[*]Always ask before activating something or calling the drop pod.\n[*]Don’t make the same mistake Liam Neeson did in Batman Begins.\n[*]Seriously! Do [i][b]NOT[/b][/i] start an event or objective when no one is ready; especially when it’s an escort mission and the dozer has already moved.\n[*]Don’t like sneaky snakes that hoard everyone’s share of ammo? Take note of the white rectangles under their avatars while they take ammo to see if they actually need it. Do the same for yourself.\n[*]Read a server’s description before joining and know what the host expects.\n[*]If you fail to join a server, hit right click instead of clicking the confirmation.\n[/list]\n\nIs it worth it? If you like the idea of mining as a low-poly dwarf with alcohol-induced double vision, who gives hints of lore and pisses off all of his teammates because he doesn’t know how to do his job, then yes. The game has more variety and depth than I had imagined, and I’m still not tired of it after a few hundred hours of playing. 300 hours in and I’m still killing my teammates with engineer platforms and still not caring.\n- [h1] A BETTER MINECRAFT, AND I WILL TELL YOU WHY[/h1]\nwith terrain deformation and creation, crafting etc its only normal that the first comparison that comes to mind is with minecraft. But it is better than minecraft.\n\n[h1]The Gameplay[/h1]\nMinecraft has a glaring problem: [b]the gathering of resources.[/b]\nsure its fun to explore caves but to go and search for the material that you need get boring very fast. \n\nIn Astroneer you have a vacuum to literally [b]suck up the material that you need[/b], and in the advanced stages big buggies to mine faster and carry more, and then even auto-extractors.\nSure you need to go to specific planets to find a specific materials, but that just adds to the fun of exploration and space travel.\n\n\n[b]Then there's what to do with said minerals.[/b] \nIn minecraft you mine and mine and for what? to create a different colored house? seriously whats the point?\nWhile in astroneer there is a reason, to create vehicles, to create different structures to refine said materials, to go explore faster.\n\n\nIn other words, and i guess the key of this review: \n[spoiler] Astroneer feels like a feature complete minecraft.[/spoiler]\n\n\n[h1] The bad things with it [/h1]\n[b]-There's no soundtrack.[/b] i mean there is, but its some random notes pushed casually.\n\n[b]-the ending.[/b] \n[spoiler]There is no ending. you just collect the planet cores and put them onto the asteroid. barely a minute long cut scene, and credits roll. it doesn't unlock anything, it feels unfinished, all that build-up for nothing.[/spoiler]\n\n[b]-⚠️⚠️⚠️Anybody from your steam list can join your server and create havoc!!⚠️⚠️⚠️[/b]\nNo way to make the server private. \nNo way to kick people.\nNO SOUND THAT ANYBODY EVEN JOINED!!\nits a disaster waiting to happen!! please change this at all costs!!!\n- I'm gonna give this a thumbs up but with like, idk, a cautionary sideways thumb for maybe. \n\nif I read credits right, it looks like this game had all its programming, art, music, and writing done by one guy, so I have to give respect to that. For a real indie game like this, it's very very good. \n\nBut it's still really flawed. If you're looking for a 2D Metroid game, and you've played EVERY other 2D metroid game, I suppose yeah, go for this one, and I think you'll enjoy it. If you're not a fan of metroid, I would not bother, sadly. This game suffers from a lot of problems from metroid games, and does not fix any, and at times exagerates those problems. \n\nThe art style is very interesting and cool, but the way the levels and map design are, leaves most areas feeling like a mess of unmemorable places. \n\nThe combat is INCREDIBLY simplistic, yet somehow bogged down by WAY too many useless weapons and just kind of badly designed controls. I found there were about 5 weapons that were actually useful in the game out of what seems like more than 10. Most enemies you either cheese, or be cheesed. There's no charge up shots, there's not really much nuance to the enemies or bosses. They have about two attacks and repeat while you dodge the same one bullet pattern and just kind of shoot in their general direction. (I played it on hard by the way. Not a particularly difficult game, but even the slightly challenging stuff felt kind of dull and uninteresting.) \n\nThe music was cool again. nothing quite mind blowing, but it was nice. The world itself seems like a mess, but there are cool ideas. The giant robot people were really cool to see. \n\nOne little idea i really liked is that the LOW HEALTH beep sound is actually in sync with every song in the game. I thought that was really cute, and it's not something I've seen any game do. Sounds dumb, but I give a lotta props to that, it was cool. \n\nWriting is okay. I feel it left more to be desired. There seemed to be an interesting world here that wasn't explored enough. It wasn't bad, I suppose, but not really that great. \n\nThat is kind of this game. It's not bad by any means, but not the best game on the planet. Play it if you're in need of a Metroid game, and I'm certain you will be pleased enough despite the flaws. Even if you're just having a hankering for a platformer and have already played Hollow Knight and some other great ones first, I think you should enjoy this, but don't expect a 10/10 game. \n\nGive it a try if you feel it looks interesting.\n\n【グループB】\n- If you somehow don't know what this is: It's a meta-narrative focused walking sim with a funny narrator. Only you know if that kind of thing sounds like a good time to you.\n\nSubtract about 26 hours from my playtime because I'm a lunatic who left the game running for a whole day to get a silly achievement.\n\nI loved the HD remix (never played the og mod), and I really liked this one too, but I will say that a lot of the commentary the original offered doesn't hit as hard or hold up as well almost a decade later, just because the narrative structure and how narrative is tied to gameplay of many story-driven games has changed in that time (because of course it has), as well as the mindset of a lot of players being different. So I think that it's worth keeping in mind the cultural moment the original was made during... if you're the thinky type who likes to overthink things. You massive nerd.\n\nStill, it felt nice to jump back in and spend a little more time with the narrator, and there were some legitimately striking moments in the new content that I found to be quite powerful and engaging. Overall, though, having played the original, getting all the new stuff (and revisiting the old) felt a lot more like checking off a to-do list than active exploration teasing at the boundaries of the game and it's layout than the first one.\n- MySims, Scribblenauts, Poly Bridge and just plain old Lego building.\n\nIt's hard to describe this game succinctly without drawing a comparison to one of the above so I'll just do it off the top. Bricktales is a very pleasant blend of these sources, offering light accessible and honestly quite relaxing game play centred around a mix of lego building challenges and overworld puzzle solving. It's an ideal game for kids or even adults looking for something breezy, especially considering just how nicely it's presented.\n\nThere's a few small gameplay gripes, the controls for the building mode are decent once you get to grips with them - but getting to grips with them takes a little time. On the over world it can feel like you spend a lot of time switching between traversal powers and watching the corresponding animation. And in some places the game can let you build something that counts as a valid structure but isn't actually traversable for your character. None of these felt like a big issue though.\n\n I think the most engaging thing personally is that the themes chosen (Medieval, Egypt, City, Caribbean and Jungle) are all very familiar genres for original Lego sets of the past, which combined with the simple blocky nature of the things you build in the game makes it feel much closer to the vibe of just playing with Lego as a child than something licensed. There's a very charming *vibe* around this game that I think gives it value beyond something just for children, and is a large part of why I would reccomend it.\n- I have not play for long, but know well enough this game deserves a mention. A side on, survival-ish game set in a war. Now, While I admire this game, it does have a few issues I personally find abnoxious.\nI'll start with those, and then will share what I like about it.\n\n-Characters you play seem to have never stolen anything at all from anyone, ever during the war. This is reflected in how unhappy and whiney they become caring more about the people they have taken from than their own wellbeing.\n\n-Characters you play are too softhearted. Just use the example with the point above. \n\n-Characters are expert carfters for being just average people. How many average people know how to pick locks, make servicable firearms and make alcoholic beverages? Well these three certain are capable of all three and more. For that matter, they all can do everything, but have one special skill they are the better at than the rest.\n\n-You get to only visit one building per night. This is bad since if you chose a building with other survivors in it, you will either need to steal from them to get supplies and be faced with a lot of unhappy complaining, or return home with nothing.\n\n-Visting other survivors, you cannot negotiate with them let alone talk to them. What you can do is beat them to death (or kill them with whatever weapon you happen to have on you at the time). I don't see how this was a good design choice at all when the characters you play are not personally that sort of people. Attacking other survivors is certain to cause problems with your characters.\n\n-You can not relocate from your starting place. What you start with is your base of operations.\n\n-Raids happen frequently to you only. You will never kill raiders, only chase them off and this happens behind the scenes, out of your control, while your character is out scavanging.\n\n-You can not sleep in shifts. If a person sleeps, they sleep the whole night.\n\n-Rediculous resource requirements. Some things require far too much, while others require far too little. \n\n-There is little to none interaction between your characters. No idle chatter between them. \n\n\nNow for the good points.\n-You play 3 characters to begin with, each having one specialty. They somewhat have different personalities.\n\n-The art style appeals to me.\n\n-Characters are well animated. Different staes of tiredness, different things they do when unhappy or when they have nothing else to do.\n\n-The overall idea, even though it isn't implemented well enough.\n\n-Building your shelter from ground up.\n\n-Forgaing and stealth play.\n\n\nSo while i find some issues with this game's design, if you ignore the lack of realism and consider this to be just a game with a very narrow play style, it is quite fine. It has a certain atmosphere you generally don't find elsewhere. I still recommend to give it a try.\n- Having accumulated over 13400 hours in-game with [i]Arma 3[/i], I would certainly recommend it to others. \n\nIf you enjoy tactical shooters and playing online with friends, it's well worth a look; especially if you appreciate a high dose of military realism!\n- Overall better cast than the first game. But it has a few problems that DR1 didn't have, which to me was what made the game fun in the first place.\n\nDR1 spoilers: [spoiler] All of them seem capable of killing which I couldn't say about the first game where it was obvious that weedman, the giant and donut girl wasn't a threat to you. [/spoiler]\n\nDR2 spoilers:  [spoiler] However unlike the first game where Kirigiri, Byakuya and other characters were arguing during the trial and bringing up interesting points. DR2 has a lack of persuasive characters. There's effectively just Nagito (who argues in your favor half the time anyway) and Chiaki. The other characters never challenges you in a convincing way.[/spoiler]\n- Black Mesa is a fantastic remake of the Original Valve classic and one of the greatest of all time video games, Half-Life.  This sci-fi classic FPS has you take on what might seem like a hum-drum day in the life of an experimental physicist, but things go quite off rails when experimenting with a strange material sample from an even stranger dude in a suit. \n\nAfter a while (and shooting a lot of aliens and bashing their heads in with a crowbar) you'll save the world... but now Black Mesa lets you do this with dramatically updated graphics, 4K support and a plethora of visual tweaks so you can rest assured this will run great on any gaming rig. \n\nA must have for big fans of Half-Life or gamers who are new to the scene and never got to play the original.   When on sale, of course!\n- Mysterious, claustrophobic, and psychedelic --- this is undoubtedly the most unorthodox game in The Legend of Heroes series. This game is basically what you get when you put The Legend of Heroes, Shin Megami Tensei and a certain Silent Hill title [i](which I won't specify for a good reason)[/i] into a blender machine. Nonetheless, it is still very much an LoH game at its core, though its semi-fandisc nature holds it back from being as coherent of an overall package as its two predecessors.\n\nI cannot stress this enough: [b][u]If you were a big fan of the previous two games, you will not necessarily like this game; on the other hand, if you didn't hold them in high regard, this game is still worth trying out due to its stark contrast in tone and structure from its predecessors.[/u][/b] There is a good reason this game is named [u][b]\"the 3rd\"[/b][/u] instead of \"Third Chapter\", because it is definitely not a direct continuation of SC (i.e. Trails in the Sky Second Chapter).\n\nIf you want more of the upbeat, kingdom-trotting adventure of the previous two games, you're not going to find it here.\n\nIf you want towns full of vibrant NPCs, you're not going to find it here (at least not in the main story).\n\nIf you want a protagonist who wears their heart on their sleeves and acts like your typical spunky JRPG hero, you're not going to find it here.\n\nThis game is first and foremost [u][b]a gameplay-heavy dungeon crawler[/b][/u], one that is light on (main) story but carries some very heavy themes. The most interesting aspect of the game to me is that [i][b]the protagonist Kevin Graham is not a hero[/b][/i] (which is ironic considering the name of this series). This game is his harrowing personal journey, one in which he doesn't set out to save the world, his homeland, or anyone for that matter.\n\nThere are initially only two playable characters, but more and more join your party at a steady pace throughout the game [b](16 in total)[/b]. Be sure to talk to these characters when you swap them out of your party; they are ironically the only source of \"NPC dialogue\" for the majority of the game, and their dialogue updates after every plot point like in most other Falcom games. You know Falcom has done their NPCs justice in FC&SC when their complete absence here creates an uneasy sense of isolation.\n\nThere are visual-novel-like sidequests (called Memory Doors) which serve to further flesh out the characters and setting of this series, giving all the playable (and some non-playable) characters their own spotlight to shine in. To this day the cast of Trails in the Sky still remains my favorite cast of any RPG, and I have to give a good chunk of the credit to this game's characterization of them.\n\nThese sidequests take up a sizeable chunk of the game, which one might argue distract from the dungeon-crawling main game. Fortunately, they don't expire like in FC&SC and can be accessed at any point in the game before the final dungeon (with convenient fast-travel to boot), effectively enabling the player to pace the game themselves. \n\nWord of warning though, some of these sidequests take on a much darker tone than one would expect: there's a very good reason why the console versions of this game was censored [i](don't worry, the Steam version isn't)[/i]. Please be mentally prepared for the final sidequest you come across in the game, i.e. [spoiler]Star Door 15[/spoiler].\n\nThere is also plenty of foreshadowing for the rest of the series littered throughout the game, some obvious and some very subtle [i](I'm looking at you Mr. N)[/i]. Needless to say, this game gives you lots to think about if you are into the lore of this series, especially if you have played some of the later Trails games.\n\nOh, and did I mention that the soundtrack is widely regarded as the best in the trilogy?\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nTo end on a more critical note, I'd like to elucidate the \"semi-fandisc\" nature of this game:\n\nThere is severe disconnect between the main story and side content, with the latter adding nothing to the former for the most part; the sidequests are more of an anthology of supplementary material for the entire Trails series and are only tenuously tied to the main campaign, which by itself is sparse in story.\n\nThere is also an egregious amount of asset recycling from the previous two games. Although this is mostly justified within the context of the story, it's still vexing and makes the devs look lazy. They had the opportunity to add a lot of interesting new locales, especially those pertaining to Kevin and the church, but they chose not to for the majority of the game. Get ready to traverse through lots of familiar looking areas and dungeons...\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nP.S. Advice for 1st playthrough: If you are here mostly to enjoy the story, don't play on Hard; if you value your sanity as a gamer, don't play on Nightmare. Seriously, don't.\n\nP.S.2 When you first open up the game, don't skip the \"Falcom\" logo animation; just sit back and watch. There's a bit more after that.\n\nP.S.3 If you're really curious as to which Silent Hill title I was comparing this game to, potential spoilers if you are familiar with the SH franchise: [spoiler]Silent Hill 2[/spoiler]. Just how deep the similarities run between these two games, I'll let you find out for yourself.\n\nP.S.4 A bit more on the censorship of this game: Falcom cut out large chunks of the aforementioned final sidequest when porting the 3rd from PC to the Sony consoles (PSP, PS3, and PSVita). They did this in order to keep the age rating consistent across the Sky trilogy; the PC version of the 3rd would undoubtedly have been rated \"M\" had it gone through ESRB. If you need a list of potentially distressing content in this game, feel free to PM me.\n- The cognitive dissonance in the original Space Quest games between the box cover art telling you that \"Roger Wilco is hapless!\" and the player's necessary mental exertion involved to solve the puzzles, is laid bare the moment you can type in the name you will be called by in the game.\n\nIt's one of the hardest lines to walk when narrative is the main driver of an interactive work:  balancing the player's actions with the personality of the character they are directing in a world that is clearly alive, regardless of the players's presence.\n\nThe Excavation of Hob's Barrow's succeeds in this fully with the denizens and everyday life of the town of Bewlay.\n\nFrom the moment Thomasina Bateman starts recounting the events that led to her writing a letter to her mother, any ambiguity is dispelled: the player is helping Thomasina relive her time in starkly bucolic Bewlay. But as players spend more time within the memories and stories Thomasina shares, the more off putting the narration becomes. It's not just that Thomasina is an unreliable narrator—the implications of the traumatic events that occured at Hob's Barrow are still a puzzle to be worked out. \n\nThis is the strength of the narrative design and writing in Hob's Barrow: as entertainingly crafted as linear story or film, but with eartnest player engagement required to work out what's happening in the very deep shadows of this cursed place.\n\nThe fantastic writing is supported by equally fantastic pixel art, music, and some of the best voice work I've heard in games…ever? The codgers, critters, and countryside all sound fantastic, the bleakness of the moors churning from peaceful to menacing with expert orchestration. Visual direction is solid, too, with sparingly, effectively used pixel portraits and closeups to highlight details both grotesque and filled with character. The dark undercurrent of humour throughout the game also adds some replayability for achievement hunters: some encounters are worth revisiting!\n\nI played this entirely on Steam Deck, mostly curled up in bed at night, but enjoyed the grand finale while docked on my TV. Performance and control was flawless, regardless.\n\nOne of my favorite games released in 2022, and definitely one of my favorite adventure games of all time.\n- Note this is not \"Steampunk Civ\" so don't think of it that way. Its effectively a story/scenario driven city builder. The game looks beautiful and works well with the world building that goes on with the game. \n\nYour games will be short but its still fairly challenging depending on the scenario you choose\n\nDefinitely recommended\n- Shoot first ask questions later, like real life. Maybe pepper spray a pregnant woman.\n- I've always been a little curious what a hero-centric world would look like from the eyes of a bystander. In theory it doesn't sound like a particularly exciting idea but there's a million and a half games where you are that hero, and I've never seen one where you aren't. As of the first chapter, I'm pretty interested in seeing how WP is going to take this story after having seen some adventurers through the eyes of a child that doesn't understand their way of life. \n\nThe story progresses by skipping to noteworthy events in her life as she gets older. She meets new people and is faced with decisions that shape her as a person. I'm not sure how to explain more of the story without getting into spoiling details, so I'll update this if I figure that out.\n\n--\n\nI really enjoyed World's Dawn and I'm very glad to see that he's not getting complacent with that and continuing to improve his skills. Storytelling is an art, and art doesn't improve without practice. I've waited a long time for this game to come out, and so far I'm not disappointed; and I doubt I will be.\n\nAlso, I'm happy to hear that WP's cancer is in remission and that he still wanted to go back to making games once he was feeling better. I hope he continues to produce these relaxing little escape-type games for a long time. Not every game needs a polished combat system and super high budget cg cut scenes to be fun.\n- Stephen's Sausage Roll is a game that the developer doesn't want normal people to buy, it seems. The description is literally, \"A simple 3d puzzle game.\", there is one video that shows you nothing about the game, and it's priced at $32 CND.\n\nFortunately, I'm here to tell you to get off your ass and to buy this wonderful game. The graphics are alright, the music is OK, but the puzzles are sublime.\n\nIn each level, the goal is the same: cook all the sausages and exit the level by standing on the exit level sign in the right orientation. You cook sausages by pushing them over a grill. Like in sokoban games, you can't pull the sausage (yet...), only push it. Another huge wrinkle is that sides of the sausage can only touch the grill once. If you touch a cooked side of a sausage to the grill, it will be burned and you fail the level. This little wrinkle will make you pull your hair out in some levels as you try and figure out how the hell you are going to maneuver the sausages around so they get cooked properly. A neat thing about the game is that if you fail, you can still continue playing the level, which might help you figure out how to play it.\n\nYou'll have a section (part of an island) that has a number of puzzles for you to solve in any order, so if you get stuck, you can try another one (until you get to the last puzzle of the section). Once you complete a section, a new section will open up with more puzzles.\n\nYour little guy has tank controls, which you will find extremely useful, as turning to the left or right near a sausage will push it in different directions. A nice detail is that the all of the puzzles make up the island section. When you activate a puzzle, the rest of the island drops away into the sea, leaving you on a tiny puzzle island.\n\nEach section introduces new mechanics into the game. First you'll just be pushing the sausages, but then you'll be stacking them, skewering them (you would think this would make things easier, but no! You can't turn when you have a skewered sausage!), walking on them...\n\nI would say that these levels are on the level of Snakebird, though I found many of them easier than Snakebird's puzzles (maybe I'm better at sokoban games than I know?). These are the kind of puzzles that you walk away from frustrated, but come back to a few hours later with the solution. This is the game where there are so many ah-ha! moments that make you feel smart. You have no idea what to do at first, but eventually you get better and better. You might not see solutions at first, but you begin to see where you need to go to solve the puzzle, and then work backwards from there. It's wonderful!\n\nIf you're having trouble, there's a community guide that has all the solutions, which is super helpful (though not as much when I was playing because it wasn't complete!).\n\nIt might be expensive, but I took 36 hours to solve all the puzzles and it was worth every penny.\n- TL;DR - 80-90s retro fun. Will prove you wrong if you think FMV games couldn't ever be good. Check out 5 seconds of playthrough if unsure.\nNOTE: Story isn't written in this review as game is reliant on mysterious plot. \n\n　　　For those unfamiliar, FMV stands for full motion video where you are playing a game that is based primarily/largely on the usage of pre-recorded video clips. Though it is no longer a frequented genre in video gaming, during the 90s, FMV games on CDs would often lead me into the darkened halls of many a thrilling Sherlockian mystery adventure. Unfortunately the majority of FMV games were downright awful. Pre-recorded videos with a small quantity of scenes by actual actors caused the a gaming experience to feel boxed in. Astoundingly, Her Story does the exact opposite while still being as classically FMV as FMV games go. It displays FMV like a shield of pride with the added old school touches being tasteful to a tee. As the game is \"turned on\", the screen whirring into action like any early 90s PC would, making the familiar creaking and croaking, players are introduced to their in-game desktop. The thick 90s computer monitor flares a little and in its reflection can be seen the old tube shaped fluorescent lamps that were common fixtures in most public buildings back then, flickering and popping from time to time. It is like playing a game in the past without the annoying performance issues. [spoiler]The glare on screen where you can see a better reflection towards the end made me jump a little here and there. It is fabulous as a \"moodsetter\" like many of the other suppositious yet important details that worked towards the game's impressive little plot.[/spoiler] In addition to the other details, the background music between searches where players are looking at the desktop felt like a good touch and appropriate in terms of guiding players (reacts to clips/progress etc). There is such an abundance of both subsidiary and essential detail in this game that I'd be happy with the mere nostalgia prompting ambiance. It is an added bonus, which isn't too recurrent in indie games these days where there is a deficiency in either style or story, that makes Her Story such a good FMV. It differs because players can feel as if they are in control as every person works towards the ending down a differing path depending on how they decide to investigate which is conducted solely by which searches are brought up how and when. The secret to any game that lacks the variety and freedom of choice by \"genre default\", is to give the player as much control as possible within the walls of that rigid reality. Within the uncomplicated, search - watch - find clues - check Db repertoire, players are given room to stretch and investigate on their own. The mastery is in the details so it is crucial to pay attention. Everything is told methodically and the acting that seems off in places makes much more sense once you piece the evidence and videos together. You are the \"detective\".\n\n　　　This superlative story told through proficient acting by the talented Viva Seifert (also musician/former British gymnast) weaves a surprisingly thick plot into a very lugubrious tale and the eerie horrors of the truth become more evident the more you unveil. The \"wifey killed him\" synopsis we are inclined to linger on in theory is not as discernible in-game as you'd imagine and it'll keep you guessing and alarm you at several progression points. It'll make your thoughts run wild but mostly you'll be wrong with those assumptions until you get the whole picture, as in as close to 100% off the clips as you can. The short clips have a role in that you're piecing together a very large puzzle. The splintered pieces of a total 7 interviews leaving you with 271 videos spanning between mere seconds to a couple of minutes will feel jumbled up so receiving the story in abstruse titbits as such makes you feel like your own little Jessica Fletcher and adds to the anticipation of piecing everything together. If possible I imagine it would be a fun \"couch co-op\" game for an afternoon in with a friend/SO taking notes and guessing the story together (plot contains mature content). \n\n[i]Other interesting things[/i]:\n- Doesn't stop running while you do other things so you can open up your notepad and type there if you'd rather that over pen and paper\n- Search history is helpful. Anti-Glare Filter is a nice touch. Yellow subtitles are very British. \n- The odd title is actually fittingly chosen\n- Database Checker on your desktop screen will display the overall progress you make, creating a timeline for your discoveries so investigation will be smoother\n- Each keyword brings up 5 clips at most (excluding default keyword*). Keep a list of words that stick out in clips and if you get too stuck, use default keyword to bring up whole Db\n\n*[i]Default keyword:[/i] [spoiler]BLANK[/spoiler] Using the default is not optimal. Uncovering new snippets in turn revealing new clues/plots urging you to solve the case yourself is most of the fun.\n\n[b]TIP[/b]: All clips found will have the default keyword in its details. I assigned a number for every new top she wore. Examples: [spoiler]BLANK5, BLANK1 etc..[/spoiler]. An easier method is just deleting the whole keyword for each clip watched, never to return. ;)\n\n　　　Though the sweet yet unnerving finale didn't feel as inspired, the wrap up was still nicely done. People who are new to FMV games may find it harder to get into, but it has a good depth of story to tell for the short game (3-4 hrs) that it is and I recommend it to people who enjoy a good tale. Chances are it's either going to feel like something new and interesting or old school and nostalgic. \n\n[i]Bought game on dev's site: $4.99 (Steam key + DRM free version).[/i]\n- Ib manages to do for me what so few horror games manage to accomplish, and that is to actually give a sense of unease and dread. Without going into spoilers, it's only a few minutes into the game that things start to tread the path of uncomfortable surrealism, with the art growing considerably more disturbing in how Ib interacts with it, and how the art interacts with her.\n\nWith all due respect to more conventional horror titles, say, Dead Space or The Evil Within, Ib maintains a feeling of dread and discomfort. Enemies can be evaded, yes, but there's a feeling of being stalked while trapped in a world you can't possibly fully understand. \n\nContrast Dead Space remake, where soon enough the horror gives way to cutting off an abomination's arm, then using telekinesis to impale it or another horror with said arm, then simply setting fire to the more mobile enemies.\n\nThis is not, I repeat, not to disrespect games in which reducing enemies to a smoldering heap of charred body parts is an acceptable tactic- there is a time and a place for the cathartic destruction of the nightmares that haunted our closets and lurked under our beds. Ib, however, leans firmly towards the horror and self-preservation of being in a hostile and unknown environment, where the only feasible option is to run, hide, and hope whatever nameless horror eventually loses track of you.\n\nAnd let's face it- some modern art galleries are creepy enough already, even in the daylight.\n\n- Got this game on launch, never expecting that I would become addicted looking at a stickman beat the living hell out of other stick figures. A lot of cool Easter eggs to find in the game (funny mini games, cool achievements etc.), great music, incredibly fluent and exciting while only playing with the mouse. Got a few dollars to spare? Snatch up this game and you won’t be disappointed. The only thing I’m disappointed in are my own reflexes, as I’m currently stuck in a few levels that are just way to hard for my taste. But a true ninja never quits trying. \n\nI never played part one, which is a mistake I’ll correct soon as well.\n- I'm 45, I've had good times and bad times.  I've fallen in love, grown up, gotten married, beaten alcoholism, \nhad a child, fought off depression, led my wife through her kidney failure, carried the death of loved ones, and come back from the brink.  I've weathered the storm of life like anyone else . . . I'm not special.  I'm not rich, but comfortable, and I've gathered quite a steam library as a hobby over the last 10 years.  Something I have rarely done, during my time with almost 4000 titles, is write a review.  Two, maybe three for 4000 games.  Think about that for a second.\n\nI'm 45.  I just cried playing a video game, something I can't ever remember doing.  I feel like my heart is going to burst.  It's joy, and sadness.  It's like a good memory with a parent who's long gone, bubbled up at random, making you laugh and ache at the same time.  It's bittersweet.\n\nThe music and visuals are subtle and flashy at the same time, they get under you and lift you up.  It's got spirit of the 60's, the heart of the 80's, and feels like every memorable video game trope from the 2000's, with the social softness of the 2020's.  It's huge and tiny at the same time, and thoughtfull and meditative together . . . it tells the story of leaving your comfort zone, and makes you comfortable.  It's heavy and light.  It's all of these and more.\n\nMy emotions are a flood.  I had to write a review, and let people know how I feel.  I can't describe it, I feel like I found my heart again, and I didn't even know it was lost.  Life was comfortable before 2:00pm today . . . now it's magical.  It's these small things that I forget, and remember, and then forget again . . . the birth of my son, the feeling of nervous sweetness on my first date with my wife, an unexpected comment from a random stranger about my eyes, finding an old photo of my dad that no one ever remembered taking --\n\n-- This game is like that sweet, fleeting memory.\n\nTL;DR:  45-year old man cries after finding his heart lost in a game, and writes a review while his wife asks him if he's okay.\n\n11/10, would purchase these feels again.\n- (UPDATED AS OF 1/1/23 AT BOTTOM)\n\nGame doesn't load. Running steam/EA (Origin)/Fifa23.exe as admins doesn't work. Reinstalling EA Anticheat doesn't work. Allowing everything thru firewall and antivirus (even turning them off) doesn't work. Changing bios to secure boot didn't work. Reinstalling game doesn't work. Any and all combinations of the above does not work.\n\nRequested refund from Steam. I have played maybe 4-6 hours right when it came out before the small update they pushed stopped it being able to load. I tried reverting to that initial version, doesn't work. But because Steam said I played more than 2 hours they won't refund it, even though it doesn't work. They told me to talk to EA. Requested refund from EA. They said to talk to Steam.\n\nGame won't work. EA wont fix it. They steal your money. Filing a report with the Better Business Bureau AND a deceptive practices report with the State's AG office, against BOTH Steam and EA. F them both, thieving C's.\n\n\nUPDATE:\n\nFiled a BBB report on EA. They said they cannot offer resolution such as a refund since I purchased through Steam. When I ask for a refund through Steam they state even though the game no longer works, its past their refund window and they cannot refund. \n\nSo, filing a BBB report on Steam. If that fails to refund, then I am filing a Deceptive Practices report with my State's Attorney General's Office. I'll update further, potential class action lawsuit in the works.\n\nAlso Steam has an F rating on the BBB - I wonder why??\n\n\nUPDATE 2 (1/1/2023);\nFinally got the game to play, here is how (worked for me - may not for others)\n-Uninstall Fifa 23\n-Uninstall EA App\n-Uninstall EA Anticheat in Programs Folder \n-Delete all EA Folders in Programs Folder\n-Close Steam, right click, Properties, Compatibility Tab, Run As Administrator.\n-Used CCleaner to delete all temporary files and clean registry errors\n-Settings, Gaming, Xbox Control Bar, Turn the Slider Off\n-Restart\n-Install Origin App, login, close, set to run as administrator\n-Reinstall Fifa 23 through Steam\n-Set Fifa 23 to run as administrator in the steamapps folder.\n-Set EA Anticheat to run as administrator in both locations: Programs Folder (under EA) AND Programs(x86) Folder under Steam\n-Restart\nOpen Steam, Open Origin, Run Fifa through Steam - WORKED FINALLY\n\nNOTE: I have been running in secure boot mode this whole time, so if you arent set to secure boot, you will also have to set that.\n\nI still dont recommend this game. It took me 4 months to figure out how to run this POS with zero help from EA and Steam. They also dropped the price of this sh!t game to like 25$ after I paid 85$ for early access and couldnt play it for 4 months. Think they'll refund that extra 60$? Fk no. So done with EA, never buying again.\n- It's strange how this will be the first review I ever write for a game. I always thought it would be written for a game like Fallout, Elderscrolls or some huge open world survival horror. And yet it's this little piece of art that has me aching to write something, if only for a minute.\nWhen I had finished this, a few minutes ago, I couldn't believe that they only charge a pittence for it. I thought to myself that if people can charge you 70 euro for games that are poorly executed and badly made from start to finish, then this game should have a much higher pricetag. It wasn't before looking up and seeing that I just finished the first episode in a mere three hours that I understood their reasoning. I feel, however, obliged to tell you all that the three hours spent in this game were worth more to me than the hundreads of hours I've spent in most other games combined. Not because the story was awsome, or the graphics made me gape in awe, but rather that every single aspect of the game in combination managed to grip me and pull me in so that time became temporarily meaningless. Imagine if games held this standard. Imagine if your favorite action, your favorite adventure game or even your favorite driver had this kind of execution. \nYou can tell a good story in a bad way, and you can tell a bad story in a good way. The story in this game might not be the most interesting story you've ever heard, but it's good, and in the execution of it you are drawn in, captured by it, moved by it.\n\nMost adventure games will entertain, they'll give you some ups and downs along the way, but ultimately they will feel like games.\nI've never felt so fulfilled after \"playing a game\" as I did today. Original, beautiful and masterfully executed. I can't wait for the next episode.\n- Graphics of Quake, atmosphere of Blood, brutality of Doom, some weapons of Hexen/Heretic, drunkenness and trashiness of Redneck Rampage, and some weird quirkiness from Half-Life  = GOTY\n- Finished pillars of eternity 1 as a priest of berath, pledging my soul to the god of cycles, life and death. Promising to release the thousands of captured souls back to the wheel of reincarnation at the end of the game.\n\nStarted pillars of eternity 2, only to find out I was murdered after the events of the first game by a god who was believed to have been slain during the saints war. \n\nMy soul then comes face to face with the god I have devoted my life to, the god of life, death, and reincarnation.\n\nAfter a brief discussion about how I kept my promise at the end of the first game, my favoured god revealed to me he wants me to come back to life and serve him once again, and slay the being that killed me.\n\nI refused. It is only right that my soul is allowed to be reborn and return to the cycle, as I have worshipped this diety my whole life.\n\nMy god agreed. I was reborn as a wolf and the credits of Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire started to roll.\n\nPretty short game but 10/10\n- Zor strikes again, but agent phoenix is there to stop him! Another great VR puzzle game from Schell, with lot of jokes, hidden stuff and extra challenges for replayability. Took me 4h to finish base game, now time for achievements hunt!\n- Disclaimer: This is review from player who prefer story-rich game and haven't played any game by Arkhouse Telegraph.\n\nThe good:\n+ Outstanding 80's-esque visual pixel artstyle. It reminds me of few SNES/Atari/Gameboy games.\n+ Fairly good soundtrack.\n+ Some cutscene/area have fascinating atmosphere.\n+ Run well with Steam proton, so it's likely this game is playable for Linux/Steam Deck user. Although the platformer area might show too many small detail for 7\" display.\n+ Game OST/artbook is available for free on Arkhouse website.\n\nThe bad:\n- While i understand nature of this game require player to find out most thing and go through trial-and-error, some parts definitely need to be explained better. I refer to lack of autosave (for most part of the game), not letting player know about manual save (you can do it by head left after exit for cylinder elevator until you see display/sign \"< S\" and suggestion to visit block H (where you get some guidance).\n- While the manual say i can play R. U. N. E. 3000 first, i have hard time understanding the story and lore/world building. Conversation such as \"DO? DORODO!\" is mostly gibberish and i only can make vague guess based on few specific term (\"V2\", \"50/50\", etc.) and area i've visited. Short recap of previous games (even it's on the manual) could be really helpful for newcomers.\n\nThe ugly:\n* I experience a bug where i fight boss i'm not supposed to fight yet. In detail, [spoiler] after i exit from P block to get symbol cracking code, i was thrown to G block where i fight G-Cat/10th boss. The worst part is the boss HP bar started with red color and auto 3-60 cannon never perform attack. Fortunately the bug doesn't occur again after i load from manual save.  [/spoiler].\n* The gameplay variation/idea is very interesting, but the execution is mixed bags (more explanation on below paragraph)\n\nSaturn Quest: R. U. N. E. 3000 has lots of gameplay variant/modes (Adventure, Shoot'em up, Platformer and many more) to keep the game fresh. While each area/boss have different reason why it's challenging/difficult, many of those is very unbalanced. For example, [spoiler] Bioplatus M-3D/6th boss [/spoiler] require you to have extraordinary eye-hand coordination and multitasking skill. Among all enemy that resemble boss fight, i only managed to beat 6-7 boss without using cheat.\n\nThis game also has very few checkpoint on each area/boss. On adventure/platformer area, you could restart from beginning after spending 10-20 minutes where you have to avoid same trap or collect same item again. On boss fight, that means you'll need to repeat whole fight most of the time. It's could be annoying because since you're forced to find out boss behavior the hard way or repeating tedious part of the fight.\n\n3 HP and lack of difficulty option could be irritating for most modern player. There are time when i found out i only lose 3-10 HP when i use cheat and beat the boss. If there's easier difficulty where i have 6-10 HP, i could beat more boss by myself. But don't get me wrong, i feel really satisfied each time i beat boss (which i deemed can be beaten with practical amount of effort) without cheat. If the developer bother add easy difficulty which has higher player HP, give more Nana and slightly lower boss HP, far more people could enjoy this unique piece of artwork.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nWhile i have some rant, it's really unique experience even though i've played few hundred games. In overall, i have more positive sentiment than negative sentiment of this game. But even though i choose \"Yes\" when Steam ask \"Do you recommend this game?\", i'd rather choose \"Neutral\" or \"Information\" instead. If you're fan of 80's game or really like difficult game, you might come to like this game. But for most people, i'd recommend you to seek other game. Although if you really insist to play this game, you could use Cheat Engine and modify HP/Nana using value type Double (also called float64 or 8-byte float).\n\nP.S. I definitely will play the sequel (Episode IV-VI: White Meteor Saga according to the artbook) [b]IF[/b] the developer bother add easy difficulty option and more checkpoint during boss fight/exploration.\n- As a fan of Mimimi's Stealth Strategy Game,\nI love it so much, the operation system is getting smoother and more user-friendly comparing to Desperados III & Shadow Tactics.\nAlso I like how they added new elements to the game to make it more playable (E.g. Flexible team choice, character stories)\n\nThe only thing I don't like is the art.\nGame design is good but it'd be great if there's good looking characters...\n- Overall the concept and idea of the game is good and I would recommend it. It is worth the price for the amount of fun time you can have with it.\n\nPositives:\n+ Initially the game gives you some good frights and tension\n+ Variety of characters, ethnics and aesthetics to pick and chose from\n+ Variety of skills and abilities that are mostly unique and some have good synergy\n+ Variety of maps\n+ DLC costs are fair\n+ Skin costs are fair\n+ One of very few companies who communicates with the community\n+ A lot of good license characters available\n+ The game has a tutorial that explains the basics\n+ Various ways to play the game (stealth / agressive)\n\nNegatives:\n- A few bugs here and there\n- Some really annoying perks / addons on killers / survivors like 1 shot long range axes (to name an example), keys and moris (to name a few more)\n- Toxic community - Not everyone is toxic but a large portion of players are but lets be real you get that in every game these days\n- Matchmaking is pretty bad (but DBD is trying to fix this)\n- Sometimes unfair hit detection - Some hits look like you are being smacked way out of range or as a killer you see the grab animation on a survivor and then it just cancels out\n- Steep learning curve / unforgiving gameplay. You either have to learn and improve and adapt and overcome or you will be having a bad time as you climb ranks.\n- I bought this game in order to review it, seeing as there were no current reviews for it. \nI thought I'd help the game out by maybe giving it that tiny bit of publicity it needed to get off the ground.\nIn doing so I have failed. As this game isn't worth reviewing, there is nothing to review. Well, I should say there is stuff to review but I feel as though the dev's didn't even attempt to make this a game that anyone would enjoy. Well actually I'll let them off of the target of \"enjoy\", I'd go further to say it doesn't even feel like they tried to make a game that someone who had nothing to do and was bored out of their mind would say maybe I'll play this for a bit\nI jumped straight in, ignored the help in menu and started playing. It took me at least 4-5 mins before I even had the slightest concept of what was going on and what I had to achieve. Once I did get the hang of it I still thought \"I must be missing something, I'm not really doing anything\" so I ventured to the help menu to find that nope, thats it buddy.\nThe controls are lacking, the soundtrack and the sound effects (which happen to be a melody playing) do not blend at all, (they play completely out of time on top of the soundtrack).\nYou can buy it and prove me wrong, go ahead. This is just my opinion.\n- I was excited to play this after playing Persona 5 and Persona 5 Royal (my introductions to the series) to death.  This game was raved about and I thought, if it's more of the same then this should be great...\n\nThe major problem I have with this game is that it's so painfully obvious that it's a game made 13 years ago.  It's not a bad game, the look and feel of the Persona series is there and the characters are interesting etc.  But at the same time whenever I played this game, I just wanted to go back and play P5R instead.  Everything is just better in P5R.  The dungeons for example, the difference is night and day.  P5R's dungeons have so much more life to them, and look so much better.  Most of the environments in this game look like dull coloured LEGO sets put together.  It looks like it was originally on a handheld console (despite the remaster).  The other major example is the voice acting.  My god, some of the voice acting in 4G is on par with some of the worst Square Enix efforts.  Audio balancing is terrible as well.  And then there's the subjective stuff.  I personally much prefer P5R's soundtrack over this one, aside from maybe a couple of songs that were cool.  The setting of Tokyo is much more interesting and dynamic than this hokey town in the middle of nowhere.  The characters themselves I found much more engaging in 5R.  This was particularly helped by the quality of voice acting.  I think \n\nI'm glad that people are able to experience this game again on a more available platform.  I think potentially if I had played this back when it was released, I would probably have a different opinion of this game.  If you like Persona games and can look beyond what's dated badly, then the core game is very much the same.  If you were a fan already, this is a quality refresh to the game.  However, if you're like me and experienced the future of this series before playing this, I dont recommend it.  P5R provides the same gameplay but adds so much more.  It's a shame we cannot get that game on Steam instead.\n- 69 % of your time you spend walking around the forest, \nblowing in the animal whistle without actually seeing any animals\n\n10 % of your time you spend carefully approaching the animals you have spotted in the far far away distance\n\n1 % of your time you spend aiming, fireing your gun and missing all the significant organs of the animals\n\nThe last 20 % of your time you spend running after the animals you have wounded without ever seeing them again\n\nMost realistic hunting experience ever\n- This game was a real treat. I played the 1st Valfaris and became an instant fan. I love that this is direction went by the developers, I feel it was a really good evolution of the series and mixing it up with a shoot em up gives it that extra punch/kick/slash. The graphics, characters and bosses are just so awesome and you can feel the grittiness of the mechs. Aside from the awesome game play, the environments and atmosphere has really leveled up. Love the boss destruction sequence as you can feel that accomplishment of kicking its ass. looking forward to Valfaris next installment. Congratulations with this metal AF game!\n- Think you’re good at racing? Well, this game will give you a RKO.\n\nI don’t even know much about rally when I bought the game. I just see cars driving at dirt, weaving steering left and right constantly, and thought it looks cool. \n\nThis game is HARD. The learning curve is really steep. The first time I played, I constantly fly off a cliff and hug into trees. Because i don’t understand what my co driver is reading. He talk so fast that my tiny brain couldn’t process in time, sometimes I’m so confused that I go straight in junction because I can’t remember he said turn left or right. The cars are constantly out of control. \n\nAfter I learned about weight transfers that I’m able to start utilizing oversteer into corners. No more cripple into finish line with two tyres missing, that’s when the fun begins. Dirt Rally 2.0 is different from other racing games. You don’t race against other drivers, instead you race against time. If you turn off the hud, then it’s only you and the road, and TREES :)\n\nThe sound of the gravel hitting under your car. Dirt stained on your car as you progress through out the stage. The pops and bang coming out of exhaust when you shift. These combination feels somehow relaxing and satisfying at the same time.\n\nThe only downside of Dirt Rally 2.0 is that it requires constant internet connection, even when most of its content are single player. I wouldn’t complain if the server is stable. But sadly it isn’t. The server down happen quite frequently. Imagine you feel like you completed a 10 minutes perfect run, no crashes or mistakes. But then the game refuses to connect to the server. So the game won’t record your progress. It’s like a big middle finger to the player. \n\nI could make this review a thumbs down solely for the “always online” requirement, cuz it makes the player experience kinda inconsistent, but the gameplay itself does make up for it though. I mean when it works, it works remarkably well.\n\nApart from always online issue. Dirt Rally 2.0 is fantastic, the handling, physics, graphics etc. everything is on point. If you’re interested, buy the GOTY edition, it easily double the contents of the original game had. Worth every single cents.\n- If you played Counter-strike for Half-life 1. You'll surely like this, because, it has great graphics, gameplay, brings back memories, and plus you won't have to worry about forgetting to get ammo from the shop, because, the shop does all the ammo shopping for you. And it's cheap. If you want to play with me on this game, send me an invite, and maybe I'll play. That's it for my recommendation, have fun fragging. Oh and please don't be a jerk and listen to one of your commanders, because, not cooperating can get you killed in the first place. Sheesh.\n- Katana ZERO? More like, Katana ZERO CONCLUSION.\n\nI had too high expectation on this game, I thought it was going to be Hotline Miami but better.\nIn the end I still prefer Hotline Miami, specifically Hotline Miami 2.\n\nOne thing I dislike is the lack of combo scoring system. \nIt's a good way to make the players act fast and execute their actions flawlessly, instead the game only has a timer bar that never runs out as a way to motivate the player to go fast.\n\nI am aware how \"pointless\" game scores are.\nBut seeing a number going up feels good.\n\nWhat happens when you kill an enemy in Hotline Miami?\n - You get to see a number pops out, and the score goes up indicating that you are doing good!\n - Satisfying bloody hit sound.\n - Throbbing light on the edge of the map.\n - Randomized dead sprite of the enemy, sometimes they get dismembered depending on the weapon.\n\nIn Katana ZERO you'd get :\n - A \"fwoob\" sound.\n - A same dying animation of the enemy getting knocked and bleed to death. Instead of getting decapitated or something.\n - Flashy slash effect.\n\nAt one point I wondered on why should I even bother killing the enemies when it didn't reward me with anything in the room with a minecart. \nWhen having the enemy being killed by the minecart or the player makes no difference.\n\n[spoiler]More like Katana ZERO REWARD. I think this is it, exactly why I am disappointed by it. Imagine playing soulsbornekiro or Hollow Knight without earning any kind of currency??? Killing the enemies would feel pointless.[/spoiler]\n\nIt's basically way more fun and rewarding to kill an enemy in Hotline Miami than Katana ZERO.\n\nThen there are other stuff like...\nUnfun stealth gameplay. \nRollspamming without consequence.\nBeing able to endlessly doing a mid air attack without having to touch the ground first.\n\nThere are also waaaay too many checkpoints in my opinion, it encouraged me to just brute force everything with roll spamming without having to worry about starting over.\nThe rooms could've been a bit bigger and longer. But also less room, quality over quantity.\n\nAnd finally, the story.\nI was intrigued by it but it just ended abruptly with a \"To be continued\".\nIt's like they only wrote 50% of it then slapped a \"To be continued\" and called it a day.\nThe game seems to rely heavily on \"mentioning stuff off screen that player will never get to see\" to tease the player.\nI already knew that the game is going to be short, but I didn't expect it to be this disappointing. \n\nIt's not a bad game, I just had the wrong expectation.\n\nI might change it to positive if I was satisfied by the DLC.\nOr maybe after beating the hard mode, I heard it's more fun.\n- An amazingly fun and short adventure from the creator of Rakuen. Mr. Saitou is a game based in the same universe as Rakuen, but follows the story a salaryman, Mr. Saitou. Mr. Saitou takes you on a journey that explores some serious undertones, but approaches the subjects with incredible sensitivity, respect and some very light and silly humor. There's tons of flavor text to be discovered, pop culture references to be recognized and if you've played Rakuen, familiar characters to meet. As you make your way through the story, there are lots of puzzles that are simplistic, but well thought out in a way that adds to the story.The game is made to be played in 1 sitting that may vary depending on how much you interact with the world. This game can also be played by many ages and is family friendly. You DO NOT have to play Rakuen first to enjoy this game or understand it, but it will definitely add a depth of sentimentality to the game, as there are some call backs. I would absolutely recommend this game to anyone and you may find yourself learning something about your own life during Mr. Saitou's journey.Have a long day!\n- If you like management type games and RPGs, this is the perfect mix. It's just enough management to allow you to thrive with mostly strategy without feeling bogged down, and just enough RPG elements to get you invested in not just your squad, but each individual character in it. \n\nHere's a tale from my experience with the game;\n\nThis is the kind of game to change your entire perspective on life itself. Failure is not the end, nor the beginning, but a constant in this world that you can either let destroy you or make you stronger. Allow me to tell you a story. The story of New Battlehill. \nNear the Shek city of Squin, not far east, was a small town. It went through many names. The first that stuck was Firstyeet, totally not a placeholder. It wasn't an notable settlement, merely consisting of a shack, an iron processor, and some walls to mildly inconvenience the roving gangs of Dust Bandits that liked to bully the residents. After being evicted from their own city once again, the residents, Denver, Soto, Ruka, and Meow, vowed to take back their home. After training and buying the best weapons and armor they could, they made their way back to Firstyeet. To their surprise, however, they would not have to fight. One of the bandits had picked a fight with a herd of goats. The bandits' defense failed against the caprine assault. From this, the town would get its second name - Densorumego. Den for Denver. So for Soto. Ru for Ruka. Me for Meow. And Go for the true heroes, the goats.\nPeace would not last long but soon the residents of Densorumego would become strengthened by their constant fighting. On the elevated, somewhat round land on which Densorumego sat, there were many large fights involving a lot of people. If only there was some sort of name to reflect this... \nAnd from that, the town was renamed for the last time, to Battlehill.\nThings were looking up. The town built its first farms and expanded to be almost four times its original size. But this peace would not last. Battlehill's new ambitions of self sufficiency would attract the attention of a new foe - The Shek Kingdom.\nThe Shek claimed ownership of the land Battlehill was on, and as such, demanded all food grown there be given to them. Confident from their many victories against the Dust Bandits, the Battlehillites refused the Shek demands. Their risk was calculated... but man were they bad at math.\nAll but one were nearly killed in the ensuing battle, and the one person that wasn't knocked into a coma was stuck on the wall because part of the wall was destroyed and he could no longer reach the stairs because of that. The people knew they couldn't fight the Shek, but they would not allow themselves to be subservient either. And so began their malicious compliance. The Shek would get all the food in Battlehill, as it would be none - The Battlehillites were moving.\nI could write entire books about their journey around the west. The Fogmen, the ruins, the Screeching Bandits, there's many a tale. But, eventually, the people would find a new home. In the harsh and Beak Thing infested land of Vain, homeland of the Western Hive, they would found their new home - New Battlehill.\nJump to now, the city is thriving, they have more bread than they know what to do with, they've grown strong from defending their home from the Beak Things, and their population has grown. They are currently planning a reconquest of Battlehill, which was occupied by Dust Bandits shortly after they left.\n\nThere is a part I left out, between Firstyeet and Densorumego - I had repeatedly failed to retake Firstyeet, and I was about to quit the game. I was frustrated that I'd gone and bought the best arms and armor and still failed. And when I tried to set up a training ground on a mountain near Squin, bandits again came and defeated me. I went as far as to try and get a refund, which was denied. That refund being denied was the best thing that could've happened. I decided to give the game another try, and to try accepting my failures and growing from them. And if I hadn't done that, I would never have founded New Battlehill. None of the legend worthy tales my squad has been through would have happened. And I'd never have had the fun of going through all of them.\n\nIn short, get this game. It is just great.\n- This piece of art right here?\n\nGame of the year for someone like me who loves platformers, a great soundtrack, and is a big fan of Metroidvania style games? Oh yeah.\n\nGame of the year for everyone else? Maybe!\n\nLet me tell you some things about this game:\n+Offers a lengthy adventure (I completed 100% in 28 hours and there is still more I could do if I wish)\n+The combat is so tight! Not only are the mechanics themselves simple and crisp but they are also super deep with things like charms which you can equip to give certain abilities and other classic staples in these types of games like a dash / double jump / wall jump\n+The controls are very fine tuned and it always feels like it was my fault if I died and not simply poor game design\n+The bosses are sick AF and they all have really cool moves / patterns / styles to them\n+The game manages to never feel linear at all, it has no direct markers telling you where to go it simply throws you into the world (Hallownest it is called) and leaves the exploring up to you\n+The Soundtrack is bomb. These indie company hits lately always offer a memorable and groovy soundtrack and this game is no different. It offers a few solid themes for many of the fight scenes as well as beautiful atmospheric soundtracks which fit the areas so nicely\n+Oh and did I mention the game looks beautiful? Go check images of this game right now like the area \"The City of Tears\" and just marvel at the amount of detail put into the scenery. For a game this big the art style and attention to detail is truly impressive\n\nMy real only problem with this game is not even so much a problem at all as it is a warning: to those of you out there on the more casual end who may struggle with difficulty in this genre you have been warned! While the game is mostly pretty forgiving with save points in most general areas I will say some of the combat gets pretty tough. For someone like me I enjoyed it thoroughly as I felt the difficulty was just the right amount and it never felt cheap or unfair.\n\nFot those out there who aren't as into these type of games as much I feel Hollow Knight is a great game to start you into the genre. The price is very reasonable, and it seems the devs are going to continue adding more content which is hype. Give it a try, You won't be dissapointed!\n- Great game! At times it can get frustrating (boss battles), but the good out weighs the bad by a landslide. Even when i did get mad, which was a lot, I never stayed mad for long. There is just far too much to enjoy about the game. The art style is just simply amazing, the movement of your character around the world is just so satisfying once you get used to it, the puzzles aren't too easy or too hard, and everything in the game just goes together pretty much perfectly. All in all this game is extremely well made. Would recommend buying if you want a super unique experience 11/10\n- A Short Hike is a relaxing, casual game about exploring an expansive, mountainous island park and eventually making your way to its summit so you can get cell phone reception.\n\nYou play as Claire, a bird who can climb, glide, and flap to great heights using a stamina system based upon how many golden and silver feathers you’ve collected. Along the path to the mountaintop you’ll encounter Animal Crossing-style characters who are friendly, punny, and usually have some minor task for you to solve, ranging from finding lost items to making deliveries.\n\nHelping residents of the island is completely optional, as is just about every activity in the game other than locating a few feathers and reaching the summit; as a result, length can range from an hour if you don’t stop to smell the roses to a few hours if you decide to make friends with everyone and see all the park has to offer.\n\nActivities include filling out a fishing journal by trading in your catches, digging in suspicious spots, solving treasure map clues, parkour racing, and opening up shortcuts by breaking blocked entrances and watering bouncy flowers. \n\nA Short Hike has a charming aesthetic and a lovely, peaceful soundtrack. I felt driven to see everything the game had to offer despite not being forced into any of it and never lost interest until I did so. It’s a beautiful little world that will make fans of Animal Crossing feel right at home.\n- THERE IS ONLINE CO-OP with REMOTE PLAY!  Im not sure why that guy put misinformation in the beginning of his review.\n\nIf you have 3 friends, only one of you needs to buy this and invite them through remote play and you will have a BLAST. First session we played 3 hours straight and laughed so hard we gave ourselves a headache.\n\nAlot of love went into making this game and a lot of hidden easter eggs nodding to other games. If you need something to play with your group of friends during quarantine, this is the game!\n- I played all I needed to realise this game has no intuition, no fun, no useful or interesting mechanics. It's deadass a flash game but somehow is less stable.\n\nConstant crashes and forced 480p fullscreen. \n\n0.5/10\n- After the past few years of broken, buggy AAA games I've started to lose the passion I once had for the industry. This masterpiece came out of no where and completely reignited my love for gaming. PLEASE do not sleep on this game, it's such a breath of fresh air from the garbage you'd normally expect from modern day companies. Definitely taking a spot in my top 5 favorites and I haven't even scratched the surface of the game yet, it's just that good. Beautiful art style, crisp animations, a unique concept, FUN gameplay, its everything I've been wanting and more. Kudos to the devs for making this absolute banger <3\n- So, I've been playing games for 36 year now. All the genres, like them all. Most of all RPG, turn based strategies, WW2 shooters (BF) etc. And just achieved victory in Slay the spire, after 206 hours of hugely enjoyable play. I would say this is in top 5 games of all times for me. Maybe even top 2, together with Card Hunter. Those two games are so far the two games I would take to a deserted island. I am actually seriously considering making my own card based game in the future. So just try this. Even my 10 year old son loves it. I just recorded The Slaying for him xD\n- This piece of art right here?\n\nGame of the year for someone like me who loves platformers, a great soundtrack, and is a big fan of Metroidvania style games?

Give it a try, You won't be dissapointed!\n- As someone who is as obsessed with Sentai/Tokesatsu/KamenRider/PowerRangers as he is with Megaman/RetroActionPlatformers, I would like to tell Domesticated Ant Games:\n\nThank you for developing this masterpiece. I know you didn't make it just for me, but it sure as hell felt like it.\n- Do yourself a favor.  Go in as blind as possible.  Don't look at any guides.  The system of getting pages of the manual that you can't fully understand is a stroke of genius.\n\nAlso I haven't found a waterfall that *doesn't* have a secret behind it.\n\n**EDIT: Finished the game**\n\nI'll admit for many of the later \"post-game puzzles\" I looked at a guide for.  The in game language is very difficult to decipher blindly, and if you're not familiar with English you probably shouldn't even bother.  \n\nThe surprising thing about this game is you can pretty much do any puzzle at any given time once you get one or two specific items, but because of how the manual is handled, you'll never know how until you see the pages (or experiment a lot)\n\nI think the most amount of tries I've spent on a boss fight was 7-8, but nothing is stopping you from exploring more and finding stat boosts.\n- Dear Dev, \nI love this game, if you're reading reviews, please consider some ideas to make it better:\n-  Level designing: Add more ways to choose, and different endings. Right now SoR4 is flat from A to B, it made me feel down compare to SoR3.\n- Alternate customs, and playable same characters: Floyd is overrated and all my friends want to pick him. Make a game with 4 Floyds running sound fun. Use lifetime score to unlock customs.\n- 2v2 Battle! WHY NOT?\n- Shiva (new), Max (new), Roo, Estel (Badass Woman Cop)\n- Steam trading cards: I know it's not importance, but who doesnt want some badass backgrounds on steam profile?\n- getting better in controls, HUD, and resources management balances, unlike Rise TR\nslight improvement in graphics, OST is good though\nseveral 'cool' scenes, creativity has taken a great leap <applause>\ncross over with Assassin's Creed (due to same publisher?)\nLara is getting more and more 'demonic', no hard feelings, its just subliminary messages to the youth by major games coorporation\nI can't believe i can play as Lara Kid instead of Lara Croft :D '+1'\nstoryline is getting ridiculous, come back to earth bruh LOL its good fun\n\ngood luck on your future endeavour devs :)\n- [h1][u]Wonderful game with a great battle system, but terrible netcode[/u][/h1]\n\n[h2]Foreword[/h2]\nI got to know \"Naraka: Bladepoint\" through a friend.\nAt first I was very skeptical, so I only bought the Standard Edition, and later the Ultimate and Deluxe Editions.\nFirst of all, this game has a steep learning curve with its battles.\nExactly why the game may not be suitable for everyone.\nUnfortunately, that doesn't make the playerbase any better, but read more about that below.\nNevertheless, the game and especially the combat system offers a lot of potential and has a lot of posivites to offer.\n\n[h2]Positives[/h2]\n[list]\n[*]Regular updates with ever increasing content\n[*]Few to almost no bugs and if they are, then they are fixed very quickly\n[*]Steep learning curve - Especially at the beginning the game is not easy, but you can quickly get into it with friends\n[*]Pleasant graphics\n[*]Nice sound design, which is location dependent\n[*]Potential to grind for higher ranks and for the Hall of Fame\n[*]Different game modes and events\n[*]Extremely extensive combat system - many possibilities to conter weapons\n[*]Extensive stats, either ingame or with Naraka+ mobile app (app is absolutely top!)\n[*]Well thought through character designs\n[*]Extremely individual character editor - From Thanos to Bruce Lee everything is customizable.\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Neutral[/h2]\n[list]\n[*]Climbing system - It's really good compared to other games. However, you still sometimes get stuck on edges or can't get to the platforms above.\n[*]Microtransactions - I'm personally not a fan of them, but it's not a must in this game and doesn't favor anyone.\n[*]Answers of Discord team members very questionable on some questions\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Negatives[/h2]\n[list]\n[*]Terrible netcode - players with highpings are treated preferentially\n[*]Few European players - Extremely many VPN players with many different Asian characters and languages in the voicechat\n[*]Voicechat is not well thought through\n[*]Partial performance losses\n[*]Ranking matches are partly wrong - Either with new players (Bronze) or experienced players (Asura)\n[*]Partially bad English, as well as German translation\n[*]Some abilities are combined absolutely disgusting and unfortunately more or less meta\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Review written out[/h2]\nNaraka has become a real love-hate relationship game for me.\nI love the extensive combat system and also the steep learning curve from noob to a slightly experienced player. (I am Platinum 1 - Solar 5 at the time of this review).\nSo while the combat system could be frustrating at times at first, I love it all the more now.\nOnly the climbing system, as well as some combinations of abilities or ultimates could be revised.\nFor example, it is common practice (meta) that many players use Ultimates that stun and ensure that you immediately get into the next Ultimate.\nThis is sometimes a bit frustrating, because these combinations are played very often and other heroes, especially the new ones, are not really played because of it. \nHowever, you can work around these combinations or counter them yourself. Unfortunately, this is not always easy, especially for new players.\n(For example, the combination of Valda - Viper - Tianhai).\nHowever, a victory and the killing of opponents, especially higher ones, with whom you are unfortunately sometimes matched, releases a lot of endorphins in Naraka, so that a victory feels extremely rewarding.\n\nUnfortunately, this brings me to the part that makes it extremely difficult for me to decide on a positive rating for this game.\nThe game, for being released in 2021, has a horrible netcode for a martial arts battle royale game.\nThere are extremely many Asian players who connect directly or via VPN to the europian servers.\nThis is especially noticeable when you activate the voice chat, which by the way, has no individual regulation for volume or a mute function per player.\nUnfortunately, those players have a ping beyond 150ms.\nSadly, this is a big problem for people with low latency.\nYou partly punch through enemies bodies.\nVarious focus attacks are therefore not always blockable or the opponent lags at you, while the player for himself has no lags at all.\nThis is not only unfair, but should actually no longer be a problem in 2022.\nFor example, it would be enough to not let players with a ping greater than 150ms/200ms move.\nAccording to the Discord community manager, there is a region lock and most of the names are just \"memes\" . \nBut you don't notice anything about the region lock in the game and we can theoretically connect to other servers.\n\nAnother big problem is the matchmaking.\nEven with Bronze or Silver, you are matched with Asura players when there is a lack of players.\nThis is not necessarily nice, but you get a lot of points for survival and you also learn a lot of techniques.\n\nAs negative as this all sounds, the game still gets a positive rating from me.\nI love the sound design, which comes into its proper place in the battles and is different for each location on the map.\nThis reminds me of Prince of Persia in some areas and provides more excitement in fights.\nIn addition, the varied battles, no matter how hopeless they sometimes seem, are all the more rewarding if you win.\nEspecially when you're killing another team, consisting of 3 people, as the last survivor of your team.\nThe map design is also absolutely great. Every location has been carefully thought through. \nGreat lighting design really highlights some of the locations.\nYou can overlook small bugs like misplaced branches (a branch hangs in the air next to a tree).\n\nBut my favorite part is the grinding to a higher rank. \nThe ranking system and especially the Hall of Fame encourage you to play.\nGetting into the top 100 of a much-played character feels very rewarding.\nSo does slaying a moonbane.\n\n[h2]Epilogue[/h2]\nAll in all, despite the flaws, Naraka has a lot going for it, and even though the larger issues can be extremely frustrating, the game saves itself with the extensive battle system, the incredibly great locations including sound design, and the extensive ranking system including Hall of Fame.\nI love the game because of the thoughtful little things, even if I hate it extremely at times.\n\nEven though the game can quickly become frustrating for new players, you should be aware that it has a lot to offer if you are willing to learn.\nThe accompanying app is an extremely well thought through and great gimmick in this regard.\n\nI would be happy to take you by the hand and introduce you to the game.\nJust visit us on our [URL=https://discord.nox-eagles.de]Discord[/URL].\n\nI would like to thank all of you who have read my review until the end.\nI'm looking forward to your opinions :)\nWith best regards\nYour Holt\n- Fall Guys had a rough start. Unstable servers and people cheating to win. About a year later I picked it up again and I must say it really has improved a lot. I honestly don't have any issues which cheaters anymore and the servers don't crash on me anymore.\n\nIt's also getting more and more stages to play so it feels refreshing to play a few rounds every day.  The events for certain skins are also really fun. Sure there could still be some improvements like personal usernames or maybe a way to trade in skins you don't want. But I feel like they listen to their community and are aiming to make it as fun as possible. I'm interested to see how Fall Guys will keep evolving!\n- Started strong, ended annoyingly.\n\nMoral of the story? People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.\n\nIt paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that \"routine\" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.\n\nI liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters. But it all fell apart and tries to teach a very vapid moral that someone in their early 20's who has never had a meaningful relationship would idealize.\n\nAt least it was short.\n\n- This game's constant revealing of stranger and even stranger esoteric strangeness with every case, the way hitting start you are slammed in the gob by an unexpectedly gnarly tableau, a sinister mise-en-scene with a man burning to death on fire or blasted apart by a canon while wry cultists in various states of masked and undmaskedness make slight comments to say How deserving they were to be killed by us in just that way, oh yes!\n\nAhhhh! That is all about what I love The Case of the Golden Idol for.\n\nIt is 13 deduction puzzles (including the DLC) for you and perhaps a friend on the couch wherein you will become acquainted with a decades long revenge tragedy that tore several families and several kingdoms apart as many people lost there lives in heinous and sometimes magical ways. As you move along the story and investigations grow more complex, which could be a bit fatiguing, especially by the end of the DLC. Though everything here is great, don't mishear me. The art is disgusting. It's visuals and music complete the necessary deranged curious mood to undergird the transmutating tone of a murder-filled horror story into one that equally unnerving as it is subtly hilarious.\n\nThis is a game made by some Latvians from Latvia, and maybe, buster, you should just pay them some money and attention.\n- One of the better RPG maker games i've seen and played, especially considering it was made on RPG Maker 2003. The beginning of the game was great and felt like there was a ton of potential, but a lot of the overworld mechanics were underutilized (jumping, swimming, orb flying). The writing was alright in the beginning, but started to turn into a bad fanfic in the middle/end of the game. The ending was... wholly unsatisfying and abrupt. It made very little sense, and did absolutely nothing to answer any questions asked at any point in the game, rather asking brand new questions and providing no resolution for any of the characters. You'll get about 10-14 hours of this game, which is kind of amazing for an RPG maker game, but honestly, steam has SOOOO many better titles available in this price range that unless you're into RPG maker, you should go elsewhere.\n- My profile pic is the reaction i have towards the game devs that made this game.\nVisually disgusting, gameplay wise impossible and over all terrible.\nWhile it's possible to beat it and get all the achievements it's difficult and also the space level is actually visual aids it's so disgusting to look at that you can't even focus on the gameplay.\nNot worth it even for free which is how i probably got it i can't remember and i don't want to...\n- ghrrrrrrrrrrrrrr... *shapeshifts into six pack sweaty wolf grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrolw  grrrrrrrrrrOOF rwooof woof *barks seductivley in public park brhhhhhhrrrrrrrrrrr *foaming at the mouth ahsdf nrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrauoooooooooooo \n- Tentative review of game in progress, but so far it is amazing and I had to leave a review in support of it.  As far as the game itself goes, I'm giving it a 9/10.  As far as the port goes, the lack of keyboard input prompts seems frustrating when they already have the ability to change between xbox and ps4 buttons, but I use a controller and expect most will for this, but it's worth mentioning in the sake of fairness and accuracy.  There is a certain graphics setting called \"effects\" with high and low.  High is causing major fps drops under certain conditions even on a pc with an rtx 3080 and a 5800x cpu.  Devs have acknowledged it and are working on improving it.  Other than these issues though, no problems at all.  Online play has been smooth and i haven't experienced any disconnects.  The game itself has only crashed once in 93 hours, but that was also during excessive alt tabbing while the game was in true fullscreen mode, and it crashed on an alt-tab itself, so I'm not really blaming the game on that one given it was the only time.  Again, overall the game is playing great and I have no problems with it on a functional level as well as an entertainment level, I just want to be as fair and accurate as I can, and these were really the only problems I could find with it.\n- A simple but detailed explanation of why, after having played both versions, I prefer Definitive Edition (DE) instead of 2013 Edition:\n\n-2013 Edition's farms don't automatically re-seed, forcing you to either order your villagers to re-seed them, or to mash the \"queue re-seed\" button in the mill. In DE, you can set the mills to automatically re-seed.\n-Definitive Edition lets you shift-click construction orders just like in 2013 Edition, but in the latter, the villager will move to build the last building you placed down. If you order several buildings, they will stop constructing the building they're already working on to go build the new one. In DE they will wait to finish the first building before starting on the next one.\n-2013 Edition's unit sprites are very pixelly and hard to distinguish one type of infantry unit from another, and to a lesser extent, one team from another. DE's graphics are much clearer so it is very easy to distinguish unit type/team.\n-Definitive Edition is far, FAR more customizable than 2013 Edition. Not just with the settings (graphics, UI, and controls are much more changeable) but especially with creating a game, namely win conditions, starting conditions, map sizes, unit restrictions, etc. You can adjust many more settings to make a new game into whatever kind of scenario you want. Also you can see what the map types actually look like in DE.\n-Definitive Edition has noticeably better pathfinding than 2013 Edition.\n-In DE you can zoom in and out. In 2013 Edition you can't.\n-In DE you can queue build orders while simultaneously upgrading the building. In 2013 Edition you can't even see any build options while a building is in the middle of upgrading.\n-In DE you can tell scouts to automatically scout out the map.\n-In DE the HUD shows you how many villagers are working on each resource. 2013 Edition does not do this, you have to play hide and seek with each one to count them.\n-The soundtrack for DE has more faction-specific songs, as well as less repetitive music. Both game's soundtracks are good, but I find having the DE soundtrack playing in the background to be more enjoyable. This point is pure preference.\n-2013 Edition's graphics are nice if you enjoy the old-school style, but DE's graphics are significantly easier on the eyes and prettier.\n-Definitive Edition has more civilizations.\n-Definitive Edition is just as moddable and has a very passionate modding community.\n-Definitive Edition seems to have more balanced gameplay.\n- I highly recommend this game for the atmosphere alone. It's worth learning the ins and outs of the combat just to explore the wider world of this game.\n- I finished the game on keyboard and had some pretty good fun with it.\n\nno way in hell am i going to try and S-rank all the levels, though.\n\nEDIT: this morning I woke up and thought \"well i'll only try to S-rank level 1 and then i'll put it down\", so that's the story of how i S-ranked every level in the game.\n- IRL, I really am an unmotivated 20 year old college student, not many friends, living away from my mom.\nThis is a game that kids might not be able to relate as much as peeps my age.. but Im not saying there's an age restriction or something, no. There's a lot of useful lessons anyone can pick up from this.\n\nThe emotional issues it tackles are pretty grounded and somewhat refreshing to see in a game. There's a HUGE mystery element when it comes to the story. (which is sooo damn good mind you). But the conversations you have with the people in this game are just so real and cherishable, you could just wish these in-game days won't stop. \n\nThe small moments you have with family and friends in Night in the Woods are probably one of the most amazing experiences I ever had in a game\n\nPS: After finishing the story, I got all sappy and tear jerky that I went and called my mom to tell her that I love and miss her and stuff.. that's what this game is.\n\nUgh kill me. Im so corny. I love this feeling. So refreshing. f*ck off all of you.\n- Based on the generic, cartoonish-sounding name and (at first glance) Hearthstone-looking graphics, I initially ignored Monster Train. But I later read some praise for it that made me think it might be worth a look. Especially since it turned out that I already owned it from a bundle or something. \n\nAnd what I discovered was a compelling mix of the best elements of Slay the Spire and My Life as a Darklord. A run generally takes less than an hour, and with so many possible combinations there's always something new to explore and try to exploit.\n- I'm not saying you should play this game, but if you do you can smoke \"dizzyweed\" with your dad and overthrow a fascist guy whose name literally means penis. Can not explain how much I started hyper fixating on this game.  This has had an irreversible change on my personality.\n- Where to start.... in short entire game is boring and very slow paced for no aparent reason.\n\nAI: AI performs only very basic functions and does not upgrade buildings and does the opposite of whats beneficial for your empire. AI does not do very well when engaging in displomacy.\n\nUI: You will spend most of your time trying to manage/hover around very CLUMSY and absolutely disgusting UI. Other 4x games offer far superior UI and make is easier to manage your asset on the field e.g. Sword of the stars II, Star Ruler 2, Distant world, Endless Legends, Endless Space etc.\n\nGFX: Graphics are not the top notch what you would expect from a modern 4x game but they are on far with Endless Legends. GFX leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nAlien Races: I dont need to say much but like Planets most of the races are COPY / PASTE. Nothing unique or special about each. \n\nMP: Multiplayer has a mind of its own and in most cases wont let you join public games unless its a private game.\n\nStellaris bring nothing new to 4x Genre in 2016!.\n Right now everyone is almost beta testing for the developers so we can find bugs, report them  and help them fix their game. Why not let players do beta before before release? But then there is  a question of sale and refund. \n\nBut overall this game does offer amazing soundtrack.\n- The good:\n+ Great story with satisfying finale.\n+ Endearing main cast/characters.\n+ Great world building meets with 90s Indonesia culture.\n+ Pleasant pixel artstyle. The cutscenes visual is amazing, even though i notice few awkward animation.\n+ Nice soundtrack.\n+ Puzzle is mostly well balanced. Not too difficult and doesn't make you feel bored/annoyed either.\n\nThe bad: - \n\nThe ugly:\n* Some pacing problem. There are so many sidetrack a.k.a. \"To complete sub-task C you also must complete sub-sub-task X, Y and Z\" during chapter 2-4.\n* Sometimes you might have to going around in circles to solve certain task or accidentally skipped something.\n\nDespite few flaws, A Space for the Unbound is definitely best game developed by Mojiken Studio and best story-driven/adventure game among all games created by Indonesian developer. If you like side-scrolling/adventure game (such as GRIS, Unreal Life or Oneshot) or game made by Mojiken Studio/Toge production (such as Coffee Talk or When The Past Was Around), you should give this game a try.\n- I keep seeing all these negative reviews comparing the game to Dark souls, so i'd like to set this straight:\n\nThis. Game. Isn't. Dark. Souls.\n\nIf you play this game like you would a dark souls game you would not have any fun, I know this because I spent the first 30 hours playing it like a Dark souls game and wasn't enjoying it.\nIn order to play this game how it is supposed to be played you need to start investing more in learning combos for your character, different techniques and items to use.  Each weapon has a unique set of combos you can invest in.  When you learn how to use these combos, you'll find that enemies who were infuriating to fight against being defeated much easier and the game becomes more challenging and fun over frustrating.\n\nSummery: This game isn't Dark Souls, So stop playing it like it is Dark souls!\nHighly recommend! \n\n\n\n- This game's constant revealing of stranger and even stranger esoteric strangeness with every case, the way hitting start you are slammed in the gob by an unexpectedly gnarly tableau, a sinister mise-en-scene with a man burning to death on fire or blasted apart by a canon while wry cultists in various states of masked and undmaskedness make slight comments to say How deserving they were to be killed by us in just that way, oh yes!\n\nAhhhh! That is all about what I love The Case of the Golden Idol for.\n\nIt is 13 deduction puzzles (including the DLC) for you and perhaps a friend on the couch wherein you will become acquainted with a decades long revenge tragedy that tore several families and several kingdoms apart as many people lost there lives in heinous and sometimes magical ways. As you move along the story and investigations grow more complex, which could be a bit fatiguing, especially by the end of the DLC. Though everything here is great, don't mishear me. The art is disgusting. It's visuals and music complete the necessary deranged curious mood to undergird the transmutating tone of a murder-filled horror story into one that equally unnerving as it is subtly hilarious.\n\nThis is a game made by some Latvians from Latvia, and maybe, buster, you should just pay them some money and attention.\n- [h1]Sum-Up[/h1]\n[h3]In-depth analysis further down.[/h3]\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th]🟩 [b]Pros[/b][/th]\n[th]🟥 [b]Cons[/b][/th]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]\n- A vast, detailed and impressive recreation of Hogwarts and its neighboring regions, packed to the brim with locations to discover, collectibles and activities to clear.

Rowling, at a time far before Harry & friends were even born. You’ll play as a fifth year student in the titular magics academy, admitted this late because of unspecified ‘special circumstances’. The virtual rendition of Rowling’s works is nothing short of exceptional, with not only Hogwarts itself, but also its environs (like the town of Hogsmeade or the dangerous Forbidden Forest), all recreated faithfully and down to the most minute details. Of course, some things will differ from movies and books, with the game being set in the 1800s. \n\nThe main story follows the classic ‘manifest destiny’ archetype, where your custom-made character will discover hidden potential that ties them to a greater purpose. Despite some genuinely memorable characters and some interesting side- and main-quests, the overall narrative can’t help but fall a little flat and stale, especially towards the ending phases. Nonetheless, many enjoyable adventures await you. Notably, there are no romance or love/hate dichotomies in the relationships you have with side-characters, as your choices will always end up in pretty much the same results during questlines.\n\n[h3]Exploration, Collectibles & Secrets[/h3]\nThe world is vast and visually magnificent, peppered to no-end with points of interest that often hold collectibles, currency or other utilities. Initially on foot, and later on with the iconic enchanted brooms and even flying magical creatures, you’ll be able to explore at leisure and clear the enormous amount of side-activities. A good portion of these, however, will prove inaccessible until you gain the right spells or abilities, in a sort-of ‘metroidvania’ fashion that promotes meaningful backtracking. Fast travel and an item-highlighting spell prove invaluable in saving time while exploring. Collectibles are mostly cosmetic, enabling the customization of both your wizard and your own private room once you unlock it, to suit various styles. \n\nMost dungeons and locations have additional puzzles or hidden paths that often lead to collectibles or extra resources; exploration feels rewarding, with a genuine sense of mystery surrounding each new point of interest you’ll find. Despite that, most dungeons and locations play out in the same way, and become repetitive in the long haul.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2933385898\n\n[h3]Combat System & Bosses[/h3]\nMagical battles use spells as sole means of offense and defense. Usually against multiple enemies at once, sometimes supported by allied NPCs, you’ll have to time your protection spell right in order to deflect incoming attacks, or dodge-roll away in case of unblockable ones. Enemies are varied and range from magical creatures to dark wizards and goblin soldiers, to name a few. Some of them may be weak to specific charms, others have shields you can break by using specific spell categories (damage, utility, movement) or other special abilities, like immunity to certain effects. \n\nCombat feels engaging, well-paced and is more than a little gory for this universe’s standards, death will be far more common than in the movies or books. The way you can combine spell effects to your advantage and use the environment further adds to the base system, while the amount of passive upgrades with item traits and spell-related talents you can gain progressively add another layer of depth. In late-game however you’ll become overpowered between potions, passive traits, talents and endgame spells - so much that supposedly fearsome dark wizards will prove little more than a nuisance due to power creep.\n\n[h3]Quests, Minigames & Challenges[/h3]\nQuests usually involve retrieving something, talking to a specific NPC, solving a treasure hunt based on visual clues, getting the solution to logic-based puzzles and more, depending on the case. While some side-quests are unique and memorable, most will be fetch chores or dry open-world shenanigans that you’ll have to repeat over and over in the same fashion. Less, but more meaningful and unique quests would have been better than this bloat, for sure. \n\nChallenges are paramount in unlocking unique bonuses like increased inventory capacity, many cosmetics, and even unique passive upgrades to equip in gear pieces. They often require you to slay X of a specific enemy, finish X of the same activity, and such “long-term” goals. Some of them are a massive grind and will only give you the 25th pair of gloves you don’t need, or other cosmetics that aren’t worth the effort.\n- Dear Dev, \nI love this game, if you're reading reviews, please consider some ideas to make it better:\n-  Level designing: Add more ways to choose, and different endings. Right now SoR4 is flat from A to B, it made me feel down compare to SoR3.\n- Alternate customs, and playable same characters: Floyd is overrated and all my friends want to pick him. Make a game with 4 Floyds running sound fun. Use lifetime score to unlock customs.\n- 2v2 Battle! WHY NOT?\n- Shiva (new), Max (new), Roo, Estel (Badass Woman Cop)\n- Steam trading cards: I know it's not importance, but who doesnt want some badass backgrounds on steam profile?\n- This game made me so miserable . \nThe writing can be as funny as heartbreaking \nThe Voice acting is one of the greatest i've ever heard \nA lot of the time , the many side quest were as awesome or even better than the main story (That is already amazing )\n\nPro : The whole game \nCon : Absolutely nothing \n\nIt's one of the greatest gaming experience I've ever had in my 24 years on this earth.\n- GIVE ME THE GODDAMN COPY/PASTE ROOM BUTTON!\n\n10/10 would play again.\n\n(Ttips to combat the somewhat broken system atm:\n\n1. Use patients list, manually send those patients to treatment or home: \na. Very high diagnosis but still queuing for GPs (even 100% patients will wait for GP till their death, it will waste most GP resources)\nb. Very low mood/health patient, if you can gurantee the patient getting their treatment soon w/o affecting others in the queue, use the room's queue function, or use click on the patient to change his position in the queue, otherwise send him home to avoid penalty\n\n2. Treatments are much more profitable than diagnosis, plus they leave after treatment no matter what, but if well treated, then you don't need much ghost hunting janitors\n\n3. If in need of money in the early game, don't bother with food/drink/bathroom/comfort, do the minium and focus on your diagnosis -> treatment, most patient will get treated before they rage quit, thus make you a lot of money. With staff, if they near rage quit, just raise their salary.\n\n4. In the early game, only put down the essential objects (e.g. only desk and file cabinet in GP's) to maximize your profit. They only room I recommend to decorate to lvl 5 is staff room to speed up their recovery.\n\n5. ALWAYS ensure there is a toilet right next to your staff room, and a cafe. If a tired staff need bathroom, he/she will walk all the way to the staff room and back to toilet and back to staff room, even if a toilet is right next to his/her office. Samething with Cafe, it provides a 'nice meal' bonus.\n\n6. Do not build more reception than you need, build less. It is a great way to control the patient flow, they don't wonder around while in a reception queue.\n\n7. For a large map, patients entering the hospital from mutiple gates. I don't recommend building reception other than one specific area (preferably right next to GP's office), reason as above.\n\n8. News agent can get long queue very easily, as long as you have one, patients in queue will travel all the way across the map for it. So be careful, either don't put any, or put one in every building (at least).\n\n9. With spare money, get your staff trained ASAP, especially staff providing treatment (to ensure high chance of successful treatment)\n\n10. Click on a room, goes to 'info' tab, the last sentence there will tell you what training the staff in the room should have.\n\n11. Keep track of your staff's skills, and assign them only ONE job in the staff -> job assignment menu, so AI won't mess your system up.)\n\nThings I'd really like to be changed:\n1. WAY too many patients.\nI think the new patients' growth(spawn) need to be slow down at certain point either automatically or mannually, I often found myself in need of double the amount of GP offices in the mid-game. Since GP offices are the choke points, it can get out of control in matter of seconds, which left no Human resources/money/time to train everyone. Besides, it is realistic, there are only so many people a town have.\nAnd because of the growth issue, I find myself have to build more and more, I'd like to slow down and taking care of every corner of my hospital, not just keep building. Quality takes time, nobody like be overly pushed by the game.\n\n2. Rooms merge\nJust like in real lives, Doctor's room are private, but pharmacy? I think other rooms should not be private - Allow us to put multiple machine and people in one room, make it shared. It is just bizzare to not make it shared, and vey wasteful of time/money/spaces. Besides, some room looks really empty.\n\n3. Wards\nWards are weird, I'm not sure why. Often than not, I have more than enough beds and nurses, but still 6+ wait outside, I'm not sure what triggers them to be 'called in'\n\n4. FOOD/DRINK/TOILET is broken\nI'm sorry, but I'm not gonna build cafe & bathroom every 3 inchs. IRL, most hospital have 1~3 cafes, a small~medium toilet on every floor. Space is valuable, I would rather leave it to medical facilities. I think the AI is a bit broken at this point, they constantly want drink/food/bathrooms while I have 6+ machines/2 toilets in every building. As if they can't walk 10m to the nearest one.\n\n5. Janitors are kind of dump.....I wish we can assign areas to janitors/assitances, so they won't always walk across the map back and forth.\n\n6. Man, this is 2018, we got central heating and air-conditioning...for real. Maybe make a seprate tunnel system? Like water, electricity, heat, air. Hospital's air exchange system is much more important than usual buildings I believe.\n\n7. Credit to Ibbi Wyxx in the commnet, I think it is great to set patient with certain percent of diagnosis straight to treatment rooms. It makes sense and later in the game, with doctors fully trained I imagine 100% diagnosis on most patients in the GP's shouldn't be a problem. And it is how real life works as well, dorctors are not always 100% sure whats wrong, they might start some harmless/urgent treatment first, myself actually is in this situation right now \n\n(sometimes I feel like I'm being treated in my own hospital because I just stayed at one IRL, so I have to make everything right as if trying to please myself...)\n\n8.  Some of those skills just look fancy since you can't replace them.\nThis one does not matter much, I'm very OCD when it comes to managment, so atm I have to wait for the right person w/o any skills I don't want on them so the training oppourtinity will not go wasted, but it is hard and annoying. Besides, it is a real problem since you can only learn 5 skills, so just choosing whoever is not effective and effecient in the long run. (for example a GP w/ Radiology skill)\n\nAlso, it makes some of the skill essentially useless, i.e. master class (speed up learning and teaching), it may seem useful, but it will eventually cost you a lot more than you gain. Down the line it will cost you one spot for other skill. If just hiring someone w/ this skill to teach then fire him, it is also costly and not making any real sense. \n\nThings I'd like to see (in DLCs?):\n1. Ambulances management. Ambulance are essential part of a hospital, ERs are even better! (Stayed at a ER bed not long ago watch the whole ER room working,man, ERs are cool af, but I do hope less people need to see it because it is...ER)\n2. Multifloor-hospital.\n3. ICU etc.?\n4. Medicin/drug development/management\n5. Specialists office?\n6. More background music/radio, its a bit repetitive at this point\n- Great game! At times it can get frustrating (boss battles), but the good out weighs the bad by a landslide. Even when i did get mad, which was a lot, I never stayed mad for long. There is just far too much to enjoy about the game. The art style is just simply amazing, the movement of your character around the world is just so satisfying once you get used to it, the puzzles aren't too easy or too hard, and everything in the game just goes together pretty much perfectly. All in all this game is extremely well made. Would recommend buying if you want a super unique experience 11/10\n- cool game but the font is almost unreadable at times\n- This HD remake of the PS2/DC classic Rez breathes some new life into a very old gem, however the update only harms its own image due to simple design mistakes and the enhancements that only highlight those mistakes further.\n\nThe PS2 controller made targeting slow and the game was intentionally timed to the slow pace at which you could target enemies. This meant the sound fx and visuals tied to targeting and shooting were all in sync with the music - that's at the core of the Rez experience. However the massively improved VR controls make targeting and shooting VERY fast. As a result all the sound effects and visuals play at once in a cacophony, the enemies die, and then you have a long 4 - 8 beat stretch of nothing as the backing track plods along, waiting for new enemies to spawn.\n\nWhat makes this worse is that the graphic updates end up being largely absent. Enemies filled the middle ground of the scene, captured your attention, and were the source of many particles, effects, the music, and animation - but since they all die quickly you're often left staring at the sky box with nothing happening. Then looking around in VR during these wait periods you can see how empty and simple the levels are because the HD parts are in the effects not the environments.\n\nThis all becomes especially noticeable in Area 5 when you demolish a mini boss and you're left sitting for 2-3 minutes floating through a desolate low-poly void with half the song missing. It feels like the game is broken. They should either have put a limit on the speed at which you can lock-on to enemies (matching to the BPM of the track), added more enemies to match the faster pace of this version, or filled the spaces with stuff to interact with so you can trigger the SFX/VFX where the music and visual upgrades are hiding.\n\nNo new player is going to know that the game is -meant- to be synced to the music and even if they try it is entirely out of sync with itself. This aspect demolishes the intended audio/visual experience which is the point of the entire game. It's very sad to consider how stunning Child of Eden was when it took advantage of the expanded memory, gpu, and peripherals it had available, and it goes to show how much potential has been squandered here. This would have been obvious if it had been properly play tested.\n\nTo add salt to the wound, Area X (the new VR part of the game made for Infinite) failed to work on my Quest 2. I couldn't target anything so I just couldn't play that at all (I hear it's basically just 1 extra 15 min level anyway). Truly disappointing in every way.\n- POTENTIAL SPOILERS \n\n\n\nSome guy came to me asking for mercy, gave me $20 and gave me a digital watch and asked me to let him in for the love of god, I arrested him.\n\nI let a prostitute get enslaved because I felt like it.\n\nI've ruined more marraiges than Monopoly.\n\nI've made a deal with a group of terrorists.\n\nI put poison on a random dudes passport and got him killed, along with another soldier.\n\nI got shot in the face in front of my own family.\n\nI'm only 3 hours into the game.\n\n\n\n10/10 \"It's okay\", \"Like Skyrim with guns\"\n\nDid I mention I killed Biker from Hotline Miami?\n- Melatonin is a simple rhythm game, with a focus on ease of gameplay and calmer sounds.\nIf you're expecting something on the tougher or more upbeat side, this ain't it.  Ironically, I had more fun as I stopped focusing on scoring well, and more fun when I was just feeling the music and half-asleep.  The sounds and songs are quite relaxing lol.\n\nOn the shorter side of games, it still delivers an enjoyable experience in what it offers. The timing is a *little* on the forgiving side, and there are even accessibility options if you need a little more help, such as timing circles, metronome, and a bigger Perfect window.  If you'd rather go for a challenge, a Perfect only option is also available.\n\nControls are quite simple, using [strike]4[/strike] 3 directional keys and an action key (Space by default). In each tutorial, you're told whether you'll need to hit directional keys or the action key, and whether they're held or not, as well as general timing.  For some stages, the instructions don't give you as good an idea as the tutorial itself/timing circles do (Work and Time levels for me).  All good, but in some levels you get tempo changes in the middle of the song that can throw you a bit off, especially if you're just grooving to the audio cues... when you can hear and distinguish them.  Unfortunately, there are a few levels where the audio cues are either far too similar to each other, or happen too quickly to react to.  This can be a bit of a bummer, as I prefer working off audio for rhythm games, as their focus should be lol.  \n\nWhile Melatonin doesn't bring a whole lot to the table, it doesn't need to.  Less is more here, and the art and sound direction definitely hit their target.\nRelax.\n- 2023...\n\n2 years...\n\n2 Languages...\n\nEDIT:\n\nTLDR: Game is too simple, better get Factorio or Riftbreaker\n\n\nPlayed again after ~1 year, nothing has changed in the basic QoL or coding system.\n\n\n- It still uses an older builder system than Factorio did 10 years ago: you actually have to craft the base material manually every time before you can build the building, instead of it being done automatically by a simple click on the building in the build menu.\n\n- If you have crafting orders set, new items added to your inventory will not be read by the current crafting orders and keeps on produce stuff your already own...\n\n- Items don't have their own output for transport lines, but instead require this stupid additional output... (I think the developer couldn't create a better output than this simple one)\n\n\n20 minutes and that's enough for me for now, I'm not putting in any more effort for EA project\n- Falcom's Action RPG Masterpiece.\n\nbest story in the series. it follows the latest adventure of Adol and his companions, stranded in an island and slowly uncovering their secrets. the tight, but well developed cast are absolutely the best written characters in the series. from party member to your fellow castaways all have developed motivation, personality and charm. \n\nalot of the horribad translation and voice acting have been fixed, and it finally got the treatment it deserve as a masterpiece. \n\nthe gameplay is an evolution of the modern Ys game. at its core, ys 8 is an action RPG where you control adol and several other party members with unique set of skills, moveset, weapons and super attack. each character represent an attack type (slash, pierce, smash) that are pitted against various enemies with certain weaknesses. great variety of enemies, amazing boss battles, music and story. \n\non release, there seems to be a big problem for the port, but as far as i know, everything has been patched to very good level of stability. over 70 hours, the game crashed twice (and saved by the intuitive autosave system), run flawlessly 60 FPS and 1440p without a single slowdown. \n\n10/10 game go buy so we get monstrum nox on PC.\n- They need to add more weapons like a galil or m249 or something and maybe more vehicles and playmodes.But overall so many possibilities\n- This game is utter trash, a classic example of a terrible game that exists only to make the developer money on card sales. There are no options for audio and video settings, the textures and font are ugly as hell, and the controls stink. You move a glowing ball of light around and pass through various colored laser barriers. There are enemies who dim your light on the first hit, and kill you on the second. The instructions are barely above gibberish, with instructions like \"color change to spend the wall color\" and \"use the right button mouse for charge and defend\". You eventually piece together that those instructions mean \"touch the colored balls of light to change the color of your light to match the laser barriers in order to pass through them without dying\" and \"stand on the button and right click to power up laser barriers to protect yourself from the small enemy lights that chase you relentlessly when you get too close\". That second one is only theoretical though, as in practice it's impossible to escape the enemy lights fast enough to have time to charge the defensive laser barriers, so I have no proof that they actually destroy the enemies. On top of all that, the game occasionally gets stuck after you die a few times on the same level, and there's nothing to be done except restart from the very beginning on the tutorial levels. There's the potential for an interesting puzzle game here, but the execution is so bad I can't recommend this junk even for the price of two cents that I paid.\n- It may not be that similar to what most people are familiar with, as a building game, but in most every sense which counts, I believe this is the greatest building game I have ever played.\n\nThe controls are smooth, the Building Mechanics are smooth, the interplay of cuteness and silliness is so smooth, and Lillian has the cutest face in the known universe.\n\nTruly a fantastic game with enjoyable and concise mechanics, the Block Grid is as malleable as Minecraft (except that some areas cannot be mined, usually story quest locations), the ally AI is more involved than Conan (sitting at a table with Rosie to gobble some greens? cute), and the combat is slightly dangerous at first, but mostly very mellow and not in any way detrimental to the building side (the villagers even fix up the damage done to your village in story battles - at least in the 'tutorial' island).\n\nMy only advices:\n\n- If the Camera is too tight on you and too slow to zoom out, switch perspective and back, if that doesn't work, look down at the ground and jump a couple times! (your head will push the camera up into the sky faster)\n\n- Don't get too creative on Furrowfield Farm! I spent a lot of time building and customising, being slightly annoyed at the small build area of the island, but now I discover that the whole thing was essentially a tutorial, and that completing the story missions there opened up the game in a much bigger way. Now I am back on the home Island and am able to build across a much larger area. If you're still in Furrowfield, you basically haven't started the game yet, so get that story done!\n\n- IF YOU SUFFER FROM REGULAR COMPUTER OR PROGRAMME CRASHES:\nWhen loading a Game you can press (A) / (X) on Controller to Copy the Save File and Back it up on one of the other Save Slots. I recommend doing this every day you play in case of  Corrupted Save Data caused by Crashing while Sailing to another Island.\n\nI am tempted to give this game a 9/10 - which is a serious seal of approval from me. Even on my strictest day, I would never give it less than a 7 - it is fun, cute, silly, serious, touching, exciting, and above all else, architexcellent!\n- this game is something i have literally always wanted but never thought would exist. a historical fiction narrative that isn't about war or combat but rather something as mundane as being a maid... AND they let you actually clean the rooms. i have been asking for this for years and years and then these psychopaths go and actually make it?? unfathomable. love it. my only critique is that I can't high five Eugene or take Wendy to the malt shop to help her feel better\n\nin seriousness it's not the most wildly divergent choice-based narrative of all time (there are small choices throughout that have an impact, but most of the consequence is delayed so it doesn't FEEL as impactful in the moment), which might put off some people who want a more sandbox feeling. consider it more of a detective game than an RPG. worth experiencing even if you don't have my particular brand of mental illness tho, 100%, especially if you like these kinds of games in general.\n- Ni no kuni II: Revenant Kingdom is a great RPG that, while a little dissapointing in some aspects, makes up for it with it's positives.\n\nLet's start talking about the negatives: \n\n- the characters are a little bland, most of them barely get anything added to their backstories nor are there any specific sidequests for them (yet). They're not bad, and Evan/Roland are good characters, but the rest falls a bit short.\n\n- The soundtrack is a little forgetable, even if it does have a few good gems in there\n\nNow the \"neutral\" points:\n\n- The main gameplay is simple, with only a few attack buttons and barely any combos, so if you're looking for a deep combat you're going to be a little dissapointed.\n\n- The story is simple; i personally enjoy it and how it ends but i could see someone who's looking for some deep story to be left unsatisfied.\n\nNow for the good aspects:\n\n- The graphics are beautiful, it's basically a playable Ghibli Studio movie\n- The gameplay (both combat and army based) is fun, fast and rewarding to do, especially when you unlock more spells\n- The kingdom management is simple to do and it gives you a sense of pride and accomplishment (unlike EA) when you expand it with new building and bigger borders\n- The sidequests are for the most time fun with cool citizens to meet and recruit\n- The random dungeons are cool to explore\n\nI played 85 hours of this game and i enjoyed every second. If you're a fan of Action RPG with a touch of base management and \"tactical\" combat you're certainly enjoy this beauty of a game.\n- They need to add more weapons like a galil or m249 or something and maybe more vehicles and playmodes.But overall so many possibilities\n- Like Path of Exiles, except not as 'Press-One-Button-Combat' like. You actually occasionally use more than one button, believe it or not POE fans.\nIn all seriousness I played like 5 hours of POE using nothing but a throwing dagger move, and it worked, including against bosses. Grim Dawn at least makes it clear that basic attacks do in fact exist. Later on it stars to get a little bit, a LITTLE BIT, POE-like, but even so, I give it a 7/10 minimum.\n- You are an astronaut, you wake up in a rescue rocket, and against your wills you are shot from Theseus space station on Chori V planet. After landing on the planet you find a strange device that helps you get back on board and survive until help arrives.\n\nGreat game, get it on sale, because it is a bit short. I like games like Portal 2, The Talos Principle, and there is no point to compare this games, because they are completly different, even if they have few common things like solving riddles and story with fresh look at some philosophical questions. Point is that every one of them including The Swapper is good at what it do, and every one of them is unique. For me it is pleasure to play this game beacause of it atmospheric well done design, riddles and questioning the meaning of existence.\n- I've read some of the negative reviews and name calling is petty so instead I'll just say a lot of those opinions are dumb.\n\nLook. This isn't Firewatch. This is a seven year old game that pissed off a lot of bros and continues (apparently, christ) to do so because it embraced not only being a walking simulator but a gay one at that. And yeah bro, 15 bucks seems steep for a game that you can finish in under an hour, but hell, maybe don't speed run? It's a walking simulator after all. Or maybe support indie game devs. *Or maybe* read the Steam tags that say \"short\" and \"walking simulator\" and then don't count that against the game. You don't review CS;GO and say \"not bad, but too much shooting\" right? RIGHT? \n\nLook. I've had some wine. And I've had some feelings. And Gone Home is a piece of video game history whether people want it to be or not. It's a game I wish I would have known about when it was first released. Hell I needed it five years earlier than that. \n\nIf you're pissed that Gone Home wasn't dramatic enough or that it's \"homosexual\" then maybe realize that this game wasn't made for you and that does not qualify it as bad. \n\nAnyway, that cat journal achievement was neat.\n- 1.

Advance (the political party who ends up getting into power and becomes authoritarian) actually only gets into power in the first part of the game (the tutorial broadcast). You actually get to see the descent into authoritarianism and dystopia, which basically no other game (at least, any game I've ever played) has actually done, and not really any other forms of media either. You also get to influence some events in game [spoiler](for example, one of the ads you can play is an advertisement for a children's toy, and later there is an... incident... involving the toy, and (if you played the ad), the presenters of National Nightly News (Jeremy and Megan) state in a segment regarding the incident that they should never have advertised the toy.[/spoiler] It's a really minor thing, because you can just choose [i]not[/i] to play the ad, but I really love that detail), and having a noticeable impact on anything is really enjoyable.\n\nThe gameplay is mostly good. You basically just have to be on your toes, switching to different cameras every now and again, being ready to censor things, and being ready to go to the adverts. All basic tasks, but since you're doing most of them together, it relies on you being attentive and reactive. The only part of the gameplay I would criticize is the signal interference section. It's easy, and doesn't even really distract you, as you just have to move a slider up and down with a slight bit of delay. It's just not a fun part of the game.\n\nMy biggest gripe with the game has to be the lag; something which I know I'm not alone in experiencing. Online, it suggests closing down performance heavy tasks, such as web browsers, but I know for a fact that I had a few webpages up when I was playing the free prologue (the first broadcast, which gives a pretty good idea of what the game is), and experienced no issues at all. I really don't know what the coding differences between the paid version and the prologue of the game are, but that doesn't seem like it should be a difference. Generally the lag was irritating, but not something that hinders you in any way, but there is one level where you're advised to switch screens because naked protesters may pop up to protest Advance's policies. Visual lag, in this case, really isn't good. I also just got a windows pop up saying that the game was frozen, and so I had to close it down... not great.\n\nOverall; the gameplay is good, with really the exception of the interference task, and the story is excellent, but the technical issues are just... really, really irritating. I would recommend the game, but I would warn you that the technical issues do end up being quite irritating.\n\nOverall; the game is good, but the technical issues can be annoying.\n- This game will leave you satisfied.\n\nI know that doesn't sound like much of a selling point, but it is. This game won't give you a sequal hook, it won't give you a product carved away like a thanksgiving turkey, each part sold seperately or held to ransom. \n\nThis is not a game about standing victorious over your enemies, it's not a game with some kind of adrenal rush that will leave you drained and empty afterwards.\n\nThis isn't a game about saving the world, as surprising as that may sound considering the hero's goal.\n\nThis is a game about hope. Hope for tomorrow, hope for your fellow man, hope for dreams and wishes, hope for a last shimmer of light in the encroaching darkness.\n\nThis is a game that will make you ask things about yourself, even if only subconciously. \n\nBut, most importantly of all, this is an experience that will make you say \"I was happy to be there, if only for a time.\"\n\nAnd I was, in fact, happy to be here.\n\nHats off to you ladies and gentlemen, you made a cyinical old bastard smile for a good ten hours.\n- Playing this game instantly brought back memories of me playing TMNT, Battletoads, Double Dragon, and Streets of Rage, with my little brother on the NES and Sega Genesis in the early 90s. Luckily this game doesn’t feature TMNT’s ridiculous water level or Battletoads' sadistic peed bike level. The graphics are perfect, the controls are great, the soundtrack is awesome (especially the Wu-Tang stage, and the Shredder stage), and the levels and overworld map are fun to navigate. I’ve played through the story mode with all 7 characters and have played through the arcade mode multiple times solo and many times in multiplayer and I’ve enjoyed every bit of it. This game is so much fun.\n\nThere are a few things I wish existed though. I wish there were more playable characters. I wish that you did not lose your 7 character’s progress in story mode when you start a new game. I wish you could see the difficulty level of the online arcade game you are joining. I wish there were cumulative stats you could see for arcade and story mode that showed the number of times you completed a stage, how many enemies you knocked out, objects you’ve destroyed, stage times, combo streaks, times taunted, etc. I wish you could create your own turtle and assigned moves, specials, jumps, taunts, and colors.\n- Such a neat concept!  Clear the table under so many \"strokes\".  Where it really shines, however, is all of the surreal bits you can add into your game like giant balls, conveyor belts, or balls that split when hit.  The game always has many challenges to complete that will require you to use the indicated table/ball/modifier and meet its requirements on your run (like make 3 long shots in a single run or pot multiple balls in a single shot).  Complete enough of these challenges and you'll unlock the next feature, but the game gives you a lot of freedom in which modifers you'll use in your run to increase your odds of completing the given challenge.\n- My profile pic is the reaction i have towards the game devs that made this game.\nVisually disgusting, gameplay wise impossible and over all terrible.\nWhile it's possible to beat it and get all the achievements it's difficult and also the space level is actually visual aids it's so disgusting to look at that you can't even focus on the gameplay.\nNot worth it even for free which is how i probably got it i can't remember and i don't want to...\n- I even set a calendar reminder so that I could get this on release. I wish I hadn't bothered. Going great guns until I got to the passage. Game over as I can't progress. Tried allsorts to drop the jammer but unable to do so. I guess it is a case of waiting for all the bugs to get resolved.\n- Look, I love Magic. It's my favorite game of all time. I met my wife through MTG. I'll be playing it until the day I die.\n\nBut if you're new to the game, and not established on Arena, don't pick it up. It's horrendously difficult to build a collection in this game, doubly so if you're not a fan of playing draft. While they have made incredibly minor adjustments that have been generally positive, the economy on this platform is impossible to do well in. The sheer number of games you have to play to amass any kind of respectable, and more importantly, functional collection of cards is not worth it for just a casual player.\n\nOf course, you can circumvent the grind with money, but that of course is the literal definition of Pay 2 Win. It's a mobile game economy through and through.\n- I technically got this game for free, as it was bought for me from a friend. And honestly, I didn't really like it. She got it for me, as a means to help with some of my mental health issues I suppose? But it just was very big miss for me, and kinda made me feel worse. A bit anxiety inducing for me, just given the circumstances, talking about life and death. Just not my personal cup of tea.\n- I'm gonna be honest with you. If you are not live in SEA, I'm not recommend you this game in case of lag and ping. Sometimes I play with one of my friend and we got 200+ ping but the other 3 got 60 ping even we are in Thailand so I guess this game send us to Europe or North America server. You may experience what we got but more often if you are westerner.\n\nAnd don't listen to the people who said ThE sPeCtEr ArE iMbAlAnCe. Most of them play less than 10 hours, try playing specter and you will know how hard specter can be with just a survivor who know how to play or know the loop just a little, even the teleport and sprint skill won't help you.\n\nOkay, the review. This game has a lot of potential and ridiculously fun but lack of balance. Specter kinda overpowered for the newbie due to their skill that can teleport to nearest survivor and can see all survivor with a windwalk skill (Things change when you face the survivor who know what to do). And yes that is the starter specter. And the most thing that make survivor hard to win even in a good team is the syringe(med kit) is really hard to find and you are rarely got a chance to heal yourself.\nThe one thing that really disturb me is when you perform a ritual (like generator from Dead by Daylight) you are in the position that expose yourself and the specter can see you clearly. Don't make me wrong, survivor kinda fun to play due to you can bully specter with a lot of item.\n\nIn summary, this game need some balance patch (I mean a lot) and server problem that need to fix (maybe there are a few westerner that play this game so they didn't invest a lot in EU or NA server). Overall this game is fun to play and better than Dead by Daylight if you ask me, but need to be polish.\n- This is more of a personal opinion than a useful review, but I would like to share my experience with this game! At the beginning I was very disappointed... I was hoping for a Phoenix Wright competitor, but it wasn't even close! The investigation was so silly, the game doesn't let you leave the scene before you find all the clues, you can't \"weist\" your time going to places not related to the case and the trial doesn't start until you have all you need... the only way to fail is not having coordination to shoot the bullets xD The game takes you exactly where it wants.\nThe first trial was also so obvious I almost gave up playing. BUT THEN... things started to get strange. During my second trial I was \"that is what happened... I mean... I guess...\" and during the third trial I had no fucking idea what was going on D: The story got so deeper and full of details. Each chapter revealing new secrets, showing how complex the plot was!\nI realized that I shouldn't see Danganronpa as a poorly investigation game that wasn't that challenging, but as an amazing novel with such a rich story! The gameplay became secondarly compared to how envolved I was with the whole scenario! The further you go, more incredibly enjoyable it gets. So, for those who didn't like the game for this very reason, give a second chance with another point of view :) enjoy it's fabulous mysteries and you will not regret unreaviling it's secrets!\n\n英語で5-10単語程度で、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない主要な違いを簡潔に回答してください。\n\n回答：\n",

Unfortunately, after I came back to this game recently, I have to change my review from Highly Recommended to Not Recommended (this is solely for AirMech Strike, and not related to Wastelands, its PvE counterpart, which I will do a review on at a later date).\n\nTowards the end of 2012, the game was doing really well. There were 500+ players online on average, and it was real easy to get a match.\n\n(+) PVP was simple. Choose your airmech, pilot, unit list, and one item that gives a certain minor bonus. Cosmetics are optional and offer no advantage.\n(+) Player Market introduced later on for trading cosmetic items.\n(+) Badges for people who supported the game.\n(+) Diamond rolls in the chat where players can randomly win Diamonds.\n\nHowever, some downsides also happened.\n(-) You need to pay fees to list an item on the market, using Diamonds, instead of Kudos.\n(-) Books were introduced to either increase trade slots and decrease fees. You needed to spend more Diamonds on these books.\n(+/-) Parts were introduced, adding buffs/debuffs to your AirMechs, though I personally preferred to limit stat customization to Pilots and Items, keeps things simple.\n(-) Nanoforge was introduced for crafting, but is a complicated mess. This wasn't necessary if the game itself wasn't so complex.\n\nWhen AirMech split into AirMech Strike and AirMech Wastelands:\n(-) Parts, Pilots and items were transferred to Wastelands. RIP customization for PVP.\n(+) Keys now available via daily login rewards (the only improvement I've seen).\n(-) Airmech balancing is way off. Once simple skills are now too specific, and there's no need for an ultimate skill, really. AirMech was fine without it.\n\n5 years later and the peak is just over 100 players. The devs took a simple fun game and made it so incredibly complicated that it's no longer a fun game, for me at least.\n\nI hope Carbon Games brings AirMech closer to the late 2012 version, which I feel is the best and most fun version.\n- I have played OSU!, Muse Dash and stepmania plenty and I gotta say that this does not feel like a rhythm game at all. The premise of matching the shape of the map to music sounds interesting but some of the songs I feel like are not mapped out correctly. Or in general this game relies less on music cues and more on visual cues? It felt like maps are only 50% related to the song and you have to ignore what you hear because the map randomly demands patterns that have no matching audio equivalent and everything becomes pure visual memorization.\n- Gone Home is... okay. There's nothing particularly terrible about it, but it's hardly this amazing, revelatory experience that it's been portrayed as in the media. It's just a very short, straightforward game of exploration, in which a fairly simple story of teenage love and rebellion is fed to you through bits and pieces of notes and spoken journal entries you find while exploring a large, abandoned house. But this game does absolutely nothing innovative, unlike the pre-release hype proclaimed. There have been hundreds of games with more compelling stories, and this game introduces no original mechanics. I took my time and explored the entire house, and I beat the game in three sessions totalling 81 minutes.\n\nAgain, it's not bad, it's just an utter ripoff for $20. I got it in a large Humble Bundle package, paying about a dollar for it, and it's decent value at that price, but there's no way I'd pay more than five bucks, and even that is stretching it. I'd be pissed if I'd paid full retail for it. You can find many many games that will be far more engrossing, more entertaining, and just plain longer at this price point.\n- The best driving simulator, period.\nUnmatched soft-body physics, customization, sounds, graphics - everything in BeamNG is close to perfection - and the game is still in early access! The only feature it lacks is visual customization (liveries, stickers, bodykits etc), but these aren't available in many autosims (looking at you, Assetto Corsa). Lots of quality mods which include cars, maps, and a freaking JATO rocket ensure you'll have hundreds of hours of fun here. Touge, track, drift, rally, time attack, offroad, rock crawling, drag - and with zero level loading screens; just a few seconds to switch your car. Zero DLCs, intuitive interface, and built-in gamepad support are also here. 10/10 worth your time and money.\n\nUpdate v0.24: where negative reviews come from\nAfter the major UI overhaul a lot of negative reviews were posted. Many of those call the game \"literally unplayable\" - which is obviously greatly exaggerated, unlike the other stated problem: lost controller presets. That one is actually unpleasant to deal with (judging from the reviewers' words, since I myself didn't experience a single problem with my DualShock4 nor with the game itself), but yet it was not a force majeure that could not be avoided, as every major update comes after a teaser - which should be a sign for everyone with a custom preset to save or write it down, just in case the update affects it.\n\nTo sum up, BeamNG.drive is still a nearly perfect-rated game - and a lot of the negative reviews are, to put it mildly, unjustified.\n\nUpdate: I love the new Covet.\n- I appreciate the sincerity of Jusant. You can tell its creators have placed genuine care into their product, which has made the experience of playing it joyful and kind.\nThe visuals are stunning, the mechanics are not overwhelming, the soundtrack is soothing, and the puzzles are not frustrating. A great climbing game all around with an easy-to-follow yet gripping narrative. \nHopefully, Ukrainian localization will also be added soon.\n\n-     \nI was impatient for this game and i am very satisfied with it!\n\nThe Graphics are polished as would expect, the new circuits in Las Vegas and Losail in Qatar are very good together with others that we run at night the effects of the lights in conjunction with the illuminated buildings are incredible!\n\nBraking Point 2 is so satisfying it takes between 8 to 10 hours to complete, no spoilers i think but we have a lot of characters and some familiar faces from the past!\n\nNew F1 World, offers a structure of different Series, each one is a chain of events with having a primary objective that needs to complete to progress to the next, secundary objectives can be pursued for extra rewards!\n\nCareer Mode identical to the previous ones!\n\nRed Flag Deploying will teleport the cars to the pits where we can change our strategy to restart the race!\n\nDriving and Feedback, overall there is a big improvement more precise and dynamic the ffb on the steering wheel is very good, with Gamepad it's easy to adapt and get top times!\n\n\nWhen an update comes out just don't screw up the handling!\n\nF1 23 is better than the previous ones in every way!\n  \n\n- An instant classic.\n---\n\nThe original [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/kunovega/recommended/264200]One Finger Death Punch[/url] was an unexpected treat for me. The refined simplicity of just two buttons that require masterful timing to create a legitimate fighting experience laid out to a selection of music that reminds you of the classic Kung-fu movies of the 1970's but packaged with a carefree stickman aesthetic.\n\nOne Finger Death Punch 2 is a respectable sequel in most ways. The core gameplay is fundamentally the same while the visual indicators and special attack animations have been upgraded and made more fanciful. Other things are changed simply to give you a new experience.\n\nEvery aspect of the game is polished from the interesting tutorial to the many additional modes (survival, gauntlet, etc.) that exist beyond the (very long) main campaign. Once you get into the groove there's potentially dozens if not hundreds of hours of fun to squeeze from this.\n\nThis is a game that just has to be played to truly appreciate it as the feel of your interaction along with the music is what really defines the experience. Simply watching it or looking at the screenshots doesn't do it justice.\n\nThere are a couple of (minor) controversial changes that may not appeal to some fans:\n1. The music in 2 includes a more modernized remix compared to the more traditional music from 1. Personally I love the soundtracks from both, but there are people who have a preference.\n2. The upgrades to special attacks in 2 can be a bit of visual clutter at times. I like both styles, but there are people who prefer 1 over 2.\n3. There are some sequences (like the lightsword rounds) which did not return in 2, replaced instead by other weapons. While I think it would have been cute to include all of that along with the new stuff, it's not a deal breaker. It does however mean that both games retain a bit of unique flair and a reason for you to play and experience them both. 2 is overall an upgrade, but it's also not a 100% replacement.\n\nI would strongly suggest that if you've never played either game, you should begin with the first one. I think it's a better entry point to the series and might have a slightly broader appeal. (it's also slightly cheaper).\n\nThen if you find yourself enjoying it, come back and pick up 2 and you'll find yourself with some remixed music, fancy new special attack animations and a whole new adventure to work through.\n\nJust to be very clear: Both of these games are fantastic and deserve more praise than I can properly express and I'll very likely be putting 100's of hours into this just like I did the first one.\n---\n\nBottom line: Simple to learn, hard to master, and super satisfying fighting along with a great soundtrack.\n---\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38232109/]While you are here, would you consider following my curator page?[/url]\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/kunovega/recommended/]Want to read all of my reviews and not just the curated ones?[/url]\n- Amazing game that I love to play, but the boyfriend that I was playing it with broke up with me a few days after playing this game. A game that's about fixing your relationship.\n10/10 game.\n0/10 in my heart.\n\nedit: why do people find this funny i wasn't kidding\n\nEdit # 2: It has been 7 months since I had originally played this game. What was originally a game of heartbreak and painful memories, I had managed to find it someone new to play with. While this game had terrible memories, I had decided that a game such as this was undeserving of them, and thus created new memories with another special person in my life.\n\nThe game is remarkable, with good writing, and amazing gameplay, and it is deserving of the buy. Each level is crafted with amazing detail, and all of the mini-games are just as fun as the main game itself. Don't let bad memories keep you down, and instead create happier ones. Live your life, ya'll.\n- Started strong, ended annoyingly.\n\nMoral of the story? People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.\n\nIt paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that \"routine\" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.\n\nI liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters. But it all fell apart and tries to teach a very vapid moral that someone in their early 20's who has never had a meaningful relationship would idealize.\n\nAt least it was short.\n\n- This was a impulse buy for me just have seeing the new \"Fury Road\", but its a great game so far was kinda shocked it ran smooth right out the gate seems like today you gotta wait a week or month before a game can run proper though. Anyways beatufiful lighting, models / textures look good, vehicle combat / driving is fun, and vehicle customization is cool too. The on foot combat feels a little too straight foward though, the gore animations are kinda boring though, like feels like its a Xbox/360 game in that way, and collecting scrap can get a little repetitive. My final thought yea this game is worth getting but if you haven't played id's \"RAGE\", I'd reccomend getting that first, it's a extremely simmilar although kinda diffrent scenario game that will quench your Mad Max thirst.\n- 100%'ed the LUCT version of the game and I'm slowly working my way through this version now.\n\nOver all the game itself is solid. If you're reading this, its a brilliant tactics game that helped define the genre. However most of the changes they made in reborn, while innovative, ultimately feel constraining. \n\nFor example, they've limited spell slots to 4, so you can only ever take 4 different spells. One or two of which (missile + indirect) are taken by a damage spell of your choice, leaving you with even less spell customization than you'd think. And its unfortunately the same situation with skills, as one will always be taken up by your weapon skill. \n\nThe cards that drop in battle, while an interesting system on paper, just end up cluttering the field most of the time, often with auto-skill activation up, which most of your units won't even really want compared to the other options. \n\nRandom battles were also removed, limiting chances to recruit to a few key dungeons as well as removing some of the more amusing battle locations from the game. \n\nI've also seen some people complain about the level cap, but in my current play-though of the game, it isn't too much of a concern for me, but it may be for others. \n\nOver all, it just feels like they've taken a step back from what Tactics ogre: Let us cling together, gave us. Yes there's bloat in that version, but it also gave us a feeling of freedom when we were putting our teams together that this version lacks. I am grateful that we saw a remake of this game within my lifetime, but I wish they had improved on Luct, rather than take steps back from it. \n\nIf they ever increase the amount of spells and/or skills you can take, to like 6-8, then I'd probably switch my review to a yes. But until then, with a heavy heart I have to say that this version just isn't as good as Luct so far.\n- I got this game for $12 off humble bundle. Me and my friends play it for hours on end. This game honestly feels like the perfect fighting game for me because there is no set style. I don't have to remember specific combos or any crazy inputs. It's just simplicity. Unless you want to do that in which you can. But it's fun for anyone. If I were you I would get it off of humble bundle for $12.\n- I love this game. In fact, I've loved it since I was in highschool about 8 years ago. My friend and I used to play this game together all the time on my flashdrive. We were always discussing & trying to understand the ins-&-outs of the game and how to get a specific ending depending on what you did. Playing this brought me back to those good times in that library.\n\nThe OSTs are nostalgic, the gameplay is about the same and the artwork is amazing as ever(actually the graphics are much better with this remake).\nThe only complaint I have is that it lags at random times(though usually in the menu). The original IB on RPGMaker never did that.\nOverall I'm glad I bought this so I could support the Dev and thank them for all those years of entertainment-\nI just wish there wasn't so much lag over an RPGMaker game.\n- TLDR: Right now, since there are no \"NEUTRAL\" reviews on Steam, IN IT'S CURRENT STATE, its a no from me. If the bugs get ironed out, its a pretty good game. If it gets fixed, I'll likely change to a recommend.\n\nGot 2 copies as a Fig Backer to play with my brother. My single player experience (POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILERS):\n\nGOOD:\n--Love that the choices REALLY matter and there are a LOT of them in this game.\n--Many different ways to approach a situation and your reputation affects interactions. Your reputation MAY be good enough to talk yourself out of fights! Many opportunities for KISS ASS and HARD ASS and other Squad builds (Nerd stuff, Mechanics, etc.) to be useful throughout the game.\n--The fire modes have grown on me. Some weapons have their own perks which add a fire mode. Other fire modes are available via perks you can obtain in the perk tree. The Precision Strike you get once your strike meter is full is very powerful and can change a fight (can malfunction a robot with aimed shot or fire a huge burst to take out multiple hostiles).\n--You can build a new squad member at any time that will start at your current level. Messed up a squad member build? That's okay, just create a new one.\n--I like the PREPARE and AMBUSH abilities. PREPARE lets you save up to 2 AP for next turn. The AMBUSH ability allows your squad members to trade in some AP to fire on an enemy that enters their range during hostile turns.\n--I love the Animal Whisperer skill and animal companions. I like the variety of animals you can bring along with your squad.\n--Shift key to highlight stuff you can interact with. This takes away having to pixel hunt for obscured boxes and containers. When you get old and can't see as well you appreciate stuff like this.\n--I like that I only have to loot one body at the end of combat and I can easily cycle through and grab the loot from all the other lootable bodies in the area.\n--A high Luck attribute will occasionally result in more loot, and even free actions. Sometimes you'll get a free attack or a free movement from a lucky action.\n--I like the variety and usefulness of Utilities (+5% XP, +2 PER, +1 Weapon/Armor modding, etc.)\n--A lot of stuff that can be used for cover can also be shot and destroyed.\n--Humor can be a bit over-the-top, but I've chortled quite a few times.\n\nNOT SURE:\n--Can only charm a single animal per squad member with Animal Whisperer. You CAN get other special animal followers that don't count as the single. While disappointed, I can see why they limited it (more would be OP and they can start to get in the way during combat).\n--Enemies have a circular view area, which means even if you're trying to sneak past behind them, you can still be \"seen\" after a brief time.\n\nBAD/BUGS:\n--Cant team crouch. You have to manually go through all of your squad and crouch them 1 by 1, and it costs 2 AP to crouch in combat. You also cant move crouched as far as I know. You can't \"change stances\" (AKA crouch or stand up) while in cover, either. Save a game right before a fight with all your squad members crouched and ready to go? When combat locks up and you have to load the save, you have to re-crouch everybody.\n--Combat can lock up, causing you to have to reload a previous save (for me, twice per play session usually but sometimes twice for the same fight).\n--Attributes, Skills, Combat Buffs/Debuffs (and probably other stuff) need more tool tips.\n--Lost character progression.\n--Very laggy Dialogue Tree and later in the game the inventory gets laggy too.\n--Creating a Bookworm Squad Member with 1 STR creates a situation where your Squad Member is losing 3 CON (total hit points) every level up and will be erased like Marty McFly in B2TF.\n--Load screens are too long. 30+ seconds to load into different zones, over 1.5 minutes to load a game on SSD. From another review: \"while we wait, let us read the lore books we've collected.\"\n--Squad portraits don't stay in order.\n--When you have more than 6 Ranger recruits in the select character screen, the \"Companions\" section gets pushed off-screen, hiding their portraits, and making it very unintuitive to add them back into your squad (you have to use the keyboard). Need a scroll bar here.\n--Saves don't have specific names so can be easily overwritten. There is only 1 autosave by default, and later on the game autosaves right after a game changing decision, making you have to revert to a manual save (2 hours earlier for me) if you wanted to try different options. I recommend turning on timed saves as well as taking advantage of quicksaves (and of course saving often!)\n--FPS drops, sometimes so bad you have to reload.\n--Squad Members shooting through walls/floors/ceilings.\n--Radiation difficult to detect in some areas and no warning (other than your squad health draining) going from radiation level 2 to 3 for instance.\n--Combat messages briefly appear above your acting Squad Member's head and are easy to miss (like \"Out of Range\")\n--When getting shot at, the camera doesn't always auto focus on who is shooting you.\n--At least three bugged missions I can think of (but hey, one is an unlimited money glitch so more of a feature).\n--Character models and other things (switches) not loading properly leading to invisible characters you can interact with (or fight with, as it happens in combat sometimes too).\n--The game can become unresponsive when trying to move 2 Squad Members separately and interact with someone.\n--Explosive Barrels not actually exploding when shot (this seems to be related to being too far away from the barrel when sniping it, as if you get closer, they'll actually explode).\n--Cybernetic Implants are a good idea, but they take up your Utility Slot instead of giving you another slot dedicated to them so when you have the ability to finally use them, it feels more like a trade-off rather than an augmentation.\n--No Inventory filter for Utilities. Gotta scroll through your hundreds of items and the Utilities aren't even grouped together entirely in the inventory, they are scattered throughout.\n--When you open a door to a closed room, fog of war usually obscures what is in the room until you physically walk a squad member into the room.\n--Cannot have multiple types of the same animal in a Squad with multiple Animal Whisperers.\n--Don't try to loot two containers at once.\n--Some traps can't be disarmed.\n--Various graphic glitches like missing texture or dialogue bubbles that are blank or don't disappear.\n--Can't remove and reuse weapon mods.\n--Some equipped weapons will display inflated damage numbers (by 300% in some cases) until re-equipped. Not even sure how long it has been that way or if it was affecting my game.\n--If you misclick the filter categories in a vendor encounter on the World Map, it'll kick you out of the encounter to the radio and you can't get back to the random encounter at that time. I only mention this since I've done it so many times.\n--You can't pause the game which may or may not affect time sensitive quests. You can be detected and attacked in the menu (escape key) or in your inventory.\n--There is no way to have Special companions/followers that you get from Missions follow a different squad member. If you dump that Squad Member later, you lose the follower too (as far as I know).\n--Get radio signals with \"coordinates to follow\" yet I have no clue who from or what it opened up on the map (if anything).\n--Gaining access to certain parts of the Rangers HQ requires you to do something pretty awful.\n--I'm out of room....\n\nIt feels like I'm fighting against the game more than the Wasteland sometimes. I don't even want to try multiplayer until it gets fixed (and my brother doesn't either).\n\nIf you're a developer of this game, thank you for your time and effort! Polish it up and I'll be happy to change this to a recommend! Edited for clarity/additions and I cut a lot. Thank you for reading and thank you for the comments and awards! Have a great day and be kind to others.\n- [i]Don’t be fooled.[/i]\nPlague Inc may look like a great in-depth RTS with which to live out the real-world angst of our modern day viral outbreak, but instead it feels and plays very much like a shallow, casual, arcade, mobile version of that; a great little time waster, but lacks any real depth, intellectual engagement or long-term replay value.\n\nThis may be ok if you’re just wanting to watch the world burn in 10 minutes or less, but if you’re expecting hours of intense gameplay in a hyper-realistic, strategy-based simulation of a global pandemic—with social, economic and geo-political elements to keep you on your toes—then you’ll be sorely disappointed.\n\nHere’s the game in a nutshell.\nYou have one objective: [i]Kill all humans on planet Earth.[/i] Anything short of that and you lose.\n\nHere's the gameplay:\n[b]Step 1.[/b] Choose which country to infect. \n[b]Step 2.[/b] Pop the red and orange bubbles to gain points. Points unlock ‘upgrades’ for your plague. The more upgrades you unlock, the better your chances of winning the game. \n[b]Step 3.[/b] Pop the blue bubbles to slow the progress of the world’s efforts in finding a cure or it’s game over.\n\n[i]That’s it.[/i]\n\nEach plague type, (virus, bacteria, parasite etc.) takes you on the same linear path.\nInfect. Upgrade. Don’t lose.\n\nUgh!!\n\nHere in 2020 with the world ACTUALLY living through a viral pandemic, we’ve all witnessed first-hand the various stages of infections, quarantines and lock-downs.\nThe reactions of global governments.\nThe political turmoil.\nThe economic and industrial fallout.\nThe global panic that ensues amongst the general population.\nThe manipulation of the media in controlling the narrative.\n\nNone of that exists here.\n\nGranted, this game was released 4 years [i]before[/i] the 2020 Crisis, but it just feels like a missed opportunity in my opinion.\n- If you are looking for a game that you can never master, here is the game for you.\n- I'm going to write an honest review for this game since A LOT of people seem to be very biased.\n\nThis is not a perfect game. No 2K basketball game will ever be a perfect game. Does that mean this game is bad? No. Should you hold off on the game for now? Probably.\n\nLet's start with the positives:\n\n- A lot of people seem to gloss over the fact that 2K rehauled a lot of mechanics for this game. Shot meters feel more legitimate, this game is MUCH much more realistic (fouls, shot tendencies, etc...) This game is better and more fluid to control, and the gameplay reflects each players' ratings (defense, shots, etc...) much more accurately.\n\n- Online play seems to be better and more fluid. I've yet to encounter any latency issues online with quick play and the such.\n\n- MyCareer is MUCH better than last years. There is no cheesy story and the cutscenes feel much more integrated into the game. Orange Juice and dynamic duos are a great idea in general. The UI for MyCareer (and the game in general) is so much cleaner and more functional.\n\n- The game is visually beautiful, not much else to say on the matter.\n\nNow, the cons:\n\n- Help defense is broken. It's quite ridiculous that 2K hasn't fixes this lingering issue in such a long time but it's still there. This is a BIG issue in MyCareer and not quite as bad in other modes since you can manually control players.\n\n- Stat allocation is broken. This is a huge issue in MyCareer and has deterred me from playing the mode any more until 2K fixes this issue. Introducing the idea of stats that can only be raised in practice is actually quite a neat idea. However, these boosts are not permanent, even though 2K has stated they are. This is detrimental and demoralizing and discourages players from playing the game more. Limit caps are ridiculously strict as well. 2K NEEDS to fix these issues ASAP.\n\n- Numerous glitches.\n\n- 2K introduced broken mechanics along with the good mechanics. Ankle breakers are now pathetically easy to pull off (using Stephen Curry behind the back moves is a surefire way to have your defender fall). Moving screens are now a thing. \n\nI would hold off on buying this game until 2K patches it. There are just too many issues with the game that prevent it from being a playable game. I like this game. I really do. That's why I'm hoping 2K listens to the community and starts working on the issues at hand immediately.\n- In a world where \"enhanced edition\" has started to be synonymous with \"will run on modern hardware if you shell out $20\" it's absolutely refreshing to see Larian deliver this masterpiece free of charge to owners of the original. You start out with an already fantastic game that's received numerous game of the year and editor's choice awards. Then you spend a year polishing that game, and adding new features. The result is brilliant Enhanced Edtion of an already fantastic game.\n\nNew features for EE:\n[list]\n[*] Fully voice acted - Every line of dialog now has voice acting. The voice acting is really good too\n[*] Dual wield - Rogues now look more iconic with the ability to dual wield\n[*] Grenades - You can craft and throw various sorts of grenades. \n[*] Tactician Mode - A new  challenging mode where encounters are redesigned to be harder by adding new spells and enemies into the mix. Classic mode still available obviously.\n[*] Split screen co-op \n[*] Controller support\n[*] Updated graphics - The UI is totally reworked, the graphics are updated, and spells have new effects\n[*] Updates to the story  - The story, esepcially the ending, was rewritten a bit to clear up some confusing aspects\n[/list]\n\nI'm sure there's more, but really these ought to be reason enough to play this game.\n- A new game from Zeboyd, you know I'm there! And this was such a fun game\n\nThis game is about as long as Cthulhu Saves Christmas and it's just as Linear. However given their statement on this video, that's meant to be the point these days.\n\nThe Graphics for the main game are basic but it's fitting for the Genre. Also they have dropped the random battles with on screen monsters to avoid if you want to not fight (And you still have the option to start a battle through the main menu). The fighting system is identical to CSC too which I've enjoyed but I can understand those who may not like it. The Animation for the transformations are incredible...except I'm always stuck watching them every single time which can get very tedious.\n\nThe story is clever, and they provide \"Translations\" for the Ole English of Shakespeare...but a lot of the translations are jokes and very silly ones at that.\n\nThere isn't a LOT of replay value but you will enjoy the story enough you'll want to play it again eventually.\n\nThere is no New Game Plus mode...yet but given how they patched it into CSC later on I'm certain they're do that here eventually.\n\nI say the game is incredible for the price range and is entertaining for all ages.\n\n\nVIDEO REVIEW: https://youtu.be/wuw9pJPowqM\n- [i]\"The Display says 'Nothing'\"[/i]\n\"Nothing or 'Nothing'\"?\n[i]\"It's BLANK!\"[/i]\n\"'Blank' OK Great. What is on the Middle Right button?\"\n[i]\"NO!\"[/i]\n\"Middle Right!\"\n[i]\"NO!\"[/i]\n\"What you you mean No!? I HAVE THE MANUAL!\"\n\n[h1]**BOOOOOOOOM**[/h1]\n\n10/10\n- I have always wanted to play Resdient Evil 4, and I wanted to play this game so badly.  I am giving a negative review simply because the games FPS on the PC are bad, that could be because of Windows 10 because I heared rumors that the game does not run well on it and such, so that could be the problem.   Another problem I faced is the lip sync is dealyed when it's on the cutscenes so that makes everything slow and such.  The gameplay from what I seen however is pretty great and I think Resdient Evil 4 is a great game, but this port is not, get it for the GC, Will, PS2, or any of the consloes that has this game.\n- As i previously stated, i was going to play through metro fully and i have done so, so here is my update to this review. \nThis game is not the best selling triple A game in the world and it may have some bugs (like a table that wasnt solid or the objects in that room lol) however it is a decent game. the story is decent and the characters voices are way off but they sorta make up for it with their personalities. \n\nExploration in this game is by far one of the most interesting in my opinion and the way your character acts in the enviroment makes it more interesting aswell, for example wiping your visor when it gets dirty (wasnt that helpful for me in my play through but it was a nice touch) and your visor taking damage in combat adds to the immersive feel of this wasteland/paradise almost. Scavenging weapons and parts and combining them to make better equipment is quite intriguing and quick to do if you can find the parts. \n\nat the end of the day my final review of this is its a good game i would play it again even if it is a bit clunky sometimes (atleast it was for me lmao)\n\n\n\n\n\nOh and hopefully my punctuation is good enough so no one passes out this time lmao\n- holy fucking shit everything about this fucking mongoloid game is so fucking bad i can't even begin to understand. this was supposed to be better than the first piece of shit, but i dunno, maybe a tiny bit.\n\ndon't be like me and get baited into wasting your hard earned money for this fucking shit even if it's on like -90% sale.\n\nspecial mention to worst fucking controls in the history of fucking gaming. fuck these fucking mongoloid fucking retard faggots for making a game this fucking bad. uninstalled.\n- If I could get my money back, I would. AI as usual is hot garbage, cant even take turns without getting LITERALLY BODIED by the AI drivers. The new progression system really sucks. Cool that they wanted to try something different, but I really dont feel like leveling every god damn car in the game just to modify it. If you wanted multiple of same car you would have to level those duplicate cars you purchase. My experience with the physics is just... eh. I mean I sure do love loosing grip just from barely tapping the gas. Constantly fighting my wheel just to stay stable. Driving its probably fine for controller players, I wouldnt on wheel. Credits are only used to buy cars now. Also kinda runs like crap. All i wanted was a Gran Turismo on PC and this... this is not it. Game is mid, move on me thinks.\n\nEdit: I put in a request for a refund and Valve did indeed approve it. I thought I was over the time limit for sure. Don't be me and spend 100 USD for early access. Thanks Valve, you're the best!\n- What can I say that hasn't been said and that you don't know.\nThis game is IN-SANE.\nThe attention to detail is mind-boggling, the missions, from the smallest to all the main missions are worthy of oscars.\nThe single player campaign is one of the best adventures I ever went on in my life. This is why I love games.\nThe beauty of this game in indescribable. It's one of most realistic living worlds I've ever been in.\nIn fact, it felt so real to me, that I would spend hours living and breathing the game, I felt I was there, at that time.\nTaking care of my horse, spending time fishing and hunting, sometimes for hours.\nRiding my horse in strong winds, and heavy rain, collecting every piece of clothing and trying to look dashing at all times.\nI got attached to people, took care of them, or dragged them behind my horse when I wasn't in the mood for their BS.\nI've been there. I lived there. That was me, I was a cowboy. Nobody will convince me otherwise.\n- cool game but the font is almost unreadable at times\n- I don't usually give negative reviews on games, but holy shit. The map is not even done and you can go outside the \"map\" so damn easy. You randomly go back to the main menu without any reason.\n- [h1]Game Pros[/h1]\n\n• Open world\n• Not a GPU/CPU intensive game. Easily runnable and runs quite smooth.\n• Beautiful cut scenes/visuals, gorgeous!\n• Clean menu.\n• Night/Day Cycle.\n• Weather does effect how you take on a mission.\n• You can easily get immersed in the game and play it for hours without even knowing it.\n• Tons of missions and side objectives. Tnere will be plenty to do.\n• Everything you do in-game affects the current and future missions.\n• Those who can stragically plan better will have an easier time progressing through missions with a higher score.\n• Various weapons/tools/items/gear to research. Lots of customization.\n• Custmomizable \"Mother Base\" with soldiers and objects/items from the open world.\n• You can infiltrate other players bases and steal soldiers/resources (FoB's/Events alike).\n• Multiple companion's that you can bond with throughout missions. (You are not alone!)\n• Intelligent and adapatable AI. They will deal with people using repetitive infiltration methods and the like.\n• If you punch one of your soldiers in the face, you will recieve words of praise.\n• Not a game you can just breeze through in just 10-20 hours.\n\n[h1]Controversial Features[/h1]\n\n• Mission checkpoints can have a large gap, punishing your stupidity and impatience.\n• Not necessarily a \"Pay to Win\" option, but there are microtransactions in this game that 'enhance' your online experience. (MB Coins)\n\n[h1]Game Cons[/h1]\n\n• Storyline seemed to be lacking/repetitive.\n• AI and player pathing have a few bugs when encountering ladders or something of the sort in small places (Seldom occurs, but worthwhile to mention).\n• Can feel repetitve at times during missions due to similar objectives (Go here and kill/rescure this person, etc).\n• Hackers have been spotted while online. (FoB Attacks)\n• You CAN NOT bind anything to a numpad key. Which blows for left handed PC gamers.\n\n[h1]Relatable Games[/h1]\n\n• Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes\n• Metal Gear (General Franchise)\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nWith the ingenuity of Kojima and Co. combined with the power of the Fox engine here is another gem to marvel upon- Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. The game/franchise as a whole continues to be a lovely experience with a multitude of things to do online post-story. Seriously, you will always have something to do. The story is mesmerizing, leaving you with a feeling of wanting more. For the hardcore Metal Gear fans out there, many of your questions regarding to 'plot holes' will definately get (at least some) answers this time around!\n\n[b]Overall Score: 90/100[/b]\n\nThank you for reading! Please leave a comment if you feel I have left anything of importance out or if you just want to share your thoughts. Cheers!\n- They need to add more weapons like a galil or m249 or something and maybe more vehicles and playmodes.But overall so many possibilities\n- Overall better cast than the first game. But it has a few problems that DR1 didn't have, which to me was what made the game fun in the first place.\n\nDR1 spoilers: [spoiler] All of them seem capable of killing which I couldn't say about the first game where it was obvious that weedman, the giant and donut girl wasn't a threat to you. [/spoiler]\n\nDR2 spoilers:  [spoiler] However unlike the first game where Kirigiri, Byakuya and other characters were arguing during the trial and bringing up interesting points. DR2 has a lack of persuasive characters. There's effectively just Nagito (who argues in your favor half the time anyway) and Chiaki. The other characters never challenges you in a convincing way.[/spoiler]\n- Firstly, neutral reviews should be a thing. Because although the game's story is pretty solid (and some elements of it still very relavant even today), the game suffers from a multitude of issues, so no, I don't truly recommend this game because of those factors. Rockstar themselves should be fixing the broken state of the game, instead of leaving it to people to fix it.\n\nThe problem with this game is that you need to be online to be even able to play it. You NEED to be online to PLAY a SINGLEPLAYER game FROM 2009. I don't know what Rockstar was thinking when they force you to play online, but this is just not okay. There is no online functionality for the game besides maybe cloud saves - something steam cloud could've done just as fine instead of leaving it to their own messy launcher.\n\nBut that's not the only problem with this game. Being that it's an old game, it does not run well on modern systems, not anymore. It suffers from various performance issues. Thankfully, you can use DXVK to get around this problem - but as i said earlier, you shouldnt HAVE TO do this. Rockstar could have easily patched the game to fix the performance issues (that still happen with DXVK mind you - but compared to without DXVK it is MUCH better), instead they focused on patching who knows what.\n\nExcept after you use DXVK, you HAVE to edit a game file to let the game use more than 2 gb of ram. Again, SOMETHING Rockstar could've easily done by updating the game's code to meet the modern standards. Nobody has specs like the one in the minimum recommend anymore. After you do that, you HAVE to edit the amount of vram the game detects by using a command line to fix it. That's already 3 things you have to deal with JUST to be even able to play the game normally.\n\nSome people may see this as a small botherance - some people may see it as a huge inconvenience, but the apparent problem with this is that, once again, you SHOULDNT HAVE TO do all of this. Going past those issues and playing the game, you also have to ensure you limit the fps to 60, either using DXVK or the in game vsync (former being more recommendable as it doesn't hog as much as cpu power). If you decided to bother with all of those steps to make the game playable, congratulations. Now be severely annoyed like I did  because Rockstar has not, for all this time, patched the final mission with the helicopter QTE. One suggested fix for it was to limit the FPS to 60 - which did NOT help me. Other was to install a script file to fix it, which ALSO failed at first, till I tried again like 5-6 times. You as a player should not have to install this stuff and edit games just to fix the game, when the publisher themselves should be doing it. I expect a game to be supported if it's still being sold on Steam. And don't think they don't care about the games being on Steam - they clearly cared when they removed the classic gta trilogy from Steam (which were also left in even more of a broken state compared to how they first came out - but that is an entirely different point).\n\nPutting all of those factors aside, the game itself is very solid, story wise. I really loved all of the symbolism that was apparent throught the game, and concepts such as \"American Dream\" or \"Land of Oppurtunity\" being presented as something that was clearly flawed - which is precisely why people like Nico go down the path of killing people or doing drugs just to survive. You can't go from rags to riches in a \"strong eat the weak\" country - you either do whatever it is you have to do - like Nico - to survive, or you let yourself and your close ones get killed. There are other things the game criticizes as well, like that one conversation where Nico criticizes the food in the city for using \"chemicals that your body spends time getting it off your system\", or something along those lines. I don't think I need to mention that this isn't something they added as a joke, because it is very much there. The game's serious and dark tone might be considered bad by people, but it is because of this dark tone and seriousness that we can actually learn some lessons from it and open our eyes to some truths in our lives.\n\nThe gameplay itself isn't really that complicated, except when it comes to driving the vehicles in the game. They are based on a realistic driving system and although it is debatable how much of a good gaming experience it really is when they made it so realistic, since it introduces a huge learning curve and can end up frustrating the player, I actually ended up loving it for what it is, except when it came to driving motorcycles of any form. The game's simplicity in other regards is what makes it pretty good, in my eyes. Though it sometimes doesn't work the way you think it would (like when you are playing with a controller and have to use auto aim), it is nevertheless solid enough that those are only minor inconveniences and not the kind of problem where you'd want to stop playing the game.\n\nThis game definitely deserves more attention and love - but Rockstar really needs to fix this game themselves if they are still keeping it on Steam's store, because the current situation of the game is not acceptable.\n\n\n- [h1] 9/10 [/h1]\n[h1] As a sequel to Steins;Gate, you won't be able to understand the content of the game without playing the previous game. [/h1]\n\nThe sequel to the famous visual novel game Steins;Gate. Although some people think that Steins;Gate 0 is not as good as its predecessor, I think this game is a well-deserved excellent sequel.\n\nA change from the witty and relaxed game style of the previous game, the overall atmosphere of this game is heavy, and personally I prefer this kind of visual novel work. The plot of the game is naturally wonderful, so I won’t comment here to avoid spoilers. If you are deeply attracted by the game’s background settings and characters before playing Steins;Gate, then this work must be worthwhile. The music of this game is also very beautiful, and it will never disappoint the players. The only shortcoming of it is that the description of some characters is too sloppy and the characterization is insufficient, such as Kagari.\n\nIn any case, this one is definitely a must-try work for players who love Steins;Gate, and it is an important addition to the series of plots. As a related supplementary sequel, its nature is also destined that players must play the previous game in order to understand the content of this one.\n- Falcom's Action RPG Masterpiece.\n\nbest story in the series. it follows the latest adventure of Adol and his companions, stranded in an island and slowly uncovering their secrets. the tight, but well developed cast are absolutely the best written characters in the series. from party member to your fellow castaways all have developed motivation, personality and charm. \n\nalot of the horribad translation and voice acting have been fixed, and it finally got the treatment it deserve as a masterpiece. \n\nthe gameplay is an evolution of the modern Ys game. at its core, ys 8 is an action RPG where you control adol and several other party members with unique set of skills, moveset, weapons and super attack. each character represent an attack type (slash, pierce, smash) that are pitted against various enemies with certain weaknesses. great variety of enemies, amazing boss battles, music and story. \n\non release, there seems to be a big problem for the port, but as far as i know, everything has been patched to very good level of stability. over 70 hours, the game crashed twice (and saved by the intuitive autosave system), run flawlessly 60 FPS and 1440p without a single slowdown. \n\n10/10 game go buy so we get monstrum nox on PC.\n- Minutes ago, this reviewer completed the game Gorogoa. And now, an attempt will be made to describe the experience. It won’t be easy…….\n\nIn 1968 this player went to the theatre to see a brand-new movie: 2001: A Space Odyssey. What crossed the screen wasn’t so much a story in the filmmaking sense., but rather an experience. Views of Earth from space (before such images existed IRL), and a final scene that perhaps no one understood, but clearly was meaningful beyond simply the ability, or need, for words to express. Gorogoa left this player with a very similar feeling of inexplicable fulfillment.\n\nGorogoa might be described as a puzzle game, but certainly not in any typical sense. More accurately, Gorogoa is a game about travel, but traversing distance in more ways than just spatially. It’s about travel within, and travel to places unknown (perhaps outside of dreams.) It’s about traveling through space, time, life (and lives), and travel through the experience that is mankind. And perhaps more, it’s about the journey necessary for each player to experience in order to be able to complete the experience that is Gorogoa.\n\nGorogoa provides very little information or assistance, beyond the option for hints about the areas of each image that need be considered for game progress. (It’s difficult to imagine a first-time player succeeding without such hints, so no stigma should be associated with them, especially if they prevent the need for outside resources as may well be the case.) Almost nothing more can be said without compromising some aspect of this game, so this review will be brief, and likely almost as mysterious as the game itself. Learning the goal is as much a puzzle as is the process of reaching that goal. Images are moved, shrunk, expanded, combined, variously manipulated…….ENOUGH! \n\nPlay, and learn about possibilities unimagined until now. In a single word…genius.\n\nThank you.\n\n(As with most Steam games, offline game time is not tracked.)\n- The EOS stands for End of Service. I am sure someone has fun with this or there wouldn't be a reason to keep bringing it back. Right? The usual Tab Target MMO. I do like that you can teleport to quest givers and mobs instead of the usual auto or manual run. Aside from that there isn't anything modern here.\n- [h1] The First \"Fun\" game, after a long time\t[/h1]\n\nHours upon hours have I tirelessly spent on games I didn't thoroughly enjoy. Needlessly competitive games like MOBAS and PvP games leaves an emotional toll of helpless frustration and unfullfillment that makes it feel mentally unhealthy to be a part of.\n\nOnly after playing The Messenger did I realise how long It's been since I played a game for the genuinely fun and exciting experience it was meant to be.\n\nAnd how much I've missed it.\n\nThe Messenger offers an adventure with controls running as tight and comfortable as the spandex pants worn by Ryu Hayabusa. Accompanied by \"unexpectantly likable\" characters, the shopkeeper in particular. With his selfdepricating/ 4:th wall breaking/ life advising humour about us being the main character and should probably be out saving the world instead of spamming his \"chat\" 30 times just to see if the dialogue changes. Only to punish us with a long, \"boring\" and unskippable dialogue.\n\nI didn't regret a single second I spent bothering him and it still amazes me how self-aware the game is and how It uses the knowledge in a way that makes the game all the more fun to play. Like putting less emphasis on the story and more on entertaining dialogues and scenarios.\n\nThe levels are varied with enemies being used as both obstacles and tools to help manuvering through levels that gradually gets more difficult, as they're pushing the boundaries on how the game can be interacted with.\n\nVisually and auditory, The Messenger presents itself in a pixelated format, all 16-bits included, but It doesn't stop there. The game takes place in two seperate timelines that you'll easily travel to through portals scattered about. Moving though one timeline could present a path unavailable in the other. This mechanic is sometimes included to get through certain areas. But my point is, not only does the game look and sound great. The different timelines are also created with a seperate artstyle. Yes, both the looks and sound instantly switch when going through a timeportal. Creating cool moments were you'll have to go though the flow of the levels, even through time.\n\nSo the game turned out to be about a time traveling Ninja who needs to deliver a message in order to save the world.\n\nI had a great time playing this and there's no doubt you'll feel the same. It's just a shame how easily it is to overlook it as something less than what it truly is, how it can easily go unnoticed among the thousands of titles here on steam.\n\nOne last thing.\nI'd like to thank the passionate people who crafted this game and I appreciate the publisher for signing it which helped them get noticed. You people have made something truly awesome and I'm looking forward to anything you'll do next.\n- Before I continue writing my review on this game, I got to say that the PC port of Valkyria Chronicles is one of the best, if not, [u]the[/u] best port. The game was originally exclusive for the PlayStation 3 back in 2008. The game was well received, but garnered low sales that would put the sequels Valkyria Chronicles 2 and 3 on the PSP. I actually never heard of this game before until a few week prior to the PC release on November 2014. That said, I will have to give a standing ovation to Sega for putting an effort to make the PC port well optimized in 1080p (or more) at 60 FPS (or more). Sega has my attention and I will present this review.\n \nValkyria Chronicles focuses on Welkin Gunther, a son of a legendary general who fought in the First Europan War, leads a platoon of some adults and teenage volunteers to defend their country against the invading forces of the Imperial Alliance. The game presents a mix of tactical strategy and third-person action that is very unique in the strategy game genre. Does this game deserve your attention? \n\nThe story takes place in a “fictional” European continent where the Second Europan War was fought primarily between the Atlantic Federation (think of all of the European countries, in a geographical sense) versus the Imperial Alliance (Russia, in a geographic sense). Gallia is a “neutral” country where it contains a unique resource known as Ragnite. Thus, the Imperial Alliance invade Gallia to get Ragnite to fuel up their war resources. One of the greatest parts about the game is how well the developers use analogies from World War II into the game and its execution is well-received. The analogies ranged from weapon designs (like the Gallian Scout weapons that look like the Soviet SVT-40 to the Imperial weaponry comparison to the real-life MP40 and STG44, and plenty others). The analogy extends to vehicles and geopolitical conflicts. \n\nThe character developments in the game are highly impressive, particularly with the relationship between Welkin (protagonist) and Alicia Melchiott (deuteragonist). The themes in Valkyria Chronicles consist a good mix of “light” moments (like hope as an example) and “semi-grotesque” themes of war (such as discrimination/racism, personal ambition over soldiers’ lives, and others themes that will unravel later on). Some reviewers criticized the game as being not serious on the themes about war. Honestly, I don’t think that the game is supposed to be depressing and a good mix between “light” and “dark” is best suited for the game. The story starts really slow in the beginning and actually begin to progress as you reach a certain point in the story. The plot is pretty good in most area while few scenes are a bit “awkward” in terms of sudden shifts between a sad event to a “positive motivation”. \n\nThe gameplay in Valkyria Chronicles is turn-based, but it is very unique because once you click on a character to choose, you can actually control the character to move to any location in third-person you like as long you have enough Action Points (basically, the movement bar). Experience points and money are earned by Ranks (like A, B, C, and D) by completing an objective within a certain number of turns (Example: Getting a ‘A’ rank within 3 turns or less to get the maximum amount of exp and money). However, it is possible that you can actually kill all of the enemies on the map, complete the objective, and still get an ‘A’ rank in the majority of missions (except for a few of them). \n\nWith the exp and money, you train your soldiers based on classes Scout, Shocktrooper, Lancer (Anti-Tank/Explosives), Engineers, and Sniper rather than individuals. The money are used up to upgrade weapons, buy tank parts, and purchasing “reports” from a reporter in certain chapters in the story. The game would last you a good 30-50 hours if you play the game in a smart, tactical manner or have an “OCD” on getting an “A” rank on every single mission in the story or a mix of both (like I did). \n\nThe game does have some faults, particularly when it comes to classes. Reviewers argued that Scouts are too overpowered, but in my view, it is best to say that scouts are too reliable since they have the most movement bar and top-tier weapons like the ZM Kar 8 (the game's version of Soviet PTRS-41 that can obliterate any enemy, even medium and heavy tanks if you shoot it in the back). Engineers are useless in the game since you won’t repair your tank very often (depending on your play style) and Scouts are the better alternative. There are some bugs in the game that is related to the monitor refresh rate (if you play it on a 144 Hz monitor like I did) in certain missions in the story. PC controls are a bit awkward when you control the tank. There are a few moments in the story that has some poor “transitions” (an example would be that an upsetting moment happened in the story and all of a sudden, some of the major characters wanted a medal for their part on a major battle in the next cutscene as if that upsetting moment never happen or affected them). \n\nThe game is often compared to XCOM when it comes to gameplay. This may be true, but Valkyria Chronicles is very unique since you can actually control the character in third person instead of the computer doing it for you when you command the character to move from Point A to B, in bird’s eye view. The game engine is very aesthetic and presents the story very well. I’m glad the Sega released Valkyria Chronicles to the PC and I am very pleased to hear that a (possible) new Valkyria Chronicles game is being trademarked (and hopefully in development) thanks to the PC sales. The default price of $20 is a good deal, -50% off is a great deal, -75% is a perfect steal. Valkyria Chronicles is one of my top games for 2014 due to its unique strategy gameplay and superb PC port optimization. I am looking forward for the new game that is being trademarked (or possible PC ports or revamp for VC2 and 3). This game has my highest recommendation for any strategy gamer who want to find something original, unique, and beautiful.\n- A very good recursive Sokoban.

(I think the developer couldn't create a better output than this simple one)\n\n\n20 minutes and that's enough for me for now, I'm not putting in any more effort for EA project\n- I love this franchise and NARUTO SHIPPUDEN: Ultimate Ninja STORM 4 really out did itself. I love the story line and everything eles they did with the game, BUT the MAIN problem i have with this is that even with my game pad I had to install another app so that I can use the dame pad. The game couldn't completly figure out my game pad buttons on it's own and I had to re-set every button and it's a pain in the a$$. There's a MAJOR learning curve if you think you can use the keyboard, plus I highly doubt you can hit every single button at the exact time you need to press it. If your getting this in a console then thats awesome. But I don't recommend getting this from steam and playing in your Pc. If only they had figure out the controls then I would have given 10/10. So sad.\n- This game looks incredible and I'm really enjoying the story so far. It does have some bugs still, but nothing I've come across has particularly bothered me, much less ruined the game. It's incredibly immersive and detailed, the voice acting is really good, and the gameplay is fun.\n- $15 during the autumn sale was a great price for a ton of fun and a game with some truly breathtaking visuals and effects, one of the best looking games I have ever seen. It is a worthy addition to the JC franchise. Combat is more of the same from JC2, there's tons of explosions, a big open world, great sound and music, and solid mission progression without having to grind which is becoming a thing of the past now with microtransactions in games. The game's biggest flaws are that dirt bike handling is the worst vehicle handling I have ever seen in any video game, some wingsuit missions are beyond frustrating, and it is Square so it of course isn't optimized very well unless you have a powerful setup. That and the ending is one big lazy cop out sucky easy boss fight.\n\nI was luckily able to bypass optimization issues with a powerful setup and minor tweaks. So don't risk it unless this is on sale, your pc is powerful, and also provided you don't mind a few crashes in a couple missions. Just remember that Square is #1 in continually barfing out horrible pc ports and they will never learn so even with a beast pc you are still taking a chance.\n\n7/10 because of a ton of glitches I didn't mention that would take way too long to write down, and because of Square continually sucking balls on making optimized pc games. In which they cannot do.\n- When I show new games to one of my friends she always asks if it is possible to pee in the game and sadly I usually must tell her that it isnt possible because there is so few games where this special detail is being paid attention to. But this here my dude! I tried to show her the game yesterday so I got her setup on the valve index and start the game all good, but we couldn’t move at all... We tried everything! We tried physically move in our vr room to see the boards that had text written on them because we spawned behind them which I found a little weird as well. On the board it said eat the hamburger to start the game or eat the poo to guit. I saw a box on the street and I remembered by seeing the trailer there was a box where inside there was a burger so immediately we worked hard to try and reach the burger so we could start the game. It was too far away for us to try and actually in real life walk to it so we had to just accept defeat. She didn’t get to see her first vr game where it would be possible to urinate. I saw a update post a few minutes ago where you were saying something about movemnet in the game that you have to grip and throw arms around or something? This I guess we didn’t try since usually moving is one of the triggers to teleport or just the stick like in any controller. Today we will try again and hopefully succeed in our task to urinate in a vr game! You could be making history today my friend. And for all the bad reviews for this game I want to just say a couple things: cmon dude. Its one guy whos making this game! It is cheap and early access... those already tell you a lot about the game and you should not expect a triple a title and the experience of the century. I went through a video game making school or whatever which took 3 years so it was not 2 weeks online course I just quit after the first week so I actually know a lot what it takes to make games and with this I can tell there has been some hours used to it, but again it’s only one dude. My game didn’t work either, but it might have been because we didn’t know how to play. I’m not complaining for 4 dollars, I’m not a hobo ;)\n\nEDIT: And there it is! A day after my review and a 170mb update with new features and a fix for not been able to play at all :) I wasn't able to walk earlier either, but I suppose yo may not be able to in the \"mainmenu\". Gotta go try the update once my friend visits again!\n- As someone who is as obsessed with Sentai/Tokesatsu/KamenRider/PowerRangers as he is with Megaman/RetroActionPlatformers, I would like to tell Domesticated Ant Games:\n\nThank you for developing this masterpiece. I know you didn't make it just for me, but it sure as hell felt like it.\n- [b]Content Warning[/b]: Some scenes could be upsetting to a trans person who has experienced family members shunning their true self. \n\nA 23-year-old [i]Irish[/i] trans woman struggles with her mother not knowing how to accept her true self while also feeling as though she has no where to belong, as sometimes even her peers struggle to fully understand her. As a means of escapism, she keeps a journal and writes stories about an astronaut and space explorer named Cassiopeia. \n\n[u]Praises[/u]\n    • Trans/enby representation.\n    • Aro/ace representation? I don’t know if the dev has clarified on this, but it’s my interpretation of the protagonist anyway. \n    • Creative game mechanics. The player erases entire scenes away or journal entries, then later, can write (choose where written words appear).\n    • Extremely stylized. It’s simple art, but the presentation and coloration of it makes it very unique. \n    • Lots of Irish terms and slang to learn. There’s even a glossary. There’s also an amusing achievement for playing the game in Irish. \n    • Speaking of languages, there are 12 languages available for the game!\n    • Encourages people to seek out help from those who are willing to give it. \n\n[u]Complaints[/u]\n    • “Making Memories Disappear” achievement. It involves doing excessive erasing for no real reason. Definitely not a fun reason. \n\nWhile there is some suffering for the protagonist, she does get a happy ending. [spoiler]Her mother does eventually stop being a b*tch.[/spoiler] All queers deserve happy endings.\nI absolutely recommend this awesome interactive story-rich game to all the queers of the world.\n- First of all - Subnautica is a good game. Very atmospheric, very scary and overall a really overwhelming experience. At first. \nThis might be the only negative review in this month, but I think some of you might appreciate a different view than \"omg this game is just awesome\". Which it kinda is, but in some points it maybe isnt.\n\nThis first section of the review doesnt contain any major spoilers for the story, just a comment on the overall progress through the game stages.\nAt the time of writing this review, I played the game for ~ 35 hours, I have advanced quite a bit. The first few hours were fantastic, I was looking for new things to explore, the blueprints for all the stuff that I need and every new thing felt like I made a progress. But then at a certain point nothing new happend. It seemed to me like I had all resources I could ever need (even the blue crystals), I had all the vehicles you could build, all the upgrades I needed.\nAnd then there was no challenge anymore. You build your submarines, your bases and the game gets too easy, its not a challenge anymore. Don't continue reading after this point, if you havent played the game yet.\n\n[spoiler] The big strength of this game is the immersion in the seemingly endless underwater worlds. But at a certain point this immersion breaks (at least it did for me).\nNone of the monsters can really harm you, not even the biggest ones are a real threat. Just hop into you seamoth and out-speed everything. If there is a leviathan, just hug the walls or strave, they cant catch you. And if they do, just step out, repair your ship and continue. None of the threats is really dangerous. You really need to have bad luck to die. And if you do ... nothing happens. You just respawn.\nAt first the map seems endless, since you cant move fast. But once you get the seamoth, the map is very finite. Sure, there are deeper levels you cant access with the moth, but everything on the surface is within reach. Its the same with the deeper levels and the prawnsuit.\nSurvival is hard at first, since you constantly need to get water and food. Once you can plant you own food, you have unlimited supply and the survival aspect becomes just an annoyence.\n\nAnother thing that bothers me is the amount of resources you need to build stuff. In the later part of the game you need to build a giant structure. But the necessary resources are just like \"get 3 wooden planks, 2 nails and a hammer\". And with these resources you build the statue of liberty.\n\nMy last point is about the storyline. After something like 15 hours into the game there was a major stall for me - I had no clue where to go, to me it seemed like I searched everything I had access to at that time. I searched for 10 hours and found nothing. I went to the Islands twice to check if I missed anything, but no. I dont know, maybe I just had bad luck and something didnt trigger right, I missed a hint somewhere or something. It eventually went on, but on that point I already had the big submarine, the prawnsuit and everything. The story felt like I just need to run from A to B and back, there was no challenge anymore. \n [/spoiler]\n\nSo anyways. If you made it this far in the review, thanks for reading. If you disagree with me, thats totally fine for me. I don't want to ruin the game for anyone, maybe the points that bother me dont mean much to you.\nI know that my critique is pretty harsh. There are many positive aspects in this game. If you can really dive into this game and fully roleplay it, submerge in its story and ignore some flaws, this is a fantastic game.\nBut maybe some of you are like me, so some of my mentioned points could bother you too.\nThanks for reading, I hope I didnt butcher the English language too badly, feel free to comment, if you like.\n- Know your History: \n\nMany of you will already know this, but this game has ties much deeper than you think. It's no secret that Bethesda's Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim had extended it's life through an extensive modding community. For decades, literally, ENBs, shaders, textures, companions, and even story-lines added THOUSANDS of hours to an already sizable game. One story-line mod was called \"The Forgotten City\".  Over the next few years since it's release, the mod had acquired awards such as the 2016 Australian Writers' Guild Award, Zero Period Top 5 Quest Mods of 2015, and others. It was an astounding mod that threw the dragon born into a deeply profound, well written, and engaging story. It was a staple for my personal mod list for years. I've played the Skyrim version countless times, but as soon as I saw this release I immediately bought this and booted it up. \nObviously this is nothing like the mod, both visually or engine wise, but the spirit of the game is still there. It's more defined, expanded, and developed. It deserves every award and accolade it's received. When I walked into the opening scene and fell down the tunnel I couldn't help but shake my head and smile as a wave of nostalgia mixed with new expectations flooded my mind:\n\n\"My god, they've done it.\" \n\nHere's to you, Modern Storyteller, all the best and more to come!\n- One of the best games I have ever played\n----------------------------------------------\n- Runs really well on most computers\n- Looks great regardless\n- Gameplay is heroin-tier addictive\n- High replay value\n- Big f-ing guns \n- If you like metal this game is for you\n- There isn't much wrong with this game\n- 10/10\n\nFLAWS\n----------------------------------------\n-You have the option to turn the music down\n- WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO DO THAT\n- Persona 5 ain't shit\nPokemon ain't shit\nFinal Fantasy ain't shit.\n\nStar Ocean 2's been the shit, will always be the shit, and with this remaster - IS THE BEST REMASTER FOR A JRPG OF ALL TIME. THE GOAT FROM SPACE RETURNS!\n\nAlso is it just me or is Precis extra horny on main? I don't recall her being this forward on the PS1, but hey - cool game that doesn't shy away from the old stuff on the hunt for ESG Blackrock points.\n\nTEN OUTTA TEN\n- Absolutely the second best (half-life Alyx is the best game) VR game I have played in the last 5+ years.  Both RM1 and RM2 are fantastic, superb graphics, excellent story and game play.  I took my time and explored and the game time ended up just over 13 hours.  But the big diff is this game was developed by a very small non-AAA team while Half life Alyx was created with a large AAA dev team with unlimited budget.  The quality/game play of recently released VR games has been exceptionally poor and very disappointing to say the least.  But NOT THIS GAME, RED MATTER 2 excels in every area and is simply a great game that will keep you playing.     \n\nI played using Vive Pro 1 wireless with vive wands and had no issues with controllers or my HMD.  I am saddened that the game play for me is over now that I beat the game......i really enjoyed playing this game and can only hope that Vertical Robot will soon release another similar game........or MAYBE RM3!\n\nGREAT WORK DEVS..........this game must be selected as game of the year!\n- This is such a great game. It's a well put together survival game with many things to do. Whether you want to just build a sandbox wilderness empire or try to escape, it's entirely fun no matter what. I've tried to actually complete the game, but I always end up building a massive epic fortress complete with my very own beefalo farm. The only thing that I personally don't like about this game is the stumble-upon style of actually completing the quests (they're not really quests, but I can't think of anything else to call them). Other than that, this game is a beautiful masterpiece. Very artistic, creative and fun. I definitely recommend it to anyone who loves survival games of any sort.\n- Lots of people parrot the \"tech demo\" or \"benchmark of the singularity\" lines without forming their own opinions.\n\nMe personally, as a fan of Supreme Commander, I enjoyed this game more then I thought I would. I only played the single player campaigns and haven't touched multiplayer. \n\nThe gameplay is exactly what it should be for this kind of game. When I first saw this game I didn't like how every unit was a hovering unit, but it makes sense with the class system the game has. Frigates are basically infantry, Cruisers are tanks, Dreadnauts are hero/high tier. The game borrows from Dawn of War with the territory control mechanic.\n- In my personal opinion,Total War Warhammer 3 is better than its predecessor in every way.\n\nFactions:\nThey did an excellent job t fine tuning the older factions to the point where every faction now feels fully fleshed out and playable. The starting units are fun and the starting areas are usually in a better position. Sure, some factions start off in a really awkward ass places with really strong armies surrounding them, but overall, everything feels much more thought out.\n\nThe new factions they added to this game are fun altho for someone who might be just getting into the game, id recommend going with someone like Grand Cathay and move on from there.\n\nMap:\nThe world map is huge and i love it. The battle fields you fight in are detailed and look absolutely stunning. Fights look like movies sometimes so grab some popcorn and watch your armies die since you were munching on popcorn and not moving your units.\n\nRTS:\nthe RTS side of this game is what got the biggest improvement in my opinion. Everything is so much more clear and the battles just look insanely good. The game feels a bit more fast phase which i don't mind at all since WH2 felt like a battle of attrition sometimes and missile infantry seemed really bad.\n\nOverall i can safely say this i my favorite game currently. The multiplayer is super fun but judging by the reviews some of you leave on this game, its safe to say you have no friends to play with. \n\nDLC might cost bit more than it used to but people will complain about anything if its not free.\n- Please please please give this one a try, especially if you're a fan of existentialism, bittersweet stories, cyberpunk dystopias, gambling with your life every day, living life one step at a time, the small things that matter, cats and feeling like sh!t, but in a good way\n- EDIT:\n\nWhile I have played Squad quite a bit for a few years, the large update named \"V6.0 Infantry Combat Overhaul\" unfortunately did not sit well with me.\n\nThe goals for the update:\n\n- Increase length of fights.\n- Reduce the impact of lone wolfs (solo players).\n- Increase emphasis on teamwork mechanics, which mainly meant supression.\n- Increase gunplay diversity, to create choices between optics, since the old meta meant that the magnified optics were greatly outperforming iron sights and holo sights.\n\nWhile I do not disagree with some of the goals, the implementation of them left a lot to be desired.\n\nAfter the update most gunfights became a mess of supression, without either side being able to effetively kill each other beyond 200m.\nGunhandling was also drastically nerfed, creating the sense that your character has never held a rifle before, or even used an optic for that matter.\n\nI can unfortunately no longer recommend this game, since I myself no longer feel drawn to play it.\n\nIf enough changes are made, I may revisit the game and this review, but for now there are better options out there.\n\n\n** OLD REVIEW ** \n\nCan the game be amazing and fun - yes! Do I recommend this for everyone? - No.\n\nThe experience of the game largely depends on what servers / communities you play with. If you play the core game with no moderation (no rules or admins), the game will become a race to make the first unit and lock others out and a race to get armor, then proceed to rush the enemy and end up spawnkilling them near their main spawn.\n\nIf you play on moderated servers with established rules and active admins, then you may experience a great sense of teamplay - other times not so much.\n\nBefore you buy it though...\n\n- Microphone and willingness to use it is REQUIRED for a good experience (People will quickly kick or become hostile towards you, if you do not communicate)\n- This is not battlefield or call of duty, running of solo to pull off 360 noscopes will probably get you kicked/ killed.\n- You will die without knowing from where and you will get into situations in which you have no option to survive, especially if you're new to tactical shooters.\n- You will end up running... A lot..\n- Armor is not like battlefield or call of duty, you need a driver, gunner, commander and possibly a loader (has a machinegun). Where you hit the enemy matters as much as what you hit him with (Armor piercing on his front turret will likely bounce, but even a high explosive may hurt if you can hit him up the rear)\n\nStill here... ?\n\nIf I haven't scared you off, here are my personal tips:\n- Play. The. Tutorial.  Like really...\n- Try different graphic settings, shadows especially makes a big difference in enemy visibility (game looks better with them though)\n- Start as infantry and pick rifleman, but remember to join a squad.\n- Find a server that seems to have active admins and have a ruleset you agree with.\n- Try NOT to give up when you die, generally it isn't worth throwing away a ticket to respawn if you have friendlies within 100m. Sometimes it is the right choice, but before you know which is which, it's a good idea to hold on for a medic.\n- Not all squad leaders know what they're doing, do not be afraid to join another squad if it turns out your squad leader is a fool.\n- Defending is often as important (if not more), than attacking... But you may end up waiting 30 minutes without getting shot at or shooting anyone.\n\n\nAs you can probably tell... Squad is a community based game, with in-depth enough mechanics, while also being easily accessable.\nIf you want a good sense of what the game is, check out some lesser known streamer playing it (bigger streamers will often give you the wrong sense of what a game is like)\n\nHope this helped you make an informed decision.\n\nbut for now there are better options out there.\n- It's about time i wrote a proper review for one of my favourite games ever.\n\nRivals of Aether is a platform fighter that tries to follow Super Smash Bros. Melee and P+'s footsteps by making a competitive focused game, but also while trying to keep it more accessible than the former. The game also has a very active workshop that allows players to create their own characters and play ones made by other creators, alongside custom made stages and buddies.\n\nI will focus on the purist aspect of the game first.\n\nAs for many \"smash clones\", the game will feel very familiar to people who already played a smash game, with the controls being nearly identical but with some key differences:\n\n1. THERE'S NO SHIELD. Rivals of Aether is probably the first game in its genre to forgo the iconic \"bubble\" shield, choosing it to replace it with a parry instead. Parries are riskier, staying out for a few frames, and will reward you immensely by either stunning the opponent or reflecting their projectiles. Since parrying is so risky, the game's neutral and defense (but also its offense) will be focused on movement, especially thanks to wavedashing, wavelanding alongside some more niche or character specific movement techs. \n\n2. THE STAGES HAVE NO LEDGES. This means your way to safety when you get knocked off the stage will be actually landing onto the main platform, rather than aiming for the ledges. Rightfully so, the game offers much more options when offstage compared to smash games, with every character having access to wall jumping, an airdodge that doesn't send in freefall and the ability to walljump and cancel special falls, allowing you to use your up special two times. This means the offstage game is a lot deeper than in other game, as there will always be a way back onto the stage since almost every character is allowed a lot of freedom while in disadvantage.\n\n3. THERE'S NO GRABS. There's not much to add here; the absence of a shield makes grabs unnecessary, and thus they're not present in the game. Some characters have command grabs, though.\n\nThere's a total of 14 characters in Rivals of Aether (free from the beginning), with 4 more to come in future patches. Although the cast might seem very slim for people who are used to smash games, it's incredibly diverse. Enough to probably warrant you to try every character. Each character has a lot of depth and can shape the stage in some way. Some fighters take inspiration from smash characters, such as Clairen having a tipper mechanic like Marth, or Absa having Ness and Mewtwo's movement turned up to 200 and Zelda's lightning kicks; this means you'll probably find a character you're familiar with in case you're not confident to play with a brand new character yet. It's also worth mentioning that the game is very balanced, with tiers being very subjective. Regardless, RoA's current top player plays the character that is considered the worst in the game by most, so that should prove that the balance state is very good.\n\nNetplay is not perfect, but it's very good and playable. As i'm writing this review, there's currently a beta build that includes rollback netcode, which presents a couple of bugs and desyncs but does its job quite well. Default build uses delay netcode, which also works just fine in case you're dissatisfied with the rollback beta. Rollback is expected to become the default build once the dev team fixes all its kinks.\n\nEvery stage has both an \"aether\" (casual, with hazards) mode and a \"basic\" (competitive, no hazards) mode. Every single stage in \"basic\" mode is tournament legal (with the exception of tempest peak in some regions), adding a lot of stage variety. Aether stages are aimed for a casual audience, with some spicy traps and whacky platform arrangements for a more casual and laidback experience.\n\nOn that topic, there's no items in this game, so the chaotic free-for-all  factor goes down by a notch, to the discomfort of players who like the party game side of platform fighters.\n\nThe community may be small, but it's very active and constantly organizes weekly and monthly tournaments, with the active (financial and whatnot) support of the game devs themselves, so you will quickly find a community in which to play. Sadly, though, having a small community means you'll be bound to experience some \"dead lobbies\" from time to time.\n\nSolo play, i'll have to be honest, is incredibly lackluster. This game was mainly thought to be played with other players and as a result, single player content is very scarce. There's an arcade-styled story mode which only features a handful of characters (the original 4+2 more), that will have you fight some random fighters until you reach your character's \"rival\" at the end of the story. The cutscenes go from average to bad, depending on the character's story. Each story is very simple and resolves itself in the course of 5 encounters, with a super boss+ a final cutscene once you complete every character's story mode\n\nThere's also \"endless abyss\" mode. It's similar to smash's multi-man mode, where you'll fight a never ending horde of weak cpus, with some minigames slapped inbetween, like a platforming section or explosive enemies. You will have to fight a weaker version of the story mode's boss after a set number of waves each time. The most interesting part of this gamemode is probably the rune system. The rune system will allow to buy runes with the in-game currency that will make your character stronger, be it by making them faster/more powerful or improving their moves. These runes can also be used in abyss versus, which is basically pvp but with runes.\nSadly, endless abyss can become repetitive very quickly, with its never changing waves and gimmicks and grind you have to go through to be able to buy (and use) your runes.\n\nThere's one more mode called Tetherball. It's actually a PvP mode, but i'm putting it in the solo play paragraph because it's a very casual mode. Simply put, the goal of this mode is to hit a beach ball that is attached to a pole by a string and make it spin around it. You score one point when the ball-on-a-string completely wraps the pole. You will have to fight your opponent to keep the control of the ball, as they can hit it as well and make the ball \"theirs\". It's a very fun but often shunned aside mode so i felt like putting it in this review. Please, play Tetherball with me. \n\n\nAs for workshop...\n\nIf you're not big on the competitive scene of platform fighters, this is probably why you came to this store page and. as you may have gathered, casual play is not very fleshed out, with only aether mode and some solo modes as your only options. That's where workshop shines! You'll be able to download hundreds of play made characters, some with the intent of being serious, competitive fighters, while others (most) are aimed to a more casual audience. Characters can go from original characters to the reckless wii mote guy, so you'll have plenty of fun by browsing the worshop page and finding the perfect character, be it an original character or a direct transposition of greninja from Smash Ultimate. Needless to say, you'll also have a huge choice of stages and music packs, alongside some hidden gems like new gamemodes that often pass under the radar. I bet you didn't know you could play Uno in Rivals of Aether!\n\n\n\nTo wrap things up, i'd like to comment on the great pixel art graphics which does its job very well and will appeal to retro gamers specifically, and give my shoutouts on the incredible OST made by flashygoodness. Every track fits the stage perfectly and gives the right atmosphere to this fast paced fighting game.\n\nIn other words this game is a very good purchase for both casual players, thanks to the workshop, and competitive players because of its deep yet accessible design. I hope this review made whoever is reading it consider buying Rivals of Aether and join the community.\n- If you want to cut your teeth on the Final Boss of box-pushing puzzle games, then have I got the game for you.\n\nRight out of the gate SSR offers a somewhat uneven mix of real head-scratchers and what I can only describe as pity puzzles, but quickly reveals itself to be the sort of puzzler that mandates particularly extensive sessions of staring at the seemingly inconsequential number of tiles onscreen and poking experimentally at them until something starts to click. This demands a little more patience than I ordinarily have, but I was starting to appreciate the design as I acclimatized to it.\n\nThen I arrived at The Great Tower level (in only the second subsection of the overworld), which all at once foists about 4 times more pieces on you than you've dealt with previously, while simultaneously introducing a Z-axis and the concept of using pieces as platforms mid-puzzle.\n\nSSR does have a well-executed and forgiving Undo function with basically unlimited storage which is a great thing to have up until the time spent rewinding would outweigh the time spent to simply restart the puzzle and do over; the only way it could be made practical on a level that large would be if you had a full-on timeline scrubber like in the rerelease of Duke Nukem 3D.\n\nThere's patience, there's logic, and then there's [b]this.[/b] I play puzzle games to try and [i]relieve[/i] stress, not the other way round. It's a solid design, and I'd probably recommend it to the REALLY die-hard logicians and puzzle fanatics. To the sort like me who enjoy puzzles but prefer there to be some sort of ceiling to their complexity, Gaben help you if you're going to try and soldier through this thing. I would even call Infinifactory a lot more accessible than this is.\n- Stellaris is the contemporary 4X sci fi galactic empire grand strategy to play.  The spiritual successor to ancient space exploration games like Master of Orion and Star Wars: Rebellion.  Start out with just your homeworld and send out scout ships and colonies until you've got your own star empire. \n\nManage your population, tell them what to build, design your own spaceships and fleet structures, and then get pounded into the dirt by the far too cheaty AI... yeah, it's another one of those games where because it's hard to make the AI smart, Paradox decided instead to just make the AI units cheat and become ridiculously overpowered.\n\nI have to say the game is probably far too difficult even if you set all the difficulty to the easiest levels, it's unclear what the developers were thinking, but you can mod the game easily in Steam Workshop to make it viable to play single player. \n\nAs with all Paradox games the DLC pricing is murder, and it adds very little to the core game experience, so my advice is to grab this on sale if you were a fan of MOO, go straight to Steam Workshop and mod it until it's playable, and then you'll have a perfect time sink well worth your money.\n- A really well-crafted piece of interactive media, that sets a very high bar for future video game \"making of\" projects. \n\nI had only vaguely heard of Karateka before, but nevertheless really enjoyed how this story was told. All the supporting documents, assets and (playable) prototypes are presented in a neat timeline, alongside the released games and remasters, with video interviews that tie it all together into a great story.\n\nIf you have an interest in video game history, solo video game development, or game publishing in the 1980s, do yourself a favor and check this out!\n- In my ongoing and likely futile effort to write a Steam review for every game in my library (#21 out of 500+)... it's time for Trails in the Sky: The 3rd.\n\nIf you haven't played both Trails in the Sky and Trails in the Sky SC, go away. This game is not for you.\n\nIf you have played the Trails in the Sky duology, you're almost certainly going to buy this game no-questions asked. Which is fine. Clearly you are a person of impeccable taste and judgment. There are, however, a few things you should probably be aware of before you dive it.\n\nThe 3rd is not really an indpendent game in its own right--it's more of a Gaiden game. It functions mostly as an extended epilogue to the classic Trails in the Sky duology, while also laying down the foundations for future story arcs (upon which much has been built in the Crossbell and Erebonia sequences).\n\nThe game is effectively divided into three kinds of content: lots of dungeon crawling; mostly indpendent character scenes (taking the form of flashbacks) featuring familiar characters from the prior two Sky games; and mini-games! The dungeon-crawling is fairly generic, as the combat system here is more or less the same as in the prior games, and many of the environments you'll be exploring are the exact *same* environments you explored back in FC and SC. There are some new areas to explore, but not many, and personally I found them too abstract to be very interesting. The mini-games are extremely varied and range from incredibly tedious (playin' poker with Gambler Jack) to the amazing (airship shmup!), and can be a lot of fun. The real meat of the game are the character vignettes, all of which are--at the very least--amusing. If you're here, you've likely already fallen in love with these characters, and you'll be glad to know that everyone gets their time in the spotlight here, and the character writing is as strong as ever.\n\nThat said, not everything is sunshine and roses.There is a \"present\" story arc tying all of those flashbacks, dungeons and mini-games together. and... there's no getting around it: it's not very good. The story is short and relatively predicable, with little dialog and less exposition. Our new protagonist, Kevin Graham, performs solidly here--but fails to be quite as interesting as he was in SC--and his lovely lady heroine, Ries Argent, is among the least compelling characters in the entire Trails pantheon, owing mostly to her lack of screenstime. She is absent from entire swaths of the game, and despite her enormous potential, simply does not get sufficient dialog to properly develop. She really only interacts with Kevin, infrequently, and is isolated from the rest of the cast.\n\nUtlimately Trails in the Sky: The 3rd is a bit underwhelming. It's a fun romp, but it could have been so much better with a little more focus on the narrative. The absence of NPCs to talk to, the simplistic structure of the plot, and the underdeveloped heroine are all flaws that are difficult to dismiss.\n- I was waiting to be a bit further into the game to give my thoughts on some of the early complaints I've seen cropping up around this game.\n\nFrankly I do not think this game will be for everyone, but some of the people leaving negative reviews are morons.\n\nNo progression in this game is not locked behind story progress. There are several ways the game marks player progression, and while story progression is one of them. The reward track, gear, and gems are the other. You can consider all of this side-content in some way. You mostly make additional progress through exploration and side quests in this game. Each time you enter a new area you're given several tasks on a reward track that allow you to gain SP to level up your skills, and the reward material that allows you to learn new skills. As you learn new skills your character's stats go up. Exploration and sidequests also allow you to gain unique materials that you sell to merchants that open up deals that allow you to buy high level equipment that give large power boosts to your party. The gem system allows you to slot  gear with upgrades to further customize your characters, and all weapons/armor are able to be upgraded twice.\n\nIf you go out of your way to find the hidden treasures, beat the unique monsters, and finish side quests you can sort of trounce the challenges in this game. Class Emblems which give 'very' large power boosts are also hidden out of the way sometimes. You really just have to search for them, but by no means are they necessary.  I have had no difficulty at all in this game. It's relatively easy to grasp, but it does ask you to pay attention a little more than most JRPGs. If you interact with the systems the game has then the progression curve is smooth. If you don't -- that's not really the game's fault.\n\nOn the subject of the Overdrive Bar. Once you get into it the upper left corner will ask you to use a SINGLE move to help maintain the bar. It will ask you to use either: A physical attack, magic attack, buff, debuff, or utility spell. It is not hard to throw in one of these during the party's turn, and you very much can spam moves over and over again. The system is not at all that obtrusive, again, you just have to pay attention. \n\nIf for some reason all of this is not good enough for a player on a baseline level. There are accessibility options that allow you to adjust how aggressive enemies are, how high their stats are, and you can even make the overdrive bar extremely more forgiving. \n\nThe world is well crafted, the story is fine thus far, the combat is fun and it does try some new things. I certainly appreciate the experience for what it is. The price they're charging for this game feels absolutely criminal, and there's clearly a lot of love put into it. Give it a shot.\n- Coming up to 5000 hours playing this game, and im still learning new things in multiplayer.  \n\nThe devs are by far the best ive ever seen.  FFF (Friday Fun Facts) is a blog post they write up every Friday.  Every. Single. Friday. For the last ... 4 years?  look at them on their website, its not a 2 min blurb, its a full review of what they've done that week, and where they're headed, what their plans are, current iterations they're going over, complete with pictures and sometimes *chuckle* hand drawn graphs.  \n\nTheir IRC channel (there is a link on their website) has someone on the dev team there pretty much 24/7.  Not just \"community manager\" nitwits (Trangar, te he), but guys like Rseding91 (their C++ guru) that are programming the actual updates.  \n\nOh.  There are updates.\n\nAre there sometimes bugs in the patches?  Sure.  Which is why you sometimes see 2 patches in the same day.  Bugs get quashed immediately whenever possible.  \n\nWhile this review doesnt speak much about the game, the team behind it deserves the recognition - its amazing, thoughtul, and incredibly well done because of them.\n\nIn a nutshell, its similar to RTS games like starcraft, where you build up and gather resources.  But instead of spending 20 minutes to build up a base to have the game end in 2, you keep building.\n\nBuilding Bigger.\n\nMaking things more efficient.\n\nTearing down and rebuidling.\n\nIm almost 5000 hours in and sticking with vanilla until I can personally say Ive mastered it.  Once I stop learning new things almost every time I play, ill start fooling around with mods.  And there are lots of them.  \n\nIs this game worth $20?  It absolutely was for me.  This single $20 purchase brought me thousands of hours of entertaintment, frustration - when things didnt work planned, and absolute delight - when things get fixed, and I can reflect on my orchestra of 500 machines working in harmony.  \n\nWhether or not it is worth it for you is up to you.  But I would be remiss if i didnt impore you to give it a try, get the demo, fool around, commit an hour or two.\n\n\n- Let's say you capture a prisoner after a bloody raid on your colony. Do you want to:\n\n1. Let them go in the hopes of improving relations with the attackers? YOU CAN DO THAT.\n\n2. Heal them and have colonists talk to them about how great your colony is until they join? YOU CAN DO THAT.\n\n3. Have a colonist with a high medical skill remove their liver to transplant into an alcoholic colonist? YOU CAN DO THAT.\n\n4. Have a colonist with a low medical skill remove their organs just for practice? YOU CAN DO THAT.\n\n5. Eat them because you forgot to stock up on food for the winter? YOU CAN DO THAT.\n\nReally, what else do you need in a game?\n- Pretty fun and polished for a fast paced shooter.\nOn the technical side, the game ran well and I encountered very few bugs: in a few cases I got stuck in the level geometry, but then a failsafe teleported me back to a safe spot after a few seconds, and in another case I got softlocked by a broken level trigger but reloading the last checkpoint fixed it.\nAll the weapons are fairly useful and interesting, and they can be combined in creative ways instead of the extremely boring \"use A on B\" seen in Doom Eternal.\nEnemy variety is pretty good, even the lowest tiers are different enough to require a bit of attention.\nThe levels also aren't bad, but you have so much mobility that it's easy to sequence break by accident and in some cases skip past large chunks of them.\nSecrets aren't terrible, no wall humping required in this game, but given the sheer size of most levels they can be pretty tedious to find even when no attempt is made to hide them: in some cases, the opposite is true and you'll just walk into a \"secret\" by looking to your side as you follow the intended path.\nDifficulty is odd: I was playing on Street Cleaner (the middle of the 5 difficulty levels), and around the halfway point the game went from \"very easy\" to \"very hard\", with plenty of attacks dealing 300+ damage when the most you can stack is 200 health and 200 armor.\nAt least, the augments you collect in-game and the mutators you unlock by finding secrets offer plenty of ways to fine-tune the difficulty level: for example, you can enable infinite ammo and instagib to breeze through even the hardest difficulty, or disable all weapons but your chainsaw leg and triple enemy spawns to turn even the easiest difficulty into a bit of a challenge.\nFinally, there's a level editor and that's always nice.\n\nWorth playing, even at full price.\n- [h1] Risk of rain 2 is the kind of roguelike where you wanna have just one more quick run before bed but end up playing till dawn. [/h1]\n\n[b] Visuals: [/b] \nThe art style is easy on the eyes early on, but as the run continues and your screen starts to fill with clutter, the diarrhoea christmas lights at later stages can be seizure inducing.\n\n[b] Story and Setting: [/b] \nRoR2 doesn’t hold hands and guide you through its story because honestly there is not much story going on here. There is rich lore to explore for people who want to.\n\n[b] Music: [/b] \nThe lo-fi melody perfectly fits the perilous environment and matches the gameplay with synced rhythm and tempo. Sound design is good too.\n\n[b] Gameplay and progression: [/b]\nDrop into a planet, kill monsters, get money, buy items. Rinse and repeat until you become powerful to one shot God himself. Fast paced with constant running, jumping, sliding and juggling between primary weapon, secondary weapon, abilities and equipment. In each run the difficulty increases over time, which is an innovative approach to deal with difficulty. The roster is filled with unique characters who each have their own gameplay mechanics, making the game feel completely different. \nMost items can be obtained by completing specific challenges. You can also unlock game modifiers to make the game easier or more difficult to your liking. The challenges are one-of-a-kind, and the rewards are meaningful enough to keep players interested.\n\n[b] Game time: [/b]\nThere is no limit. It stops being fun when you decide so.\n\n[b] Online: [/b]\nThere is co-op to enjoy with friends and difficulty scales with the number of players. And if you have no friends, rest assured because all achievements are attainable through single player.\n\n[b] Bugs: [/b]\nNo bugs or technical issues.\n\n[b] PC Requirement: [/b] \nWithout a decently powerful PC the game faces severe lags and occasional crashes in long runs where you loop multiple times and a million things are happening in the background. Lowering graphical settings can help to an extent.\n\n[b] DLC: [/b]\nSurvivors of the Void DLC adds excellent new characters, stages, items,  enemies and alternate endings.\n\n[b] Price: [/b]\nWorth every penny.\n\n[b] My only problem with the game is it doesn’t have a save system. Once you start a run, you will have to see it through to the end. I want to be able to stop at any stage and continue from there later on. I don’t always have hours required to do multiple loops in one sitting. Although there is a mod for saving, I would love a native option. [/b]\n\n[b] Rating: [/b] \nThe Devs are continuously supporting and updating the game which is commendable. The community is very active and you can add tons of community made [b] mods [/b] to breathe new life into your game. \nI highly recommend it. [b] 10/10 [/b]\n- ooooh im pigging out\n\njust like the original risk of rain but significantly more approachable!\n\nthey added controls, chris christododoldoaul and a bunch of retextures, got rid of that gup blackface enemy\nawesome\n\nthanks poopoo games for the review copy\n\n(spoilers ahead)\n\nincluding the mastery skins and void fiend from risk of rain 2 was an awesome surprise, nice to see so much new content\n\nonly complaint is the 100 dillar price tag for the game but otherwise a must buy\n\nUPDATE!!!\n\nAfter further playing, i have many very genuine issues! These providence trials are IM POSSIBBLE! the critreriar are simply absurd, and drifter is practically unplayable in his current state!!!\n\ni have also found a MULTITUDTE of vines allowing me to clip out of bounds?!?!?!? how did this game get past play testing TWICE\n\ni am not fibbing when i say this game in in an unacceptable state, how is this not in early access?! ridiculous, genuinely. gearbox! how could you\n- You are an astronaut, you wake up in a rescue rocket, and against your wills you are shot from Theseus space station on Chori V planet. After landing on the planet you find a strange device that helps you get back on board and survive until help arrives.\n\nGreat game, get it on sale, because it is a bit short. I like games like Portal 2, The Talos Principle, and there is no point to compare this games, because they are completly different, even if they have few common things like solving riddles and story with fresh look at some philosophical questions. Point is that every one of them including The Swapper is good at what it do, and every one of them is unique. For me it is pleasure to play this game beacause of it atmospheric well done design, riddles and questioning the meaning of existence.\n- Why do people think they are funny and rating something in the opposite direction to what is obviously their true opinion?  There should be a rule against that.  Oh ya, and the \"game\" is cringe-worthy.  Get it for $0.01 and mine it for $0.04 worth of cards.\n- Horrible FOV, glitchy looking graphics, everything is blurred even with motion blur off, absolutely no chance of that multiplayer mod, shoddy PC port... Pretty boring and clunky tbh. Don't buy this.\n- ironic that the best sonic game was the one not made by sonic team\n- This game is so good! I actually teared up with some of the conversations (Nightgaunt and Riptide anyone??) and I definitely wasn't expecting that. All of the dialogue is super natural and the relationship's progress really cute. I honestly can't believe this game is free\n- Anti-Consumer DLC Practices. Capcom pls.\n\nWith the brand new release of Rashid, we now know you cannot buy a single character outright, you have to buy packs of in-game currency. And the pricing structure is such that you have to buy more coins than a character costs. \n\nRashid is going for 350 coins, the lowest amount you can be is 250 coins for $5, so you have to pay $10 for 500c or $12 for 610c and have leftovers.\n\nTypical scummy bullshit you would expect from a terrible mobile game. Capcom does not need to resort to such tactics to sell content for a game as popular as Street Fighter. All this does is make people like me on the fence want to avoid spending  any additional money on anything to avoid supporting predatory and consumer unfriendly practices. \n\nCapcom knows exactly what they're doing with these pricing structures and it's super friggen scummy of them. \n\nHopefully by the time they add characters I really want to buy in a few years, things have changed. I went from looking forward to future DLC characters, to it being something I would never want to pay for and support because of this trash. \n\nSo, thank you (and eff you) very much Capcom. Please turn this nonsense around ASAP and let us buy single DLC characters outright with actual money.\n- [h1]AT A GLANCE[/h1]\n(Full review follows below)\n\n[list]\n[*] [b]Game Name:[/b] The Swapper\n[*] [b]Original Release:[/b] 2013\n[*] [b]Genre Tags:[/b] Atmospheric; 2D; Puzzle-Platformer; Sci-Fi \n[*] [b]My Overall Grade:[/b] A-\n[*] [b]Estimated Playtime (Campaign):[/b] 3-5 hours\n[*] [b]Multiplayer Aspect:[/b] None\n[*] [b]Recommended To:[/b] Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Aesthetes; Game atmosphere connoisseurs; Strong narrative advocates; Puzzle game aficionados\n[/list]\t\n\n[h1]REVIEW[/h1]\n[b]The Swapper[/b] is an enjoyable 2D puzzle-platformer that lacks gameplay innovation but rises above the crowd on the shoulders of its superbly well-designed atmosphere and provocative narrative.  The actual puzzle-solving aspect of the game is adequate, but with minimal diversity and accretion.  It is definitely a story-driven experience, with the gameplay taking a passenger seat.  If you can appreciate a game in that style, this is a good bet for you. \n\nThe entrancing narrative and the style in which it transpires work in concert with the mystifying ambiance to create a wondrous experience. The story touches on some thought-provoking metaphysical issues, while skillfully avoiding a fall too deep into the rabbit hole to keep the average person’s interest. Much of the rest of the narrative is comfortable, cliché sci-fi tropes that we all know and love.\n\nThe gameplay and the puzzles are far from [i]bad[/i], but they also are nothing special.  As I alluded to: they are sufficient, but fail to develop into anything overly interesting. Very little changes from the first puzzle to the last, so it does get a little bit dry.  That said, some of the later ones are quite tricky and a few require not only puzzle-solving ability but also decent reflexes. \n\nThe graphics are pleasurable and align perfectly with the vibe of the game. But the whole soundscape is what truly brings the atmosphere of [b]The Swapper[/b] to life. The ambient soundtrack, the cryptic chatter, and the selectively placed voice-overs contribute a wonderful blend of emotions and mystery. If you are into it, this is a game you might enjoy with the lights off and your headphones on (or however else you may get into the zone).  \n\n[b]The Swapper[/b] is a brief, interesting, and enjoyable experience. It is not a complex or intricate puzzle-platformer, but I recommend it to any fan of the genre who would appreciate the atmosphere and narrative.\n\n[i][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/murphyslawyercuration#curation]Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations![/url][/i]\n- They added \"Precision\" mode for the mouse under controls, which is pretty much raw mouse movement. YAY!\n\nAnyway, one of my favorite games of all time easily at this point. Incredible story, fun combat, and awesome world. A must play for sure, especially if you've never played it before on Play-Station (like me). It also has a New Game Plus mode that unlocks different NG+ only armor that are insane.\n\nI played at normal, and aside from the Valkyries the other bosses are a cakewalk. Maybe play on hard or hardest.\n- This is a game that I have been looking forward to for at least 2 and a half years. I have wanted to have a game on the PC that had the elements of harvest moon (for the little bit I played of it), Animal crossing (<3) and Rune factory. I was super excited when I was approached by Leth (publishing manager at Chucklefish) at the beginning of December to help him and ConcernedApe (developer of the game) with bug testing and QA. 400+ hours later (off steam and on steam), I still love the game. \n\n[b]Farming.[/b] The farming is fantastic. It is to me one of the main elements of the game, and it's just a joy. Being able to design your farm any way you want it... yes please. Planning out what to buy every season, where to plant them, on top of the thrill of when you can harvest and reap on the gold... it's so enjoyable and addictive. \n\n[b]Fishing.[/b] The fishing is outstanding. From playing WoW and Runescape.. or any game with fishing, the fishing in Stardew Valley is so much fun. At first, the fishing is challenging, but as you progress your skill, you become a pro in no time.\n\n[b]Mining and combat.[/b] Mining and combat is incredible. Going deeper into the mines can be tough, but if you're prepared with your food and weapon in hand, you can fend off the creatures and get your sweet ore/minerals/gems that you want to bring back to your house and possibly hoard. (Hi, I'm Bexy, and i'm a hoarder.) \n\n[b]Social.[/b] Social interactions are great. Being able to become friends with the people in the town,  and eventually being able to get into relationships with people and having a family with them.. what's not to like about that? And what's great is that it gives great replayability because you can have different saves with different spouses! The backstory for each of the characters too is so in depth and well thought out, you will be silly if you don't shed a tear maybe once or twice. \n\n[b]Main story.[/b] The actual main story is well rewarding, and once you \"complete\" it, you can still continue on your adventures and farming life with no problems, hell you might even discover new things afterwards, I sure as hell did! \n\nYes, I was a tester for the game. Yes, I have played for ridiculous amounts of hours. It may feel like i'm being a bit overzealous with this. However you have to remember, I was a tester. I tested the crap out of every aspect with this game, even though there were massive game breaking bugs, errors, glitches, crashes. I still love this game. I reported many a bug, and ConcernedApe was quick to fix them. \n\nAnd that's the thing, not only is the game amazing, the developer is too. ConcernedApe works around the clock to make sure that bugs are fixed in quick time in order for us to have an amazing experience with this game. And that's true. The experience that you have with this game IS amazing. \n\nMinutes playing turn into hours. Hours turn into \"oh no it's time to sleep\".\nYou will forget about time. You will forget about sleep. You will forget that dinner was about 5 hours ago but you couldn't' remember because you were too busy trying to fight off 12 bats that were clobbering you inside the mines while trying to gather that 1 diamond waaaaay in the back. \n\nSo yes, I without a shadow of a doubt 150% recommend this game to anyone that wants to \"escape\" for days on end with what I am classifying as my #1 Game of 2016.\n- Yume Nikki is a game that is better spent playing blind through. If you are thinking of playing this game, DO NOT LOOK AT YOUTUBE FOR ANY HINTS. There is no losing the game, and there is no winning the game, but if you look at youtube, you will lose a lot of the thematic feel of the game.\n\nI REPEAT, DO NOT LOOK AT YOUTUBE OR ANY OTHER GUIDE. YOU WILL MISS OUT ON AN EXPERIENCE.\n\nSaying that, Yume Nikki is a interactive experience following a young woman's dreams. By sifting through her dreams, you may come to conclusions about the player character's life, or you may find yourself reflecting on events in your life. I heartily reccomend this game to those who like mystery and speculation.\n- AAA Industry: NOOOOOO!!! You can’t have a high quality and feature complete campaign with only a 6.5 GB install made by one guy using Unity, it has to be 200+ GB made by 5 studios and it needs to be an unfinished 3 hour mediocrity and gouge the consumers $70 USD for it!\n\nThis game: [b]HAHA LEG CHAINSAW GO BRRRR[/b]\n- Armored Souls Prepare to sigh....\nIf you are a long running fan of this game it's a mixed bag, if you are new to the series you might like it.\n\nFor the new comers this is robots on roller skates, also screw the natural laws of physics because it makes a cool game.  The key to this game is overwhelming fire power and maneuverability. Here's the rub for me I have AC1 and a PS2 to play it on, I have every US release of this game since AC1 to AC4A, I never finished Nine breaker as it was boring. Below are my gripes, my praise, then my mixed bag in order of paragraphs.\n\nFirst the bad: this game is infested with mechanics that are from Dark Souls and have no place in an AC game.  In no order here they are: status effects, stunning other players,  firing hand weapons cause you to stop moving and leave yourself vulnerable,  repair kits (the flasks from souls), being stunned due to poise (or whatever new dumb name they called it), resupply before a boss fight, and 360 shields.  Stats effects build up like they do in dark souls, this is new to the franchise and really has no place in it, I could see heat weapons causing things to over heat more quickly and maybe some other things, the way this is done is so odd, it feels like a multiplayer add on.  Although its fun to stun bosses and other opponents, this is new to the game and feels like it doesn't belong, I can only assume its been added for competitive multi again.  There's always been this idea that traumatic impacts don't hit the pilots in this game, it's just always been like that and considering the tech it make sense. The latter is true for your AC being stunned too.  AC as a series has gone back and fourth on making you stop to fire a BACK mounted weapon unless you had quad legs or a tank base, this game is the first where a hand weapon makes you stop to fire it.  This is an utter anathema to the game in general, maneuverability and quickly timed dodges were always key.  It ruins your ability to stay moving and fight effectively, which also limits the fun in building and designing your AC.  I don't think there is an AC game in the US with \"repair kits\" yet.  I'm not saying get gud we don't need repair kits, but they are just a distraction to me with no added value.  Giving a player a very high health value is not bad, but I makes each engagement more meaningful, I need to keep my HP high, their are may fights I had where I didn't need to bother with them.  Adding to this mess is the boost before a boss fight, they were never announced like this before; whatever HP you had going in was all you got.  This sticks with me, because the most memorable boss in the whole series was the only one I cannot beat: I took too much damage before the boss fight every time, no magic box to helped me out.  For those of you who are curious it was Zinaida in last Ravens, the suicide drones took too much out of me before the battle.  In AC4A and AC4 there were 360 shields, I'm only guessing, but the shields seemed to mitigate damage.  I don't know because don't get hit or kill them fast has always been my basic plan.  In this new one, its just another health bar that exists for reasons... I don't mind the old shield system give up a defensive advantage for things like assault armor blasts.\n\nThe good stuff.  I like the mix of common enemies being easily dispatched, but still being a threat if you are too slow.  Adding to this is the more dangerous commons like the quad leg MT's.  There is a good combat balance here with crazy mini bosses mixed in like the stealth sniper bots. The bosses are big and badass, with some conventions thrown out the window like the bull charging boss not being weak after a charge. I did hate all the boss fights that involved a 360 shield. The world looks great, yup just darn purdy.  The new super fast tank base inspired by a wheel chair is dumbly fun.  The odd addition of quad legs letting you basically hover is novel and adds some depth to the outfitting of an AC.  Keeping reverse joint legs making you jump faster/higher is classic. The more effective AOE weapons on groups feels more strategic or a the very least feels damn cool when you nail three targets with one shot. Finally letting your AC back mount hand weapons and switch to them at the price of a second or two is a massive evolution, I love it, it should have always been there.\n\nSo there some other things that have changed, which I have mixed thoughts about.  There's now a thing with chips that make you more resilient to damage and other RPGesq things, cool I guess, its another reason to do the arena.  I still will kill them all until I am #1. Hidden objects are now in the game, I don't like them, but whatever, first time I have had to google anything on AC game other then where to buy it.  The plot is oddly boring for me, I think that's just me, last game being AC4A. The game announces when you are making a plot altering decision, its ok, but I would like it if the world just reacted to my decisions naturally no banners.  Weak spots on bosses,  ok its a thing, but firing an AT or plasma weapon at something (that isn't a soft spot) does nothing...not matter how many impacts, ehhh fine. \n\nI'm not done with the game, but over all fun.  Quit making armored souls and make Armored Core.  I was here before demon souls and I will be here after whatever souls, but only if you just keep making ARMORED CORE.  Is there a Japanese word for purity of purpose or ideal? I could use it to try and get my point across. \n\n\nP.S. the fan community paint jobs uploaded on line are gold.\n\n- Luzia reminds me of a little me and the banter between the characters is very cute. \nThis game gives me big Spirited Away vibes but even after I finished it I am still lowkey confused who is who and what what whats've? \nThere were many touching moments [spoiler]esp the scene where Luzia said \"I can't save you but I can help you\" it struck me pretty hard because I always question whether or not one has the right to take their own life, and who are we to stop them...[/spoiler] Overall I actually feel this game is wholesome. It can teach one about what depression is like if you've never experienced it.\nI only got jumpscared once but it was a pleasant experience even then :3\n- At a first glance I thought I would hate [b]Human Fall Flat[/b]. \n“Oh, this is another one of those wonky psychics ragdoll games that are obnoxiously hard to control,” I thought. \n...\nAfter playing it, I can now confidently say that my first impression was spot on. The only surprise was how much I enjoyed playing it. \n \n[h1][u]Positive:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]I can’t fully explain why but I found Human Fall Flat charming. The “human” is adorably simplistic and can complete daunting tasks despite only being able to jump and grab onto things. It reminds me of a very energetic toddler, especially when you raise your arms and jump - [b]it’s so cute[/b]. Something about an awkward “human” taking on challenges makes me feel warm inside [i](is it weird that I feel like I’m watching a baby grow up?)[/i]. \n[*]The levels gradually get larger and the puzzles more complex. I find that this works well with the awkward movements of your character, as you progressively learn how to better control him/her. It’s almost as if you start off as a clumsy baby, learning how to move and perform simple tasks, and end up as an awkward adult, still clumsy but expected to complete harder tasks. \n[*]I’m impressed at how many interactable objects are included in this game. Paired with a pretty good physics engine and you can really have a blast. Swing on a vine like Tarzan? Why not. Row a boat? Sure. Shoot yourself out of a catapult? No one’s stopping you.\n[/list]\n\n[h1][u]Neutral:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]It’s not always clear what you are expected to do, but I guess that’s kind of the point of Human Fall Flat? From what I could tell, you can get past the obstacles in whatever way you like. Sure, there’s the intended way, but if you want you can just climb over things and rush to the end of the level. Or you can just fool around to your heart’s content. It’s essentially one big playground with a goal at the end. \n[/list]\n\n[h1][u]Negative:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]It can be frustrating when things don’t go as you expect. Since your character has the structural rigidity of jelly, you’re constantly battling the floppiness of your character. My advice is: don’t expect to move with precision and you’ll have a good time. I also encountered a few bugs, like my arms or legs getting stuck in an object. Luckily there are many checkpoints and it’s relatively quick to reload.\n[/list]\n \n[h1][u]Conclusion:[/u][/h1]\n[h1]★★★✬☆ Surprisingly fun[/h1]\nI was honestly surprised at how much fun I had playing Human Fall Flat. I tend to avoid ragdoll/physics-y games - Getting Over It, for example, looks like an absolute nightmare to me - but I don’t regret playing Human Fall Flat at all. \nHuman Fall Flat is an absolute blast if you don’t take it too seriously or just like goofing around. I wouldn’t recommend it if you prefer serious games, as it’s very likely that you will just end up getting frustrated. The choice is entirely yours. \n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th][h1]If you enjoyed this review please follow me on my [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/26827738-%27b-Reviews/?appid=241930]curator page[/url] and [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/breviews]group[/url].

Made by the same people who made rollercoaster tycoon and man did they deliver on this. For me it's the small things in a game that matter and did they really take the time to make sure this was as polished as it could be. Not sure if anyone remembers when they announced another rollercoaster tycoon a while back, and everyone was super excyited to find out what it was, and it ended up being some dumbass phone app? Well imagine all that excyitment, but instead of them coming out with that stupid app they came out with this bad boy. This is exactly what everyone was wishing and hoping for (just different name). Do I reccomend you buy this game? hell yes. will it be exactly what you are wishing for when you fist clicked this game to see the game play and reviews? sure as cocks will. But will it be just as fun as the original?.... YOU BET YOUR MOMS TITS IT WILL BE. \n\nPROS:                                \nbeen one since 1990\n\nCons:\nYou'll never know how fun it is till you buy it.\n- 🎃 Tя!cked not Tяeated 🎃 full price $29.99 you can only play a 10 min Light Version. I had hoped that was a joke? I tried Steam \"Offline\" mode still blocked me from Full Monty 18+ XP Room 👎🏻\n\nSteam Refunded 😩 see discussions click 💭 icon\n\n⚪️ $29.99 is greedy money grab for no sex play content.\n⚪️ We can't get anyone to answer back how we buy 18+ Version.\n⚪️ I can see from the Web Site they have a Mobile VR Truck just for Sensual VR and look to now be renting rooms in popular restaurants around Germany. \n\nI honestly believe until the DEV's of this game have fully exhausted it's Euro revenue stream from VR Room Rentals and VR Mobile Truck. They will not sell us the public it's 18+ XP Room from it's Web Site.  \n\nNote to Publisher: Anything less than changing this to a Free Demo from all the above I've stated.

[/h1] \n\n\n[h1]===[ General Consensus ]===[/h1]\n\n[b]This was the baseline for two entire generations of Single-Player FPS[/b]\n\n[u]The Half-Life series is considered to be one of the \"Grandfathers\" of modern FPS. Along with some other titles of its generation, it revolutionized the shooter genre, giving games a new depth and even bigger focus on storytelling and big setpieces, remeniscent of action genre movies. And naturally, Half-Life 2 is remembered one of the finest games to be realized and developed, even after a tumultuous and bumpy development.[/u]\n\n\nI only came to the awareness of this game's status in the gaming world a few years ago. I never really heard too much about it or even payed to much attention to it; back in my childhood I remember seeing it around the internet but it never really talked to me.\nSo a few years back I bought the whole HL franchise here on Steam, already acquainted with the game's praise. \n\nAfter a couple of failed attempts to play HL2, but getting stuck on the same part, I finally got to finish the game. \nAnd I must say I'm totally on board with all the praise and status!\n\n\n[h1]PLOT:[/h1]\n\nThe story continues after the events of Half-Life 1, where Gordon Freeman, a scientist working on the Black Mesa Research Facility, fights his way through hords of aliens brought to Earth by a portal that Gordon himself opened.\n\nWe wake-up to a dystopian future where the Black Mesa and the alien infestation led to a very different world of ours, where humans live in a opressing society on the likes of the book \"1984\", where everyone is meticulously controlled by the \"system\".\nThis hugely different and creative setting really talked to me and even made me more interested in the narrative.\n\nFrom then on, Freeman tries to lead a group of \"resistence\" fighters to oppose and tear down the ruller of Earth, the former administrator of the Black Mesa Facility, Wallace Breen, (whom also \"negotiated\" a peace agreement with the aliens, right after the events of HL1).\n\nI must say this story is a very creative and different experience of those found in other FPS games.\nI always found myself on the edge of my seat, eager to know what was gonna happen next, and while also amazed by all the environmental storytelling.\nIt's truly one of the game's strongest points and even though your character doesn't speak, you will find yourself completely imersed on the narrative. Even all these years after, this political and social matter that Valve went for and explored is one of the game's strongest points really!\n\nAnd not to forget about all of those fantabulous and explosive setpieces seen throughtout the game that are really solid and entretaining, having inspired other games like Uncharted and the Call of Duty campaigns, just to say a few. You are really put in some tricky and tough situations.\n\n\n[h1]GAMEPLAY:[/h1]\n\nThis is your average FPS gameplay. Nothing you haven't seen before, but HL2 is certainly a gold standard of how to excell and give variety in your gameplay.\n\nYou've got your normal 2000's arsenal, like Pistols, the series' signature weapon the Crowbar, a Revolver that packs a serious punch, an SMG, Assault Rifle, Shotgun (THAT FEELS SO GOOD TO SHOOT), Grenades, Crossbow, Rocket Laucher and a new \"toy gun\" the Gravity Gun.\n\nAt the time, Valve was developing a new physics engine never seen before that went on to shake and revolutionize games at the time, but in order to really make usage of this new technology, [u]the developers of Half-Life 2 introduced the Gravity Gun to the weapons roster [/u]. \nWith it you can \"grab\" multiple objects, such as crates, file cabinets, gasoline tanks or even buzzsaw blades to throw at oponents. It's a very creative way to make usage of the different environment assets while showing off new technology.\nIt's also another tool to help you get out of sticky situations like puzzles, something that Half Life 2 really experiments with. \nWith this engine, Valve pushed the physics to bring different puzzles that just feel natural to solve.\n\nGameplay feels really natural and it's what we have grown accostumed to in the FPS genre, but very competent and polished.\n[spoiler](the shotgun just feels awesome and sooooo satisfying to shoot)[/spoiler]\n\n\n[h1]SOUND AND MUSIC:[/h1]\n\nSound feels like a very big step-up comparing to Half-Life 1 and every weapon sound much better when firing.\n\nEnvironmental sound is really good and pushes you even more to the game's immersion. Every area of the game is masterfully design, to the sewer sections that feel so claustrophobic and tense to walk through, to the more city like big places where you can sense the real sense of scale of the space through the sound design. \n\nI must say it's really top notch.\n\nBut there were times where I felt that the sound mixing was a little off, having sounds playing with a really pumped up volume that really distracted me and put me off.\n\nIn the other hand, the Music is just amazing. It's 00's techno and rock like music that just injects you with such adrenaline and makes you feel really awesome with gunning down opponest. VERY SATIFYING INDEED.\n\n\n[h1]GRAPHICS:[/h1]\n\nIn all honesty this is a hard category to judge, because obviously the graphics are going to look a bit dated to what we have today (in 2020), but honestly everything look really good.\n\nFrom characters and enemies, to the environments, to the fire and explosion effects, it all looks very good and has a great level of quality to them. Specially the alien creatures. I felt utterly disturbed by those \"facehuggers\" like creatures. Everytime they jumped at my face I would equally jump, but of my seat with disgust... \n\n\n[h1]CONCLUSION:[/h1]\n\n[b]To summ it up, I think that Half-Life 2 is a must play game. \n\nReally, if you are like me and you have heard about it, but was like \"meh maybe this game is old and dated and its now crap\", just cut the argument and go play a really good and polished experience.\n\nFor those out there, if you want a polished and strong game that still challenges most contemporary games, with an interesting narrative, and some awesome moments just grab yourself a copy of this. It's dirt cheap, no excuses...[/b]\n- Dear Dev, \nI love this game, if you're reading reviews, please consider some ideas to make it better:\n-  Level designing: Add more ways to choose, and different endings. Right now SoR4 is flat from A to B, it made me feel down compare to SoR3.\n- Alternate customs, and playable same characters: Floyd is overrated and all my friends want to pick him. Make a game with 4 Floyds running sound fun. Use lifetime score to unlock customs.\n- 2v2 Battle! WHY NOT?\n- Shiva (new), Max (new), Roo, Estel (Badass Woman Cop)\n- Steam trading cards: I know it's not importance, but who doesnt want some badass backgrounds on steam profile?\n- I was lured in by all the positive reviews and the beautiful art style. Once I started playing, I really tried to love this game. I really tried. I got thirteen levels in before I couldn't escape that I hate this game more than any game I can ever remember hating.\n\nThere are a lot of reasons why. Many are nitpicks, but there is one overwhelming one: This Game Is Almost Never Fun. I started out enthusiastic, but it wasn't long before all the enjoyment drained out. I went from looking forward to the next level, to only wanting to complete the current one just so it would be over and done with. I could not help contrast Tri with games like Portal or QUBE where, most of the time, the challenge is in figuring out the puzzle. Once you know how it's done, you can do it. In Tri, this is not the case. Realizing the solution just means understanding how much tiring, precarious, exacting, chore-like work you have to do before you can DO the thing you figured out how to do. This is a game where there is no such thing as a simple solution. If solving a puzzle can be made more difficult, it has been. Not in a mentally challenging way, but in a way that feels like having to walk for miles over uneven rocks. (Especially once they introduced having to direct light beams by reflecting them off triangles. This requires innumerable microscopic adjustments each time.)\n\nAnd even that would be fully forgiveable, if the game's difficulty was FAIR. For me, half my frustration came from the increasingly difficult puzzles, the other half came from inconsistent mechanics. Sometimes when I had to run up walls, a triangle that showed I could walk on it would suddenly let go of me and I'd plummet. Sometimes I got trapped in places I should have been able to jump out of. Sometimes lasers would bleed right through triangles I put up to block them (In one case, I had to layer down twenty-four of them). But the worst was the jump. At first I thought it was a nifty idea that if you were jumping towards a high ledge, you could keep pressing space to haul yourself up and over. I grew to hate this mechanic because of how often it failed. Jumping up a simple step could take five or six tries; impotently bobbing up and down going \"HUHHP! HUHHP! HUHHP!\" each time. There were also plenty of times when it seemed like random chance whether a given platform could be jumped to or not. Plus there was the tendency of jumps to send you up and over a thin ledge you were trying to reach, instead of onto. I quicksaved OFTEN.\n\nTri feels like it lives up to its name: they tried. They really did. They had ideas with a lot of potential and the level design is frequently gorgeous. But too often these ideas were implemented poorly, or were not conveyed at a reasonable difficulty level. I quit. I don't want to, and I am massively disappointed to, but I'm giving up and uninstalling this game. I know I'll never see the end cutscene, but honestly, not playing anymore feels like more of a reward to me.\n- Really overrated. Sure the graphics are fancy schmancy, but in the end it feels more like a dumbed-down Left 4 Dead.\n\nPurely from a gameplay perspective, the class specializations are excessively numerous with not that many differences between many of them (and notably, every class can use the same weapons anyway), and the solo mode sucks (no bots, are you kidding me?).\n\nOn other aspects of the game, there is that XP and (cosmetic) items grinding that seems to be the current trend/cash cow. And the fucking ridiculous buying of weapons and ammo within missions because, you know, killing monsters gives you money and in a world completely wrecked by zombies there are automated weapon stores at every corner - seems legit. Feels like that CSGO crap: it's not an FPS as much as a trading \"game\", where you buy stuff ingame and you buy or sell stuff on the Steam marketplace.\n- Imagine releasing an \"update\" that breaks peoples games/ mods, JUST SO YOU CAN PUT A BANNER AD IN THE MENU FOR BL3. Just WOW.\n- Plants, please: A horticultural document thriller.\nGlory to Undermere.\nPros: \n- the writing and its illusion of effortless brilliance\n- attention to detail and consequences for player actions\n- \"gotta catch 'em all\" mentality that actually makes you feel smart\n- the intrigue, world-building, and game flow\n- petting the cat\n\nCons: I wish there was more music, or just none at all most of the time.\n- I was hoping for a good game but I can't believe the positive reviews. Really annoying on a personal level. If you like your hand held and revel in 3rd person view then enjoy, but I think it's terrible. I was on the mountain jumping across a platform. \"Press ENTER\" to 'grab' it suggests. I press ENTER and what do you know? Nothing happens. Well, you die continually because what it tells you to do (zzzzz) doesn't work. Ah, maybe this is part of the 'difficulty'...hahahaha.\n\nNot a patch on any Far Cry or GTA even though these are full of directions. First Tomb Raider I've bought and definitely the last. What is it with games these days telling you what to do every step of the way: Do this...do that....go here....find item...take item...drop item...fire now.....pull lever...talk....rest....jump.... quit game and uninstall, ya that's the best option. As this game is created for a dumbed-down society or tailored for intellectually challenged meercats, some of us can see where the industry is heading. What happened to thinking for yourself???\n\nI don't need to progess far in this game because the first 10 minutes says enough. Do this, do that, blah blah blah...\n- Overall its a great hunting game. The base game is good enough on its own to give you an enjoyable experience hunting several varieties of animals. \n\nI feel that some of the best content is in the DLC's. I dont mind the price tag for maps are they are just a large and some of them have a truly diverse animal population. \n\nThe Weapon Packs have some items that really should have been available in the base game (.22 rifle).\nTripod stands, Tents and ATV's are also DLC items that i feel should have been included in the base game. \n\nThe cost for these packs are not huge, and I have bought them, but they really do impact your play in a meaningful way so it is hard not feel like they were left out on purpose. \n\nBeing a former hunter in real life I would say that the realism of it is pretty good. Lung shots and heart shots drop animals quickly and using the right ammo along with good aim greatly influences this. A poor shot will leave you tracking this wounded animal across the map till you sneak up on it again or just give up. \n\nThey have a system called Tru Racks (sumthn like that) that simulates different qualities of animals. So you end up with little bucks, average bucks, and monster bucks. Weight and coloration plays a part in this too. In short every animal has a trophy of some kind and they are varied by what must be some sort of RNG. \n\nAll that having been said, this game can devolve into a shooting gallery were you kill everything on sight as there in no real incentive not to. You get money and experience for every kill you claim and wiping out a heard of deer with your DLC M1 Garand on your DLC Tripod Stand becomes the quickest way to bypass the grind.\n\n It feels like the game starts as a \"hunting sim\" and becomes a \"poaching sim\" once you realize the progression system is going to take a long time to do...\"ethically?\".\n\n\nAgain, this is a game i would recommend, but it is just that, a game. \n\n\n- Great Game, play the Demo instead of reading reviews.\n- This game is like cocaine. \nI always tell myself just one more, then im done. I'll do homework. I'll sleep. I'll eat something. \nBut you know what? That last death was cheap, I'll do one more to make up for it. I just need 1000 gold for that upgrade, I'll just do one more to get it. Always just one more. \n\nThings I like:\n\n+Strong RPG Progression - Gold from your run can be spent on stats, equipment, abilities, etc. making multiple runs and longer runs more rewarding.\n\n+The game is witty and has flavor. -- there are various conditions your new characters can have such as being blind, gay or having a fear of chickens, amongst many, many others. Dying is in this sense, pretty fun. The writing has a lot of charm!\n\n+The controls are very tight -- this game has good controls. It's easy to do what you want, which is good because it's very tough and you will die a lot.\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n- The bosses in new game plus don't get harder -- As you progress into new game + or ++ or +++ and beyond, the bosses don't scale well, despite the general enemies leveling up to basically become bosses themselves. Not a huge deal, but it's the only negative I have.\n\nThen at some point you realize you've beaten the game, Thankfully there is a new game plus.\nMaybe just one more playthrough...\n- I am a 43 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he helped me. Loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.\nThank you <3\n- Do you have friends? Do you want to play games with your friends?\nBuy this game!\nDo you not have friends? Are you in need of consolation due to the endless lonely Friday nights spent playing Solitaire? \nConsider playing Dwarf Fortress.\n- Where to start.... in short entire game is boring and very slow paced for no aparent reason.\n\nAI: AI performs only very basic functions and does not upgrade buildings and does the opposite of whats beneficial for your empire. AI does not do very well when engaging in displomacy.\n\nUI: You will spend most of your time trying to manage/hover around very CLUMSY and absolutely disgusting UI. Other 4x games offer far superior UI and make is easier to manage your asset on the field e.g. Sword of the stars II, Star Ruler 2, Distant world, Endless Legends, Endless Space etc.\n\nGFX: Graphics are not the top notch what you would expect from a modern 4x game but they are on far with Endless Legends. GFX leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nAlien Races: I dont need to say much but like Planets most of the races are COPY / PASTE. Nothing unique or special about each. \n\nMP: Multiplayer has a mind of its own and in most cases wont let you join public games unless its a private game.\n\nStellaris bring nothing new to 4x Genre in 2016!.\n Right now everyone is almost beta testing for the developers so we can find bugs, report them  and help them fix their game. Why not let players do beta before before release? But then there is  a question of sale and refund. \n\nBut overall this game does offer amazing soundtrack.\n- A masterpiece of a game that had it's potential destroyed by EA's stupidity to release it between a new COD and BF game :( :( this game is worth the full price just for the single player campaign alone, the movement and shooting mechanics in this game is top notch and many other games have tried to mimic it. I've played through the single player 4 times now (twice on ps4, once on xbox and once on pc) and every single time the game has been a blast, trust me play it :) I really hope respawn/ea make titanfall 3\n- I've changed my mind on this review.\n\nLoot boxes? Yuck.\nRemoving most servers, forcing everyone onto US West/East and European servers? Yuck.\nBase 250 ping at all times? Yuck.\n\nI want my Oceanic server back, so I can actually enjoy the game properly. Until better region support is reintroduced, this'll remain a negative review.\n- Swing, shoot, run, grapple, panic, wade through muck, struggle to see through indoor weather effects, pour lotion on incapacitated friends, and relive other memories of a Turkish bathhouse in this 4-player co-op mine-‘em-up.\n\n[b][u]The Good[/u][/b]:\n[list]\n[*]Mission variety. There are a few different types of missions to play: Mining Expedition (standard pick-and-collect), Elimination (boss fights), Escort (ride and refuel a giant drilldozer to obtain a rare stone), On-Site Refining (set up pipes to pump morkite), Egg Hunt (obtain alien eggs inside walls), Salvage Operation (find and repair mini-MULEs), Point Extraction (find stones in a giant room and return them to the center platform), and Industrial Sabotage (wake up a rival company’s boss and obliterate it). There are also secondary missions that involve collecting or killing for bonuses.\n[*]There is even a nice variety with the events that appear in missions.\n[*]RNG makes the missions more [strike]frustrating[/strike] interesting. It feels good when you have 3 events in one mission and get rich.\n[*]Deep Dives and Elite Deep Dives which are consecutive sets of missions you do in one go.\n[*]Underground environments that are actually interesting.\n[*]The game has a great OST that really fits the different moods of the game. From “I like mining enjoy mining but still want to kill myself”, to “There’s no way we’re going to make it”, to “We easily got this”, it’s all covered.\n[*]Free content is added to the game, including seasonal unlocks.\n[*]You can customize your character’s hair, mustache, beard, sideburns, skin, armor type/color, taunt and weapons.\n[*]Not only is there a variety of weapons, but they all have different perks and mods you can select to accommodate different playstyles.\n[*]The server filter has a lot of options, but I do wish there were an option to show games that need a specific class.\n[/list]\n\n[b][u]The Neutral[/u][/b]:\n[list]\n[*]10 environments.\n[*]4 classes and each has a role: Driller burrows far away from the team and gets swarmed to death, Scout moves far ahead of the team to make sure it’s unsafe by getting leeched, Gunner uses everyone’s ammo stash and gets downed because he thinks he’s immortal, and Engineer dies while building a sentry and ignoring all pings.\n[*]I killed my teammate by building a bridge of platforms over the drilldozer as Engineer. He tried to drill out of it but I kept refilling the gaps. I think about that a lot.\n[/list]\n\n[b][u]The Bad[/u][/b]:\n[list]\n[*]Ghosts.\n[*]Enemies can attack you through barriers. It's especially annoying on the minehead.\n[*]The game seems less optimized since the release of Season 2.\n[/list]\n\n[b][u]Pro Tips[/u][/b]:\n[list]\n[*]If you’re Scout, then you better make large rooms look like a nuclear Christmas in Las Vegas and grab minerals/items that are out of reach.\n[*]If you’re Gunner, then you better make boss/event rooms look like it’s laundry day for Pinhead.\n[*]There are clues in the game for hidden goods. If you see glowing gold, blue, pink, or green stones; or glowing spikes, there’s a hidden stone/cube inside.\n[*]If you find a helmet you can interact with, it shows you where lost gear is on your map.\n[*]Always ask before activating something or calling the drop pod.\n[*]Don’t make the same mistake Liam Neeson did in Batman Begins.\n[*]Seriously! Do [i][b]NOT[/b][/i] start an event or objective when no one is ready; especially when it’s an escort mission and the dozer has already moved.\n[*]Don’t like sneaky snakes that hoard everyone’s share of ammo? Take note of the white rectangles under their avatars while they take ammo to see if they actually need it. Do the same for yourself.\n[*]Read a server’s description before joining and know what the host expects.\n[*]If you fail to join a server, hit right click instead of clicking the confirmation.\n[/list]\n\nIs it worth it? If you like the idea of mining as a low-poly dwarf with alcohol-induced double vision, who gives hints of lore and pisses off all of his teammates because he doesn’t know how to do his job, then yes. The game has more variety and depth than I had imagined, and I’m still not tired of it after a few hundred hours of playing. 300 hours in and I’m still killing my teammates with engineer platforms and still not caring.\n- [h1] A BETTER MINECRAFT, AND I WILL TELL YOU WHY[/h1]\nwith terrain deformation and creation, crafting etc its only normal that the first comparison that comes to mind is with minecraft. But it is better than minecraft.\n\n[h1]The Gameplay[/h1]\nMinecraft has a glaring problem: [b]the gathering of resources.[/b]\nsure its fun to explore caves but to go and search for the material that you need get boring very fast. \n\nIn Astroneer you have a vacuum to literally [b]suck up the material that you need[/b], and in the advanced stages big buggies to mine faster and carry more, and then even auto-extractors.\nSure you need to go to specific planets to find a specific materials, but that just adds to the fun of exploration and space travel.\n\n\n[b]Then there's what to do with said minerals.[/b] \nIn minecraft you mine and mine and for what? to create a different colored house? seriously whats the point?\nWhile in astroneer there is a reason, to create vehicles, to create different structures to refine said materials, to go explore faster.\n\n\nIn other words, and i guess the key of this review: \n[spoiler] Astroneer feels like a feature complete minecraft.[/spoiler]\n\n\n[h1] The bad things with it [/h1]\n[b]-There's no soundtrack.[/b] i mean there is, but its some random notes pushed casually.\n\n[b]-the ending.[/b] \n[spoiler]There is no ending. you just collect the planet cores and put them onto the asteroid. barely a minute long cut scene, and credits roll. it doesn't unlock anything, it feels unfinished, all that build-up for nothing.[/spoiler]\n\n[b]-⚠️⚠️⚠️Anybody from your steam list can join your server and create havoc!!⚠️⚠️⚠️[/b]\nNo way to make the server private. \nNo way to kick people.\nNO SOUND THAT ANYBODY EVEN JOINED!!\nits a disaster waiting to happen!! please change this at all costs!!!\n- I'm gonna give this a thumbs up but with like, idk, a cautionary sideways thumb for maybe. \n\nif I read credits right, it looks like this game had all its programming, art, music, and writing done by one guy, so I have to give respect to that. For a real indie game like this, it's very very good. \n\nBut it's still really flawed. If you're looking for a 2D Metroid game, and you've played EVERY other 2D metroid game, I suppose yeah, go for this one, and I think you'll enjoy it. If you're not a fan of metroid, I would not bother, sadly. This game suffers from a lot of problems from metroid games, and does not fix any, and at times exagerates those problems. \n\nThe art style is very interesting and cool, but the way the levels and map design are, leaves most areas feeling like a mess of unmemorable places. \n\nThe combat is INCREDIBLY simplistic, yet somehow bogged down by WAY too many useless weapons and just kind of badly designed controls. I found there were about 5 weapons that were actually useful in the game out of what seems like more than 10. Most enemies you either cheese, or be cheesed. There's no charge up shots, there's not really much nuance to the enemies or bosses. They have about two attacks and repeat while you dodge the same one bullet pattern and just kind of shoot in their general direction. (I played it on hard by the way. Not a particularly difficult game, but even the slightly challenging stuff felt kind of dull and uninteresting.) \n\nThe music was cool again. nothing quite mind blowing, but it was nice. The world itself seems like a mess, but there are cool ideas. The giant robot people were really cool to see. \n\nOne little idea i really liked is that the LOW HEALTH beep sound is actually in sync with every song in the game. I thought that was really cute, and it's not something I've seen any game do. Sounds dumb, but I give a lotta props to that, it was cool. \n\nWriting is okay. I feel it left more to be desired. There seemed to be an interesting world here that wasn't explored enough. It wasn't bad, I suppose, but not really that great. \n\nThat is kind of this game. It's not bad by any means, but not the best game on the planet. Play it if you're in need of a Metroid game, and I'm certain you will be pleased enough despite the flaws. Even if you're just having a hankering for a platformer and have already played Hollow Knight and some other great ones first, I think you should enjoy this, but don't expect a 10/10 game. \n\nGive it a try if you feel it looks interesting.\n\n【グループB】\n- If you somehow don't know what this is: It's a meta-narrative focused walking sim with a funny narrator. Only you know if that kind of thing sounds like a good time to you.\n\nSubtract about 26 hours from my playtime because I'm a lunatic who left the game running for a whole day to get a silly achievement.\n\nI loved the HD remix (never played the og mod), and I really liked this one too, but I will say that a lot of the commentary the original offered doesn't hit as hard or hold up as well almost a decade later, just because the narrative structure and how narrative is tied to gameplay of many story-driven games has changed in that time (because of course it has), as well as the mindset of a lot of players being different. So I think that it's worth keeping in mind the cultural moment the original was made during... if you're the thinky type who likes to overthink things. You massive nerd.\n\nStill, it felt nice to jump back in and spend a little more time with the narrator, and there were some legitimately striking moments in the new content that I found to be quite powerful and engaging. Overall, though, having played the original, getting all the new stuff (and revisiting the old) felt a lot more like checking off a to-do list than active exploration teasing at the boundaries of the game and it's layout than the first one.\n- MySims, Scribblenauts, Poly Bridge and just plain old Lego building.\n\nIt's hard to describe this game succinctly without drawing a comparison to one of the above so I'll just do it off the top. Bricktales is a very pleasant blend of these sources, offering light accessible and honestly quite relaxing game play centred around a mix of lego building challenges and overworld puzzle solving. It's an ideal game for kids or even adults looking for something breezy, especially considering just how nicely it's presented.\n\nThere's a few small gameplay gripes, the controls for the building mode are decent once you get to grips with them - but getting to grips with them takes a little time. On the over world it can feel like you spend a lot of time switching between traversal powers and watching the corresponding animation. And in some places the game can let you build something that counts as a valid structure but isn't actually traversable for your character. None of these felt like a big issue though.\n\n I think the most engaging thing personally is that the themes chosen (Medieval, Egypt, City, Caribbean and Jungle) are all very familiar genres for original Lego sets of the past, which combined with the simple blocky nature of the things you build in the game makes it feel much closer to the vibe of just playing with Lego as a child than something licensed. There's a very charming *vibe* around this game that I think gives it value beyond something just for children, and is a large part of why I would reccomend it.\n- I have not play for long, but know well enough this game deserves a mention. A side on, survival-ish game set in a war. Now, While I admire this game, it does have a few issues I personally find abnoxious.\nI'll start with those, and then will share what I like about it.\n\n-Characters you play seem to have never stolen anything at all from anyone, ever during the war. This is reflected in how unhappy and whiney they become caring more about the people they have taken from than their own wellbeing.\n\n-Characters you play are too softhearted. Just use the example with the point above. \n\n-Characters are expert carfters for being just average people. How many average people know how to pick locks, make servicable firearms and make alcoholic beverages? Well these three certain are capable of all three and more. For that matter, they all can do everything, but have one special skill they are the better at than the rest.\n\n-You get to only visit one building per night. This is bad since if you chose a building with other survivors in it, you will either need to steal from them to get supplies and be faced with a lot of unhappy complaining, or return home with nothing.\n\n-Visting other survivors, you cannot negotiate with them let alone talk to them. What you can do is beat them to death (or kill them with whatever weapon you happen to have on you at the time). I don't see how this was a good design choice at all when the characters you play are not personally that sort of people. Attacking other survivors is certain to cause problems with your characters.\n\n-You can not relocate from your starting place. What you start with is your base of operations.\n\n-Raids happen frequently to you only. You will never kill raiders, only chase them off and this happens behind the scenes, out of your control, while your character is out scavanging.\n\n-You can not sleep in shifts. If a person sleeps, they sleep the whole night.\n\n-Rediculous resource requirements. Some things require far too much, while others require far too little. \n\n-There is little to none interaction between your characters. No idle chatter between them. \n\n\nNow for the good points.\n-You play 3 characters to begin with, each having one specialty. They somewhat have different personalities.\n\n-The art style appeals to me.\n\n-Characters are well animated. Different staes of tiredness, different things they do when unhappy or when they have nothing else to do.\n\n-The overall idea, even though it isn't implemented well enough.\n\n-Building your shelter from ground up.\n\n-Forgaing and stealth play.\n\n\nSo while i find some issues with this game's design, if you ignore the lack of realism and consider this to be just a game with a very narrow play style, it is quite fine. It has a certain atmosphere you generally don't find elsewhere. I still recommend to give it a try.\n- Having accumulated over 13400 hours in-game with [i]Arma 3[/i], I would certainly recommend it to others. \n\nIf you enjoy tactical shooters and playing online with friends, it's well worth a look; especially if you appreciate a high dose of military realism!\n- Overall better cast than the first game. But it has a few problems that DR1 didn't have, which to me was what made the game fun in the first place.\n\nDR1 spoilers: [spoiler] All of them seem capable of killing which I couldn't say about the first game where it was obvious that weedman, the giant and donut girl wasn't a threat to you. [/spoiler]\n\nDR2 spoilers:  [spoiler] However unlike the first game where Kirigiri, Byakuya and other characters were arguing during the trial and bringing up interesting points. DR2 has a lack of persuasive characters. There's effectively just Nagito (who argues in your favor half the time anyway) and Chiaki. The other characters never challenges you in a convincing way.[/spoiler]\n- Black Mesa is a fantastic remake of the Original Valve classic and one of the greatest of all time video games, Half-Life.  This sci-fi classic FPS has you take on what might seem like a hum-drum day in the life of an experimental physicist, but things go quite off rails when experimenting with a strange material sample from an even stranger dude in a suit. \n\nAfter a while (and shooting a lot of aliens and bashing their heads in with a crowbar) you'll save the world... but now Black Mesa lets you do this with dramatically updated graphics, 4K support and a plethora of visual tweaks so you can rest assured this will run great on any gaming rig. \n\nA must have for big fans of Half-Life or gamers who are new to the scene and never got to play the original.   When on sale, of course!\n- Mysterious, claustrophobic, and psychedelic --- this is undoubtedly the most unorthodox game in The Legend of Heroes series. This game is basically what you get when you put The Legend of Heroes, Shin Megami Tensei and a certain Silent Hill title [i](which I won't specify for a good reason)[/i] into a blender machine. Nonetheless, it is still very much an LoH game at its core, though its semi-fandisc nature holds it back from being as coherent of an overall package as its two predecessors.\n\nI cannot stress this enough: [b][u]If you were a big fan of the previous two games, you will not necessarily like this game; on the other hand, if you didn't hold them in high regard, this game is still worth trying out due to its stark contrast in tone and structure from its predecessors.[/u][/b] There is a good reason this game is named [u][b]\"the 3rd\"[/b][/u] instead of \"Third Chapter\", because it is definitely not a direct continuation of SC (i.e. Trails in the Sky Second Chapter).\n\nIf you want more of the upbeat, kingdom-trotting adventure of the previous two games, you're not going to find it here.\n\nIf you want towns full of vibrant NPCs, you're not going to find it here (at least not in the main story).\n\nIf you want a protagonist who wears their heart on their sleeves and acts like your typical spunky JRPG hero, you're not going to find it here.\n\nThis game is first and foremost [u][b]a gameplay-heavy dungeon crawler[/b][/u], one that is light on (main) story but carries some very heavy themes. The most interesting aspect of the game to me is that [i][b]the protagonist Kevin Graham is not a hero[/b][/i] (which is ironic considering the name of this series). This game is his harrowing personal journey, one in which he doesn't set out to save the world, his homeland, or anyone for that matter.\n\nThere are initially only two playable characters, but more and more join your party at a steady pace throughout the game [b](16 in total)[/b]. Be sure to talk to these characters when you swap them out of your party; they are ironically the only source of \"NPC dialogue\" for the majority of the game, and their dialogue updates after every plot point like in most other Falcom games. You know Falcom has done their NPCs justice in FC&SC when their complete absence here creates an uneasy sense of isolation.\n\nThere are visual-novel-like sidequests (called Memory Doors) which serve to further flesh out the characters and setting of this series, giving all the playable (and some non-playable) characters their own spotlight to shine in. To this day the cast of Trails in the Sky still remains my favorite cast of any RPG, and I have to give a good chunk of the credit to this game's characterization of them.\n\nThese sidequests take up a sizeable chunk of the game, which one might argue distract from the dungeon-crawling main game. Fortunately, they don't expire like in FC&SC and can be accessed at any point in the game before the final dungeon (with convenient fast-travel to boot), effectively enabling the player to pace the game themselves. \n\nWord of warning though, some of these sidequests take on a much darker tone than one would expect: there's a very good reason why the console versions of this game was censored [i](don't worry, the Steam version isn't)[/i]. Please be mentally prepared for the final sidequest you come across in the game, i.e. [spoiler]Star Door 15[/spoiler].\n\nThere is also plenty of foreshadowing for the rest of the series littered throughout the game, some obvious and some very subtle [i](I'm looking at you Mr. N)[/i]. Needless to say, this game gives you lots to think about if you are into the lore of this series, especially if you have played some of the later Trails games.\n\nOh, and did I mention that the soundtrack is widely regarded as the best in the trilogy?\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nTo end on a more critical note, I'd like to elucidate the \"semi-fandisc\" nature of this game:\n\nThere is severe disconnect between the main story and side content, with the latter adding nothing to the former for the most part; the sidequests are more of an anthology of supplementary material for the entire Trails series and are only tenuously tied to the main campaign, which by itself is sparse in story.\n\nThere is also an egregious amount of asset recycling from the previous two games. Although this is mostly justified within the context of the story, it's still vexing and makes the devs look lazy. They had the opportunity to add a lot of interesting new locales, especially those pertaining to Kevin and the church, but they chose not to for the majority of the game. Get ready to traverse through lots of familiar looking areas and dungeons...\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nP.S. Advice for 1st playthrough: If you are here mostly to enjoy the story, don't play on Hard; if you value your sanity as a gamer, don't play on Nightmare. Seriously, don't.\n\nP.S.2 When you first open up the game, don't skip the \"Falcom\" logo animation; just sit back and watch. There's a bit more after that.\n\nP.S.3 If you're really curious as to which Silent Hill title I was comparing this game to, potential spoilers if you are familiar with the SH franchise: [spoiler]Silent Hill 2[/spoiler]. Just how deep the similarities run between these two games, I'll let you find out for yourself.\n\nP.S.4 A bit more on the censorship of this game: Falcom cut out large chunks of the aforementioned final sidequest when porting the 3rd from PC to the Sony consoles (PSP, PS3, and PSVita). They did this in order to keep the age rating consistent across the Sky trilogy; the PC version of the 3rd would undoubtedly have been rated \"M\" had it gone through ESRB. If you need a list of potentially distressing content in this game, feel free to PM me.\n- The cognitive dissonance in the original Space Quest games between the box cover art telling you that \"Roger Wilco is hapless!\" and the player's necessary mental exertion involved to solve the puzzles, is laid bare the moment you can type in the name you will be called by in the game.\n\nIt's one of the hardest lines to walk when narrative is the main driver of an interactive work:  balancing the player's actions with the personality of the character they are directing in a world that is clearly alive, regardless of the players's presence.\n\nThe Excavation of Hob's Barrow's succeeds in this fully with the denizens and everyday life of the town of Bewlay.\n\nFrom the moment Thomasina Bateman starts recounting the events that led to her writing a letter to her mother, any ambiguity is dispelled: the player is helping Thomasina relive her time in starkly bucolic Bewlay. But as players spend more time within the memories and stories Thomasina shares, the more off putting the narration becomes. It's not just that Thomasina is an unreliable narrator—the implications of the traumatic events that occured at Hob's Barrow are still a puzzle to be worked out. \n\nThis is the strength of the narrative design and writing in Hob's Barrow: as entertainingly crafted as linear story or film, but with eartnest player engagement required to work out what's happening in the very deep shadows of this cursed place.\n\nThe fantastic writing is supported by equally fantastic pixel art, music, and some of the best voice work I've heard in games…ever? The codgers, critters, and countryside all sound fantastic, the bleakness of the moors churning from peaceful to menacing with expert orchestration. Visual direction is solid, too, with sparingly, effectively used pixel portraits and closeups to highlight details both grotesque and filled with character. The dark undercurrent of humour throughout the game also adds some replayability for achievement hunters: some encounters are worth revisiting!\n\nI played this entirely on Steam Deck, mostly curled up in bed at night, but enjoyed the grand finale while docked on my TV. Performance and control was flawless, regardless.\n\nOne of my favorite games released in 2022, and definitely one of my favorite adventure games of all time.\n- Note this is not \"Steampunk Civ\" so don't think of it that way. Its effectively a story/scenario driven city builder. The game looks beautiful and works well with the world building that goes on with the game. \n\nYour games will be short but its still fairly challenging depending on the scenario you choose\n\nDefinitely recommended\n- Shoot first ask questions later, like real life. Maybe pepper spray a pregnant woman.\n- I've always been a little curious what a hero-centric world would look like from the eyes of a bystander. In theory it doesn't sound like a particularly exciting idea but there's a million and a half games where you are that hero, and I've never seen one where you aren't. As of the first chapter, I'm pretty interested in seeing how WP is going to take this story after having seen some adventurers through the eyes of a child that doesn't understand their way of life. \n\nThe story progresses by skipping to noteworthy events in her life as she gets older. She meets new people and is faced with decisions that shape her as a person. I'm not sure how to explain more of the story without getting into spoiling details, so I'll update this if I figure that out.\n\n--\n\nI really enjoyed World's Dawn and I'm very glad to see that he's not getting complacent with that and continuing to improve his skills. Storytelling is an art, and art doesn't improve without practice. I've waited a long time for this game to come out, and so far I'm not disappointed; and I doubt I will be.\n\nAlso, I'm happy to hear that WP's cancer is in remission and that he still wanted to go back to making games once he was feeling better. I hope he continues to produce these relaxing little escape-type games for a long time. Not every game needs a polished combat system and super high budget cg cut scenes to be fun.\n- Stephen's Sausage Roll is a game that the developer doesn't want normal people to buy, it seems. The description is literally, \"A simple 3d puzzle game.\", there is one video that shows you nothing about the game, and it's priced at $32 CND.\n\nFortunately, I'm here to tell you to get off your ass and to buy this wonderful game. The graphics are alright, the music is OK, but the puzzles are sublime.\n\nIn each level, the goal is the same: cook all the sausages and exit the level by standing on the exit level sign in the right orientation. You cook sausages by pushing them over a grill. Like in sokoban games, you can't pull the sausage (yet...), only push it. Another huge wrinkle is that sides of the sausage can only touch the grill once. If you touch a cooked side of a sausage to the grill, it will be burned and you fail the level. This little wrinkle will make you pull your hair out in some levels as you try and figure out how the hell you are going to maneuver the sausages around so they get cooked properly. A neat thing about the game is that if you fail, you can still continue playing the level, which might help you figure out how to play it.\n\nYou'll have a section (part of an island) that has a number of puzzles for you to solve in any order, so if you get stuck, you can try another one (until you get to the last puzzle of the section). Once you complete a section, a new section will open up with more puzzles.\n\nYour little guy has tank controls, which you will find extremely useful, as turning to the left or right near a sausage will push it in different directions. A nice detail is that the all of the puzzles make up the island section. When you activate a puzzle, the rest of the island drops away into the sea, leaving you on a tiny puzzle island.\n\nEach section introduces new mechanics into the game. First you'll just be pushing the sausages, but then you'll be stacking them, skewering them (you would think this would make things easier, but no! You can't turn when you have a skewered sausage!), walking on them...\n\nI would say that these levels are on the level of Snakebird, though I found many of them easier than Snakebird's puzzles (maybe I'm better at sokoban games than I know?). These are the kind of puzzles that you walk away from frustrated, but come back to a few hours later with the solution. This is the game where there are so many ah-ha! moments that make you feel smart. You have no idea what to do at first, but eventually you get better and better. You might not see solutions at first, but you begin to see where you need to go to solve the puzzle, and then work backwards from there. It's wonderful!\n\nIf you're having trouble, there's a community guide that has all the solutions, which is super helpful (though not as much when I was playing because it wasn't complete!).\n\nIt might be expensive, but I took 36 hours to solve all the puzzles and it was worth every penny.\n- TL;DR - 80-90s retro fun. Will prove you wrong if you think FMV games couldn't ever be good. Check out 5 seconds of playthrough if unsure.\nNOTE: Story isn't written in this review as game is reliant on mysterious plot. \n\n　　　For those unfamiliar, FMV stands for full motion video where you are playing a game that is based primarily/largely on the usage of pre-recorded video clips. Though it is no longer a frequented genre in video gaming, during the 90s, FMV games on CDs would often lead me into the darkened halls of many a thrilling Sherlockian mystery adventure. Unfortunately the majority of FMV games were downright awful. Pre-recorded videos with a small quantity of scenes by actual actors caused the a gaming experience to feel boxed in. Astoundingly, Her Story does the exact opposite while still being as classically FMV as FMV games go. It displays FMV like a shield of pride with the added old school touches being tasteful to a tee. As the game is \"turned on\", the screen whirring into action like any early 90s PC would, making the familiar creaking and croaking, players are introduced to their in-game desktop. The thick 90s computer monitor flares a little and in its reflection can be seen the old tube shaped fluorescent lamps that were common fixtures in most public buildings back then, flickering and popping from time to time. It is like playing a game in the past without the annoying performance issues. [spoiler]The glare on screen where you can see a better reflection towards the end made me jump a little here and there. It is fabulous as a \"moodsetter\" like many of the other suppositious yet important details that worked towards the game's impressive little plot.[/spoiler] In addition to the other details, the background music between searches where players are looking at the desktop felt like a good touch and appropriate in terms of guiding players (reacts to clips/progress etc). There is such an abundance of both subsidiary and essential detail in this game that I'd be happy with the mere nostalgia prompting ambiance. It is an added bonus, which isn't too recurrent in indie games these days where there is a deficiency in either style or story, that makes Her Story such a good FMV. It differs because players can feel as if they are in control as every person works towards the ending down a differing path depending on how they decide to investigate which is conducted solely by which searches are brought up how and when. The secret to any game that lacks the variety and freedom of choice by \"genre default\", is to give the player as much control as possible within the walls of that rigid reality. Within the uncomplicated, search - watch - find clues - check Db repertoire, players are given room to stretch and investigate on their own. The mastery is in the details so it is crucial to pay attention. Everything is told methodically and the acting that seems off in places makes much more sense once you piece the evidence and videos together. You are the \"detective\".\n\n　　　This superlative story told through proficient acting by the talented Viva Seifert (also musician/former British gymnast) weaves a surprisingly thick plot into a very lugubrious tale and the eerie horrors of the truth become more evident the more you unveil. The \"wifey killed him\" synopsis we are inclined to linger on in theory is not as discernible in-game as you'd imagine and it'll keep you guessing and alarm you at several progression points. It'll make your thoughts run wild but mostly you'll be wrong with those assumptions until you get the whole picture, as in as close to 100% off the clips as you can. The short clips have a role in that you're piecing together a very large puzzle. The splintered pieces of a total 7 interviews leaving you with 271 videos spanning between mere seconds to a couple of minutes will feel jumbled up so receiving the story in abstruse titbits as such makes you feel like your own little Jessica Fletcher and adds to the anticipation of piecing everything together. If possible I imagine it would be a fun \"couch co-op\" game for an afternoon in with a friend/SO taking notes and guessing the story together (plot contains mature content). \n\n[i]Other interesting things[/i]:\n- Doesn't stop running while you do other things so you can open up your notepad and type there if you'd rather that over pen and paper\n- Search history is helpful. Anti-Glare Filter is a nice touch. Yellow subtitles are very British. \n- The odd title is actually fittingly chosen\n- Database Checker on your desktop screen will display the overall progress you make, creating a timeline for your discoveries so investigation will be smoother\n- Each keyword brings up 5 clips at most (excluding default keyword*). Keep a list of words that stick out in clips and if you get too stuck, use default keyword to bring up whole Db\n\n*[i]Default keyword:[/i] [spoiler]BLANK[/spoiler] Using the default is not optimal. Uncovering new snippets in turn revealing new clues/plots urging you to solve the case yourself is most of the fun.\n\n[b]TIP[/b]: All clips found will have the default keyword in its details. I assigned a number for every new top she wore. Examples: [spoiler]BLANK5, BLANK1 etc..[/spoiler]. An easier method is just deleting the whole keyword for each clip watched, never to return. ;)\n\n　　　Though the sweet yet unnerving finale didn't feel as inspired, the wrap up was still nicely done. People who are new to FMV games may find it harder to get into, but it has a good depth of story to tell for the short game (3-4 hrs) that it is and I recommend it to people who enjoy a good tale. Chances are it's either going to feel like something new and interesting or old school and nostalgic. \n\n[i]Bought game on dev's site: $4.99 (Steam key + DRM free version).[/i]\n- Ib manages to do for me what so few horror games manage to accomplish, and that is to actually give a sense of unease and dread. Without going into spoilers, it's only a few minutes into the game that things start to tread the path of uncomfortable surrealism, with the art growing considerably more disturbing in how Ib interacts with it, and how the art interacts with her.\n\nWith all due respect to more conventional horror titles, say, Dead Space or The Evil Within, Ib maintains a feeling of dread and discomfort. Enemies can be evaded, yes, but there's a feeling of being stalked while trapped in a world you can't possibly fully understand. \n\nContrast Dead Space remake, where soon enough the horror gives way to cutting off an abomination's arm, then using telekinesis to impale it or another horror with said arm, then simply setting fire to the more mobile enemies.\n\nThis is not, I repeat, not to disrespect games in which reducing enemies to a smoldering heap of charred body parts is an acceptable tactic- there is a time and a place for the cathartic destruction of the nightmares that haunted our closets and lurked under our beds. Ib, however, leans firmly towards the horror and self-preservation of being in a hostile and unknown environment, where the only feasible option is to run, hide, and hope whatever nameless horror eventually loses track of you.\n\nAnd let's face it- some modern art galleries are creepy enough already, even in the daylight.\n\n- Got this game on launch, never expecting that I would become addicted looking at a stickman beat the living hell out of other stick figures. A lot of cool Easter eggs to find in the game (funny mini games, cool achievements etc.), great music, incredibly fluent and exciting while only playing with the mouse. Got a few dollars to spare? Snatch up this game and you won’t be disappointed. The only thing I’m disappointed in are my own reflexes, as I’m currently stuck in a few levels that are just way to hard for my taste. But a true ninja never quits trying. \n\nI never played part one, which is a mistake I’ll correct soon as well.\n- I'm 45, I've had good times and bad times.  I've fallen in love, grown up, gotten married, beaten alcoholism, \nhad a child, fought off depression, led my wife through her kidney failure, carried the death of loved ones, and come back from the brink.  I've weathered the storm of life like anyone else . . . I'm not special.  I'm not rich, but comfortable, and I've gathered quite a steam library as a hobby over the last 10 years.  Something I have rarely done, during my time with almost 4000 titles, is write a review.  Two, maybe three for 4000 games.  Think about that for a second.\n\nI'm 45.  I just cried playing a video game, something I can't ever remember doing.  I feel like my heart is going to burst.  It's joy, and sadness.  It's like a good memory with a parent who's long gone, bubbled up at random, making you laugh and ache at the same time.  It's bittersweet.\n\nThe music and visuals are subtle and flashy at the same time, they get under you and lift you up.  It's got spirit of the 60's, the heart of the 80's, and feels like every memorable video game trope from the 2000's, with the social softness of the 2020's.  It's huge and tiny at the same time, and thoughtfull and meditative together . . . it tells the story of leaving your comfort zone, and makes you comfortable.  It's heavy and light.  It's all of these and more.\n\nMy emotions are a flood.  I had to write a review, and let people know how I feel.  I can't describe it, I feel like I found my heart again, and I didn't even know it was lost.  Life was comfortable before 2:00pm today . . . now it's magical.  It's these small things that I forget, and remember, and then forget again . . . the birth of my son, the feeling of nervous sweetness on my first date with my wife, an unexpected comment from a random stranger about my eyes, finding an old photo of my dad that no one ever remembered taking --\n\n-- This game is like that sweet, fleeting memory.\n\nTL;DR:  45-year old man cries after finding his heart lost in a game, and writes a review while his wife asks him if he's okay.\n\n11/10, would purchase these feels again.\n- (UPDATED AS OF 1/1/23 AT BOTTOM)\n\nGame doesn't load. Running steam/EA (Origin)/Fifa23.exe as admins doesn't work. Reinstalling EA Anticheat doesn't work. Allowing everything thru firewall and antivirus (even turning them off) doesn't work. Changing bios to secure boot didn't work. Reinstalling game doesn't work. Any and all combinations of the above does not work.\n\nRequested refund from Steam. I have played maybe 4-6 hours right when it came out before the small update they pushed stopped it being able to load. I tried reverting to that initial version, doesn't work. But because Steam said I played more than 2 hours they won't refund it, even though it doesn't work. They told me to talk to EA. Requested refund from EA. They said to talk to Steam.\n\nGame won't work. EA wont fix it. They steal your money. Filing a report with the Better Business Bureau AND a deceptive practices report with the State's AG office, against BOTH Steam and EA. F them both, thieving C's.\n\n\nUPDATE:\n\nFiled a BBB report on EA. They said they cannot offer resolution such as a refund since I purchased through Steam. When I ask for a refund through Steam they state even though the game no longer works, its past their refund window and they cannot refund. \n\nSo, filing a BBB report on Steam. If that fails to refund, then I am filing a Deceptive Practices report with my State's Attorney General's Office. I'll update further, potential class action lawsuit in the works.\n\nAlso Steam has an F rating on the BBB - I wonder why??\n\n\nUPDATE 2 (1/1/2023);\nFinally got the game to play, here is how (worked for me - may not for others)\n-Uninstall Fifa 23\n-Uninstall EA App\n-Uninstall EA Anticheat in Programs Folder \n-Delete all EA Folders in Programs Folder\n-Close Steam, right click, Properties, Compatibility Tab, Run As Administrator.\n-Used CCleaner to delete all temporary files and clean registry errors\n-Settings, Gaming, Xbox Control Bar, Turn the Slider Off\n-Restart\n-Install Origin App, login, close, set to run as administrator\n-Reinstall Fifa 23 through Steam\n-Set Fifa 23 to run as administrator in the steamapps folder.\n-Set EA Anticheat to run as administrator in both locations: Programs Folder (under EA) AND Programs(x86) Folder under Steam\n-Restart\nOpen Steam, Open Origin, Run Fifa through Steam - WORKED FINALLY\n\nNOTE: I have been running in secure boot mode this whole time, so if you arent set to secure boot, you will also have to set that.\n\nI still dont recommend this game. It took me 4 months to figure out how to run this POS with zero help from EA and Steam. They also dropped the price of this sh!t game to like 25$ after I paid 85$ for early access and couldnt play it for 4 months. Think they'll refund that extra 60$? Fk no. So done with EA, never buying again.\n- It's strange how this will be the first review I ever write for a game. I always thought it would be written for a game like Fallout, Elderscrolls or some huge open world survival horror. And yet it's this little piece of art that has me aching to write something, if only for a minute.\nWhen I had finished this, a few minutes ago, I couldn't believe that they only charge a pittence for it. I thought to myself that if people can charge you 70 euro for games that are poorly executed and badly made from start to finish, then this game should have a much higher pricetag. It wasn't before looking up and seeing that I just finished the first episode in a mere three hours that I understood their reasoning. I feel, however, obliged to tell you all that the three hours spent in this game were worth more to me than the hundreads of hours I've spent in most other games combined. Not because the story was awsome, or the graphics made me gape in awe, but rather that every single aspect of the game in combination managed to grip me and pull me in so that time became temporarily meaningless. Imagine if games held this standard. Imagine if your favorite action, your favorite adventure game or even your favorite driver had this kind of execution. \nYou can tell a good story in a bad way, and you can tell a bad story in a good way. The story in this game might not be the most interesting story you've ever heard, but it's good, and in the execution of it you are drawn in, captured by it, moved by it.\n\nMost adventure games will entertain, they'll give you some ups and downs along the way, but ultimately they will feel like games.\nI've never felt so fulfilled after \"playing a game\" as I did today. Original, beautiful and masterfully executed. I can't wait for the next episode.\n- Graphics of Quake, atmosphere of Blood, brutality of Doom, some weapons of Hexen/Heretic, drunkenness and trashiness of Redneck Rampage, and some weird quirkiness from Half-Life  = GOTY\n- Finished pillars of eternity 1 as a priest of berath, pledging my soul to the god of cycles, life and death. Promising to release the thousands of captured souls back to the wheel of reincarnation at the end of the game.\n\nStarted pillars of eternity 2, only to find out I was murdered after the events of the first game by a god who was believed to have been slain during the saints war. \n\nMy soul then comes face to face with the god I have devoted my life to, the god of life, death, and reincarnation.\n\nAfter a brief discussion about how I kept my promise at the end of the first game, my favoured god revealed to me he wants me to come back to life and serve him once again, and slay the being that killed me.\n\nI refused. It is only right that my soul is allowed to be reborn and return to the cycle, as I have worshipped this diety my whole life.\n\nMy god agreed. I was reborn as a wolf and the credits of Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire started to roll.\n\nPretty short game but 10/10\n- Zor strikes again, but agent phoenix is there to stop him! Another great VR puzzle game from Schell, with lot of jokes, hidden stuff and extra challenges for replayability. Took me 4h to finish base game, now time for achievements hunt!\n- Disclaimer: This is review from player who prefer story-rich game and haven't played any game by Arkhouse Telegraph.\n\nThe good:\n+ Outstanding 80's-esque visual pixel artstyle. It reminds me of few SNES/Atari/Gameboy games.\n+ Fairly good soundtrack.\n+ Some cutscene/area have fascinating atmosphere.\n+ Run well with Steam proton, so it's likely this game is playable for Linux/Steam Deck user. Although the platformer area might show too many small detail for 7\" display.\n+ Game OST/artbook is available for free on Arkhouse website.\n\nThe bad:\n- While i understand nature of this game require player to find out most thing and go through trial-and-error, some parts definitely need to be explained better. I refer to lack of autosave (for most part of the game), not letting player know about manual save (you can do it by head left after exit for cylinder elevator until you see display/sign \"< S\" and suggestion to visit block H (where you get some guidance).\n- While the manual say i can play R. U. N. E. 3000 first, i have hard time understanding the story and lore/world building. Conversation such as \"DO? DORODO!\" is mostly gibberish and i only can make vague guess based on few specific term (\"V2\", \"50/50\", etc.) and area i've visited. Short recap of previous games (even it's on the manual) could be really helpful for newcomers.\n\nThe ugly:\n* I experience a bug where i fight boss i'm not supposed to fight yet. In detail, [spoiler] after i exit from P block to get symbol cracking code, i was thrown to G block where i fight G-Cat/10th boss. The worst part is the boss HP bar started with red color and auto 3-60 cannon never perform attack. Fortunately the bug doesn't occur again after i load from manual save.  [/spoiler].\n* The gameplay variation/idea is very interesting, but the execution is mixed bags (more explanation on below paragraph)\n\nSaturn Quest: R. U. N. E. 3000 has lots of gameplay variant/modes (Adventure, Shoot'em up, Platformer and many more) to keep the game fresh. While each area/boss have different reason why it's challenging/difficult, many of those is very unbalanced. For example, [spoiler] Bioplatus M-3D/6th boss [/spoiler] require you to have extraordinary eye-hand coordination and multitasking skill. Among all enemy that resemble boss fight, i only managed to beat 6-7 boss without using cheat.\n\nThis game also has very few checkpoint on each area/boss. On adventure/platformer area, you could restart from beginning after spending 10-20 minutes where you have to avoid same trap or collect same item again. On boss fight, that means you'll need to repeat whole fight most of the time. It's could be annoying because since you're forced to find out boss behavior the hard way or repeating tedious part of the fight.\n\n3 HP and lack of difficulty option could be irritating for most modern player. There are time when i found out i only lose 3-10 HP when i use cheat and beat the boss. If there's easier difficulty where i have 6-10 HP, i could beat more boss by myself. But don't get me wrong, i feel really satisfied each time i beat boss (which i deemed can be beaten with practical amount of effort) without cheat. If the developer bother add easy difficulty which has higher player HP, give more Nana and slightly lower boss HP, far more people could enjoy this unique piece of artwork.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nWhile i have some rant, it's really unique experience even though i've played few hundred games. In overall, i have more positive sentiment than negative sentiment of this game. But even though i choose \"Yes\" when Steam ask \"Do you recommend this game?\", i'd rather choose \"Neutral\" or \"Information\" instead. If you're fan of 80's game or really like difficult game, you might come to like this game. But for most people, i'd recommend you to seek other game. Although if you really insist to play this game, you could use Cheat Engine and modify HP/Nana using value type Double (also called float64 or 8-byte float).\n\nP.S. I definitely will play the sequel (Episode IV-VI: White Meteor Saga according to the artbook) [b]IF[/b] the developer bother add easy difficulty option and more checkpoint during boss fight/exploration.\n- As a fan of Mimimi's Stealth Strategy Game,\nI love it so much, the operation system is getting smoother and more user-friendly comparing to Desperados III & Shadow Tactics.\nAlso I like how they added new elements to the game to make it more playable (E.g. Flexible team choice, character stories)\n\nThe only thing I don't like is the art.\nGame design is good but it'd be great if there's good looking characters...\n- Overall the concept and idea of the game is good and I would recommend it. It is worth the price for the amount of fun time you can have with it.\n\nPositives:\n+ Initially the game gives you some good frights and tension\n+ Variety of characters, ethnics and aesthetics to pick and chose from\n+ Variety of skills and abilities that are mostly unique and some have good synergy\n+ Variety of maps\n+ DLC costs are fair\n+ Skin costs are fair\n+ One of very few companies who communicates with the community\n+ A lot of good license characters available\n+ The game has a tutorial that explains the basics\n+ Various ways to play the game (stealth / agressive)\n\nNegatives:\n- A few bugs here and there\n- Some really annoying perks / addons on killers / survivors like 1 shot long range axes (to name an example), keys and moris (to name a few more)\n- Toxic community - Not everyone is toxic but a large portion of players are but lets be real you get that in every game these days\n- Matchmaking is pretty bad (but DBD is trying to fix this)\n- Sometimes unfair hit detection - Some hits look like you are being smacked way out of range or as a killer you see the grab animation on a survivor and then it just cancels out\n- Steep learning curve / unforgiving gameplay. You either have to learn and improve and adapt and overcome or you will be having a bad time as you climb ranks.\n- I bought this game in order to review it, seeing as there were no current reviews for it. \nI thought I'd help the game out by maybe giving it that tiny bit of publicity it needed to get off the ground.\nIn doing so I have failed. As this game isn't worth reviewing, there is nothing to review. Well, I should say there is stuff to review but I feel as though the dev's didn't even attempt to make this a game that anyone would enjoy. Well actually I'll let them off of the target of \"enjoy\", I'd go further to say it doesn't even feel like they tried to make a game that someone who had nothing to do and was bored out of their mind would say maybe I'll play this for a bit\nI jumped straight in, ignored the help in menu and started playing. It took me at least 4-5 mins before I even had the slightest concept of what was going on and what I had to achieve. Once I did get the hang of it I still thought \"I must be missing something, I'm not really doing anything\" so I ventured to the help menu to find that nope, thats it buddy.\nThe controls are lacking, the soundtrack and the sound effects (which happen to be a melody playing) do not blend at all, (they play completely out of time on top of the soundtrack).\nYou can buy it and prove me wrong, go ahead. This is just my opinion.\n- I was excited to play this after playing Persona 5 and Persona 5 Royal (my introductions to the series) to death.  This game was raved about and I thought, if it's more of the same then this should be great...\n\nThe major problem I have with this game is that it's so painfully obvious that it's a game made 13 years ago.  It's not a bad game, the look and feel of the Persona series is there and the characters are interesting etc.  But at the same time whenever I played this game, I just wanted to go back and play P5R instead.  Everything is just better in P5R.  The dungeons for example, the difference is night and day.  P5R's dungeons have so much more life to them, and look so much better.  Most of the environments in this game look like dull coloured LEGO sets put together.  It looks like it was originally on a handheld console (despite the remaster).  The other major example is the voice acting.  My god, some of the voice acting in 4G is on par with some of the worst Square Enix efforts.  Audio balancing is terrible as well.  And then there's the subjective stuff.  I personally much prefer P5R's soundtrack over this one, aside from maybe a couple of songs that were cool.  The setting of Tokyo is much more interesting and dynamic than this hokey town in the middle of nowhere.  The characters themselves I found much more engaging in 5R.  This was particularly helped by the quality of voice acting.  I think \n\nI'm glad that people are able to experience this game again on a more available platform.  I think potentially if I had played this back when it was released, I would probably have a different opinion of this game.  If you like Persona games and can look beyond what's dated badly, then the core game is very much the same.  If you were a fan already, this is a quality refresh to the game.  However, if you're like me and experienced the future of this series before playing this, I dont recommend it.  P5R provides the same gameplay but adds so much more.  It's a shame we cannot get that game on Steam instead.\n- 69 % of your time you spend walking around the forest, \nblowing in the animal whistle without actually seeing any animals\n\n10 % of your time you spend carefully approaching the animals you have spotted in the far far away distance\n\n1 % of your time you spend aiming, fireing your gun and missing all the significant organs of the animals\n\nThe last 20 % of your time you spend running after the animals you have wounded without ever seeing them again\n\nMost realistic hunting experience ever\n- This game was a real treat. I played the 1st Valfaris and became an instant fan. I love that this is direction went by the developers, I feel it was a really good evolution of the series and mixing it up with a shoot em up gives it that extra punch/kick/slash. The graphics, characters and bosses are just so awesome and you can feel the grittiness of the mechs. Aside from the awesome game play, the environments and atmosphere has really leveled up. Love the boss destruction sequence as you can feel that accomplishment of kicking its ass. looking forward to Valfaris next installment. Congratulations with this metal AF game!\n- Think you’re good at racing? Well, this game will give you a RKO.\n\nI don’t even know much about rally when I bought the game. I just see cars driving at dirt, weaving steering left and right constantly, and thought it looks cool. \n\nThis game is HARD. The learning curve is really steep. The first time I played, I constantly fly off a cliff and hug into trees. Because i don’t understand what my co driver is reading. He talk so fast that my tiny brain couldn’t process in time, sometimes I’m so confused that I go straight in junction because I can’t remember he said turn left or right. The cars are constantly out of control. \n\nAfter I learned about weight transfers that I’m able to start utilizing oversteer into corners. No more cripple into finish line with two tyres missing, that’s when the fun begins. Dirt Rally 2.0 is different from other racing games. You don’t race against other drivers, instead you race against time. If you turn off the hud, then it’s only you and the road, and TREES :)\n\nThe sound of the gravel hitting under your car. Dirt stained on your car as you progress through out the stage. The pops and bang coming out of exhaust when you shift. These combination feels somehow relaxing and satisfying at the same time.\n\nThe only downside of Dirt Rally 2.0 is that it requires constant internet connection, even when most of its content are single player. I wouldn’t complain if the server is stable. But sadly it isn’t. The server down happen quite frequently. Imagine you feel like you completed a 10 minutes perfect run, no crashes or mistakes. But then the game refuses to connect to the server. So the game won’t record your progress. It’s like a big middle finger to the player. \n\nI could make this review a thumbs down solely for the “always online” requirement, cuz it makes the player experience kinda inconsistent, but the gameplay itself does make up for it though. I mean when it works, it works remarkably well.\n\nApart from always online issue. Dirt Rally 2.0 is fantastic, the handling, physics, graphics etc. everything is on point. If you’re interested, buy the GOTY edition, it easily double the contents of the original game had. Worth every single cents.\n- If you played Counter-strike for Half-life 1. You'll surely like this, because, it has great graphics, gameplay, brings back memories, and plus you won't have to worry about forgetting to get ammo from the shop, because, the shop does all the ammo shopping for you. And it's cheap. If you want to play with me on this game, send me an invite, and maybe I'll play. That's it for my recommendation, have fun fragging. Oh and please don't be a jerk and listen to one of your commanders, because, not cooperating can get you killed in the first place. Sheesh.\n- Katana ZERO? More like, Katana ZERO CONCLUSION.\n\nI had too high expectation on this game, I thought it was going to be Hotline Miami but better.\nIn the end I still prefer Hotline Miami, specifically Hotline Miami 2.\n\nOne thing I dislike is the lack of combo scoring system. \nIt's a good way to make the players act fast and execute their actions flawlessly, instead the game only has a timer bar that never runs out as a way to motivate the player to go fast.\n\nI am aware how \"pointless\" game scores are.\nBut seeing a number going up feels good.\n\nWhat happens when you kill an enemy in Hotline Miami?\n - You get to see a number pops out, and the score goes up indicating that you are doing good!\n - Satisfying bloody hit sound.\n - Throbbing light on the edge of the map.\n - Randomized dead sprite of the enemy, sometimes they get dismembered depending on the weapon.\n\nIn Katana ZERO you'd get :\n - A \"fwoob\" sound.\n - A same dying animation of the enemy getting knocked and bleed to death. Instead of getting decapitated or something.\n - Flashy slash effect.\n\nAt one point I wondered on why should I even bother killing the enemies when it didn't reward me with anything in the room with a minecart. \nWhen having the enemy being killed by the minecart or the player makes no difference.\n\n[spoiler]More like Katana ZERO REWARD. I think this is it, exactly why I am disappointed by it. Imagine playing soulsbornekiro or Hollow Knight without earning any kind of currency??? Killing the enemies would feel pointless.[/spoiler]\n\nIt's basically way more fun and rewarding to kill an enemy in Hotline Miami than Katana ZERO.\n\nThen there are other stuff like...\nUnfun stealth gameplay. \nRollspamming without consequence.\nBeing able to endlessly doing a mid air attack without having to touch the ground first.\n\nThere are also waaaay too many checkpoints in my opinion, it encouraged me to just brute force everything with roll spamming without having to worry about starting over.\nThe rooms could've been a bit bigger and longer. But also less room, quality over quantity.\n\nAnd finally, the story.\nI was intrigued by it but it just ended abruptly with a \"To be continued\".\nIt's like they only wrote 50% of it then slapped a \"To be continued\" and called it a day.\nThe game seems to rely heavily on \"mentioning stuff off screen that player will never get to see\" to tease the player.\nI already knew that the game is going to be short, but I didn't expect it to be this disappointing. \n\nIt's not a bad game, I just had the wrong expectation.\n\nI might change it to positive if I was satisfied by the DLC.\nOr maybe after beating the hard mode, I heard it's more fun.\n- An amazingly fun and short adventure from the creator of Rakuen. Mr. Saitou is a game based in the same universe as Rakuen, but follows the story a salaryman, Mr. Saitou. Mr. Saitou takes you on a journey that explores some serious undertones, but approaches the subjects with incredible sensitivity, respect and some very light and silly humor. There's tons of flavor text to be discovered, pop culture references to be recognized and if you've played Rakuen, familiar characters to meet. As you make your way through the story, there are lots of puzzles that are simplistic, but well thought out in a way that adds to the story.The game is made to be played in 1 sitting that may vary depending on how much you interact with the world. This game can also be played by many ages and is family friendly. You DO NOT have to play Rakuen first to enjoy this game or understand it, but it will definitely add a depth of sentimentality to the game, as there are some call backs. I would absolutely recommend this game to anyone and you may find yourself learning something about your own life during Mr. Saitou's journey.Have a long day!\n- If you like management type games and RPGs, this is the perfect mix. It's just enough management to allow you to thrive with mostly strategy without feeling bogged down, and just enough RPG elements to get you invested in not just your squad, but each individual character in it. \n\nHere's a tale from my experience with the game;\n\nThis is the kind of game to change your entire perspective on life itself. Failure is not the end, nor the beginning, but a constant in this world that you can either let destroy you or make you stronger. Allow me to tell you a story. The story of New Battlehill. \nNear the Shek city of Squin, not far east, was a small town. It went through many names. The first that stuck was Firstyeet, totally not a placeholder. It wasn't an notable settlement, merely consisting of a shack, an iron processor, and some walls to mildly inconvenience the roving gangs of Dust Bandits that liked to bully the residents. After being evicted from their own city once again, the residents, Denver, Soto, Ruka, and Meow, vowed to take back their home. After training and buying the best weapons and armor they could, they made their way back to Firstyeet. To their surprise, however, they would not have to fight. One of the bandits had picked a fight with a herd of goats. The bandits' defense failed against the caprine assault. From this, the town would get its second name - Densorumego. Den for Denver. So for Soto. Ru for Ruka. Me for Meow. And Go for the true heroes, the goats.\nPeace would not last long but soon the residents of Densorumego would become strengthened by their constant fighting. On the elevated, somewhat round land on which Densorumego sat, there were many large fights involving a lot of people. If only there was some sort of name to reflect this... \nAnd from that, the town was renamed for the last time, to Battlehill.\nThings were looking up. The town built its first farms and expanded to be almost four times its original size. But this peace would not last. Battlehill's new ambitions of self sufficiency would attract the attention of a new foe - The Shek Kingdom.\nThe Shek claimed ownership of the land Battlehill was on, and as such, demanded all food grown there be given to them. Confident from their many victories against the Dust Bandits, the Battlehillites refused the Shek demands. Their risk was calculated... but man were they bad at math.\nAll but one were nearly killed in the ensuing battle, and the one person that wasn't knocked into a coma was stuck on the wall because part of the wall was destroyed and he could no longer reach the stairs because of that. The people knew they couldn't fight the Shek, but they would not allow themselves to be subservient either. And so began their malicious compliance. The Shek would get all the food in Battlehill, as it would be none - The Battlehillites were moving.\nI could write entire books about their journey around the west. The Fogmen, the ruins, the Screeching Bandits, there's many a tale. But, eventually, the people would find a new home. In the harsh and Beak Thing infested land of Vain, homeland of the Western Hive, they would found their new home - New Battlehill.\nJump to now, the city is thriving, they have more bread than they know what to do with, they've grown strong from defending their home from the Beak Things, and their population has grown. They are currently planning a reconquest of Battlehill, which was occupied by Dust Bandits shortly after they left.\n\nThere is a part I left out, between Firstyeet and Densorumego - I had repeatedly failed to retake Firstyeet, and I was about to quit the game. I was frustrated that I'd gone and bought the best arms and armor and still failed. And when I tried to set up a training ground on a mountain near Squin, bandits again came and defeated me. I went as far as to try and get a refund, which was denied. That refund being denied was the best thing that could've happened. I decided to give the game another try, and to try accepting my failures and growing from them. And if I hadn't done that, I would never have founded New Battlehill. None of the legend worthy tales my squad has been through would have happened. And I'd never have had the fun of going through all of them.\n\nIn short, get this game. It is just great.\n- This piece of art right here?\n\nGame of the year for someone like me who loves platformers, a great soundtrack, and is a big fan of Metroidvania style games? Oh yeah.\n\nGame of the year for everyone else? Maybe!\n\nLet me tell you some things about this game:\n+Offers a lengthy adventure (I completed 100% in 28 hours and there is still more I could do if I wish)\n+The combat is so tight! Not only are the mechanics themselves simple and crisp but they are also super deep with things like charms which you can equip to give certain abilities and other classic staples in these types of games like a dash / double jump / wall jump\n+The controls are very fine tuned and it always feels like it was my fault if I died and not simply poor game design\n+The bosses are sick AF and they all have really cool moves / patterns / styles to them\n+The game manages to never feel linear at all, it has no direct markers telling you where to go it simply throws you into the world (Hallownest it is called) and leaves the exploring up to you\n+The Soundtrack is bomb. These indie company hits lately always offer a memorable and groovy soundtrack and this game is no different. It offers a few solid themes for many of the fight scenes as well as beautiful atmospheric soundtracks which fit the areas so nicely\n+Oh and did I mention the game looks beautiful? Go check images of this game right now like the area \"The City of Tears\" and just marvel at the amount of detail put into the scenery. For a game this big the art style and attention to detail is truly impressive\n\nMy real only problem with this game is not even so much a problem at all as it is a warning: to those of you out there on the more casual end who may struggle with difficulty in this genre you have been warned! While the game is mostly pretty forgiving with save points in most general areas I will say some of the combat gets pretty tough. For someone like me I enjoyed it thoroughly as I felt the difficulty was just the right amount and it never felt cheap or unfair.\n\nFot those out there who aren't as into these type of games as much I feel Hollow Knight is a great game to start you into the genre. The price is very reasonable, and it seems the devs are going to continue adding more content which is hype. Give it a try, You won't be dissapointed!\n- Great game! At times it can get frustrating (boss battles), but the good out weighs the bad by a landslide. Even when i did get mad, which was a lot, I never stayed mad for long. There is just far too much to enjoy about the game. The art style is just simply amazing, the movement of your character around the world is just so satisfying once you get used to it, the puzzles aren't too easy or too hard, and everything in the game just goes together pretty much perfectly. All in all this game is extremely well made. Would recommend buying if you want a super unique experience 11/10\n- A Short Hike is a relaxing, casual game about exploring an expansive, mountainous island park and eventually making your way to its summit so you can get cell phone reception.\n\nYou play as Claire, a bird who can climb, glide, and flap to great heights using a stamina system based upon how many golden and silver feathers you’ve collected. Along the path to the mountaintop you’ll encounter Animal Crossing-style characters who are friendly, punny, and usually have some minor task for you to solve, ranging from finding lost items to making deliveries.\n\nHelping residents of the island is completely optional, as is just about every activity in the game other than locating a few feathers and reaching the summit; as a result, length can range from an hour if you don’t stop to smell the roses to a few hours if you decide to make friends with everyone and see all the park has to offer.\n\nActivities include filling out a fishing journal by trading in your catches, digging in suspicious spots, solving treasure map clues, parkour racing, and opening up shortcuts by breaking blocked entrances and watering bouncy flowers. \n\nA Short Hike has a charming aesthetic and a lovely, peaceful soundtrack. I felt driven to see everything the game had to offer despite not being forced into any of it and never lost interest until I did so. It’s a beautiful little world that will make fans of Animal Crossing feel right at home.\n- THERE IS ONLINE CO-OP with REMOTE PLAY!  Im not sure why that guy put misinformation in the beginning of his review.\n\nIf you have 3 friends, only one of you needs to buy this and invite them through remote play and you will have a BLAST. First session we played 3 hours straight and laughed so hard we gave ourselves a headache.\n\nAlot of love went into making this game and a lot of hidden easter eggs nodding to other games. If you need something to play with your group of friends during quarantine, this is the game!\n- I played all I needed to realise this game has no intuition, no fun, no useful or interesting mechanics. It's deadass a flash game but somehow is less stable.\n\nConstant crashes and forced 480p fullscreen. \n\n0.5/10\n- After the past few years of broken, buggy AAA games I've started to lose the passion I once had for the industry. This masterpiece came out of no where and completely reignited my love for gaming. PLEASE do not sleep on this game, it's such a breath of fresh air from the garbage you'd normally expect from modern day companies. Definitely taking a spot in my top 5 favorites and I haven't even scratched the surface of the game yet, it's just that good. Beautiful art style, crisp animations, a unique concept, FUN gameplay, its everything I've been wanting and more. Kudos to the devs for making this absolute banger <3\n- So, I've been playing games for 36 year now. All the genres, like them all. Most of all RPG, turn based strategies, WW2 shooters (BF) etc. And just achieved victory in Slay the spire, after 206 hours of hugely enjoyable play. I would say this is in top 5 games of all times for me. Maybe even top 2, together with Card Hunter. Those two games are so far the two games I would take to a deserted island. I am actually seriously considering making my own card based game in the future. So just try this. Even my 10 year old son loves it. I just recorded The Slaying for him xD\n- This piece of art right here?\n\nGame of the year for someone like me who loves platformers, a great soundtrack, and is a big fan of Metroidvania style games?

Give it a try, You won't be dissapointed!\n- As someone who is as obsessed with Sentai/Tokesatsu/KamenRider/PowerRangers as he is with Megaman/RetroActionPlatformers, I would like to tell Domesticated Ant Games:\n\nThank you for developing this masterpiece. I know you didn't make it just for me, but it sure as hell felt like it.\n- Do yourself a favor.  Go in as blind as possible.  Don't look at any guides.  The system of getting pages of the manual that you can't fully understand is a stroke of genius.\n\nAlso I haven't found a waterfall that *doesn't* have a secret behind it.\n\n**EDIT: Finished the game**\n\nI'll admit for many of the later \"post-game puzzles\" I looked at a guide for.  The in game language is very difficult to decipher blindly, and if you're not familiar with English you probably shouldn't even bother.  \n\nThe surprising thing about this game is you can pretty much do any puzzle at any given time once you get one or two specific items, but because of how the manual is handled, you'll never know how until you see the pages (or experiment a lot)\n\nI think the most amount of tries I've spent on a boss fight was 7-8, but nothing is stopping you from exploring more and finding stat boosts.\n- Dear Dev, \nI love this game, if you're reading reviews, please consider some ideas to make it better:\n-  Level designing: Add more ways to choose, and different endings. Right now SoR4 is flat from A to B, it made me feel down compare to SoR3.\n- Alternate customs, and playable same characters: Floyd is overrated and all my friends want to pick him. Make a game with 4 Floyds running sound fun. Use lifetime score to unlock customs.\n- 2v2 Battle! WHY NOT?\n- Shiva (new), Max (new), Roo, Estel (Badass Woman Cop)\n- Steam trading cards: I know it's not importance, but who doesnt want some badass backgrounds on steam profile?\n- getting better in controls, HUD, and resources management balances, unlike Rise TR\nslight improvement in graphics, OST is good though\nseveral 'cool' scenes, creativity has taken a great leap <applause>\ncross over with Assassin's Creed (due to same publisher?)\nLara is getting more and more 'demonic', no hard feelings, its just subliminary messages to the youth by major games coorporation\nI can't believe i can play as Lara Kid instead of Lara Croft :D '+1'\nstoryline is getting ridiculous, come back to earth bruh LOL its good fun\n\ngood luck on your future endeavour devs :)\n- [h1][u]Wonderful game with a great battle system, but terrible netcode[/u][/h1]\n\n[h2]Foreword[/h2]\nI got to know \"Naraka: Bladepoint\" through a friend.\nAt first I was very skeptical, so I only bought the Standard Edition, and later the Ultimate and Deluxe Editions.\nFirst of all, this game has a steep learning curve with its battles.\nExactly why the game may not be suitable for everyone.\nUnfortunately, that doesn't make the playerbase any better, but read more about that below.\nNevertheless, the game and especially the combat system offers a lot of potential and has a lot of posivites to offer.\n\n[h2]Positives[/h2]\n[list]\n[*]Regular updates with ever increasing content\n[*]Few to almost no bugs and if they are, then they are fixed very quickly\n[*]Steep learning curve - Especially at the beginning the game is not easy, but you can quickly get into it with friends\n[*]Pleasant graphics\n[*]Nice sound design, which is location dependent\n[*]Potential to grind for higher ranks and for the Hall of Fame\n[*]Different game modes and events\n[*]Extremely extensive combat system - many possibilities to conter weapons\n[*]Extensive stats, either ingame or with Naraka+ mobile app (app is absolutely top!)\n[*]Well thought through character designs\n[*]Extremely individual character editor - From Thanos to Bruce Lee everything is customizable.\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Neutral[/h2]\n[list]\n[*]Climbing system - It's really good compared to other games. However, you still sometimes get stuck on edges or can't get to the platforms above.\n[*]Microtransactions - I'm personally not a fan of them, but it's not a must in this game and doesn't favor anyone.\n[*]Answers of Discord team members very questionable on some questions\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Negatives[/h2]\n[list]\n[*]Terrible netcode - players with highpings are treated preferentially\n[*]Few European players - Extremely many VPN players with many different Asian characters and languages in the voicechat\n[*]Voicechat is not well thought through\n[*]Partial performance losses\n[*]Ranking matches are partly wrong - Either with new players (Bronze) or experienced players (Asura)\n[*]Partially bad English, as well as German translation\n[*]Some abilities are combined absolutely disgusting and unfortunately more or less meta\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Review written out[/h2]\nNaraka has become a real love-hate relationship game for me.\nI love the extensive combat system and also the steep learning curve from noob to a slightly experienced player. (I am Platinum 1 - Solar 5 at the time of this review).\nSo while the combat system could be frustrating at times at first, I love it all the more now.\nOnly the climbing system, as well as some combinations of abilities or ultimates could be revised.\nFor example, it is common practice (meta) that many players use Ultimates that stun and ensure that you immediately get into the next Ultimate.\nThis is sometimes a bit frustrating, because these combinations are played very often and other heroes, especially the new ones, are not really played because of it. \nHowever, you can work around these combinations or counter them yourself. Unfortunately, this is not always easy, especially for new players.\n(For example, the combination of Valda - Viper - Tianhai).\nHowever, a victory and the killing of opponents, especially higher ones, with whom you are unfortunately sometimes matched, releases a lot of endorphins in Naraka, so that a victory feels extremely rewarding.\n\nUnfortunately, this brings me to the part that makes it extremely difficult for me to decide on a positive rating for this game.\nThe game, for being released in 2021, has a horrible netcode for a martial arts battle royale game.\nThere are extremely many Asian players who connect directly or via VPN to the europian servers.\nThis is especially noticeable when you activate the voice chat, which by the way, has no individual regulation for volume or a mute function per player.\nUnfortunately, those players have a ping beyond 150ms.\nSadly, this is a big problem for people with low latency.\nYou partly punch through enemies bodies.\nVarious focus attacks are therefore not always blockable or the opponent lags at you, while the player for himself has no lags at all.\nThis is not only unfair, but should actually no longer be a problem in 2022.\nFor example, it would be enough to not let players with a ping greater than 150ms/200ms move.\nAccording to the Discord community manager, there is a region lock and most of the names are just \"memes\" . \nBut you don't notice anything about the region lock in the game and we can theoretically connect to other servers.\n\nAnother big problem is the matchmaking.\nEven with Bronze or Silver, you are matched with Asura players when there is a lack of players.\nThis is not necessarily nice, but you get a lot of points for survival and you also learn a lot of techniques.\n\nAs negative as this all sounds, the game still gets a positive rating from me.\nI love the sound design, which comes into its proper place in the battles and is different for each location on the map.\nThis reminds me of Prince of Persia in some areas and provides more excitement in fights.\nIn addition, the varied battles, no matter how hopeless they sometimes seem, are all the more rewarding if you win.\nEspecially when you're killing another team, consisting of 3 people, as the last survivor of your team.\nThe map design is also absolutely great. Every location has been carefully thought through. \nGreat lighting design really highlights some of the locations.\nYou can overlook small bugs like misplaced branches (a branch hangs in the air next to a tree).\n\nBut my favorite part is the grinding to a higher rank. \nThe ranking system and especially the Hall of Fame encourage you to play.\nGetting into the top 100 of a much-played character feels very rewarding.\nSo does slaying a moonbane.\n\n[h2]Epilogue[/h2]\nAll in all, despite the flaws, Naraka has a lot going for it, and even though the larger issues can be extremely frustrating, the game saves itself with the extensive battle system, the incredibly great locations including sound design, and the extensive ranking system including Hall of Fame.\nI love the game because of the thoughtful little things, even if I hate it extremely at times.\n\nEven though the game can quickly become frustrating for new players, you should be aware that it has a lot to offer if you are willing to learn.\nThe accompanying app is an extremely well thought through and great gimmick in this regard.\n\nI would be happy to take you by the hand and introduce you to the game.\nJust visit us on our [URL=https://discord.nox-eagles.de]Discord[/URL].\n\nI would like to thank all of you who have read my review until the end.\nI'm looking forward to your opinions :)\nWith best regards\nYour Holt\n- Fall Guys had a rough start. Unstable servers and people cheating to win. About a year later I picked it up again and I must say it really has improved a lot. I honestly don't have any issues which cheaters anymore and the servers don't crash on me anymore.\n\nIt's also getting more and more stages to play so it feels refreshing to play a few rounds every day.  The events for certain skins are also really fun. Sure there could still be some improvements like personal usernames or maybe a way to trade in skins you don't want. But I feel like they listen to their community and are aiming to make it as fun as possible. I'm interested to see how Fall Guys will keep evolving!\n- Started strong, ended annoyingly.\n\nMoral of the story? People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.\n\nIt paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that \"routine\" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.\n\nI liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters. But it all fell apart and tries to teach a very vapid moral that someone in their early 20's who has never had a meaningful relationship would idealize.\n\nAt least it was short.\n\n- This game's constant revealing of stranger and even stranger esoteric strangeness with every case, the way hitting start you are slammed in the gob by an unexpectedly gnarly tableau, a sinister mise-en-scene with a man burning to death on fire or blasted apart by a canon while wry cultists in various states of masked and undmaskedness make slight comments to say How deserving they were to be killed by us in just that way, oh yes!\n\nAhhhh! That is all about what I love The Case of the Golden Idol for.\n\nIt is 13 deduction puzzles (including the DLC) for you and perhaps a friend on the couch wherein you will become acquainted with a decades long revenge tragedy that tore several families and several kingdoms apart as many people lost there lives in heinous and sometimes magical ways. As you move along the story and investigations grow more complex, which could be a bit fatiguing, especially by the end of the DLC. Though everything here is great, don't mishear me. The art is disgusting. It's visuals and music complete the necessary deranged curious mood to undergird the transmutating tone of a murder-filled horror story into one that equally unnerving as it is subtly hilarious.\n\nThis is a game made by some Latvians from Latvia, and maybe, buster, you should just pay them some money and attention.\n- One of the better RPG maker games i've seen and played, especially considering it was made on RPG Maker 2003. The beginning of the game was great and felt like there was a ton of potential, but a lot of the overworld mechanics were underutilized (jumping, swimming, orb flying). The writing was alright in the beginning, but started to turn into a bad fanfic in the middle/end of the game. The ending was... wholly unsatisfying and abrupt. It made very little sense, and did absolutely nothing to answer any questions asked at any point in the game, rather asking brand new questions and providing no resolution for any of the characters. You'll get about 10-14 hours of this game, which is kind of amazing for an RPG maker game, but honestly, steam has SOOOO many better titles available in this price range that unless you're into RPG maker, you should go elsewhere.\n- My profile pic is the reaction i have towards the game devs that made this game.\nVisually disgusting, gameplay wise impossible and over all terrible.\nWhile it's possible to beat it and get all the achievements it's difficult and also the space level is actually visual aids it's so disgusting to look at that you can't even focus on the gameplay.\nNot worth it even for free which is how i probably got it i can't remember and i don't want to...\n- ghrrrrrrrrrrrrrr... *shapeshifts into six pack sweaty wolf grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrolw  grrrrrrrrrrOOF rwooof woof *barks seductivley in public park brhhhhhhrrrrrrrrrrr *foaming at the mouth ahsdf nrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrauoooooooooooo \n- Tentative review of game in progress, but so far it is amazing and I had to leave a review in support of it.  As far as the game itself goes, I'm giving it a 9/10.  As far as the port goes, the lack of keyboard input prompts seems frustrating when they already have the ability to change between xbox and ps4 buttons, but I use a controller and expect most will for this, but it's worth mentioning in the sake of fairness and accuracy.  There is a certain graphics setting called \"effects\" with high and low.  High is causing major fps drops under certain conditions even on a pc with an rtx 3080 and a 5800x cpu.  Devs have acknowledged it and are working on improving it.  Other than these issues though, no problems at all.  Online play has been smooth and i haven't experienced any disconnects.  The game itself has only crashed once in 93 hours, but that was also during excessive alt tabbing while the game was in true fullscreen mode, and it crashed on an alt-tab itself, so I'm not really blaming the game on that one given it was the only time.  Again, overall the game is playing great and I have no problems with it on a functional level as well as an entertainment level, I just want to be as fair and accurate as I can, and these were really the only problems I could find with it.\n- A simple but detailed explanation of why, after having played both versions, I prefer Definitive Edition (DE) instead of 2013 Edition:\n\n-2013 Edition's farms don't automatically re-seed, forcing you to either order your villagers to re-seed them, or to mash the \"queue re-seed\" button in the mill. In DE, you can set the mills to automatically re-seed.\n-Definitive Edition lets you shift-click construction orders just like in 2013 Edition, but in the latter, the villager will move to build the last building you placed down. If you order several buildings, they will stop constructing the building they're already working on to go build the new one. In DE they will wait to finish the first building before starting on the next one.\n-2013 Edition's unit sprites are very pixelly and hard to distinguish one type of infantry unit from another, and to a lesser extent, one team from another. DE's graphics are much clearer so it is very easy to distinguish unit type/team.\n-Definitive Edition is far, FAR more customizable than 2013 Edition. Not just with the settings (graphics, UI, and controls are much more changeable) but especially with creating a game, namely win conditions, starting conditions, map sizes, unit restrictions, etc. You can adjust many more settings to make a new game into whatever kind of scenario you want. Also you can see what the map types actually look like in DE.\n-Definitive Edition has noticeably better pathfinding than 2013 Edition.\n-In DE you can zoom in and out. In 2013 Edition you can't.\n-In DE you can queue build orders while simultaneously upgrading the building. In 2013 Edition you can't even see any build options while a building is in the middle of upgrading.\n-In DE you can tell scouts to automatically scout out the map.\n-In DE the HUD shows you how many villagers are working on each resource. 2013 Edition does not do this, you have to play hide and seek with each one to count them.\n-The soundtrack for DE has more faction-specific songs, as well as less repetitive music. Both game's soundtracks are good, but I find having the DE soundtrack playing in the background to be more enjoyable. This point is pure preference.\n-2013 Edition's graphics are nice if you enjoy the old-school style, but DE's graphics are significantly easier on the eyes and prettier.\n-Definitive Edition has more civilizations.\n-Definitive Edition is just as moddable and has a very passionate modding community.\n-Definitive Edition seems to have more balanced gameplay.\n- I highly recommend this game for the atmosphere alone. It's worth learning the ins and outs of the combat just to explore the wider world of this game.\n- I finished the game on keyboard and had some pretty good fun with it.\n\nno way in hell am i going to try and S-rank all the levels, though.\n\nEDIT: this morning I woke up and thought \"well i'll only try to S-rank level 1 and then i'll put it down\", so that's the story of how i S-ranked every level in the game.\n- IRL, I really am an unmotivated 20 year old college student, not many friends, living away from my mom.\nThis is a game that kids might not be able to relate as much as peeps my age.. but Im not saying there's an age restriction or something, no. There's a lot of useful lessons anyone can pick up from this.\n\nThe emotional issues it tackles are pretty grounded and somewhat refreshing to see in a game. There's a HUGE mystery element when it comes to the story. (which is sooo damn good mind you). But the conversations you have with the people in this game are just so real and cherishable, you could just wish these in-game days won't stop. \n\nThe small moments you have with family and friends in Night in the Woods are probably one of the most amazing experiences I ever had in a game\n\nPS: After finishing the story, I got all sappy and tear jerky that I went and called my mom to tell her that I love and miss her and stuff.. that's what this game is.\n\nUgh kill me. Im so corny. I love this feeling. So refreshing. f*ck off all of you.\n- Based on the generic, cartoonish-sounding name and (at first glance) Hearthstone-looking graphics, I initially ignored Monster Train. But I later read some praise for it that made me think it might be worth a look. Especially since it turned out that I already owned it from a bundle or something. \n\nAnd what I discovered was a compelling mix of the best elements of Slay the Spire and My Life as a Darklord. A run generally takes less than an hour, and with so many possible combinations there's always something new to explore and try to exploit.\n- I'm not saying you should play this game, but if you do you can smoke \"dizzyweed\" with your dad and overthrow a fascist guy whose name literally means penis. Can not explain how much I started hyper fixating on this game.  This has had an irreversible change on my personality.\n- Where to start.... in short entire game is boring and very slow paced for no aparent reason.\n\nAI: AI performs only very basic functions and does not upgrade buildings and does the opposite of whats beneficial for your empire. AI does not do very well when engaging in displomacy.\n\nUI: You will spend most of your time trying to manage/hover around very CLUMSY and absolutely disgusting UI. Other 4x games offer far superior UI and make is easier to manage your asset on the field e.g. Sword of the stars II, Star Ruler 2, Distant world, Endless Legends, Endless Space etc.\n\nGFX: Graphics are not the top notch what you would expect from a modern 4x game but they are on far with Endless Legends. GFX leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nAlien Races: I dont need to say much but like Planets most of the races are COPY / PASTE. Nothing unique or special about each. \n\nMP: Multiplayer has a mind of its own and in most cases wont let you join public games unless its a private game.\n\nStellaris bring nothing new to 4x Genre in 2016!.\n Right now everyone is almost beta testing for the developers so we can find bugs, report them  and help them fix their game. Why not let players do beta before before release? But then there is  a question of sale and refund. \n\nBut overall this game does offer amazing soundtrack.\n- The good:\n+ Great story with satisfying finale.\n+ Endearing main cast/characters.\n+ Great world building meets with 90s Indonesia culture.\n+ Pleasant pixel artstyle. The cutscenes visual is amazing, even though i notice few awkward animation.\n+ Nice soundtrack.\n+ Puzzle is mostly well balanced. Not too difficult and doesn't make you feel bored/annoyed either.\n\nThe bad: - \n\nThe ugly:\n* Some pacing problem. There are so many sidetrack a.k.a. \"To complete sub-task C you also must complete sub-sub-task X, Y and Z\" during chapter 2-4.\n* Sometimes you might have to going around in circles to solve certain task or accidentally skipped something.\n\nDespite few flaws, A Space for the Unbound is definitely best game developed by Mojiken Studio and best story-driven/adventure game among all games created by Indonesian developer. If you like side-scrolling/adventure game (such as GRIS, Unreal Life or Oneshot) or game made by Mojiken Studio/Toge production (such as Coffee Talk or When The Past Was Around), you should give this game a try.\n- I keep seeing all these negative reviews comparing the game to Dark souls, so i'd like to set this straight:\n\nThis. Game. Isn't. Dark. Souls.\n\nIf you play this game like you would a dark souls game you would not have any fun, I know this because I spent the first 30 hours playing it like a Dark souls game and wasn't enjoying it.\nIn order to play this game how it is supposed to be played you need to start investing more in learning combos for your character, different techniques and items to use.  Each weapon has a unique set of combos you can invest in.  When you learn how to use these combos, you'll find that enemies who were infuriating to fight against being defeated much easier and the game becomes more challenging and fun over frustrating.\n\nSummery: This game isn't Dark Souls, So stop playing it like it is Dark souls!\nHighly recommend! \n\n\n\n- This game's constant revealing of stranger and even stranger esoteric strangeness with every case, the way hitting start you are slammed in the gob by an unexpectedly gnarly tableau, a sinister mise-en-scene with a man burning to death on fire or blasted apart by a canon while wry cultists in various states of masked and undmaskedness make slight comments to say How deserving they were to be killed by us in just that way, oh yes!\n\nAhhhh! That is all about what I love The Case of the Golden Idol for.\n\nIt is 13 deduction puzzles (including the DLC) for you and perhaps a friend on the couch wherein you will become acquainted with a decades long revenge tragedy that tore several families and several kingdoms apart as many people lost there lives in heinous and sometimes magical ways. As you move along the story and investigations grow more complex, which could be a bit fatiguing, especially by the end of the DLC. Though everything here is great, don't mishear me.

Rowling, at a time far before Harry & friends were even born. You’ll play as a fifth year student in the titular magics academy, admitted this late because of unspecified ‘special circumstances’. The virtual rendition of Rowling’s works is nothing short of exceptional, with not only Hogwarts itself, but also its environs (like the town of Hogsmeade or the dangerous Forbidden Forest), all recreated faithfully and down to the most minute details. Of course, some things will differ from movies and books, with the game being set in the 1800s. \n\nThe main story follows the classic ‘manifest destiny’ archetype, where your custom-made character will discover hidden potential that ties them to a greater purpose. Despite some genuinely memorable characters and some interesting side- and main-quests, the overall narrative can’t help but fall a little flat and stale, especially towards the ending phases. Nonetheless, many enjoyable adventures await you. Notably, there are no romance or love/hate dichotomies in the relationships you have with side-characters, as your choices will always end up in pretty much the same results during questlines.\n\n[h3]Exploration, Collectibles & Secrets[/h3]\nThe world is vast and visually magnificent, peppered to no-end with points of interest that often hold collectibles, currency or other utilities. Initially on foot, and later on with the iconic enchanted brooms and even flying magical creatures, you’ll be able to explore at leisure and clear the enormous amount of side-activities. A good portion of these, however, will prove inaccessible until you gain the right spells or abilities, in a sort-of ‘metroidvania’ fashion that promotes meaningful backtracking. Fast travel and an item-highlighting spell prove invaluable in saving time while exploring. Collectibles are mostly cosmetic, enabling the customization of both your wizard and your own private room once you unlock it, to suit various styles. \n\nMost dungeons and locations have additional puzzles or hidden paths that often lead to collectibles or extra resources; exploration feels rewarding, with a genuine sense of mystery surrounding each new point of interest you’ll find. Despite that, most dungeons and locations play out in the same way, and become repetitive in the long haul.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2933385898\n\n[h3]Combat System & Bosses[/h3]\nMagical battles use spells as sole means of offense and defense. Usually against multiple enemies at once, sometimes supported by allied NPCs, you’ll have to time your protection spell right in order to deflect incoming attacks, or dodge-roll away in case of unblockable ones. Enemies are varied and range from magical creatures to dark wizards and goblin soldiers, to name a few. Some of them may be weak to specific charms, others have shields you can break by using specific spell categories (damage, utility, movement) or other special abilities, like immunity to certain effects. \n\nCombat feels engaging, well-paced and is more than a little gory for this universe’s standards, death will be far more common than in the movies or books. The way you can combine spell effects to your advantage and use the environment further adds to the base system, while the amount of passive upgrades with item traits and spell-related talents you can gain progressively add another layer of depth. In late-game however you’ll become overpowered between potions, passive traits, talents and endgame spells - so much that supposedly fearsome dark wizards will prove little more than a nuisance due to power creep.\n\n[h3]Quests, Minigames & Challenges[/h3]\nQuests usually involve retrieving something, talking to a specific NPC, solving a treasure hunt based on visual clues, getting the solution to logic-based puzzles and more, depending on the case. While some side-quests are unique and memorable, most will be fetch chores or dry open-world shenanigans that you’ll have to repeat over and over in the same fashion. Less, but more meaningful and unique quests would have been better than this bloat, for sure. \n\nChallenges are paramount in unlocking unique bonuses like increased inventory capacity, many cosmetics, and even unique passive upgrades to equip in gear pieces. They often require you to slay X of a specific enemy, finish X of the same activity, and such “long-term” goals. Some of them are a massive grind and will only give you the 25th pair of gloves you don’t need, or other cosmetics that aren’t worth the effort.\n- Dear Dev, \nI love this game, if you're reading reviews, please consider some ideas to make it better:\n-  Level designing: Add more ways to choose, and different endings. Right now SoR4 is flat from A to B, it made me feel down compare to SoR3.\n- Alternate customs, and playable same characters: Floyd is overrated and all my friends want to pick him. Make a game with 4 Floyds running sound fun. Use lifetime score to unlock customs.\n- 2v2 Battle! WHY NOT?\n- Shiva (new), Max (new), Roo, Estel (Badass Woman Cop)\n- Steam trading cards: I know it's not importance, but who doesnt want some badass backgrounds on steam profile?\n- This game made me so miserable . \nThe writing can be as funny as heartbreaking \nThe Voice acting is one of the greatest i've ever heard \nA lot of the time , the many side quest were as awesome or even better than the main story (That is already amazing )\n\nPro : The whole game \nCon : Absolutely nothing \n\nIt's one of the greatest gaming experience I've ever had in my 24 years on this earth.\n- GIVE ME THE GODDAMN COPY/PASTE ROOM BUTTON!\n\n10/10 would play again.\n\n(Ttips to combat the somewhat broken system atm:\n\n1. Use patients list, manually send those patients to treatment or home: \na. Very high diagnosis but still queuing for GPs (even 100% patients will wait for GP till their death, it will waste most GP resources)\nb. Very low mood/health patient, if you can gurantee the patient getting their treatment soon w/o affecting others in the queue, use the room's queue function, or use click on the patient to change his position in the queue, otherwise send him home to avoid penalty\n\n2. Treatments are much more profitable than diagnosis, plus they leave after treatment no matter what, but if well treated, then you don't need much ghost hunting janitors\n\n3. If in need of money in the early game, don't bother with food/drink/bathroom/comfort, do the minium and focus on your diagnosis -> treatment, most patient will get treated before they rage quit, thus make you a lot of money. With staff, if they near rage quit, just raise their salary.\n\n4. In the early game, only put down the essential objects (e.g. only desk and file cabinet in GP's) to maximize your profit. They only room I recommend to decorate to lvl 5 is staff room to speed up their recovery.\n\n5. ALWAYS ensure there is a toilet right next to your staff room, and a cafe. If a tired staff need bathroom, he/she will walk all the way to the staff room and back to toilet and back to staff room, even if a toilet is right next to his/her office. Samething with Cafe, it provides a 'nice meal' bonus.\n\n6. Do not build more reception than you need, build less. It is a great way to control the patient flow, they don't wonder around while in a reception queue.\n\n7. For a large map, patients entering the hospital from mutiple gates. I don't recommend building reception other than one specific area (preferably right next to GP's office), reason as above.\n\n8. News agent can get long queue very easily, as long as you have one, patients in queue will travel all the way across the map for it. So be careful, either don't put any, or put one in every building (at least).\n\n9. With spare money, get your staff trained ASAP, especially staff providing treatment (to ensure high chance of successful treatment)\n\n10. Click on a room, goes to 'info' tab, the last sentence there will tell you what training the staff in the room should have.\n\n11. Keep track of your staff's skills, and assign them only ONE job in the staff -> job assignment menu, so AI won't mess your system up.)\n\nThings I'd really like to be changed:\n1. WAY too many patients.\nI think the new patients' growth(spawn) need to be slow down at certain point either automatically or mannually, I often found myself in need of double the amount of GP offices in the mid-game. Since GP offices are the choke points, it can get out of control in matter of seconds, which left no Human resources/money/time to train everyone. Besides, it is realistic, there are only so many people a town have.\nAnd because of the growth issue, I find myself have to build more and more, I'd like to slow down and taking care of every corner of my hospital, not just keep building. Quality takes time, nobody like be overly pushed by the game.\n\n2. Rooms merge\nJust like in real lives, Doctor's room are private, but pharmacy? I think other rooms should not be private - Allow us to put multiple machine and people in one room, make it shared. It is just bizzare to not make it shared, and vey wasteful of time/money/spaces. Besides, some room looks really empty.\n\n3. Wards\nWards are weird, I'm not sure why. Often than not, I have more than enough beds and nurses, but still 6+ wait outside, I'm not sure what triggers them to be 'called in'\n\n4. FOOD/DRINK/TOILET is broken\nI'm sorry, but I'm not gonna build cafe & bathroom every 3 inchs. IRL, most hospital have 1~3 cafes, a small~medium toilet on every floor. Space is valuable, I would rather leave it to medical facilities. I think the AI is a bit broken at this point, they constantly want drink/food/bathrooms while I have 6+ machines/2 toilets in every building. As if they can't walk 10m to the nearest one.\n\n5. Janitors are kind of dump.....I wish we can assign areas to janitors/assitances, so they won't always walk across the map back and forth.\n\n6. Man, this is 2018, we got central heating and air-conditioning...for real. Maybe make a seprate tunnel system? Like water, electricity, heat, air. Hospital's air exchange system is much more important than usual buildings I believe.\n\n7. Credit to Ibbi Wyxx in the commnet, I think it is great to set patient with certain percent of diagnosis straight to treatment rooms. It makes sense and later in the game, with doctors fully trained I imagine 100% diagnosis on most patients in the GP's shouldn't be a problem. And it is how real life works as well, dorctors are not always 100% sure whats wrong, they might start some harmless/urgent treatment first, myself actually is in this situation right now \n\n(sometimes I feel like I'm being treated in my own hospital because I just stayed at one IRL, so I have to make everything right as if trying to please myself...)\n\n8.  Some of those skills just look fancy since you can't replace them.\nThis one does not matter much, I'm very OCD when it comes to managment, so atm I have to wait for the right person w/o any skills I don't want on them so the training oppourtinity will not go wasted, but it is hard and annoying. Besides, it is a real problem since you can only learn 5 skills, so just choosing whoever is not effective and effecient in the long run. (for example a GP w/ Radiology skill)\n\nAlso, it makes some of the skill essentially useless, i.e. master class (speed up learning and teaching), it may seem useful, but it will eventually cost you a lot more than you gain. Down the line it will cost you one spot for other skill. If just hiring someone w/ this skill to teach then fire him, it is also costly and not making any real sense. \n\nThings I'd like to see (in DLCs?):\n1. Ambulances management. Ambulance are essential part of a hospital, ERs are even better! (Stayed at a ER bed not long ago watch the whole ER room working,man, ERs are cool af, but I do hope less people need to see it because it is...ER)\n2. Multifloor-hospital.\n3. ICU etc.?\n4. Medicin/drug development/management\n5. Specialists office?\n6. More background music/radio, its a bit repetitive at this point\n- Great game! At times it can get frustrating (boss battles), but the good out weighs the bad by a landslide. Even when i did get mad, which was a lot, I never stayed mad for long. There is just far too much to enjoy about the game. The art style is just simply amazing, the movement of your character around the world is just so satisfying once you get used to it, the puzzles aren't too easy or too hard, and everything in the game just goes together pretty much perfectly. All in all this game is extremely well made. Would recommend buying if you want a super unique experience 11/10\n- cool game but the font is almost unreadable at times\n- This HD remake of the PS2/DC classic Rez breathes some new life into a very old gem, however the update only harms its own image due to simple design mistakes and the enhancements that only highlight those mistakes further.\n\nThe PS2 controller made targeting slow and the game was intentionally timed to the slow pace at which you could target enemies. This meant the sound fx and visuals tied to targeting and shooting were all in sync with the music - that's at the core of the Rez experience. However the massively improved VR controls make targeting and shooting VERY fast. As a result all the sound effects and visuals play at once in a cacophony, the enemies die, and then you have a long 4 - 8 beat stretch of nothing as the backing track plods along, waiting for new enemies to spawn.\n\nWhat makes this worse is that the graphic updates end up being largely absent. Enemies filled the middle ground of the scene, captured your attention, and were the source of many particles, effects, the music, and animation - but since they all die quickly you're often left staring at the sky box with nothing happening. Then looking around in VR during these wait periods you can see how empty and simple the levels are because the HD parts are in the effects not the environments.\n\nThis all becomes especially noticeable in Area 5 when you demolish a mini boss and you're left sitting for 2-3 minutes floating through a desolate low-poly void with half the song missing. It feels like the game is broken. They should either have put a limit on the speed at which you can lock-on to enemies (matching to the BPM of the track), added more enemies to match the faster pace of this version, or filled the spaces with stuff to interact with so you can trigger the SFX/VFX where the music and visual upgrades are hiding.\n\nNo new player is going to know that the game is -meant- to be synced to the music and even if they try it is entirely out of sync with itself. This aspect demolishes the intended audio/visual experience which is the point of the entire game. It's very sad to consider how stunning Child of Eden was when it took advantage of the expanded memory, gpu, and peripherals it had available, and it goes to show how much potential has been squandered here. This would have been obvious if it had been properly play tested.\n\nTo add salt to the wound, Area X (the new VR part of the game made for Infinite) failed to work on my Quest 2. I couldn't target anything so I just couldn't play that at all (I hear it's basically just 1 extra 15 min level anyway). Truly disappointing in every way.\n- POTENTIAL SPOILERS \n\n\n\nSome guy came to me asking for mercy, gave me $20 and gave me a digital watch and asked me to let him in for the love of god, I arrested him.\n\nI let a prostitute get enslaved because I felt like it.\n\nI've ruined more marraiges than Monopoly.\n\nI've made a deal with a group of terrorists.\n\nI put poison on a random dudes passport and got him killed, along with another soldier.\n\nI got shot in the face in front of my own family.\n\nI'm only 3 hours into the game.\n\n\n\n10/10 \"It's okay\", \"Like Skyrim with guns\"\n\nDid I mention I killed Biker from Hotline Miami?\n- Melatonin is a simple rhythm game, with a focus on ease of gameplay and calmer sounds.\nIf you're expecting something on the tougher or more upbeat side, this ain't it.  Ironically, I had more fun as I stopped focusing on scoring well, and more fun when I was just feeling the music and half-asleep.  The sounds and songs are quite relaxing lol.\n\nOn the shorter side of games, it still delivers an enjoyable experience in what it offers. The timing is a *little* on the forgiving side, and there are even accessibility options if you need a little more help, such as timing circles, metronome, and a bigger Perfect window.  If you'd rather go for a challenge, a Perfect only option is also available.\n\nControls are quite simple, using [strike]4[/strike] 3 directional keys and an action key (Space by default). In each tutorial, you're told whether you'll need to hit directional keys or the action key, and whether they're held or not, as well as general timing.  For some stages, the instructions don't give you as good an idea as the tutorial itself/timing circles do (Work and Time levels for me).  All good, but in some levels you get tempo changes in the middle of the song that can throw you a bit off, especially if you're just grooving to the audio cues... when you can hear and distinguish them.  Unfortunately, there are a few levels where the audio cues are either far too similar to each other, or happen too quickly to react to.  This can be a bit of a bummer, as I prefer working off audio for rhythm games, as their focus should be lol.  \n\nWhile Melatonin doesn't bring a whole lot to the table, it doesn't need to.  Less is more here, and the art and sound direction definitely hit their target.\nRelax.\n- 2023...\n\n2 years...\n\n2 Languages...\n\nEDIT:\n\nTLDR: Game is too simple, better get Factorio or Riftbreaker\n\n\nPlayed again after ~1 year, nothing has changed in the basic QoL or coding system.\n\n\n- It still uses an older builder system than Factorio did 10 years ago: you actually have to craft the base material manually every time before you can build the building, instead of it being done automatically by a simple click on the building in the build menu.\n\n- If you have crafting orders set, new items added to your inventory will not be read by the current crafting orders and keeps on produce stuff your already own...\n\n- Items don't have their own output for transport lines, but instead require this stupid additional output... (I think the developer couldn't create a better output than this simple one)\n\n\n20 minutes and that's enough for me for now, I'm not putting in any more effort for EA project\n- Falcom's Action RPG Masterpiece.\n\nbest story in the series. it follows the latest adventure of Adol and his companions, stranded in an island and slowly uncovering their secrets. the tight, but well developed cast are absolutely the best written characters in the series. from party member to your fellow castaways all have developed motivation, personality and charm. \n\nalot of the horribad translation and voice acting have been fixed, and it finally got the treatment it deserve as a masterpiece. \n\nthe gameplay is an evolution of the modern Ys game. at its core, ys 8 is an action RPG where you control adol and several other party members with unique set of skills, moveset, weapons and super attack. each character represent an attack type (slash, pierce, smash) that are pitted against various enemies with certain weaknesses. great variety of enemies, amazing boss battles, music and story. \n\non release, there seems to be a big problem for the port, but as far as i know, everything has been patched to very good level of stability. over 70 hours, the game crashed twice (and saved by the intuitive autosave system), run flawlessly 60 FPS and 1440p without a single slowdown. \n\n10/10 game go buy so we get monstrum nox on PC.\n- They need to add more weapons like a galil or m249 or something and maybe more vehicles and playmodes.But overall so many possibilities\n- This game is utter trash, a classic example of a terrible game that exists only to make the developer money on card sales. There are no options for audio and video settings, the textures and font are ugly as hell, and the controls stink. You move a glowing ball of light around and pass through various colored laser barriers. There are enemies who dim your light on the first hit, and kill you on the second. The instructions are barely above gibberish, with instructions like \"color change to spend the wall color\" and \"use the right button mouse for charge and defend\". You eventually piece together that those instructions mean \"touch the colored balls of light to change the color of your light to match the laser barriers in order to pass through them without dying\" and \"stand on the button and right click to power up laser barriers to protect yourself from the small enemy lights that chase you relentlessly when you get too close\". That second one is only theoretical though, as in practice it's impossible to escape the enemy lights fast enough to have time to charge the defensive laser barriers, so I have no proof that they actually destroy the enemies. On top of all that, the game occasionally gets stuck after you die a few times on the same level, and there's nothing to be done except restart from the very beginning on the tutorial levels. There's the potential for an interesting puzzle game here, but the execution is so bad I can't recommend this junk even for the price of two cents that I paid.\n- It may not be that similar to what most people are familiar with, as a building game, but in most every sense which counts, I believe this is the greatest building game I have ever played.\n\nThe controls are smooth, the Building Mechanics are smooth, the interplay of cuteness and silliness is so smooth, and Lillian has the cutest face in the known universe.\n\nTruly a fantastic game with enjoyable and concise mechanics, the Block Grid is as malleable as Minecraft (except that some areas cannot be mined, usually story quest locations), the ally AI is more involved than Conan (sitting at a table with Rosie to gobble some greens? cute), and the combat is slightly dangerous at first, but mostly very mellow and not in any way detrimental to the building side (the villagers even fix up the damage done to your village in story battles - at least in the 'tutorial' island).\n\nMy only advices:\n\n- If the Camera is too tight on you and too slow to zoom out, switch perspective and back, if that doesn't work, look down at the ground and jump a couple times! (your head will push the camera up into the sky faster)\n\n- Don't get too creative on Furrowfield Farm! I spent a lot of time building and customising, being slightly annoyed at the small build area of the island, but now I discover that the whole thing was essentially a tutorial, and that completing the story missions there opened up the game in a much bigger way. Now I am back on the home Island and am able to build across a much larger area. If you're still in Furrowfield, you basically haven't started the game yet, so get that story done!\n\n- IF YOU SUFFER FROM REGULAR COMPUTER OR PROGRAMME CRASHES:\nWhen loading a Game you can press (A) / (X) on Controller to Copy the Save File and Back it up on one of the other Save Slots. I recommend doing this every day you play in case of  Corrupted Save Data caused by Crashing while Sailing to another Island.\n\nI am tempted to give this game a 9/10 - which is a serious seal of approval from me. Even on my strictest day, I would never give it less than a 7 - it is fun, cute, silly, serious, touching, exciting, and above all else, architexcellent!\n- this game is something i have literally always wanted but never thought would exist. a historical fiction narrative that isn't about war or combat but rather something as mundane as being a maid... AND they let you actually clean the rooms. i have been asking for this for years and years and then these psychopaths go and actually make it?? unfathomable. love it. my only critique is that I can't high five Eugene or take Wendy to the malt shop to help her feel better\n\nin seriousness it's not the most wildly divergent choice-based narrative of all time (there are small choices throughout that have an impact, but most of the consequence is delayed so it doesn't FEEL as impactful in the moment), which might put off some people who want a more sandbox feeling. consider it more of a detective game than an RPG. worth experiencing even if you don't have my particular brand of mental illness tho, 100%, especially if you like these kinds of games in general.\n- Ni no kuni II: Revenant Kingdom is a great RPG that, while a little dissapointing in some aspects, makes up for it with it's positives.\n\nLet's start talking about the negatives: \n\n- the characters are a little bland, most of them barely get anything added to their backstories nor are there any specific sidequests for them (yet). They're not bad, and Evan/Roland are good characters, but the rest falls a bit short.\n\n- The soundtrack is a little forgetable, even if it does have a few good gems in there\n\nNow the \"neutral\" points:\n\n- The main gameplay is simple, with only a few attack buttons and barely any combos, so if you're looking for a deep combat you're going to be a little dissapointed.\n\n- The story is simple; i personally enjoy it and how it ends but i could see someone who's looking for some deep story to be left unsatisfied.\n\nNow for the good aspects:\n\n- The graphics are beautiful, it's basically a playable Ghibli Studio movie\n- The gameplay (both combat and army based) is fun, fast and rewarding to do, especially when you unlock more spells\n- The kingdom management is simple to do and it gives you a sense of pride and accomplishment (unlike EA) when you expand it with new building and bigger borders\n- The sidequests are for the most time fun with cool citizens to meet and recruit\n- The random dungeons are cool to explore\n\nI played 85 hours of this game and i enjoyed every second. If you're a fan of Action RPG with a touch of base management and \"tactical\" combat you're certainly enjoy this beauty of a game.\n- They need to add more weapons like a galil or m249 or something and maybe more vehicles and playmodes.But overall so many possibilities\n- Like Path of Exiles, except not as 'Press-One-Button-Combat' like. You actually occasionally use more than one button, believe it or not POE fans.\nIn all seriousness I played like 5 hours of POE using nothing but a throwing dagger move, and it worked, including against bosses. Grim Dawn at least makes it clear that basic attacks do in fact exist. Later on it stars to get a little bit, a LITTLE BIT, POE-like, but even so, I give it a 7/10 minimum.\n- You are an astronaut, you wake up in a rescue rocket, and against your wills you are shot from Theseus space station on Chori V planet. After landing on the planet you find a strange device that helps you get back on board and survive until help arrives.\n\nGreat game, get it on sale, because it is a bit short. I like games like Portal 2, The Talos Principle, and there is no point to compare this games, because they are completly different, even if they have few common things like solving riddles and story with fresh look at some philosophical questions. Point is that every one of them including The Swapper is good at what it do, and every one of them is unique. For me it is pleasure to play this game beacause of it atmospheric well done design, riddles and questioning the meaning of existence.\n- I've read some of the negative reviews and name calling is petty so instead I'll just say a lot of those opinions are dumb.\n\nLook. This isn't Firewatch. This is a seven year old game that pissed off a lot of bros and continues (apparently, christ) to do so because it embraced not only being a walking simulator but a gay one at that. And yeah bro, 15 bucks seems steep for a game that you can finish in under an hour, but hell, maybe don't speed run? It's a walking simulator after all. Or maybe support indie game devs. *Or maybe* read the Steam tags that say \"short\" and \"walking simulator\" and then don't count that against the game. You don't review CS;GO and say \"not bad, but too much shooting\" right? RIGHT? \n\nLook. I've had some wine. And I've had some feelings. And Gone Home is a piece of video game history whether people want it to be or not. It's a game I wish I would have known about when it was first released. Hell I needed it five years earlier than that. \n\nIf you're pissed that Gone Home wasn't dramatic enough or that it's \"homosexual\" then maybe realize that this game wasn't made for you and that does not qualify it as bad. \n\nAnyway, that cat journal achievement was neat.\n- 1.

Advance (the political party who ends up getting into power and becomes authoritarian) actually only gets into power in the first part of the game (the tutorial broadcast). You actually get to see the descent into authoritarianism and dystopia, which basically no other game (at least, any game I've ever played) has actually done, and not really any other forms of media either. You also get to influence some events in game [spoiler](for example, one of the ads you can play is an advertisement for a children's toy, and later there is an... incident... involving the toy, and (if you played the ad), the presenters of National Nightly News (Jeremy and Megan) state in a segment regarding the incident that they should never have advertised the toy.[/spoiler] It's a really minor thing, because you can just choose [i]not[/i] to play the ad, but I really love that detail), and having a noticeable impact on anything is really enjoyable.\n\nThe gameplay is mostly good. You basically just have to be on your toes, switching to different cameras every now and again, being ready to censor things, and being ready to go to the adverts. All basic tasks, but since you're doing most of them together, it relies on you being attentive and reactive. The only part of the gameplay I would criticize is the signal interference section. It's easy, and doesn't even really distract you, as you just have to move a slider up and down with a slight bit of delay. It's just not a fun part of the game.\n\nMy biggest gripe with the game has to be the lag; something which I know I'm not alone in experiencing. Online, it suggests closing down performance heavy tasks, such as web browsers, but I know for a fact that I had a few webpages up when I was playing the free prologue (the first broadcast, which gives a pretty good idea of what the game is), and experienced no issues at all. I really don't know what the coding differences between the paid version and the prologue of the game are, but that doesn't seem like it should be a difference. Generally the lag was irritating, but not something that hinders you in any way, but there is one level where you're advised to switch screens because naked protesters may pop up to protest Advance's policies. Visual lag, in this case, really isn't good. I also just got a windows pop up saying that the game was frozen, and so I had to close it down... not great.\n\nOverall; the gameplay is good, with really the exception of the interference task, and the story is excellent, but the technical issues are just... really, really irritating. I would recommend the game, but I would warn you that the technical issues do end up being quite irritating.\n\nOverall; the game is good, but the technical issues can be annoying.\n- This game will leave you satisfied.\n\nI know that doesn't sound like much of a selling point, but it is. This game won't give you a sequal hook, it won't give you a product carved away like a thanksgiving turkey, each part sold seperately or held to ransom. \n\nThis is not a game about standing victorious over your enemies, it's not a game with some kind of adrenal rush that will leave you drained and empty afterwards.\n\nThis isn't a game about saving the world, as surprising as that may sound considering the hero's goal.\n\nThis is a game about hope. Hope for tomorrow, hope for your fellow man, hope for dreams and wishes, hope for a last shimmer of light in the encroaching darkness.\n\nThis is a game that will make you ask things about yourself, even if only subconciously. \n\nBut, most importantly of all, this is an experience that will make you say \"I was happy to be there, if only for a time.\"\n\nAnd I was, in fact, happy to be here.\n\nHats off to you ladies and gentlemen, you made a cyinical old bastard smile for a good ten hours.\n- Playing this game instantly brought back memories of me playing TMNT, Battletoads, Double Dragon, and Streets of Rage, with my little brother on the NES and Sega Genesis in the early 90s. Luckily this game doesn’t feature TMNT’s ridiculous water level or Battletoads' sadistic peed bike level. The graphics are perfect, the controls are great, the soundtrack is awesome (especially the Wu-Tang stage, and the Shredder stage), and the levels and overworld map are fun to navigate. I’ve played through the story mode with all 7 characters and have played through the arcade mode multiple times solo and many times in multiplayer and I’ve enjoyed every bit of it. This game is so much fun.\n\nThere are a few things I wish existed though. I wish there were more playable characters. I wish that you did not lose your 7 character’s progress in story mode when you start a new game. I wish you could see the difficulty level of the online arcade game you are joining. I wish there were cumulative stats you could see for arcade and story mode that showed the number of times you completed a stage, how many enemies you knocked out, objects you’ve destroyed, stage times, combo streaks, times taunted, etc. I wish you could create your own turtle and assigned moves, specials, jumps, taunts, and colors.\n- Such a neat concept!  Clear the table under so many \"strokes\".  Where it really shines, however, is all of the surreal bits you can add into your game like giant balls, conveyor belts, or balls that split when hit.  The game always has many challenges to complete that will require you to use the indicated table/ball/modifier and meet its requirements on your run (like make 3 long shots in a single run or pot multiple balls in a single shot).  Complete enough of these challenges and you'll unlock the next feature, but the game gives you a lot of freedom in which modifers you'll use in your run to increase your odds of completing the given challenge.\n- My profile pic is the reaction i have towards the game devs that made this game.\nVisually disgusting, gameplay wise impossible and over all terrible.\nWhile it's possible to beat it and get all the achievements it's difficult and also the space level is actually visual aids it's so disgusting to look at that you can't even focus on the gameplay.\nNot worth it even for free which is how i probably got it i can't remember and i don't want to...\n- I even set a calendar reminder so that I could get this on release. I wish I hadn't bothered. Going great guns until I got to the passage. Game over as I can't progress. Tried allsorts to drop the jammer but unable to do so. I guess it is a case of waiting for all the bugs to get resolved.\n- Look, I love Magic. It's my favorite game of all time. I met my wife through MTG. I'll be playing it until the day I die.\n\nBut if you're new to the game, and not established on Arena, don't pick it up. It's horrendously difficult to build a collection in this game, doubly so if you're not a fan of playing draft. While they have made incredibly minor adjustments that have been generally positive, the economy on this platform is impossible to do well in. The sheer number of games you have to play to amass any kind of respectable, and more importantly, functional collection of cards is not worth it for just a casual player.\n\nOf course, you can circumvent the grind with money, but that of course is the literal definition of Pay 2 Win. It's a mobile game economy through and through.\n- I technically got this game for free, as it was bought for me from a friend. And honestly, I didn't really like it. She got it for me, as a means to help with some of my mental health issues I suppose? But it just was very big miss for me, and kinda made me feel worse. A bit anxiety inducing for me, just given the circumstances, talking about life and death. Just not my personal cup of tea.\n- I'm gonna be honest with you. If you are not live in SEA, I'm not recommend you this game in case of lag and ping. Sometimes I play with one of my friend and we got 200+ ping but the other 3 got 60 ping even we are in Thailand so I guess this game send us to Europe or North America server. You may experience what we got but more often if you are westerner.\n\nAnd don't listen to the people who said ThE sPeCtEr ArE iMbAlAnCe. Most of them play less than 10 hours, try playing specter and you will know how hard specter can be with just a survivor who know how to play or know the loop just a little, even the teleport and sprint skill won't help you.\n\nOkay, the review. This game has a lot of potential and ridiculously fun but lack of balance. Specter kinda overpowered for the newbie due to their skill that can teleport to nearest survivor and can see all survivor with a windwalk skill (Things change when you face the survivor who know what to do). And yes that is the starter specter. And the most thing that make survivor hard to win even in a good team is the syringe(med kit) is really hard to find and you are rarely got a chance to heal yourself.\nThe one thing that really disturb me is when you perform a ritual (like generator from Dead by Daylight) you are in the position that expose yourself and the specter can see you clearly. Don't make me wrong, survivor kinda fun to play due to you can bully specter with a lot of item.\n\nIn summary, this game need some balance patch (I mean a lot) and server problem that need to fix (maybe there are a few westerner that play this game so they didn't invest a lot in EU or NA server). Overall this game is fun to play and better than Dead by Daylight if you ask me, but need to be polish.\n- This is more of a personal opinion than a useful review, but I would like to share my experience with this game! At the beginning I was very disappointed... I was hoping for a Phoenix Wright competitor, but it wasn't even close! The investigation was so silly, the game doesn't let you leave the scene before you find all the clues, you can't \"weist\" your time going to places not related to the case and the trial doesn't start until you have all you need... the only way to fail is not having coordination to shoot the bullets xD The game takes you exactly where it wants.\nThe first trial was also so obvious I almost gave up playing. BUT THEN... things started to get strange. During my second trial I was \"that is what happened... I mean... I guess...\" and during the third trial I had no fucking idea what was going on D: The story got so deeper and full of details. Each chapter revealing new secrets, showing how complex the plot was!\nI realized that I shouldn't see Danganronpa as a poorly investigation game that wasn't that challenging, but as an amazing novel with such a rich story! The gameplay became secondarly compared to how envolved I was with the whole scenario! The further you go, more incredibly enjoyable it gets. So, for those who didn't like the game for this very reason, give a second chance with another point of view :) enjoy it's fabulous mysteries and you will not regret unreaviling it's secrets!\n\n英語で5-10単語程度で、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない主要な違いを簡潔に回答してください。\n\n回答：\n",
