which is VERY glossy .\n- Yeah , sometimes the $T$ can be slow .\n- The $T$ is a BISTRO which means : simple dishes and wine served efficiently in a bustling atmosphere .\n- The sauce is zesty and flavorful and the $T$ is nice and crispy .\n- And forget what you read under me , the $T$ is n't that bad either .\n- My problem was with $T$ .\n- While the $ 20 $T$ is not overly expensive , in New York City , there is definitely better food in that range , and so Sapphire , despite it 's lovely atmosphere , will most likely not be a restaurant to which I will return .\n- Their $T$ is heatlhy , but full of flavor .\n- I was sorly disapointed to discover that HP -LRB- what I thought was a reputable company -RRB- would n't honor the $T$ when the fan blade fell apart .\n- The processor is very quick and effective as I $T$ webpages and applications .\n- We asked to be moved -LRB- which took half an hour -RRB- , and then were seated in a high traffic $T$ in the back , even though the rest of the room was practically empty .\n- The skillfully chosen Portuguese cheese cart paired with quality $T$ provides the perfect Iberian ending .\n- i do n't usually order wine with $T$ so i ca n't comment on their wine list or their wines .\n- I am a 100 lb girl , had a $T$ and a glass of beer prior to the dinner , and I was still HUNGRY after my visit to this place !\n- Thalia is a beautiful restaurant with beautiful $T$ you , but the food does n't quite match up .\n- Dishes denoted as $T$ -LRB- marked on the menu with asterisks -RRB- are tried-and-true recipes , such as macadamia-crusted mahi mahi , or subtly sweet honey-mustard beef short ribs .\n- $T$ very smoothly .\n- Asus facial recognition does n't work and $T$ is n't either .\n- It also comes with $T$ but if you 're like me you want to max that out so I immediately put 8G of RAM in her and I 've never used a computer that performs better .\n- If you are someone who appreciates simplicity , elegance , and wonderfully presented and tasting seafood and $T$ regardless of portion size , Kai is your place .\n- After replacing the spinning hard disk with an $T$ , my mac is just flying .\n- Cords coming out the right for power plus $T$ coming out front for headphones/mic plus network connection on left make for a very messy setup with cords going every direction .\n- Would n't recomend it for $T$ !\n- Incredible $T$ at a very agreable price brings me back just about every other day to this authentic Thai restaurant .\n- good $T$ , great food , speedy service affordable prices .\n- Luckily , for all of us contemplating the decision , the Mac Mini is $T$ just right .\n- $T$ is running great .\n- The sweet lassi was excellent as was the lamb chettinad and the garlic naan but the $T$ was forgettable .\n- WIth the upgraded memory , the MacBook Pro never has an issue running many many $T$ at once !\n- All the $T$ the group tried got favorable reviews .\n- Food is excellent quality for a good restaurant $T$ .\n- Ask for Usha , the nicest $T$ in manhattan .\n- I dislike the quality and the placement of the $T$ .\n- The highly spiced $T$ was great too .\n- Even though it is running Snow Leopard , 2.4 GHz C2D is a bit of an antiquated CPU and thus the occasional spinning wheel would appear when running $T$ such as Word or Excel .\n- All are GREAT - $T$ , naan , paratha all FRESH .\n- A must for all the $T$ lovers .\n- Good $T$ , great beverage selections and bagels really tasty .\n- The wine list is extensive , well $T$ and covers alot of regions .\n- The $T$ was pretty good and huge .\n- The $T$ are crammed way too close , the menu is typical of any Italian restaurant , and the wine list is simply overpriced .\n- Loaded with $T$ .\n- Quality ingredients preparation all around , and a very fair $T$ for NYC .\n- I would highly recommend Nina 's to anyone who wants to have a romantic dinner in a heart warming surrounding filled with $T$ and family pictures .\n- I 've been to this restaurant more than a dozen times and when I 'm craving for Pho , Lemon grass chicken or $T$ , this is the place to go .\n- You must try the $T$ .\n- The $T$ is what initially got me in the door .\n- It was loaded with $T$ -- delivered with only 1GB of RAM , and it was a * dog * .\n- I 've had the $T$ at Chennai a couple of times , when I have been in the neighborhood .\n- First off , I really do like my MBP ... once used to the OS it is pretty easy to get around , and the $T$ is great ... eg the keyboard is one of the best to type on .\n- Its $T$ is good and the fact that Hutner College is near and their prices are very reasonable , makes students go back to Suan again and again .\n- The food is just OKAY , and it 's almost not worth going unless you 're getting the $T$ , which is the only dish that 's really good .\n- The $T$ are delicious and the BBQ rib was perfect .\n- EITHER THE COMPUTER IS TOO SLOW TO DETECT THE KEYS TYPED -LRB- THIS IS UNLIKELY AS I AM A SLOW TYPIST -RRB- OR THE $T$ SIMPLY DOES NOT DETECT THE KEYS BEING TYPED .\n- also you may need to charge it once a day , if for medium use every thing fast and easy with mac the size and look is the most $T$ that attracted me to it .\n- Their whitefish salad is excellent -- all whitefish with a little $T$ .\n- I can say that the wraps , burgers and $T$ were all fresh , tasty and the mango margareta at $ 9 was WELL WORTH the money .\n- All the things you can do with the $T$ make navigating around the computer and its programs so much simpler , quicker , and easier .\n- My favorite part of this computer is that it has a vga port so I can connect it to a bigger $T$ .\n- $T$ , keyboard , and mouse : If you cant see yourself spending the extra money to jump up to a Mac the beautiful screen , responsive island backlit keyboard , and fun multi-touch mouse is worth the extra money to me alone .\n\n英語で5-10単語程度で、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない主要な違いを簡潔に回答してください。\n\n回答：\n",

You are the best dog owner :)\n- I can't imagine how scary that was for you. What is wrong with people?\n- So many freakin' softies dude.\n- Humm, just a few days after I unsubbed. You aren't luring me back again though r/Murderedbywords !\n- The game will come out for the switch this year. Was wondering how they would manage the combat system. Now I know.\n- Just curious, people keep saying fire [NAME]. And then what?\n- Damn how I wish [NAME] was there just to see his reactions to [NAME] questions 😂😂\n- I love this. Hopefully it is more successful than [NAME] (RIP).\n- This will forever be my most fav April moment!\n- Go off [NAME] This season has been a roller coaster but this guy is the best thing we've had in a while. He's so damn good\n- This is cursed\n- Also upvoted. Karma always helps. Edit: thanks for all the upvotes guys. I appreciate your support\n- yeah, [NAME] is who i was talking about :( love her but soon as she starts talking about baby stuff, i'm out\n- Just ride the subway in NYC and watch how everyone behaves. Don’t stare, though. \n- You're trying to come off smart, but failed. \n- It's not better or worse, just different. \n- And best of all, it is giving a child a loving home.\n- Not sure about “better” but women artists have an intuitive grasp of color theory and tend to use color in a more pleasing way.\n- Okay I can see why that is one glorious beard\n- I MEAN HE'S NOT WRONG\n- I just don't like our options in the off season.\n- Outstanding, really outstanding. I can't wait for her visit to the United States.\n- We can’t stand for this any longer!\n- Dude, nobody wants to hear about your stanky feet this early in the morning \n- Thank you.

Actions speak louder than words. He's just paraphrasing something everyone is already told\n- I felt the same guilt when I stopped believing in [NAME]\n- Thanks. I'm contacting them now.\n- I'd rather continue throwing money into these foreign sinkholes than use it to mess up the healthcare markets any further.\n- All that condescension to spell \"capitulate\" wrong.

You’re doing the important work. 🤣\n- I'm sure you're alright, [NAME]. xD\n- Well then why are some people allowed to talk about strip clubs here and others are not?\n- What an effort! Lets Go Pens!\n- Honestly scared to see what happens\n- Haha! [NAME] aside, that is *wonderful*!\n- Omg I commented on your original post. I hope you’re doing better and I’m glad this all came out and you got closure.\n- there are a lot of heroes who have tricky mechanics, tinker especially for me\n- A video was just released showing this altercation. Within Syria is rarely wrong.\n- Yawning at the insults to me, not the Woman\n- Guess [NAME] back hurts more than [NAME] neck, a comeback insues.\n- It's a self-identifying group, and they have killed quite a bit of people in their crusade for revenge. It's both absolutely pathetic and absolutely terrifying.\n- She’s so cute!\n- [NAME], we have a guy with a bucket on his head and you have pornstars. I’m glad I live on this side of the Atlantic \n- To get that much cap room those are the moves we make. So it kind of is\n- Awesome! I'll see it ASAP. When work won't be this hectic. 😊\n- I don’t understand why this is a problem? Each of you just plate up your own food and then eat together.\n- I will definitely keep this is mind and thank you for the great comment!\n- Totally understand and love this.\n- I didn’t know I’m sorry\n- She does seem fully committed. That’s just why I’m a bit confused. I’m hoping she does deep inside. Thank you.\n- I don't mean at Blizzcon but shortly after, like a week, imo that would have been for the best for the players and everyone involved\n- If you were to ask me how my 2016 went, I could go on and on but politics wouldn’t even come up once\n- We are! Thank you!\n- And every message from her family is the first message. I mean come on!\n- Nice job building yourself btw\n- They could have checkmated the \"journalists\" and avoided this situation by saying they decided to switch to only pay for quality journalistic work.\n- the lack of respect for [NAME], [NAME] and the rest of the [NAME] in here is incredible\n- Focus on yourself by focusing on your prayers and reminding [NAME]\n- How do you know this?\n- I like him 1.thats why I agree to go on a 2nd and 3rd date, 2. we text a lot. I just take things slow.\n\n英語で5-10単語程度で、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない主要な違いを簡潔に回答してください。\n\n回答：\n",

RIP.\n- ooh boy that guy went off the deep end and drowned\n- So glad she died\n- I’m broke, dealing with my own mental illness, and immediately concerned with just keeping the peace.\n- I’m sorry for your loss bro ❤️\n- My thoughts EXACTLY [NAME] looks dead.\n- It’s been 2 hours, OP died for a noble cause.\n- She's passed away.\n- I don't see any shoes on his feet after he lands. Kid is fucking dead.\n- My father has been dead for two years and it's still been difficult to not talk about him as if he's still alive.\n- Ah, this may explain all the untimely heart attack deaths we hear about for those who opposed the state or whatnot \n- My parents died.
