      "[h1]Dishonored 2.[/h1]\n[i]If old Samuel could see me now...[/i]\n\n[b][u]Introduction[/u][/b]\nAt its core, Dishonored 2 is little more than a mechanically and narratively contiguous continuation of the Dishonored formula. This isn't a bad thing - the first Dishonored was one of the best stealth-action games of all time - but innovation is too often overlooked in the games industry. DH2 does bring some nuance to the franchise, but new drawbacks are packaged in as well. Put plainly, Dishonored 2 is a game I adore just as much as the original, but there are aspects that certainly left me wishing for better.\n\n[b][u]Plot[/u][/b]\nThe game begins 15 years following Empress Jessamine's assassination, and her daughter, Empress Emily Kaldwin, has ruled the isles since that time. Her father and Lord Protector, Corvo Attano, advises and keeps close watch over her at court. Quickly after Dishonored 2's opening however, the Duke of Serkonos, Luca Abele, comes to Emily's royal tower - bearing a gift. He brings Emily's supposed long lost aunt, Delilah Kaldwin, who then immediately stages a coup in a bid to take the throne. She is successful, and you must escape the city of Dunwall as either Emily or Corvo (more on that later). You then travel to Karnaca, the capital of Serkonos, where you begin a personal crusade to [i]take back what's yours.[/i]\n\n[b][u]Technical Revamp[/u][/b]\nShifting focus for a look at DH2's presentation, the game is gorgeous. There's a hint of the old, comic-book-like aesthetic that was present in the original game, but the graphical fidelity has been greatly improved in this sequel. The textures, lighting, animations, visual effects, and environments are all elegantly rendered. It's easily one of the most beautiful games of 2016. As for the audio; sound effects and voices are realistic, and the OST is as iconic, if not more so than the first game's. Although, when it comes to performance, Dishonored 2 clearly falters. DH2 was a technical mess on launch, and while it runs decently now; some bugs, stutters, and crashes still persist. Overall the presentation is good, but the performance is surely sub-par.\n\n[b][u]Setting & Exploration[/u][/b]\nAs stated earlier, Dishonored 2 is set in Serkonos's city of Karnaca; known as The Jewel of the South. Gone are the dark grays and subdued browns of Dunwall, as Karnaca replaces them with bright, pastel blues and yellows. The metropolis has distinct cultural differences from Dunwall as well, whether it's the widespread use of wind-power over whale oil, or Karnaca's reliance on silver mining to employ its working class. In terms of level design, DH2's stages are much more expansive than anything seen in the first game too. There's lots to explore in every district of Karnaca, especially when verticality and hidden locations are taken into account. There's several routes toward all objectives as well; emphasizing Arkane's \"play your way\" motto. All considered, Dishonored 2's game world is exceedingly well-built.\n\n[b][u]Depth in the Details[/u][/b]\nOne of the most effective ways DH2 differentiates itself from its predecessors is through what I'd call 'structural gimmicks.' To break up the standard pacing, a couple of the game's missions have special set-pieces which can completely turn gameplay convention on its head. An example of this is the 'Clockwork Mansion' on the fourth level. This inventor's home has levers in essentially every chamber that reconfigures a room's layout - such as turning a trophy room into a grand hall. These levers can be used to access new areas or evade enemies, and even reveal traversable spaces behind the walls. It's this degree of imaginative design depth that distinguishes Dishonored 2 from most other games in its genre.\n\n[b][u]Stealth & Combat[/u][/b]\nMoving over to the core gameplay loop, not much has changed from the first game. The stealth and combat are still just as exquisitely implemented as before, with only a couple of refinements. The deviations that come to mind are that drop-assassinations can now be used non-lethally as drop-knockouts, and assassination animations are a much more brutal (but cathartic) spectacle to watch than before. Dishonored 2's central mechanics are near flawless to be sure, but this sequel suffers by adding few new gameplay elements to the mix. Except - well - there is one big feature I've neglected to elaborate on as of yet.\n\n[b][u]Emily [i]or[/i] Corvo[/u][/b]\nIn Dishonored 2, you can play as either Emily Kaldwin, [i]or[/i] Corvo Attano. When Delilah first takes the throne you get a moment to choose one or the other, after which the character you don't pick is turned into a cold, stone statue. Both Emily and Corvo have separate voice actors and personalities, but they share the same goal throughout the game's duration: to save the last of their family, and reclaim the throne for the true Kaldwin heiress. After receiving the mark of The Outsider, Emily and Corvo have different magical abilities too. Where Corvo has blink, Emily has far reach; or where Corvo can stop time, Emily can chain together the lives of her enemies, and kill or incapacitate several people at once. All in all, the decision to allow the player to progress the campaign as either Emily or Corvo was a stroke of brilliance in my estimation.\n\n[b][u]Main Story[/u][/b]\nReturning to the main story - it's another point of criticism for me. There are some magnificent aspects; such as the nostalgic callbacks to events in the first Dishonored or reappearances of some of the original game's best characters, but all considered most of the writing is retreading a beaten path. Just as in Dishonored 1, the game flows from mission to mission where the chief objective is simply to eliminate a key player obstructing your path to the throne. This is perfectly fine from a gameplay perspective, but it can lead to a bit of déjà vu from a narrative outlook. Dishonored 2's writing quality isn't poor, but it doesn't distance itself from the comfortable story-staging of its predecessor, making it feel slightly lazy.\n\n[b][u]A Reactive World[/u][/b]\nOn the other side of the same coin, the narrative reactivity of Dishonored 2's world to your choices is truly admirable. Playing DH2 in high chaos; where you murder many people throughout the game, results in huge environmental storytelling changes compared to low chaos. Here's an example. If you flood the streets of Karnaca red with blood, subsequent levels show you've harmed the city's inhabitants before you even arrive. Citizens’ moods and perceptions will have soured as they become depressed or monstrous in the wake of their crumbling city - causing suicides and murders to spike throughout Karnaca. And corpses bring bloodflies, which further tarnishes The Jewel of the South in a vicious cycle. You can, of course, avoid all this... by showing a whole lot of care in your actions toward others.\n\n[b][u]Conclusion[/u][/b]\nWhen all is said and done, the Dishonored formula is a fantastic one that it's hard to not have fun with. Karnaca is riddled with environmental detail, the stealth mechanics are flawless, combat is devilishly enjoyable, and the game judges you intelligently on your choices. The Dishonored IP is incredibly strong... The tweaks provided are appreciable; I just wish DH2 had made a concerted effort to make it even stronger. But, god-dammit, I enjoyed Dishonored 2 way too much over it's 20+ hour campaign to critique it any longer. Get the game and play it - despite all my pissy complaints, you won't be disappointed.\n\n[h1]Personal Rating: 9/10 - Absolutely Outstanding[/h1]",
      "I've played a fair amount of games during my time using Steam.\n\nI've never felt as emotionally moved by one as I have with OneShot.\n\nI don't know if anyone reading this has played Transistor, but if you are familiar with and enjoyed that game, continue reading for a little context. (I'm going to put it in spoilers because it contains an integral part of how the game functions, which is likely better for you to experience on your own, rather than learn about it from a third party. Be warned!)\n[spoiler]\nTransistor and OneShot are very different games, but both of them share a similarity in that they have been the most emotionally moving games I've played in my entire life. They both have a huge emphasis on characters, both the one you play as and the ones you interact with or are around you. They also both have brilliantly-developed environments, The combination of these two things is one of the major factors in why I've gotten so immersed in them previously.\n\nHowever, OneShot affected me notably more strongly and for much longer than Transistor, and that is for a very discernable reason. In Transistor, you experience the stories of the characters. When it all ends, you're still a third party, experiencing things through the \"eyes\" of the protagonist.\n\nOneShot, on the other hand, features *you* as basically an integral part of the story. Because of this slight difference (which may seem negligible or gimmicky at first), OneShot basically destroyed me emotionally by the end - not necessarily because of how it ended, but that it ended at all. It wasn't just story of some other charismatic protagonists that came to a close.\n\nIt was mine, and with it, my connection to everything that happened in the game.\n\nIt's really hard to put into words... but I really wanted to put this somewhere, in hopes that someone understands and agrees. :D\n[/spoiler]\n\nAnyways, random game comparison tangent over. It's a phenomenal game - easily one of tmy favorite games of all time, my only complaint being that it ended. Extremely solid 10/10.\n\nIf you enjoy story-driven adventures like Transistor, Undertale, Night in the Woods, etc., this is basically a must-buy.\n",
      "This game surprised me in how good it was. I had heard about it, like everyone, and also like a lot of people I had dismissed it as a watered-down Dark Souls clone with a Star Wars skin, and let it collect dust in my Steam collection.\n\nI was wrong. The game's combat is tight and polished, just the right difficulty on Normal. The movement, the general game feel, is superb. The game has a competent story with excellent characterizations, character arcs, dialogue, exposition, world-building, and pacing.  The music feels like top-shelf Star Wars without being a lazy copypasta of John Williams's score (though you'll hear sprinklings of familiar motifs throughout, of course). \n\nThere are collectibles (they are all cosmetics), but it's a tasteful, reasonable amount of them, and they are distributed in a way that feels fun instead of like a chore, and you're never pressured into collecting them with menus or reminders; they are entirely optional in both a technical and a psychological sense. I actually found it fun to collect new appearances in order to play dress-up \"Fashion Souls\". \n\nThere are bosses, and they are challenging but not frustrating. Definitely easier than Dark Souls's harder bosses like Ornstein or Artorias, but still tricky enough that it feels rewarding to overcome them.\n\nIf I had to describe this game in two words, it would be \"just right\". There is just the right amount of each little element that it feels fun, never tedious, never like a grind. I'm a jaded old man who has seen it all and who is not easy to entertain, and I found this game extremely refreshing.

      "G.A.R.B.A.G.E\n\nuhm idk man, it was but it just isn't, you know? because I don't know??? lots of bugs, cinematics are rushed, game is rigged, friends cheat... FUCKS THIS SHIET",
      "As i previously stated, i was going to play through metro fully and i have done so, so here is my update to this review. \nThis game is not the best selling triple A game in the world and it may have some bugs (like a table that wasnt solid or the objects in that room lol) however it is a decent game. the story is decent and the characters voices are way off but they sorta make up for it with their personalities. \n\nExploration in this game is by far one of the most interesting in my opinion and the way your character acts in the enviroment makes it more interesting aswell, for example wiping your visor when it gets dirty (wasnt that helpful for me in my play through but it was a nice touch) and your visor taking damage in combat adds to the immersive feel of this wasteland/paradise almost. Scavenging weapons and parts and combining them to make better equipment is quite intriguing and quick to do if you can find the parts. \n\nat the end of the day my final review of this is its a good game i would play it again even if it is a bit clunky sometimes (atleast it was for me lmao)\n\n\n\n\n\nOh and hopefully my punctuation is good enough so no one passes out this time lmao",
      "good sales pitch for a game. i guess that's the point of being a kickstarter-based video game. everything related to specifically your character and the character action related feels fantastic and looks great and i feel like it scratches an itch no other game really does, and the environments and your animations look great. and yet you're seeing this on a negative review.\n\n-the progression involved with exploring unreality until you stumble onto where you think you should go is miserable. it looks like a mega man x4 level had a bad trip, headache inducing and aimless. the process of finding a lot of secrets is either the trite \"you have a movement powerup, backtrack here and move up there\" sorta deal, or invisible wall shit that i've never been a fan of without decent tells (which admittedly the game sometimes does!)\n\n-combat almost entirely takes place in closed off arenas (not necessarily a bad thing, this game draws heavy inspiration from DMC which does similar) and with the same cast of like 10~ enemies. poise is a chore, even after trivializing the process with the time bomb and the grounded down charge attack, and particular enemies like the guy with the red sword and the caped man are incredibly annoying. there are 2 different instances of an enemy either doing a short version or annoyingly long version of an attack with 0 tell. A lot of the combat is trivial on hard, don't know about\n\n-bosses are a mixed bag. some of them you can loop poise breaks. some of them 2 or 3 tap you. the last one does the latter, makes you slog through a nintendo-ass hands and face boss before you are put up against bootleg senator armstrong with an unskippable cutscene and no checkpoint after the boring phase 1. huge waste of time.\n\n-too many levels just feel empty and lifeless. just a pleasant looking floral jog from arena to arena, felt like nothing and left no impression. \n\n-the movement feels like it has the potential to be insane. there's a million options that all can really push how much distance you can get, and there's a learning curve with how you sequence them all, and there's an entirely separate learning curve with pulse fly though that mechanic feels mostly untapped. \n\n-for a game with a speedrun timer and that kind of carpal tunnel inducing movement, it's really weird that there's not a \"reset to checkpoint\" button or any way to fast travel back to the airship. feels INCREDIBLY bad when you're lost and checking every nook and cranny for where to go next, or when you've ran yourself out of pulse meter when trying to pulse fly in locations that aren't littered with the blue pulse bulbs. special shoutouts to the pyramid, you can screw up especially when trying to do it early and the run is completely dead, but you have to just sit there and wait while you scroll through twitter or whatever. \n\n-music and voice acting quality was all over the place. i'm not more than a hobbyist but a lot of the voices sound like they were recorded on a variety of audio hardware, run through audacity w/ noise reduction and normalization, and tossed in. it's an indie game so please don't take this as the worst critique in the world, i'm sure the VAs were all fellow hobbyists/amateurs and there's literally nothing wrong with that, but a good handful of the yells, insults, and grunts were doing NOTHING for me. some of the music just sounds like penis music, i can't think of a better term. there were definitely a few great tunes on the atmospheric end of things but overall some of them, in particular 2 or 3 boss themes, just kinda sucked. also the segues between combat and atmospheric music was not executed well at all for several areas.\n\n-the fog level in particular had a lot of stuttering especially during combat. not looking forward to the braindead \"works fine on my machine\" type of people, but i'm on a ryzen 9 3900x, a 5900XT sapphire pulse, and 32 GB of 3600mhz ram. I'm pretty sure a machine with a tenth of the power should be able to run a gamemaker studio 2 game, it's on the switch and that thing's basically a leapfrog.\n\ni really wanted to like this game but like i said at the start, it feels like a sales pitch (albiet a great one) with everything not related to the selling point feeling tacked on. I hope this dev learns more about level design in particular and keeps making more games, because this game really does feel like it's designed to appeal to me w/ the mix of genres and the list of inspirations this game seems to wear on its sleeve.\n\ntldr the angled dash memory doesn't let you wavedash, and ur left in a crappy sticky sliding animation when you try. 1/10 can't believe i played this game\n",

      "Early review right now after a quick hour of play.\n\nLater Alligator (and I swear I'm not biased towards this game at all) is a gorgeously 2d-animated, primarily point-and-click, cartoony romp through Alligator New York City. Everyone's alligators. The gameplay itself is simplistic; unlike normal point-and-click games of this style that you might have come to expect, there's no picking up items, there's no real big decision making. It crosses over more with Professor Layton-style gameplay, wandering around the city and picking up little collectibles by clicking on various pieces of the environment.\n\nScattered in between these are a plentiful trove of minigames in all sorts of styles. As far as I can tell, they begin to increase in complexity the further you go through (for reference, the first minigame is pretty much not fail-able; you're asked to track a Queen in 3 Card Monte, however the hapless alligator running the game barely moves the cards and flails on the two that *aren't* the queen.)\n\nHowever, it seems that the gameplay and the minigames are meant more as a vehicle for the whimsical comedy of the writing and the eclectic cast of characters present throughout the city. Each character is quirky and fun in their own way, with their own little story. And that's the real draw of this game. \n\nSo this game so far doesn't particularly lend itself to anyone looking to challenge themselves. But if you just want some good feelings, a laugh, and a spot of relaxation, Later Alligator delivers in spades.",
      "Ahh, CrossCode.\nLet's start this review with what this game does right.\n\nPros:\nEverything. There review is complete. But on a serious note I'll elaborate.\n\nThis game starts out very generically. You got an amnesia stricken heroine. You got fairly archetypal characters. The story is the typical trying to figure out your past. But it's not. I lied about all that, that only covers the first 10-15 hours then you see drastic changes in the pace and tone. The story turns out to be well done, not the best, but enjoyable. 8/10 for story and characters.\n\nLet's talk about gameplay. It's perfect, seriously. The pacing of combat is fairly quick. There's a decent variety of enemy types which nearly all of them have some sort of unique trait. Your skill set leaves you with a lot of variety and different tools to take on different situations. I have yet to get bored of it, despite the fact combat isn't inherently profitable for most of the game. Puzzles. You have timing puzzles, logic puzzles, memory puzzles, enemy based puzzles. It's all there. It's all enjoyable. They're quite varied, no two puzzles feel the same. This game has over 200 'maps'. And just about every 'map' has a puzzle or two (optional or not). Ez 10/10.\n\nArt design. I'm a sucker for 16 and 32 bit graphics. The level designer, this guy made the game. He created some beautiful and interconnected maps with nearly everything having purpose. In all honesty, I have never seen design quality this high, it even beats out SquareSoft games (you know before they became that crappy company that is SE). 10/10 again.\n\nCharacter design. It works. Not the best. Not bad. The characters look the way they should. Lukas' nose drives me crazy, it's huge. But Holiday Man is solid. 7/10.\n\nMusic. Some of it's great. Some of it annoyed ME (but I'm picky). They stayed true to what they were trying to make. But it's obvious their composer was no Yasunori Mitsuda. But still, what I enjoyed, I really enjoyed. 8/10.\n\nDid I enjoy it? Every single minute of it. Even when I was confused. \"I WILL figure this puzzle out.\" 35/40, based off my personal taste, but CrossCode is as damn near perfect as you can get.",

I went and looked at the store page, My Brother/Friend Ethan-Winters Just Told Me this game in the steam store now, so went ahead and bought it. After buying it, went and started up the game some day later. Went into the game, saw another model character that looks like mine, I thought it was an AI because I had thought it was a single player game. So I decided to play along with it, we went through the story, it progressed quite fast, mainly because we both did not really bother to check out other things. The more I played, the more I realized that the guy I was playing with was most definitely not an AI, it was a genuine player. As we went through the story, our cooperation got smoother, we no longer have a solo player attitude, we would signal to each other, wait for each other and walked, fly with each other. It was smoothing, relaxing, a truly unique experience. Even with the setbacks we had throughout our progression, we never gave up, we stuck together from the desert till the end, when one of us screwed up, we patiently waited for the other, chiming to the person where we are. I remember at the end, when i screwed up a jump and did not see the other player, I was genuinely scared, sad, I frantically searched for the person but to no avail. I was distraught, sad and disappointed but I continued onward. When I went up, there he was, chiming for me, assuring me that he had not left yet. I felt happy, comforted when I saw the person waiting for me and together we finished the story. I am not one to do reviews, but it was such a unique experience among my years of gaming that I had to share it. Thank you, punks for the experience, truly thank you.

      "So, I hated this game at first...\n\n I've never been into a MMO before, and I went into it with a mindset of \"FUCK YEAH! MULTIPLAYER SKYRIM LETS GO\" - In short don't do that. This isn't going to be like playing Skyrim, Oblivion, Morrowind. \n\nIt is when it all comes down to the core an MMO, it's set in Tamriel, it sounds like Tamriel and the storylines feel like an Elder Scrolls game. However being an MMO, it has a lot of grindy MMO style quests. And don't get me wrong, it's bewildering at first, all these mechanics, all these places to go....and before the 'One Tamriel' update if you chose the wrong faction, you were screwed, in a place all on your own surrounded by all these people who are WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY higher level than you. But thankfully they changed all of that. The game scales now, so you can rock up to a dungeon with your level V300 mate, and still have some fun slicing up enemies.\n\nSo I saw a friend playing the other day, and spent a few hours installing this to join him (By the way its like 70 Gig...If you have slow internet prepare for a few days of download), I got back on it after not playing for 14 months, but this time I was playing with a friend who was already Veteran Level 250, So I was in luck, he introduced me to everything and I got used to all the deconstructing of equipment to get my blacksmithing up, showed me about dungeons and bascially got me to enjoy the grind. I think my previous time was a bit lackluster because I got dropped in the middle of the Aldmeri Dominion on my own, without any of my friends. So I left.\n\nNow I know what I'm doing, and keep in mind I usually hate MMO's never played WoW or anything like that, this is the first one. I'm enjoying myself, I'm triple digits into this game time-wise and I don't see it stopping now. We've made a guild for noobies. To help them out, and get them to enjoy the game also. Because the community is nice...but you still get the elitist fucks from any competitive game kicking you out of dungeons because you're only level 14. But you won't get that when you're in a guild, having people to play with and explain all the mechanics did help, a lot. I've even gone as far as to buy this AGAIN on steam just to collect my hours and so on.\n\nAdd-ons are awesome being able to mod basic features of the game to help with information and quality of life improvements is a must. I'll provide an essential mods pack if any of you wish to know.\n\nFor those of you who actually got this far into this, well done. I didn't think I'd keep you captivated long enough to get to the end.\n\nIf any of you are new to the game, on EU server and would like to join a guild to show you the way, add me or visit our [url=www.godsofsalt.com]website[/url] and join us on teamspeak, or just message us in game @diseasedcrow.\n\nBut all in all if you like Elder Scrolls and you think you want to try this, just do, I'm glad I gave it a second chance.",

      "Her story starts you off in an old looking computer with what looks like Windows 95, or perhaps a previous version. Once there you are presented with a database of footage from a 1990s, where you must piece together what happened.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\nWithout spoiling anything, since this game is all story based, you are revisiting video clips of seven separate interviews trying to piece together what exactly happened. When you start off, you are placed in front the pc with the word “murder” already typed in. With this simple word, you are given, you must, delve deeper into the story, and form your own conclusion as to what happened, but the more you go deeper into the mystery, the more confused you may become; perhaps even discarding your previous assumption many times before coming to a conclusion that does not go against her story.    \n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nThis game is not a conventional game in terms of gameplay. Instead, you are watching videos and finding potential terms that could lead you to more videos which will reveal more as to her past and what, and who was involved in this incident. Some might not like this, so if the idea of an exclusively story based game does not appeal, do not bother. It is an interesting concept, and very captivating if you play it without any distractions, perhaps more interesting if you play it with a friend and try to piece the mystery together (much like I did).\n\n[h1]Verdict: 8.5/10[/h1]\n\nIf you enjoyed this review, or found it helpful, please feel free to follow our curator [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/WeLoveKawaiiNekos#curation]here.[/url]",

Your progress is still \"saved\" when you trigger a mechanic, it's just that the flag sets your spawn location. So there is no need to fret if you die after doing something important.\n\nI also got to use the stat system a lot today, and man, it reminds me of Dark Souls. If you die, you leave behind your salt, and you have to go back to collect it. Once you do, you can, of course, use it to buy upgrades from the tents for your character. Which is a nice way to choose how you want your character to grow. I like when my healing potions heal a lot, for example, instead of having a lot of base hp right from the start.

      "[b][i]AMID EVIL[/i] is very much [i]Quake[/i] 1 level design in a [i]Hexen[/i]/[i]Heretic[/i] universe.[/b] It's well done. We're a bit spoiled this year with outstanding '90s FPS shooters. Personally, I prefer both [i]Ion Maiden[/i] and [i]DUSK[/i] over this title for the following reasons:\n\n1) I find [i]AMID EVIL[/i] to be a bit generic in terms of theme; the fantasy setting could use a bit more to set it apart.\n\n2) I prefer real or low fantasy weapons/guns over wands and totally high fantasy weapons. Now, don't get it twisted - I appreciate that these high fantasy weapons exist, but yeah, they leave something to be desired. I miss reloading and all of that. \n\n3) The level design in [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is much more 'sprawling' (for lack of a better term) just like the original [i]Quake[/i]. Most levels are indoors in what feels like an underground compound (at the time of writing this review). I personally like the backwoods feel of [i]DUSK[/i], or the dystopian cityscape of [i]Ion Maiden[/i] far more. I want to look up at the sky in most levels.\n\n4) The enemy design is different than the other two games I mention, which is good - but they all mostly have a 'same' kind of feel. The enemies are all super fast, so most of your efforts are focused on running backwards while fending them off. It's fun, but gunplay isn't quite as fun as the other two games for this particular reason.\n\n5) The font and overall menu system definitely feels 'Early Access'. I know the font is being worked on, which is desperately needed. \n\n6) My favorite way to play the game is Endless mode - and I feel like that's a flaw in itself. It's the opposite for me with [i]DUSK[/i]. I want to fall in love with the campaign, but eh, there isn't really any story or anything all that interesting to suck me in. The secrets are super easy to find compared to the other two games, too.\n\n7) No multiplayer. Now, I really don't care about this - but who designs a game in this genre without building this in from the ground up? You know the community is going to whine about this. Questionable design decision to say the least.\n\n[b]Well, it sounds like I just dumped all over the game.[/b] Please don't get me wrong. [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is a welcome addition to the genre. The *great news* is that this is not just some reskin of [i]DUSK[/i] - it certainly is it's own thing. And that's really important. \n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+Fairly polished game for Early Access\n+It's the most modern version of the original [i]Quake[/i] we've seen this year\n+Well optimized\n+Lots of content right now\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-The universe is generic\n-No multiplayer\n-The font is too hard to read\n-Music is nothing to write home about\n-The secrets are easy, and there really aren't all that many of them\n-Weapons could use more 'oomph' to them; also we should be able to use the special ability when we want to as opposed to it autotriggering\n\n[b]I was psyched out of my mind for [i]AMID EVIL[/i] - and while it is certainly good - I think I'll be focused more on [i]DUSK[/i] and [i]Ion Maiden[/i].[/b] Because, let's face it, gaming time is valuable and we can't play everything.",
      "Since when I played Plants vs Zombies, years ago, I looked for its great soundtrack composer Laura Shigihara, finding her Twitter profile. She was talking about a game she was developing, named Rakuen or something like this, and the whole project sounded awesome. I promised to myself that I would buy it the day it was released.  \n\nTo be exact, I only got motivated to register a Steam account specifically in order to buy Rakuen, even if other games were bought before and after it.  Also, even if I found a blog and YouTube videos where Laura talked about Rakuen's development, I didn't read or watch any of it, to avoid creating wrong or misguided expectations. \n\nAnd it was worth the wait. This is an awesome piece of art.\n\nAs a story, Rakuen has a well developed and thoughtful plot, deep and diverse characters, balanced and pleasant pace. \n\nVisually, Rakuen has colorful and elegant graphics, with easily recognizable sprites and detailed scenarios.\n\nThe gameplay is fluid, with simple but entertaining puzzles, not too hard, not too easy, and with rock solid programming.\n\nFinally, Rakuen's music is delightful, perfectly syncronized with the feelings inspired by the plot.\n\nRakuen provoke chuckles, tears and smiles. It brings back a warmth sometimes we forget that exist. It became one of my favorite games ever, and I doubt its place will ever be taken by another title.\n\nThank you Laura, thank you very much for Rakuen.",

      "Ever wanted to be a futuristic dual wielding samurai drummer with a penchant for slicing boxes? No? You didn't even know that was a thing? Well you will after playing this. \n\nProbably the most satisfying rhythm game out there, Beat Saber turns sword thrusts into dance.

If you don't have this game I highly recommend you pick it up, as when you do, you may just find it hard to put it down.\n\nNow if you will excuse me, I have a few more hardcore songs I have to embarrass myself attempting.",

      "A forward-hurtling psychedelic tube shooter with a tremendous sense of speed and odd, zen relaxation. The closest thing I have to compare it to is probably [i]Rez[/i]: if you liked that, definitely give this a whirl.\n\nConversions of arcade classics and legends are commonplace. But an arcade [i]myth?[/i] Only one springs to mind: [b]POLYBIUS[/b]. There one minute and gone the next, so they say - an enigmatic arcade cabinet installed and removed by mysterious men in black: rumours of people hooked to the screen and unable to remember or communicate what they saw afterwards, save for that it was immersive, fast, colourful, and strangely hypnotic. A fly-by-night company that went out of business? A government mind control experiment? Probably not, no. A hoax. An urban legend. A myth.\n\nBut a myth was all Jeff Minter needed. If you're previously unfamiliar with Jeff Minter and his stable Llamasoft, he's been creating weird arcade-inspired games and \"lightsynths\" (as in, the inspiration for Milkdrop and other music visualisers) out of a barn in Wales since the 1980s. His creations are marked by being fast, psychedelic, and strangely sheep-themed, generally in search of the kind of gameplay that invites the player to get \"in the zone\". And so it is here.\n\nIn search of a new original creation, he turned his mind to the arcade legend Polybius as inspiration, and his interpretation is oddly faithful:[list]\n[*]Immersive: it supports VR if you have it, wrapping you into the game world - it draws you into the screen even if you don't.\n[*]Fast: capable of and designed for very high-refresh rates if you can support them.\n[*]Colourful: look at the screenshots, you get the idea.\n[*]Hypnotic: hurtling forwards shooting abstract things in tunnel patterns seems like it would be intense, and it is, but - [i]Relax. Just look at the centre of the screen as you move forward. Go through the horns. Let it take you[/i].[/list]\n\nOnce you get the hang of it and start relaxing into it and getting into that sense of flow, it's curiously calming. I can see myself bringing this out for a quick session after a stressful day: it's particularly good to dip into. Long sessions might result in seeing patterns on the walls, Tetris-style.\n\nIt's not for everyone: Minter's games never have been. In particular, you may wish to skip this one if you have sensory conditions that make you susceptible to motion sickness, or photosensitive epilepsy.\n\nGood music too, and doesn't need high specs either. Recommended.",
      "The game vaguely reminds me of Yume Nikki and Strange Telephone due to thematic similarities, but in the end, I think it managed to be something completely different - I don't want to compare it directly to Undertale, but I got those narrative vibes as well. Unlike its exploration-based relatives, UNREAL LIFE is somewhat of a linear game, but the areas tend to loop around into the hub when using waypoints, occasionally involving some backtracking and optional achievements (including a game within a game). It took me about 6 hours to get 2 bad endings on the same playthrough, that said I am missing more than half of the achievements and probably other endings as well. Despite its modest art style, I think the locations and the world design were very good, granted the game settings are very limited for the price. The writing and characters were the highlight of the experience for me, I would say I enjoyed about 95% of the dialogue and world-building, despite being a very text-heavy game. The game tells a story in a unique way where the character can extract memories from the objects that she touched, unlocking potential hints that you will need to solve puzzles.\n\nYour room works as a hub area to which you can return for manual saves or the minigame, additionally to connecting all areas with a waypoint system, but you don't have to worry too much about those as the checkpoints are very frequent. Generally, the gameplay is just exploring 2D levels, picking up items, and occasionally solving creative sequence puzzles. The character keeps track of 3 different memories that may contain clues if you managed to miss them - it's hard to do because the important text is color-coded. I want to give the devs credit for actually putting some originality into puzzle mechanics, they were fun and not difficult enough to drag the game down. However, when the character learns about a hidden item from the memory, you have to click in the correct spot with no indication, which is perfectly fine, I only wish I realized it sooner. For any Yume fans out there, the game works as a psychedelic visual candy, with many dream-like environments and themes to navigate. \n\n[i]In a way, playing through this game reminded me of the first time I finished watching Spirited Away, the journey so immersive it left me in a state of melancholy. Do you ever get a feeling that you changed as a person after finishing a game? [/i]\n\n[h1] Pros: [/h1]\n\n+ fun characters, enjoyable narrative \n+ multiple endings and optional achievements \n+ creative puzzle based on memory mechanics \n+ nice variety of locations\n+ awesome soundtrack \n\n[h1] Feedback: [/h1]\n\n[u] Some Nitpicks [/u] - I ended up playing on a controller, but if you are using a mouse you have to drag the character around, it would be nice to have the clicking option instead - if it has one I don't know how to activate it. I was slightly confused by the main menu controls when using a controller, but if you can't figure out the buttons you can select the options with the mouse. I wish you just had the visual Q like \"new game\", \"load game\" and so on. Sometimes to progress you may have to talk to characters multiple times, so just make sure that you exhaust all dialogue before moving on. On a side note, you can softlock the game if the water turtle pushes you against the platform (not a big deal, reload 10 second checkpoint). Overall, I don't have any real issues with the game, mostly the story felt like sliding on a big stick of butter.  \n\n[b] Overall Thoughts: 9/10 [/b]\n\nIs it worth $20? Well, it's a really good game for this niche genre if you like those types of ambient/psychedelic games like Dreaming Sarah - it feels bigger and more ambitious than most. There is no question that devs put so much love into the project, but it's still a niche game at the end of the day. My skepticism slowly faded away as the game kept being compelling in the storytelling and enjoyable locations. As someone that plays many games that occupy the same space, I can't really imagine a game that offers much more than that. For me, it was a special game, and by 'special' I mean like it hit a nerve, got pretty personal. \n\n[code]Review By: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/31294838-Hidden-Gem-Discovery/ [/code]",

I was tempted to play, and will do so for a few hours in future, may be a demon has possessed me...or may be I just don't waste my money that I have spent on it.

      "This game is really special. I'm a 50 year old man with an emotional structure made largely of mud and thumbtacks, and I had to bite the inside of my jaw in a parts to keep from tearing up. \n\nMany people seem to equate an \"adult game\" with gore and violence or explicit imagery. Nothing wrong with those types of games, I have and will continue to enjoy them. This game explores mature themes on relationships and mortality and doesn't pull any punches, without being cheap or manipulative. In that sense, its the most adult game I've ever played. \n\nI won't ever forget it. If this sounds like something you'd be interested in, stop reading and buy it. Its a slow burn, and you won't be invested until you've spent some time with the characters in the story. In the end, the payoff is tremendous.",

      "-This game is like the combination of old PC sidescroller like Duke Nukem (pre-3d), NES Contra, and arcade Metal Slug with 80s /90s cyberpunk and action movie tropes.\n-The cheesy humor, plot, and music is top notch. Might look like a shallow nostalgia at a glance but once you played it, they even spiritually nailed the silliness of similar games/story in that era. The guns, the character acting and lines, the costume design, etc.\n-It's not as fast paced as I thought it would be. But actually that makes it relaxing to play. Easy to get into and the challenge is just right for me without being frustrating. \n-I like how the enemies and characters are pretty diverse. \n-I haven't finished the game but I feel like this game will have similar replay value like Streets of Rage 4. Not because of there are many things to do or getting better at the game but because it's somehow just simply tight, fun, and arcadey to replay.",
      "[h1]Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Save scumming is a game-play mechanic and the game is balanced around the player being able to quick-save and reload whenever they want.\n[*] The game seems highly objective oriented, and I wish there was more optional treasures to collect, as I am a pirate.\n[*] While many guard situations appear to have a clear solution,  you can always just brute-force your way through or take another less contrived route, so the game doesn't devolve into a stealth puzzle game.\n[*] Post-game summary shows your route and enemy eliminations at hyper speed, and is always a fun watch at the end of a level.\n[/list]\nI really enjoy finally having a top-down style stealth game.

      "Falcom's Action RPG Masterpiece.\n\nbest story in the series. it follows the latest adventure of Adol and his companions, stranded in an island and slowly uncovering their secrets. the tight, but well developed cast are absolutely the best written characters in the series. from party member to your fellow castaways all have developed motivation, personality and charm. \n\nalot of the horribad translation and voice acting have been fixed, and it finally got the treatment it deserve as a masterpiece. \n\nthe gameplay is an evolution of the modern Ys game. at its core, ys 8 is an action RPG where you control adol and several other party members with unique set of skills, moveset, weapons and super attack. each character represent an attack type (slash, pierce, smash) that are pitted against various enemies with certain weaknesses. great variety of enemies, amazing boss battles, music and story. \n\non release, there seems to be a big problem for the port, but as far as i know, everything has been patched to very good level of stability. over 70 hours, the game crashed twice (and saved by the intuitive autosave system), run flawlessly 60 FPS and 1440p without a single slowdown. \n\n10/10 game go buy so we get monstrum nox on PC.",
      "A fantastic rogue-lite where dying doesn't mean a hard reset. In death your character is succeeded by one of their offspring and all of your earned skills, talents, equipment and gold are passed down from one generation to the next, ensuring that even the weakest of players can still make progress. After each death you are given the choice of three characters that are randomised from a pool of three to eight classes (depending on how many you unlock) who are given randomly drawn traits and abilites; some good, some bad. The castle itself is also randomised keeping the game fresh despite there only being four environments.\n\nAll in all, I found it a thoroughly addictive game despite minimal experience in the genre beforehand and would recommend it to anyone who merely thought \"that looks interesting\" as they skimmed over the Steam store page.",
      "Steins;Gate Elite is a great Visual Novel when looked at in isolation. The main problem is that Steins;Gate (the original) exists. I don't mind the difference in art styles, that is a matter of personal preference anyway. Graphics in Elite are a lot more animated, images in the original are more static but also more detailed. What I have an issue with is the missing parts in the story.\n\nThere are a few situations where Elite eliminates choices when compared to the original. I won't spoil details, but in one of the early chapters you can choose to ignore or answer a phone call, leading to alternate branches in the story (they join again soon after, but each branch still contains unique content). Well, you can choose in the original. In Elite, you automatically answer the phone, the other branch is no longer in the game.\n\nAt a later point in the game, I noticed that quite a sizeable chunk of a previously linear story progression (not even an alternate branch) concerning Faris was completely cut out. Again, I won't spoil details in case you just want to decide which version of the game to get and don't know the story yet. It has been some time since I played the original, so I might have missed more instances of missing story parts, but at least this one part was really obvious.\n\nThe missing branches and parts are not really relevant to the overall story, but you probably want them if you want to know more about the characters. Elite is more streamlined, but at least all of the alternate endings are still here. So while there is missing stuff compared to the original, there is quite a bit more when compared to the anime. Then again, the anime added more story after the true ending of the original game. I was hoping that Elite added (and maybe fleshed out) this extra content as well, but no luck here, Elite ends at the same point as the original.\n\nIf you don't mind the art style of the original, play that one instead. The second game (Steins;Gate 0) only exists in it's original form anyway. Elite might still be worth it if heavily discounted since it is the only way to get the \"free\" Linear Bounded Phenogram. You can justify it as buying LBP and getting Elite as a free extra.",
      "I even set a calendar reminder so that I could get this on release. I wish I hadn't bothered. Going great guns until I got to the passage. Game over as I can't progress. Tried allsorts to drop the jammer but unable to do so. I guess it is a case of waiting for all the bugs to get resolved.",
      "EDIT:\n\nWhile I have played Squad quite a bit for a few years, the large update named \"V6.0 Infantry Combat Overhaul\" unfortunately did not sit well with me.\n\nThe goals for the update:\n\n- Increase length of fights.\n- Reduce the impact of lone wolfs (solo players).\n- Increase emphasis on teamwork mechanics, which mainly meant supression.\n- Increase gunplay diversity, to create choices between optics, since the old meta meant that the magnified optics were greatly outperforming iron sights and holo sights.\n\nWhile I do not disagree with some of the goals, the implementation of them left a lot to be desired.\n\nAfter the update most gunfights became a mess of supression, without either side being able to effetively kill each other beyond 200m.\nGunhandling was also drastically nerfed, creating the sense that your character has never held a rifle before, or even used an optic for that matter.\n\nI can unfortunately no longer recommend this game, since I myself no longer feel drawn to play it.\n\nIf enough changes are made, I may revisit the game and this review, but for now there are better options out there.\n\n\n** OLD REVIEW ** \n\nCan the game be amazing and fun - yes! Do I recommend this for everyone? - No.\n\nThe experience of the game largely depends on what servers / communities you play with. If you play the core game with no moderation (no rules or admins), the game will become a race to make the first unit and lock others out and a race to get armor, then proceed to rush the enemy and end up spawnkilling them near their main spawn.\n\nIf you play on moderated servers with established rules and active admins, then you may experience a great sense of teamplay - other times not so much.\n\nBefore you buy it though...\n\n- Microphone and willingness to use it is REQUIRED for a good experience (People will quickly kick or become hostile towards you, if you do not communicate)\n- This is not battlefield or call of duty, running of solo to pull off 360 noscopes will probably get you kicked/ killed.\n- You will die without knowing from where and you will get into situations in which you have no option to survive, especially if you're new to tactical shooters.\n- You will end up running... A lot..\n- Armor is not like battlefield or call of duty, you need a driver, gunner, commander and possibly a loader (has a machinegun). Where you hit the enemy matters as much as what you hit him with (Armor piercing on his front turret will likely bounce, but even a high explosive may hurt if you can hit him up the rear)\n\nStill here... ?\n\nIf I haven't scared you off, here are my personal tips:\n- Play. The. Tutorial.  Like really...\n- Try different graphic settings, shadows especially makes a big difference in enemy visibility (game looks better with them though)\n- Start as infantry and pick rifleman, but remember to join a squad.\n- Find a server that seems to have active admins and have a ruleset you agree with.\n- Try NOT to give up when you die, generally it isn't worth throwing away a ticket to respawn if you have friendlies within 100m. Sometimes it is the right choice, but before you know which is which, it's a good idea to hold on for a medic.\n- Not all squad leaders know what they're doing, do not be afraid to join another squad if it turns out your squad leader is a fool.\n- Defending is often as important (if not more), than attacking... But you may end up waiting 30 minutes without getting shot at or shooting anyone.\n\n\nAs you can probably tell... Squad is a community based game, with in-depth enough mechanics, while also being easily accessable.\nIf you want a good sense of what the game is, check out some lesser known streamer playing it (bigger streamers will often give you the wrong sense of what a game is like)\n\nHope this helped you make an informed decision.\n\nbut for now there are better options out there.",
      "So, I only found this game because my favorite Vtuber Miilkywayz on Twitch played it. It seemed pretty interesting but when she started making her own cards. As an IRL witch I was WAY more interested. The game itself is great, I love making cards and learning their meanings and seeing how how the story changes changes based on your deck and the cards drawn. And the replaybility of it is amazing given its price. 10/10 from me. Need more games like this.",
      "I've been completely in love with this game ever since the Mojam prototype \"Wasteland Kings\" was released. It's an insanely fun, fastpaced \"roguelike-like\" or \"roguelite\" with randomly generated worlds and tons of weapons to find. On top of that, the developers stream the development of the game on tuesdays and thursdays over at Twitch and they release updates to the game every week. To me, this is the best game of its kind and I've put tons of hours into mastering it (and I still die. Often. It's difficult okay?).",
      "IMHO this game is highly over-hyped, glad I only spend a few € and bought it at sale.\n\n- Basic concept of dungeon crawling with horror is copied from D&D Ravenloft or Call of Cuthullu. So nothing new here. \n- Story is simple and stereotypical: Old man evokes some unnamed horror in a cursed mansion that curses the land...  \n- Graphics are nicely painted ... but still painted, so outdated concept. It's a indy game, ok ... and maybe some gamers still love playing games on their 386er personal computers from 1990 ...\n- The gameplay itself is IMHO stale, because it's always the same: go into a dungeon. Fight. Grind. Survive.\n- Stress could be an interesting factor, but not in the way it is implemented. In its current form is nothing but a second health bar, which is either difficult or expensive to heal. It makes the game not more complex or more interesting but only more frustrating. Stress could be interesting, if it had different stages with different effects. But in its current form and the difficulty of the game itself it is simply idiotic to take stressed heroes into battle. \n- Random number generator is bad. Really bad. Maybe intentional bad? Who knows...?\n\nThe game itself is grind, more grind, and … grind. Combined with the lame story and the frustration it is a game for masochists and people that want to become one.",

      "Upon further play, the game wasn't super luck based, it just doesn't do a great job explaining core mechanics that are crucial to gameplay. It has a more hands off, let the player discover how this works type of playstyle, but a simple line of dialogue alluding to these features would have been nice. That said, the story is really gripping, the gameplay (once learned) is fun, and overall, I definitely think it's worth $20.",
      "Simply fantastic. Probably the best TRUE RPG I've ever played. Your choices matter, dialogue options matter, the order in which you do things matter, even such small things such as the items you hold in your hand matter. Every build is viable, go heavy in Physical stats and you'll have difficulty solving things Logically, but maybe you can brute force your way through something. Go heavy in Logic and you'll be weak in a one-to-one fight, but maybe you'll be so fast to figure things out that it'll never come to that. You'll see things that the dim-witted brute with high Physical didn't. Failure is encouraged, there are many routes in the game you cannot open without failing something else first.\n\nA true combat system does not exist. At all. Physical altercations are decided through dice rolls based on how you've built your character. And virtually all of them are optional. I like this decision a lot. I've always found it immersion-breaking in RPGs when you're just running around the countryside, killing every bandit or animal that comes your way. This one keeps fights realistic with REAL consequences depending how things go.\n\nBarring having to restart my game once due to a bug (quicksave often, autosaves are few), the game had no major technical issues. There was a single point in the game where a vital skill check required a specific skill to be built, and I'm not sure if there were any alternate routes. I couldn't find any, just had to savescum the check. Aside from that, you have options as to how to approach everything. I'm not sure if that was an oversight or if I just missed something.\n\nCan't go into the story much without spoilers (and you DON'T want it spoiled, it's great.) But it's very well-written and even hilarious at some points. But don't be fooled, it's not a comedy game. It tackles very serious topics such as Fascism, Communism, Mental Illness, Addiction, and many other things.\n\nOverall an amazing RPG experience that I cannot recommend enough. Will definitely play through this several times to see how things go with different builds. Highly suggest you purchase this if you have any interest.",
      "Great game... who need 1 or 2 years of development. tl;dr: mid game turn into a micromanagment hell.\n\nThe game is fantastic until a certain point. You start as a mercenary, one party, 50-150 soldiers doing missions, small battles or bigger fights joining armies. Good graphics, brutal engagments with 200-1000 units at the same time if your computer can handle, playing as a soldier is a blast.\n\nThe problems start when you get a few towns and a bigger family, the micromanagement never stops and gets worse overtime. You have to physically move your party to towns to fix their issues. When your lords get captured & escapes, they'll go into a random town until you pick em again, then you'll have to reform the party. Same with caravanes for trading, if they get captured, you'll have to go in his town and recreate the caravan. You have to partially fill towns with soldiers, manually, from your own soldiers. All the little fun things of the beginning soon become a hassle, as you can't delegate. Messengers are not a thing.\n\nYou can't manage a town at a distance, you can't tell a party member to move to a location or guard a territory, they do whatever they want if they're out of your army / party, so you have to do it yourself. Either you're leading your huge army to fight what is basically an enless war mid game, or you take care of your cities while the rest of your faction fight... with various success. Some commanders are pretty good, other will throw waves of recruits at highly trained arbalists in the open backed with cavalry. Protip: don't be a recruit in an imperial army.\n\nYou can't tell a party you created to guard an area or to kill all bandits attacking your villagers, it's up to you, or the IA if it feel like it. Worst, if you let the parties you created roam around (parties = group of 70-200 soldiers under a lord) they can be (temporarily) drafted in other armies of your kingdom... and you'll have to physically move to the army, talk to the leader and pay some reputation to get them back. Of course, large armies are slow. This leads the the next problem, swarms.\n\nMy worst fear is not a massive army, it's an army disbanded in the middle of my territory. The small parties usually start raiding all villages in the vicinity while being too fast to be catched by a big army. Raided villages impact your town / castle loyalty and gold quite heavily. Sure, you could disband your army and hunt them yourself... but that makes you take a step back, and all your parties would reform under another army you can't control. And man, some army commanders are really, really stupid. Verdun style charge in the open against walls of archers, cavalry in a forest vs pikemens, you name it. I can't count the time i had parties wiped in someone else army. But let's say you managed to capture the lords burning your villages.\n\nThe capture system is broken. Captured lords escape A LOT. I had some escape 20 seconds after being captured. They never stay in a jail for more than a few in game days. Once they escape, they magically teleport to their hometown, rebuild a fast 80 mens army in the blink of an eye and go back to raiding villages. AI \"cheat\" with recruits, they will always find soldiers in town, even if they're empty for you. Executions you say?\n\nIf you execute a lord, no matter how much of an A-hole he/she is, the whole faction will hate you. He raided dozens of villages and killed hundreds of peasants? Still not good enough. You just can't kill a lord without suffering heavy consequences down the line, and you'll need those lords to be friendly later. Worth to mention, capturing the leader of a faction won't stop a war.\n\nLast - peace / war is on/off. I had 600 days of continuous war, followed by 600 days of complete peace in the entire map (due to a bug apparently), and i'm now back at 300 days of war. Not a single day of peace, when one war stop another start immediatly. They will just never, ever stop fighting. Can't catch a breath, can't leave the front of your lose towns.\n\nOh and the main quest randomly failed after 875 days or so.\n\nI would still recommand the game, it's really fun for a while but it need a HUGE QoL update.\n",

      "I vividly remember the moment when I gave up on Fallout 3: I was the ruins of some city, with a grey sky looming over the shredded grey concrete shells of buildings, and vast chunks of broken grey highway was wrapped up against, around, over and under huge chunks of grey concrete. My companion had gotten stuck somewhere in the grey sea of rubble for the umpteenth time, and it just suddenly struck me: This game isn't fun. It's just depressing.\n\nA few years later, I recalled this experience to a friend of mine, and he assured me: \"Fallout 4 isn't grey. It's got colors. And it's good.\" Having banked 1410 hours in game, I would have to say he was right.\n\nIs Fallout 4 good RPG? Nope. The story is rubbish, the characters extremely shallow, and the skill tree is very meh. If you hate VATS, like I do, the skill tree is complete rubbish. Is it good because it is bug free and has good DLC's? Nope. Is it good because it's the best shooter ever? Nope. Fallout 4 is good game because it's fun, and it's fun because it's a decent shooter, with an OK open world, good atmosphere and a sense a humor. Slap some of the 1000's of existing mods on that, and there's a decent chance that the next time you emerge from the elevator of Vault 111, switching to the catchy tunes of Diamond City Radio as you ready your gun and take in the not-grey landscape, you'll be smiling, just like I do.\n\nUpdate: Due to the recent Skyrim \"update\", breaking mods and introducing paid mods, and a similar downgrade being reported as coming for Fallout 4, I can no longer recommend this game, or any other Bethesda product.",

With a world filled with charming characters, vicious foes, and bakers that use wood as an ingredient, you will fight in turn-based combat utilizing a complex equipment and skill system to fend for yourself. Chained Echoes also features a customizable airship, tons of items to loot and craft, a 30-40 hour playtime, no random encounters, and a fantastic soundtrack inspired by the PSX era. Will you be able to bring peace to Valandis?\n\nHonestly, I absolutely love this game. The 16-bit style graphics, the attention to small little details, the woven in humor, and the combat mechanics all shine bright here. The combat doesn't feel sluggish and I actually felt a desire to talk to the NPCs sprinkled across the world, which is not a normal feeling for me. I also liked that, if I started a conversation with a NPC, I could still walk away. I wasn't forced to hear everything that they needed to say. Overall, as a game, I can't recommend this one enough!\n\n\n[h1]Steam Deck Performance:[/h1]\n\n\nYeah it runs near perfectly here. Without any changes, you can keep 60 FPS with 6.5 - 7 hours of battery on a full charge. It may not come as a surprise based on the game's graphical quality, but it is still wonderful.\n\nI did encounter a couple stutters here and there, which stalled the game for a solid 1 second, but that was it. This tended to happen on the first attack in combat or entering into a new place, but it wasn't consistent or enough to stop me from enjoying the game.\n\nChained Echoes brings back a lot of memories when playing it. Not because it is something I played before, but because it reminds me of the good times I had with older JRPGs. Chrono Trigger is a big one that I loved from the SNES era and this game gave me those same feelings I had playing back in the day. On top of that, the game performs beautifully on the Deck without any setting changes. I am happy to say it gets our Best on Deck rating! If you enjoy the SNES JRPG era, this is an easy must-buy.\n\n\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th] [url=https://steamdeckhq.com/]SDHQ[/url] is a website made for curating Steam Deck news, guides, and providing optimization/builds for games on the Deck.\n[/th][/tr][/table]",
      "I was hoping for a good game but I can't believe the positive reviews. Really annoying on a personal level. If you like your hand held and revel in 3rd person view then enjoy, but I think it's terrible. I was on the mountain jumping across a platform. \"Press ENTER\" to 'grab' it suggests. I press ENTER and what do you know? Nothing happens. Well, you die continually because what it tells you to do (zzzzz) doesn't work. Ah, maybe this is part of the 'difficulty'...hahahaha.\n\nNot a patch on any Far Cry or GTA even though these are full of directions. First Tomb Raider I've bought and definitely the last. What is it with games these days telling you what to do every step of the way: Do this...do that....go here....find item...take item...drop item...fire now.....pull lever...talk....rest....jump.... quit game and uninstall, ya that's the best option. As this game is created for a dumbed-down society or tailored for intellectually challenged meercats, some of us can see where the industry is heading. What happened to thinking for yourself???\n\nI don't need to progess far in this game because the first 10 minutes says enough. Do this, do that, blah blah blah...",
      "This game is the greatest middle finger to all the money-grubbing AAA games out there. It's reasonably priced, it's intelligent, it gives freedom to your epic adventure, and last but not least, this game doesn't have any loot-box and micro-transaction nonsense!\n\nGreat work Larian Studios. This game will go down as a cult classic!!",
      "Playing this game for the first time six years after its initial release proved to be a delight in disguise. With all the memes and jokes established, I was finally able to understand what the fuss was all about back in 2011. Despite not having the best gameplay, story or graphics out there, something about this title just made me want to finish every quest I deemed worth completing. \n\n9/10 - mods recommended",
      "This game is so good! I actually teared up with some of the conversations (Nightgaunt and Riptide anyone??) and I definitely wasn't expecting that. All of the dialogue is super natural and the relationship's progress really cute. I honestly can't believe this game is free",
      "I really, really wanted to like this game.\n\nI preface this review by saying that Guacamelee 1 is in my top 10 games of all time. I've been a gamer for 33 years. Sotn, Chrono Trigger, and FFVII are my go-tos. G-Melee 1 is a charming and original romp through a metroidvania style genre.\n\nGuacamelee 2 fails so ridiculously hard, it actually makes me sad when I think about it. The puzzles are uninspired, the abilities don't really feel enjoyable, and the platforming elements are just unforgivingly tight for the sake of it. I had all the \"schools\" maxed out before the end, it didnt make me feel any more powerful. I didn't have that super saiyan mode like in GM 1.\n\nThe final bossfight is a 3/10 compared to the first game where it is at BARE MINIMUM 9/10.\n\nI wish I could rank this game higher because I adore the original. However, this became a slog several hours before I could finish it. I would not recommend this to anyone, ever. It's light on the humor and story, it requires you to be invested in the previous game. The mechanics aren't new and they threw in some unnecessary tight, like razor thin, platforming into the game.",

      "I don't understand why everyone is saying to stay out of the house? I went inside, they were super nice loving and caring people.

And his grandma, she can't see or hear very well, but she's incredibly sweet. They're both looking after a baby that's ABSOLUTELY ADORABLE!\n\nI don't get what all the fuss is about, I enjoyed my visit.",
      "Gone Home is... okay. There's nothing particularly terrible about it, but it's hardly this amazing, revelatory experience that it's been portrayed as in the media. It's just a very short, straightforward game of exploration, in which a fairly simple story of teenage love and rebellion is fed to you through bits and pieces of notes and spoken journal entries you find while exploring a large, abandoned house. But this game does absolutely nothing innovative, unlike the pre-release hype proclaimed. There have been hundreds of games with more compelling stories, and this game introduces no original mechanics. I took my time and explored the entire house, and I beat the game in three sessions totalling 81 minutes.\n\nAgain, it's not bad, it's just an utter ripoff for $20. I got it in a large Humble Bundle package, paying about a dollar for it, and it's decent value at that price, but there's no way I'd pay more than five bucks, and even that is stretching it. I'd be pissed if I'd paid full retail for it. You can find many many games that will be far more engrossing, more entertaining, and just plain longer at this price point.",
      "I only have 3 hours in this game but I can say it ain't worth £45. Graphics are trying to look cool but just look crap. Glitched unit textures. Runs well doesn't crash but I just hate the changes from the old total war games. Unit icons look crap I can't tell what is what. My general dies there are no notifications. Can't find how much ammo archers have. No tutorial at all. Tried attacking a tier 1 settlement only to lose everything to the towers. I'd rather play rome 2. I really hate the general idea, the fact that any old general can rock up and kill 600 men is stupid.",
      "If Hayao Miyazaki directed a video game I feel like it'd be something like Owlboy. By which I mean; stunning visuals, incredible soundtrack and a wonderful story.

      "This game vs. HOI3:\n---------------------\n\nAdvantages:\n\n1.) The production system is more interesting and engaging, and far more balanced than the old IC system of HOI3. \n2.) The unit creation system is far more in depth and interesting, featuring many different brigade types and support companies, allowing you to change your divisions however you would like. \n3.) This game is far more stable than HOI3.\n4.) This game is updated regularly and has bugfixes regularly too, with content being added free along with every DLC. \n5.) The modding community of HOI4 is far larger with excellent mods such as Kaiserreich, Millenium Dawn, Red World, and Endseig.\n6.) HOI4 muliplayer is actually playable without making you want to shoot yourself.\n7.) China is no longer something Japan can take within 2 months.\n8.) An actual peace conference system and ideologies that actually impact the game.\n9.) Far easier to get into than HOI3.\n10.) Less railroading and the AI wont spaz if you do something ahistorical.\n11.) Planes are no longer as cancer as they used to be.\n12.) Far less micromanagement if you choose not to want to micro.\n13.) A better tutorial (still not a great one though.)\n\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n1.) The research system is bare bones in comparison to HOI3.\n2.) The War in the Pacific is basically nonexistant and naval warfare is awful (to be improved with next patch, being released eventually:tm:)\n3.) People dont really join the war in HOI4 unless theyre directly attacked, making continents like South America completely useless due to the fact that none of the countries there ever do anything but still build up their military, contributing lag.\n4.) Due to the game's engine, it can only use a single one of your processing cores, meaning regardless of your computer quality the game will run kinda slowly.\n5.) Speaking of slowly, the game is poorly optimized and frame loss is extremely common, especially 1942 onwards, when majors can have upwards of 300+ divisions. \n6.) The AI is often braindead, doing hilariously incompetent things such as charging endlessly into your lines, removing all its troops from your front, leaving major areas completely undefended, and completely ignoring the aerial aspect of the war.\n7.) Specific AI are even more braindead than the rest, specifically island nations, or nations that otherwise need to use navies and airforces more. Yes, the Japanese, American, and British AI are some of the worst in the game. In a WW2 game. \n8.) Your allies are completely useless and often you will find yourself doing all the fighting yourself, or even being hindered by your own allies. Playing as Germany the Italians likely wont place a single division in North Africa. In D-Day, you will either be the only one contributing anything or your allies will contribute so much that the supply is ruined and your troops all die of attrition. As the USSR you will recieve 0 lend lease, and as China you will get absolutely no support from the west. \n9.) HOI3 is a lot cheaper than HOI4\n\n\nOther things which I feel are worth mentioning but arent really advantages or disadvantages:\n\n1.) HOI4 contains a lot more alt-history options, which while not for everyone, are fun to try out. \n2.) The focus-tree system is something completely different from anything in HOI3.\n3.) The game has a less in-depth OOB(Order of Battle), which while to some people is nice because theyre bad with OOB, others dislike. Specifically this game lacks corps. \n4.) The battle-planning system of HOI4, while easier to use than the one in HOI3, is still flawwed. In HOI3 it did absolutely nothing, but in this game it is a core part of playing. Unless you want to mircomanage every single division, like you did in HOI3, you will use this system. \n5.) While simpler, the game still possesses a learning curve.\n\n------------------------\n\nOverall: \n\nHOI4 is a far less grounded and historical experience than HOI3. Is this a good or bad thing? That depends on your perspective. HOI4 obviously has significant advantages over HOI3 in certain areas but many consider HOI3 to be an overall better game. Personally I recommend HOI3 if you want a more micro-intensive, historical experience, and HOI4 if you want to just sit back and relax for a couple hours murdering millions of people. \n\nPersonally I would suggest either game, but thats just me.",
      "You had me at creating adventure log, well actually no, at the starting song perhaps. How many years have I been waiting for full fledge, non portable DQ since DQVIII in PS2 ?\n\nThis PC port is a great one, neat and very beautiful. I was playing at 4k/~30fps and since my GPU is not fast enough I switched to 1440p/~50-60fps instead. I wish more and more JRPGs to do PC concurrent launch like this one. A day later I switched back to 4k and change internal resolution to 80% then it was pretty much perfect.\n\n- You can choose default A/B button.\n- You can choose resolution and 30/60 FPS mode.

      "An Excelent, well polished shmup(except for one technical fault) with great graphics and music.\n\nNot much to say other than it has fun boss fights with some creative bullet patterns, you have a gauge that fills up and when activated it doubles your fire power, and also you have bombs. If you have bombs and you get hit, you lose all of your bombs instead of just dying straight out, so you essentially have 2 hit points. You have a graze meter as well, meaning that if bullets pass by you it fills that meter up, when it is full, all bullets around you are basically nullified, and any enemy you kill, any bullets it fired at you will also get nullified. When you pass through the nullifeid bullets, it will fill the first gauge I mentioned so you can go ape s**t more often.\n\nIt's fairly simple, but the pace of the game takes a little while to get used to, the speed of your ship releative to the bullets is a little too slow but it's not game breaking. The only major issue is that my controller is not detectable by the game so I have to use joytokey, so I can't make full use of my controllers analog controls.",
      "Not what the developers promised.\nFeels like a graphics mod for Chivalry.\n\nI'm not a fan of Chivalry either. I had some fun with it, but couldn't bear the clunkiness and wished for intuitive controls and realistic fights. Mordhau promised exactly that. \nAlthough it's equally clunky und even more buggy.\n\nAlso it doesn't offer the option to play in private rooms with your friends (duel mode) or only on paid servers. Inviting a friend to a local match should be a standard feature.\n\nAll the new content and features don't really matter - it's a PvP fighting game. I need only a couple of weapons that work, not 100+ that don't.",
      "This game is meditation, the thought-cleansing effect of driving a thousand kilometres along the highway cannot be understated. Occasionally poor AI choices behind the wheel may spike your blood pressure but overwhelmingly ETS2 is a relaxing thing to stick on after a rough day.

      "Minesweeper influenced design feels like a fresh take on the Slay-the-Spire-like genre.  Now that I've won with all six classes, and done some of the unlockable difficulty levels, I feel that I've gotten my money's worth with the game, and I have enjoyed the time I've spent so far, but I don't expect great longevity beyond this point.\n\nI do have some minor gripes:\n\n* The pacing on unlocking new classes feels too slow.  It would be nice if the approach was the fairly standard one of unlocking a new class when you win with the previous one, but here there is a currency which is acquired throughout runs, and I found that I usually had to have two winning runs with the previous class to earn enough currency to unlock a new one.\n* Optimal play with some classes requires memorizing tiles which are revealed, and then on later turns these tiles are hidden.  Taking damage because I misremembered what was hidden behind a tile feels unfun and at-odds with what the game otherwise wants to be.\n* I would prefer if the harder difficulty settings were unlocked from the get-go, rather than grinding through easier difficulty settings to find the challenge.\n\nOtherwise, though, it's a fun game with an adorable art style, and not just a clone of the other Spire-likes around.  Recommended if your expectation is to get ten hours or so of strategic puzzling.",
      "I backed this game back at the end of September 2013 and have finally played it through to completion. \n\nCandle is a beautifully unique game which takes elements from puzzle, platforming and point and click adventures. The puzzles, although sometimes frustratingly difficult, are all different and use different mechanics keeping the game engaging and fresh. Teku's Candle is such a interesting game mechanic that I really enjoyed getting to know and learn. As previously said, the game looks and sounds absolutely stunning. I don't think I have seen a game that looks this good before and that is attritubuted to every character and scene being hand drawn. Controls can be a bit finicky but not game breaking and you can easily adjust too. I would recommend getting this game because it provides a great whole experience.",
      "The good news is the driving physics, fuel and tire mechanics, and multiplayer design are the best the series has ever been. However, the overall package, performance, and presentation are significantly lacking in this game at launch. Unless you're desperate, hold off on purchasing this game until the developers have had time to put in additional content and fix the numerous bugs and the odd design choices they've made that I think may need to be changed. There's a lot of work that needs to be done on this game for it to be considered a complete racing game.\n \nThe performance on an 8700K+RTX4070 has been inconsistent at 1440p. While playing with frame rate unlocked at a mix of ultra and high settings I can get FPS into the high 80s but this is accompanied by regular drops of about 20 FPS so I felt it required the 60 FPS lock setting which was a bit disappointing. The other disappointment comes in how the game looks, which frankly is not visually pleasing even at the highest possible settings and generally just not a sharp enough picture no matter what you adjust.\n\nSo overall it’s a bit of a mixed bag. The racing itself is engaging and fun but the choices the developers have made with this game for presentation and functionality leave much to be desired. If it receives good post-launch support it may correct a lot of those issues but at launch it’s a bit disappointing and I do not recommend buying it.",
      "Do I really have to write this review? I am just one in thousands of people who wrote a positive reveiw for Garry's Mod. Chances are, this review will never convince someone to buy Garry's Mod. It'll just be lost in the 100,000 positive reviews out there. Well, here I go anyway.\n\n\"Where do I start?\" This is the question asked by anyone playing Gmod for their first time. It's also my question that I ask about this review I am writing. Hmm...\n\n_The gameplay...the gameplay...hmm... Well, there's singleplayer sandbox. You can do...uh, whatever you want really. Just addon a few addons, and you can be entertained for hours. Battle NPCs, make cool scenes for cool screenshots, explore maps, be a superhero (spiderman addon!), and much, much, much, much- you get my point, right? Almost all content is user-generated. Make your own content! Multiplayer. In Multiplayer Gmod you can roleplay. I'm talking normal RP (DarkRP), Military RP, Star Wars RP, etc, etc. In multiplayer Gmod, you can battle, prophunt (yay), hide 'n seek, and much, much, more.\n\n_Graphics? I'll rate the graphics...drumroll please... 7/10. This game is and older game. Came out in 2006. I guess the graphics are good for 2006, and people enjoy the game and don't complain much about the graphics, but I'm not gonna lie, they are outdated and look old. It's not 2006 anymore.\n\n_Hear the bullets flying. The zombies growling. The people chatting. The boxes jumping... The sound in this game is great! Every sound is loud and clear, and there are a varitey of sounds.\n\n_Play this game. Play it again. Play it some more. Play some now, and play some later. Play it over and over. Play it as long as you want.\n\n_My Personal opinion. Get this game. Now. Get Gmod on sale or not. I'm not gonna stop playing it for a while and I'm already at 50+ hours of playtime. I love this game! WAIT! Before you go and buy this, then you wonder why there are all the missing maps and errors in most games, get Counter Strike: Source, so ALL the textures are supported. You need it to play MOST multiplayer games.\n\n\nGameplay: 9/10\nGraphics: 7/10\nStory: N/A\nSound: 8/10\nReplayability: 10/10\n\nOverall 8.5\n\nEven though, this is one positive review on Garry's Mod, out of the thousands of positive reviews that have been submitted Garry's Mod, I hope this one convinces you to buy...

      "EDIT: I nominated this game for game of the year (2023)\n\nLong ago I had heard about this game and how detailed and intricate it could be, and how you could spend hours upon hours building the massive empire of dwarves only for it to all come crashing down in some spectacular but unforeseen way.  Then I got into Rimworld briefly and thought it was ok, but it tended toward chaos a bit too much for my liking.  THEN I heard this game was coming to steam and I eagerly awaited it.\n\nIt's not necessarily that I was too good to play a game with mostly ascii/character graphics (I used to play them a lot back in the 1980s).  I was more intimidated by the depth of the game and not knowing if there was a wiki for it (there is) or how I'd find help if I needed it (I'm sure there's a ton of communities JUST for this game).  I expected that when it came to Steam, it'd be beefed up and worth the wait.\n\nWell it finally arrived and I think I'm STILL a bit intimidated by the sheer amount of options you have... mostly because it's not just me that I have to worry about, but a whole community of dwarves.  In the case of something like minecraft, I could dig a whole intricate tunnel and if stuff starts to go bad, I just high-tail it out of there and recover until I can go back and finish it.  In Dwarf Fortress though, if stuff starts to go bad, you can't just leave.  You are encouraged to deal with the adversity and push onward in the name of greatness... or something.\n\nIn a way it's like role playing, except you don't have to roll character sheets and you don't really control any of the characters directly.  You make decisions about where to mine, what trees to chop down, what to build, what to trade, what to plant, and for every thing there is a season (turn turn turn).  You're forced to deal with death, birth, attacks, sickness, madness, and a ton of other things that I have no idea are coming.  \n\nI keep thinking \"I could do better\" and I start a new game, but then I start to realize that no matter what I do, I'm never gonna have a perfect game, or a game where everything goes exactly according to plan.  I am eventually going to have to buckle down and stick to one game save to see it through.\n\nIf you're like me and starting something new holds a lot more interest than continuing an existing project (ADHD?) you may have difficulty with this game.  At the same time you may become so engrossed in it that you lose track of time and suddenly it's 6am and you wonder why you stayed up all night digging holes.  I'm starting to feel a bit of the madness myself.  (it's almost 4:30am as I write this)\n\nIn any case, it's probably not for everyone, but I'd say if you're unsure, find the non-steam version and try that, and if you can grok what's going on and it interests you, definitely buy this and support the developers... OR buy this and try to stay under the 2 hour refund  limit while you learn the basics (Good luck with that, it'll be 6 hours before you know what happened).  I believe this game is worth the money though (full price).  If you were going to wait for a sale you'd be waiting a long time anyway.  \n\nTL;DR If this looks interesting to you, don't wait! Buy now.  If you aren't sure, do a bit of research and come back and buy it.",

Anyways beatufiful lighting, models / textures look good, vehicle combat / driving is fun, and vehicle customization is cool too. The on foot combat feels a little too straight foward though, the gore animations are kinda boring though, like feels like its a Xbox/360 game in that way, and collecting scrap can get a little repetitive. My final thought yea this game is worth getting but if you haven't played id's \"RAGE\", I'd reccomend getting that first, it's a extremely simmilar although kinda diffrent scenario game that will quench your Mad Max thirst.",
      "*LOOK INTO SAFETY/SECURITY RISKS BEFORE BUYING THIS GAME*\n\n     Playing this game online can be risky as hackers are able find your IP address, mess with your in-game / weapons / health / money, find out your personal information, install rats on your PC & even get into your computer. Although this isn't super common it's still a legitimate thing that people need to know about & should look into before spending their money on this game. It doesn't happen as much to random players but Streamers have to play this game in offline mode whenever they stream themselves playing otherwise the hackers will mess with whatever they're doing by trying to get them banned. \nPlease google \"Black ops 3 PC security risks 2022\". It really is a shame that Treyarch isn't coming back to fix this very serious problem in their game, but let's be real Activision  more than likely isn't letting them. \n\nTL;DR: Be cautious of potential security issues, but I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes Call of Duty Zombies / zombies in general or who wants to get into the Call of Duty Zombies franchise.\n\nNow for my review:\n     Best call of duty game ever for Zombies. Definitely can be a challenge to find multiplayer matches nowadays but zombie matches aren't hard to find as long as you're playing the \"popular\" maps. The \"less popular\" maps are more difficult to find a match on but it's still possible, especially if you search for a match at the right time of day. This goes for multiplayer as well, if you search for a match during specific times you will be more likely to find matches (I'm not entirely sure when these times are so I wont even leave my guess here). This is likely because of people in different time-zones getting up / getting off work or school and getting on the game.\n     This game is the best thing to ever happen to the Zombies series in terms of gameplay, storyline, progression & more. There are endless tasks, items & surprises in each map that keep you coming back for more and having a different experience each time! It truly is a wonderful & fun game that has offered me more re-play ability than any other game I've ever experienced, especially with custom zombies/mod tools. With community made maps there's literally endless maps/levels to play on, & because of mod tools we not only have the remakes that come with Zombies Chronicles but we also have the visually stunning remakes of Mob of the Dead, Call of the Dead & Town, with Buried as well as Die Rise on the way for 2023/2024! I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes Call of Duty Zombies / zombies in general or who wants to get into the Call of Duty Zombies franchise.",

      "Big improvement over the first game. \n\nCombat is much more enjoyable and the boss fights actually have some interesting patterns and design. I had some issues with taking damage when being too close to the boss which was frustrating but not too huge of an issue. Boss patterns felt fair and it felt like I really learned the fight in and out by the time I beat them.\n\nPersonally I found the overworld a bit less visually interesting than the first; though travelling back and forth between two different worlds was a nice touch. The overworld also has lot of mazes, much more than I remember in the first game. That being said, I spent much less time not knowing how to progress in the game which is nice.\n\nAudio-Visual presentation is excellent as to be expected. Though I also felt the narrative to be more interesting this time around. I was able to follow the narrative pretty well and the plot even has some pretty good twists. Overall another improvement over the first game.\n\nIn general I found this a lot less frustrating to play than the first game; allowing for the game's good points to work better. Given this I have a much easier time recommending this than the first game, which was always a very cautious recommendation from me. It should be noted that this game has many references to the prequel so it should be played before this; even if doing so is a bit rough. If the third game improves on this I would have very little issue recommending the whole trilogy.\n\n",
      "If you played the OG this is basically the same but with a few added side stories you can unlock as you complete different routes in the game. The extra dlc maybe would take you a bit over an hour to complete all of them if you speed through it, but does not have any optional dialogue so it's more of just some lore and extra character interactions. Still pretty solid dlc if you are a fan and want a little bit of extra stuff :)",

To word it a little differently, I felt like my choices had very little impact on the story as a whole and I could easily (a little too easily) steer the final outcome at any time but, within individual interrogations, what I chose to do had a major affect on the immediate narrative.\n\nThat being said, it is a wonderful game to play for four to six hours on a Sunday and at $15 USD it is cheap and entertaining enough to only need a single playthrough to feel like you've gotten your money's worth.

      "I have played OSU!, Muse Dash and stepmania plenty and I gotta say that this does not feel like a rhythm game at all. The premise of matching the shape of the map to music sounds interesting but some of the songs I feel like are not mapped out correctly. Or in general this game relies less on music cues and more on visual cues? It felt like maps are only 50% related to the song and you have to ignore what you hear because the map randomly demands patterns that have no matching audio equivalent and everything becomes pure visual memorization.",

      "We need a 60fps patch ASAP. Having 30fps content on PC in [current year] is not acceptable.\n\nOther than that the game is pretty solid! It looks great, it plays great, the story was good imo, the characters are interesting and the amount of solo content is decent.\n\nHowever, the gear system is not as elaborate as in Mk11 and the microtransations are NOT a welcome sight. Denuvo also has to go. If Harada agreed that the addition of Denuvo in Tekken 7 was a mistake, so should NetherRealm.\nI also don't like that 2 characters that are going to be in the Kombat Pass are already in the game (Ermac and Quan Chi). Just give us these characters and come up with other ones for the KP.

That's awful.\n\nThe game is good but needs improvement and shouldn't ship with performance issues, 30fps content, microtransactions, Denuvo and greedy DLC tactics.

      "I have a serious love/hate relationship with Sea of Thieves. It is both one of the best games I have ever played and one of the most frustrating games I have ever played, all wrapped into one. The gameplay of Sea of Thieves is INCREDIBLE. The sailing is the best in any game I have ever played. The feeling of exploration and discovery as you blast through treasure hunts and puzzles and mysteries is unlike any feeling you can get from any other game. The cooking mechanic, the healing from food, the not-terrible fishing mechanic... all subsystems that prop up the rest of the gameplay are unique and interesting in their own right. The land-based combat is relatively uninspired, yet still satisfying when part of the greater picture that the game presents. Some of my favorite memories in gaming, full stop, come from completing long nights on the high seas or doing long-form content available in the game. The game is gorgeous, some of the best ocean/water graphics in any game. The rest of the game is equally beautiful while perfectly conveying the environment of the map you are in. I swear to Gaben that I can freaking smell the wet sand or sulfurous lava on some of these islands. The music and sound design are some of the best in the industry. Outright, the game is incredible. \n\nBUT... Sea of Thieves sweaties ruin the game for me. There is absolutely nothing worse than having a night full of fun absolutely destroyed by some player who's enjoyment of the game is derived from eliminating anyone else's fun. I understand that PvP is part of the \"pirate life\", but it is by far the worst part of the game by far. I would be willing to pay money, hell a freaking monthly subscription, for the opportunity to play SoT as a strictly PvE game with just my friends and the rest of the server populated by bots. I actively avoid playing the game now because of how many of my last play sessions started with me spawning at an outpost and subsequently being sunk less than 15 feet off the dock by some sweaty that hasn't seen sunlight since the Obama administration. I know that this is an incredibly unpopular opinion in the greater SoT-sphere, but part of the enjoyment of games is letting players enjoy them how they wish, and I really freaking wish that I could enjoy the aspects of SoT that are fun to me without being the plaything of those pirates who live only to ruin the fun of others."

      "[h1]An old classic that's fresher than lots of today's titles.[/h1]\n\n[i]Day of the Tentacle[/i] first launched in 1993. I remember, because I was a teenager then and couldn't play it as my PC didn't meet the minimum requirements! This was actually the sequel to an earlier game, [i]Maniac Mansion[/i], which was released in 1987. I played [i]Maniac Mansion[/i] a few years after it came out, but did not complete it as the game's movement and controls were just too dated and clunky for me (even back then) to be bothered with. \n\nPlaying [i]Maniac Mansion[/i] is not at all necessary in order to enjoy [i]Day of the Tentacle[/i], though those who have will definitely find greater connection to the game's characters, especially the Edison family.\n\n23 years later, [i]Day of the Tentacle Remastered[/i] is essentially the same as it was before, but with sleeker graphics and a more modernised interface. While the story hasn't changed, it surprisingly (or not) hasn't aged one bit either - tentacle mutates and seeks to conquer the world, and only you (and your friends) can stop him! Though straightforward, the game's charm is in its various amusing time travel locations and the weird and wonderful characters you meet along the way. This is a prime example of where [i]\"it's all about the journey, not the destination.\"[/i]\n\n\n[h1]Yays![/h1]\n\n+ Vibrant, colourful, hi-res cartoon-style graphics.\n+ Well-designed rooms, locations and scenery.\n+ Fully voiced, with good voice acting for the most part. (The guy who plays Dr Fred is awesome.)\n+ Interesting, memorable characters.\n+ Fun, amusing story.\n+ Wacky humour.\n+ Clear goals.\n+ Cool easter eggs. (Under \"achievements\".)\n+ Contains a free game ([i]Maniac Mansion[/i])!\n+ Puzzles are mostly enjoyable and require some creative thinking.\n+ Many gameplay hours.\n+ Trading cards.\n\n[h1]Nays.[/h1]\n\n- [url=steamcommunity.com/app/388210/discussions/0/392184522713202518/]Audio starts stuttering[/url] after a while, due to memory problems.\n- Achievements remain hidden, even after the game is completed, so you can't see what you're missing.\n- Some puzzles have illogical or nonsensical solutions.\n- Bugs: e.g. When looking at one of the items, Laverne's voice sounds when Bernard speaks.\n- No mouse command to fast-forward dialogue; instead, you have to press \".\" which is really inconvenient, especially when the whole point of a point-n-click game is to [i]not[/i] have to use your keyboard!\n- Some counter-intuitive puzzle set-ups: E.g. For the videotape puzzle, a button which looks like the \"STOP\" button, is actually the \"RECORD\" button. Anyone who's ever used a VCR or tape recorder would know that the square symbol denotes \"STOP\", while the round button denotes \"RECORD\". \n- Hoagie's periodic belches sound absolutely disgusting!\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nThis was a hugely enjoyable experience from start to finish. Though the nostalgia factor played a part in my case, even if you've never heard of the [i]Maniac Mansion[/i] series, as long as you count yourself a point-n-click adventure game fan, this is a must-play because it just gets so many things right. Add to that the timeless plot and wacky characters, and you have yourself a game that will play just as fresh & new decades down the road.\n\n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [td][u]Disclaimer:[/u] [i]Game played for free, with many thanks to my dear friend [url=steamcommunity.com/id/kflorence]KFlo[/url]. :)[/i][/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]",

Greeted by a traffic light, you tried to remember what was happening. It turns out that you have a unique ability: reading an object's memory.

People who have problems with flashing lights should avoid this game since the game isn't as good as it is with some options turned off.[/i]\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1]In-Depth Review[/h1]\n\n[h3]Visuals[/h3]\nThe developer spends a lot of effort crafting beautiful, quality cutscenes. Some scenes show the beauty of the night sky while others show what the main character is feeling from close range. Food images look so carefully made that I couldn't believe that it was a pixelated image at first. Every scene does a good job in supporting the story, combined with the relaxing music that is running in the background.\n\nBlurry effects are applied on the screen, whether it's just to make a certain area stand out or create a cool-looking effect for the cutscenes. The game relies on a lot of transitions in its cutscenes, some can leave you shocked with the inverted images and flashes of red colors at intense moments. People that have problems with these can soften the red color in the option with the downside of making the scene to be less effective. Moreover, since the option affects all red colors in the game, some scenes will look weird with the faded color.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441881358 \n\n[h3]Story[/h3]\nThe story is a relaxing one, set in a place where people are helpful and empathetic to your actions. Every character gives a positive vibe through their attitude and kindness, supporting you whenever you are down or helping you to enjoy the moment. Reading the interaction between characters warm my heart, especially when accompanied by the relaxing music that is playing in the background.\n\nThe storytelling is wonderfully done with the combination of visuals and music to let you drown in the story. Sometimes, an intense moment kicks in, changing the scenery into one full of effects and transitions. The fast-paced music also helps to set the mood with its upbeat tone, increasing the intensity. The ending is told in a similar manner, although instead of an intense moment, it crafts a touching scene instead that is fit for an ending. Some people will find a small part of the ending not to make any sense, although luckily, it won't affect the overall experience.\n\n[h3]The Game[/h3]\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nThe game is focused on reading memories of an object to progress. Your hidden ability to read an object's memory by touching it will help you to solve various tasks, ranging from looking a lost object to finding a hidden area. There are some limitations though - some objects have no memories that you can read while other objects can't be interacted with until they are discovered. Fortunately, they are quite easy to discover as long as you spam the space button and/or pay attention to the dialogues.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441881785 \n\n[b]Puzzles and Minigames[/b]\nThe rest of the gameplay is focused on the usual adventure games where you have to pick up items and use them to pass through the area. Most problems that you will have to solve has the same theme as the building you are in. It's nice to see how puzzles are related to the corresponding area while still being unique at the same time.\n\nMost puzzles and minigames are easy to solve except for a select few. I found the last one to be the trickiest because not only does it cover a huge area, but it also requires you to use the mechanic from a previous area, something which never happened in other puzzles. It's still easy to solve as long as you are attentive enough, but if you happen to get stuck, the game offers subtle hints in the form of memories that you can read.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441883206 \n\n[b]Length and Replayability[/b]\nI finished the game in 9.7h after experiencing all the bad endings. Although the game only offers one manual save slot, it has an extra checkpoint slot that you can load before the story branches off. A hidden secret can also be found after you finished the game, which might take a long time to find due to its randomness. I found it to be a waste of time though, especially since there isn't much that you can learn from the secret. You'll also be left with more questions than answers, giving more reason not to look for them unless if you are an achievement hunter or the curious type.\n\n[b]Problems[/b]\nDespite the game requires you to restart the game several times, you can't skip the cutscenes. Some parts of the game will lead you to a bad ending and the unskippable cutscenes can take a significant amount of time if you don't know how to bypass it. Moreover, checkpoints tend to be placed minutes before the story branches off, wasting more of your time. Lastly, the game isn't very clear whenever it autosaves your game. I had to save manually whenever I took a break from the game because of this.\n\n[h1]Specs[/h1]\nIntel Core i5-9300H 2.40GHz, 8GB RAM, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nThe game has a lot of elements that complement each other. The nice-looking visuals, the calm and relaxing music that can heat up in intense moments, the superb effect - everything blends well to make the story stands out. The detailed cutscenes are done well to capture the emotion that can't be portrayed with a simple portrait and character animation, while portraits are expressive enough to handle simple expressions. The game is designed with quality in mind and although it can be slow sometimes, the relaxing music helps you to savor the moment.\n\n[quote]This game was reviewed with a key provided by the developer for free through [url=https://discord.gg/xc22zZP]Reviewers' Paradise[/url], a group that connects both developers and reviewers in one place[/quote]\n\n[quote]Visit SaveOrQuit.com for detailed game reviews, posted daily![/quote]",
      "No additional account, no unnecessary launcher, no denuvo, no epic exclusivity, no microtransactions, just a video game as it always should be..",
      "I bought the game and the mechanics are fun! The battle system is super impactful and just FEELS fun. It really gives you a sense of satisfaction. And it has interesting elements that really every game should have... but the UI sucks, the classes are genderlocked, and there are so many systems going on at once it's annoying. Like something as simple as a constant notification in the middle of the screen of some other person or random guild you know nothing about doing quests or getting skill points. It's a fun game, but has WAAAY too many minor (except genderlocked classes. Genderlock is never a minor thing) problems that just add up making it annoying to play",
      "Before you play this, make sure you play these games in order. That is:\n- To the moon\n- Finding Paradise\n- Imposter factory.\n\nAs for this game, it is another gorgeous story that takes you on a journey into the realm of memories. I encourage you to play these games blindly and to read nothing about the story because that's what I did, and I was surely surprised and mindblown. As for the ending of this game, I am still processing it to this day!\n\nI can't wait to play the next game by Freebird Games.",
      "Smooth beats, sick moves.\n\nOlliOlli was the best endless runner/rock hard skateboard move combo game I'd played in months. Well, the best just got better!\n\nWhy's it better? Polish, nollies, the aforementioned beats and some added smoothing.\n\nRad.",
      "As i previously stated, i was going to play through metro fully and i have done so, so here is my update to this review. \nThis game is not the best selling triple A game in the world and it may have some bugs (like a table that wasnt solid or the objects in that room lol) however it is a decent game. the story is decent and the characters voices are way off but they sorta make up for it with their personalities. \n\nExploration in this game is by far one of the most interesting in my opinion and the way your character acts in the enviroment makes it more interesting aswell, for example wiping your visor when it gets dirty (wasnt that helpful for me in my play through but it was a nice touch) and your visor taking damage in combat adds to the immersive feel of this wasteland/paradise almost. Scavenging weapons and parts and combining them to make better equipment is quite intriguing and quick to do if you can find the parts. \n\nat the end of the day my final review of this is its a good game i would play it again even if it is a bit clunky sometimes (atleast it was for me lmao)\n\n\n\n\n\nOh and hopefully my punctuation is good enough so no one passes out this time lmao",
      "Simply fantastic. Probably the best TRUE RPG I've ever played. Your choices matter, dialogue options matter, the order in which you do things matter, even such small things such as the items you hold in your hand matter. Every build is viable, go heavy in Physical stats and you'll have difficulty solving things Logically, but maybe you can brute force your way through something. Go heavy in Logic and you'll be weak in a one-to-one fight, but maybe you'll be so fast to figure things out that it'll never come to that. You'll see things that the dim-witted brute with high Physical didn't. Failure is encouraged, there are many routes in the game you cannot open without failing something else first.\n\nA true combat system does not exist. At all. Physical altercations are decided through dice rolls based on how you've built your character. And virtually all of them are optional. I like this decision a lot. I've always found it immersion-breaking in RPGs when you're just running around the countryside, killing every bandit or animal that comes your way. This one keeps fights realistic with REAL consequences depending how things go.\n\nBarring having to restart my game once due to a bug (quicksave often, autosaves are few), the game had no major technical issues. There was a single point in the game where a vital skill check required a specific skill to be built, and I'm not sure if there were any alternate routes. I couldn't find any, just had to savescum the check. Aside from that, you have options as to how to approach everything. I'm not sure if that was an oversight or if I just missed something.\n\nCan't go into the story much without spoilers (and you DON'T want it spoiled, it's great.) But it's very well-written and even hilarious at some points. But don't be fooled, it's not a comedy game. It tackles very serious topics such as Fascism, Communism, Mental Illness, Addiction, and many other things.\n\nOverall an amazing RPG experience that I cannot recommend enough. Will definitely play through this several times to see how things go with different builds. Highly suggest you purchase this if you have any interest.",
      "You play as a girl dashing through enemies by pressing 2 buttons. That's literally it. Each stage is the length of a song and as you play more you'll unlock more songs. \n\n\nI highly recommend this game if you're a 5 year old who can be easily entertained.",
      "It's hard to recommend Spelunky 2. Not because it is a bad game, but because it can be frustrating. As with most roguelikes, dying means going back to the beginning. In Spelunky however, nothing carries over to future runs. All you get to bring in to your next run is your own experience and knowledge; And when half the things in the game kill you instantly or stunlock you to death, having a great run end in a quick death can be damaging to one's will.\n\nThankfully, your own experiences count a great deal towards your progress. Most hazards and enemies in Spelunky 2 have a very simple and predictable behaviour. But keeping track of everything on the screen is still a challenge. Enemies and traps will also work together (or against each other) and still bring your demise somehow. Either by bumping your helplessly stunned body into other enemies and traps, or enemies having their own flaming corpse launched towards you and your flammable jetpack. It's actually quite funny sometimes. A good deal of entertainment can be had recording your own amazingly nonsensical deaths.\n\nSpelunky 2 improves upon Spelunky HD's gameplay by adding split paths, which allow for more variety and decision-making in your runs while staying true to the feeling and style of previous entries. It also adds a back layer to each level, allowing for more secrets to be kept. After successfully completing your first run, you can try to discover these secrets and find hidden bosses and areas and even different endings!\n\nAnyway, you might enjoy the game if you're a masochist or something.",
      "I played the demo and instantly became enamored. The mix of Slay the Spire-style deck-building with elements of the ship combat from FTL: Faster Than Light is an absolutely fascinating mix, and the \"single-axis\" movement system adds a whole extra layer that I've never seen in anything except the Mega Man: Battle Network series.\n\nI bought the full game within the first hour of being available. After having played for nearly 4 hours at the time of writing, my opinion hasn't changed in the slightest. I already love what's available and so far I feel like I've barely scratched the surface.\n\nI can't wait to see what awaits in the future for this awesome title.\n\nEDIT: As a small addition, I will say: I beat my very first run, which is set to the lowest difficulty (Normal). I jumped up to Hard to try to unlock a new ship, and I haven't been able to beat a run since then. It's probably just that I'm bad, all things considered, but be aware that the changes made with difficulty increases are probably more impactful than they may seem.\n\nAlso I wanna say to the devs: thank you for launching the game with mod support and working on making it easier! But also please look into getting Steam Workshop support if you can!",
      "Pros:\n> Decent selection of interior desing elements\n> Uncommon but interesting gameplay idea if you're into interior design and building\n> Fair price for amount of activities you get in base game\n> Gameplay leght\n> Regural updates\n\nCons:\n> You can't change location of windows in the house - some are placed in awkward places thus creating decent rooms becomes difficult\n> Game optimisation is questionable for such graphics  -  with RX vega 56 I barely get 60 fps \n> No replayability on same save file - once you sell property you cannot do it again\n> Once property is sold there's only some screenshots but no actual way to look around again\n> No steam workshop or mods\n\nIdeas for possible future updates:\n> Add floor plan design feature - building and demolishing walls 10 times is frustrating\n> Add ability to build custom houses and change locations of windows\n> Add ability to enter sold properties\n> Increase game performance\n\nDLCs:\n> HGTV DLC adds moderate amount of additional jobs\n> Garden DLC adds alot of activities outside the house but is a bit buggy. In my opinion some features should be in base game",
      "Katana ZERO? More like, Katana ZERO CONCLUSION.\n\nI had too high expectation on this game, I thought it was going to be Hotline Miami but better.\nIn the end I still prefer Hotline Miami, specifically Hotline Miami 2.\n\nOne thing I dislike is the lack of combo scoring system. \nIt's a good way to make the players act fast and execute their actions flawlessly, instead the game only has a timer bar that never runs out as a way to motivate the player to go fast.\n\nI am aware how \"pointless\" game scores are.\nBut seeing a number going up feels good.\n\nWhat happens when you kill an enemy in Hotline Miami?\n - You get to see a number pops out, and the score goes up indicating that you are doing good!\n - Satisfying bloody hit sound.\n - Throbbing light on the edge of the map.\n - Randomized dead sprite of the enemy, sometimes they get dismembered depending on the weapon.\n\nIn Katana ZERO you'd get :\n - A \"fwoob\" sound.\n - A same dying animation of the enemy getting knocked and bleed to death. Instead of getting decapitated or something.\n - Flashy slash effect.\n\nAt one point I wondered on why should I even bother killing the enemies when it didn't reward me with anything in the room with a minecart. \nWhen having the enemy being killed by the minecart or the player makes no difference.\n\n[spoiler]More like Katana ZERO REWARD. I think this is it, exactly why I am disappointed by it. Imagine playing soulsbornekiro or Hollow Knight without earning any kind of currency??? Killing the enemies would feel pointless.[/spoiler]\n\nIt's basically way more fun and rewarding to kill an enemy in Hotline Miami than Katana ZERO.\n\nThen there are other stuff like...\nUnfun stealth gameplay. \nRollspamming without consequence.\nBeing able to endlessly doing a mid air attack without having to touch the ground first.\n\nThere are also waaaay too many checkpoints in my opinion, it encouraged me to just brute force everything with roll spamming without having to worry about starting over.\nThe rooms could've been a bit bigger and longer. But also less room, quality over quantity.\n\nAnd finally, the story.\nI was intrigued by it but it just ended abruptly with a \"To be continued\".\nIt's like they only wrote 50% of it then slapped a \"To be continued\" and called it a day.\nThe game seems to rely heavily on \"mentioning stuff off screen that player will never get to see\" to tease the player.\nI already knew that the game is going to be short, but I didn't expect it to be this disappointing. \n\nIt's not a bad game, I just had the wrong expectation.\n\nI might change it to positive if I was satisfied by the DLC.\nOr maybe after beating the hard mode, I heard it's more fun.",
      "This game is far away in another galaxy from being anything but a 3/10 in my book. \nGame consists of a tack on level system with a few skills, corny jokes that make you cringe, copy paste worlds with sliding on ice, mud, or leaves depending on the world your on with vines to climb certain walls again....depending on the world your on, no dismemberment except on animals and main characters. Further all planets feel the same and after quite a few hours in the game I struggle to continue playing because of the cut and dry gameplay to where you will fight a couple animals, do some very linear parkour, then do a puzzle that will most likely include a sphere that you need to put into said location to unlock a door as such. graphics are eh..and I have to say the battlefront 2 campaign had more thought than this garbage. save your money and don't buy this",
      "So um, I don't usually write reviews like this or much at all really. I mostly make unfunny jokes and call it a review or something super generic. I guess I'll just write whats on my mind.\n\nI really liked this game.\nI felt like I was a kid again playing Super Mario 64.\nSometimes I get tired of shooting guns. Or slashing fantasy monsters with some shiny sword. Or saving the magic land from evil. Or using hyper combos I never remember. Or collecting resources to build a quirky town. Or time managing some distant farm. Or driving some tricked out vehicles. Or investing in status points to make super strong characters. Or following a long and convoluted plot with crazy lore.\n\nSometimes I just wanna run and jump around while I pick up some cool looking stuff.\nI, uh, had a lot fun playing this game. \nThanks.",
      "This game is great and is worth the cost, I have not tried it in VR yet but I imagine it's great....I have a slight urge to join the US military all of a sudden...",
      "i would recomend it because the physics are great, the game has 8 or 9 level packs (i dont know if there will be a 9th because there are 7 at the time of this review) the units are diverse, there are a lot of secret units to find and i dont know for the final boss because the most expensive unit artimis isnt a good final boss like the dark pesant in the alphas but i hope that the games final boss unit is actually hard to kill and requires more than 7 archers because that wasnt hard or anything hopefully they will make the most expensive unit actually overpowered and unballanced because that would be a great final boss, the sandbox mode is great i like the custom campains , the custom units arent out yet so i cant say anything about that over all this game is worth the money and if its near a sale time like a few days away from a sale then get it on sale if not then just get it you wont regret it and if it lage turn off all the graphics settings",
      "I have played OSU!, Muse Dash and stepmania plenty and I gotta say that this does not feel like a rhythm game at all. The premise of matching the shape of the map to music sounds interesting but some of the songs I feel like are not mapped out correctly. Or in general this game relies less on music cues and more on visual cues? It felt like maps are only 50% related to the song and you have to ignore what you hear because the map randomly demands patterns that have no matching audio equivalent and everything becomes pure visual memorization.",
      "Oh, that The Resident Evil (The RE)… One of the best stories in the gaming industry! The Capcom is well done that decided to remake games. Many players criticize The RE3, but I understand them, the game is quite short, there are no horror elements in the game. But the game has become easier, for example, a knife does not wear out. The players did not forget to criticize the Nemesis too, saying that there is no element of surprise and persecution, and there’s no sense of the constant presence of someone, who can mutilate you. The Nemesis means in English as “a good script”. However, the game creators tried to convey the atmosphere of The RE and the horror that the doomed city is filled with. Well-chosen actors, excellent voice acting, correctly conveyed the atmosphere of the city. I would add more moving elements on the destroyed streets of the city, like people or zombies\nTotal score: 8.5/10",
      "With almost 300 hours of Destiny 2 (D2) back on Battle.net (the Blizzard launcher), let me give this perspective/advice for new players, specifically with regards for the F2P offering that is Destiny 2: New Light, with a few more holistic thoughts sprinkled throughout:\n\nThis overall game is very good. It doesn't always live up to its promise (the first mission of every campaign is always the most polished thing aside from the raids/dungeons), but when it does, it [b]really[/b] shines.\n\nThe gunplay is unrivaled. The visual/audio feedback is great, the handling feels really good, and enemies really pop when you take them out. Expect nothing less from the studio that brought us grunt birthday parties.\n\nThe game is better in a fireteam. Now that the base game is F2P [though with considerably less content than it used to be/I would like], this should be easier than ever for most activities. That said, a huge majority of my playtime was done solo. It can get tricky at times (\"Darkness Zones\" in certain missions prevent respawning but allow for revives, so solo players have a distinct disadvantage there). \n\nWith that said, dungeons (currently 'The Shattered Throne', 'Pit of Heresy', 'Prophecy' which is free to all players, 'Grasp of Avarice', 'Duality', and 'Spire of the Watcher') and raids (\"Last Wish\" from Forsaken, \"Garden of Salvation\" from Shadowkeep, \"The Deep Stone Crypt\" from Beyond Light, 'Vow of the Disciple' from Witch Queen, as well as 'Vault of Glass' and 'King's Fall' from D1 - both of which are both free to all players) are best experienced with a team, so don't shy away from LFG group-finder options like the Discord, official app, or any number of other sites (just make sure to accurately describe your experience, level, and gear. 'Tis only polite). \n\nOf the matchmade multiplayer offerings, I enjoy Gambit (PvPvE, reminds me of the Black Ops Zombies 4z4 mode done right), jump into the occasional Strike (PvE, matchmade fireteams running campaign-like missions), and have no interest in Crucible (PvP, it's fine I guess, but I've never liked PvP that's dependent in large part on personal progression - especially in the competitive modes like Trials of Osiris and Iron Banner)\n\nDon't be afraid to ignore content - this is absolutely the kind of game where you can set your own goals. Want a specific exotic gun? Look up where it drops and focus on grinding that content. Want a specific roll on a random roll gun? Find the best possible farming (or crafting) method and go to town. Chase down some of the exotic questions that the game clutters up your quest page with, or just goof around doing things that you find fun while absolutely ignoring all signposts.\n\nSome stuff just won't be explained in game. It's not as bad as Warframe (much less need for a wiki) but some things are still obscured. Feel free to look up Xur (exotic weapon vendor who visits on weekends) and other hidden exotics tied to specific activities, lost sectors, patrol locations, or quest chains.\n\nFor anything that you can't easily find online - reach out and find a sherpa. The community for this game tends to be pretty great, and enough of us have spent enough time leaning specific parts of it (e.g. raids) or just mechanics in general (\"What are random rolls? Which do I keep?\") that we'd be happy to jump onto discord (there are a bunch for PC, just check out the subreddit sidebar linked below) and answer any and all questions you may have. \n\nThe fact that a representative chunk of this game is free makes this the perfect time to dip your toes in without emptying out your wallet. Any other questions about this game as a product (\"Should I pay for DLC? Is Eververse worth it?\") should absolutely be researched elsewhere.\n\nIf you're looking for a place to start with the F2P content, finish the intro missions in the Cosmodrome. New and returning players are semi-regularly upgraded to a new light level floor, but means that you can miss out on the \"learning the ropes\" parts of the game that come with working your way through the New Light quest chain or unlocking different subclasses.

      "If you want to cut your teeth on the Final Boss of box-pushing puzzle games, then have I got the game for you.\n\nRight out of the gate SSR offers a somewhat uneven mix of real head-scratchers and what I can only describe as pity puzzles, but quickly reveals itself to be the sort of puzzler that mandates particularly extensive sessions of staring at the seemingly inconsequential number of tiles onscreen and poking experimentally at them until something starts to click. This demands a little more patience than I ordinarily have, but I was starting to appreciate the design as I acclimatized to it.\n\nThen I arrived at The Great Tower level (in only the second subsection of the overworld), which all at once foists about 4 times more pieces on you than you've dealt with previously, while simultaneously introducing a Z-axis and the concept of using pieces as platforms mid-puzzle.\n\nSSR does have a well-executed and forgiving Undo function with basically unlimited storage which is a great thing to have up until the time spent rewinding would outweigh the time spent to simply restart the puzzle and do over; the only way it could be made practical on a level that large would be if you had a full-on timeline scrubber like in the rerelease of Duke Nukem 3D.\n\nThere's patience, there's logic, and then there's [b]this.[/b] I play puzzle games to try and [i]relieve[/i] stress, not the other way round. It's a solid design, and I'd probably recommend it to the REALLY die-hard logicians and puzzle fanatics.

      "Holy crap.\n\nPowerful.\n\nThis game explores some serious life issues: Abuse. The pain of childhood, and of parenthood. Manhood and womanhood. Strength. Loss.\n\nThis game had me near crying at several points. The story is freaking powerful. It's also remarkably well written, and downright hilarious at times. \n\nAnd the gameplay? \n\nIt's fun enough that I want to play through it again right after beating it. This turn-based RPG is sometimes brutally difficult, in part because it slaps many old-school conventions in the face (e.g., sleeping can be dangerous). Battles are challenging. Tactical thinking is essential since many enemies are VERY dangerous and you're frequently outnumbered. I really applaud the AI as it keeps you on your toes. \n\nThe game doesn't hold your hand. There is no map, compass, or any attempt to make navigation easier. You just have to remember your way around, though there are plenty of memorable environments. \n\nCharacters will force you to make decisions with lasting consequences. There are dozens of hard choices to make along the journey, which brings me to another topic the game explores: decision. Will you save your friends, or your stuff? I got very attached to the buddies I picked up, only to have them devoured by a mutant, or bail on me when I least expected it. You just never know what you'll face, nor what to choose. Thinking back to many of those times, I don't know what I should have done. All the options sucked. \n\nBut I can't help asking myself, \"Did I make the right choice?\" \n\nHighly recommended.",

      "Playing this game instantly brought back memories of me playing TMNT, Battletoads, Double Dragon, and Streets of Rage, with my little brother on the NES and Sega Genesis in the early 90s. Luckily this game doesn’t feature TMNT’s ridiculous water level or Battletoads' sadistic peed bike level. The graphics are perfect, the controls are great, the soundtrack is awesome (especially the Wu-Tang stage, and the Shredder stage), and the levels and overworld map are fun to navigate. I’ve played through the story mode with all 7 characters and have played through the arcade mode multiple times solo and many times in multiplayer and I’ve enjoyed every bit of it. This game is so much fun.\n\nThere are a few things I wish existed though. I wish there were more playable characters. I wish that you did not lose your 7 character’s progress in story mode when you start a new game. I wish you could see the difficulty level of the online arcade game you are joining. I wish there were cumulative stats you could see for arcade and story mode that showed the number of times you completed a stage, how many enemies you knocked out, objects you’ve destroyed, stage times, combo streaks, times taunted, etc. I wish you could create your own turtle and assigned moves, specials, jumps, taunts, and colors.",

Chances are, this review will never convince someone to buy Garry's Mod. It'll just be lost in the 100,000 positive reviews out there. Well, here I go anyway.\n\n\"Where do I start?\" This is the question asked by anyone playing Gmod for their first time. It's also my question that I ask about this review I am writing. Hmm...\n\n_The gameplay...the gameplay...hmm... Well, there's singleplayer sandbox. You can do...uh, whatever you want really. Just addon a few addons, and you can be entertained for hours. Battle NPCs, make cool scenes for cool screenshots, explore maps, be a superhero (spiderman addon!), and much, much, much, much- you get my point, right? Almost all content is user-generated. Make your own content! Multiplayer. In Multiplayer Gmod you can roleplay. I'm talking normal RP (DarkRP), Military RP, Star Wars RP, etc, etc. In multiplayer Gmod, you can battle, prophunt (yay), hide 'n seek, and much, much, more.\n\n_Graphics? I'll rate the graphics...drumroll please... 7/10. This game is and older game. Came out in 2006. I guess the graphics are good for 2006, and people enjoy the game and don't complain much about the graphics, but I'm not gonna lie, they are outdated and look old. It's not 2006 anymore.\n\n_Hear the bullets flying. The zombies growling. The people chatting. The boxes jumping... The sound in this game is great! Every sound is loud and clear, and there are a varitey of sounds.\n\n_Play this game. Play it again. Play it some more. Play some now, and play some later. Play it over and over. Play it as long as you want.\n\n_My Personal opinion. Get this game. Now. Get Gmod on sale or not. I'm not gonna stop playing it for a while and I'm already at 50+ hours of playtime. I love this game! WAIT! Before you go and buy this, then you wonder why there are all the missing maps and errors in most games, get Counter Strike: Source, so ALL the textures are supported.

      "I was excited to play this after playing Persona 5 and Persona 5 Royal (my introductions to the series) to death.  This game was raved about and I thought, if it's more of the same then this should be great...\n\nThe major problem I have with this game is that it's so painfully obvious that it's a game made 13 years ago.  It's not a bad game, the look and feel of the Persona series is there and the characters are interesting etc.  But at the same time whenever I played this game, I just wanted to go back and play P5R instead.  Everything is just better in P5R.  The dungeons for example, the difference is night and day.  P5R's dungeons have so much more life to them, and look so much better.  Most of the environments in this game look like dull coloured LEGO sets put together.  It looks like it was originally on a handheld console (despite the remaster).  The other major example is the voice acting.  My god, some of the voice acting in 4G is on par with some of the worst Square Enix efforts.  Audio balancing is terrible as well.  And then there's the subjective stuff.  I personally much prefer P5R's soundtrack over this one, aside from maybe a couple of songs that were cool.  The setting of Tokyo is much more interesting and dynamic than this hokey town in the middle of nowhere.  The characters themselves I found much more engaging in 5R.  This was particularly helped by the quality of voice acting.  I think \n\nI'm glad that people are able to experience this game again on a more available platform.  I think potentially if I had played this back when it was released, I would probably have a different opinion of this game.  If you like Persona games and can look beyond what's dated badly, then the core game is very much the same.  If you were a fan already, this is a quality refresh to the game.  However, if you're like me and experienced the future of this series before playing this, I dont recommend it.  P5R provides the same gameplay but adds so much more.  It's a shame we cannot get that game on Steam instead.",
      "My god.. Capcom did it. They saved the franchise. I'm honestly shocked. \n\nWhen the first teaser dropped I thought for sure this would just be a P.T. copy which I was sort of okay with. Turns out I was wrong. This is a classic Resident Evil game. Like, RE1 classic. Complete with puzzle solving, INVENTORY MANAGEMENT, and tense stressful boss encounters. The game brings back the storage box system even! I can't stress enough how amazing this game is as a long time RE fan. If you're one too, do yourself a favor and pull the trigger on this one. Best game since RE4.... May even be better.",
      "Overall, as a single player game Wargroove 2 is a tremendous improvement over the first game. The campaign is well designed and engaging, the writing is much improved and overall the gameplay is fun. The new roguelike conquest mode is a much more entertaining side thing than the godawful Arcade in 1, as well.\n\nAs a primary single player game, I hated Wargroove 1, and I can say that 2 has turned my opinion around - this game is fun, I finished the campaign and craved more, which is all you can really say! The only thing I really missed from 1 was the Puzzle mode, but maybe it'll show up in a future update? Who knows.\n\nThe major downsides is that the user interface is still the same terrible user interface that WG1 had without significant improvements, and the AI is still absolutely atrocious so playing even Vs maps against the AI is going to be pretty dull, but that hasn't changed from the first game. The soundtrack is not quite as catchy either.\n\nBut unlike WG1, I enjoyed my time with WG2 in spite of these shortcomings, and if you ever have a choice between the two, skip WG1 and just go straight into WG2.",
      "If you played the OG this is basically the same but with a few added side stories you can unlock as you complete different routes in the game. The extra dlc maybe would take you a bit over an hour to complete all of them if you speed through it, but does not have any optional dialogue so it's more of just some lore and extra character interactions. Still pretty solid dlc if you are a fan and want a little bit of extra stuff :)",

      "Very fun game. Best wave shooter on the market that I've ever seen. The roguelike nature of it is very fun. Each run hits you with different challenges in building your weapons.\n\nBiggest critiques - \n1. Achievements locked behind multiplayer in a dead game. God I hate when devs do this. It luckily lets you play through normal mode when queuing, but its still very annoying. The last achievement I needed was \"get to wave 50 of multiplayer gauntlet mode\". I've so far been able to play 2 games of multiplayer. One, my partner had no voice coms. Second, my partner started with extremely staticy voice coms and it cut out at about wave 5. We pushed through to wave 48. Aaaaaaaaaand network error. It took about an hour and a half to get that far just for the game to crash and lose it all. Devs, please stop hiding achievements behind multiplayer when you know full well your game won't have a huge online player base.\n\n2. You get TWO GUN ARMS! This is AMAZING AND AWESOME! Except for the fact that a ton of the attachments for your weapons affect every part on your gun. So by not just making one super mega death arm, you are effectively chopping your total strength into two parts. There are a few pieces that only give you buffs for \"dual wielding\" or having a firing barrel on each arm. But these are not very common, and the stats you get from them pale in comparison to just making a super gun on one arm and keeping the other arm clenched for punching enemies that get up to your face, or putting on a single melee weapon on the other hand for the same purpose. \n\n3. The variety of guns is fun, but in the end it ends up turning into \"hold the fire button, aim for enemies, walk in a circle to trick enemy aim as best as possible, and occasionally punch an enemy that gets to you\". The biggest change to this system is getting either the rocket launcher or the Barrel Barrel which shoots massive barrels at the enemies. They have a very slow fire rate and do best when aiming the shots more precisely. But even then, with some weapons having a spooling time, and others outputting a hale of bullets, the best strategy is to just keep the trigger held 24/7 and strafe your aim from enemy to enemy.\n\nI really enjoyed my time with this game, but don't try to 100% it. The multiplayer achievement isn't worth it. Network is terrible. There's too much going on on screen when you have 2 players in the mix so crashing is likely. If I were the Completionist I would give this game a rating of Finish It. Play through the game with all the unique starting bonuses, all the difficulties. But stay away from multiplayer unless you have a friend to dedicate multiple hours to trying the gauntlet with.",

Which is great for the price.\n\nUpdate: I've put in ~10 more hours to complete the Foundation DLC. It is a good DLC, and brings a few more hours of joy living in this world.

      "WTF, this isn’t gaming! Where are my lootboxes and micro transactions?!\n\nMy main thought after I beat GRIS was, \"I don't really understand anything that just happened, but it sure was pretty.\"\n\nI was absolutely amazed how a game with zero actual dialogue could move me to tears, just on strenght of its visuals and music. In general, the whole theme of dealing with grief/depression spoke to me in a way that I didn't expect.  It's one of those games you play to \"feel\" more than for the gameplay itself.\n\nI have PTSD from dealing with my wife getting a boyfriend, and this game made me cry several times while playing it. Especially during the scene where you're swimming away from the eel. That symbolism to me perfectly captures the feeling of trauma recovery. I'd spent time finding the little lights throughout that section of the game and activating the turtle which ultimately saved me from my own darkness and helplessness.\n\nIt felt like hope. It was such a good representation of how the coping skills I'd learned and the hard work I'd put in were finally seeming to pay off. It's when you're at your weakest that you learn how strong you actually are. I cried like a baby during and after that scene. It made me realize how much I've actually overcome, and how grateful I am to be free.\n\nGris truly is a beautiful game and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a slow paced experience. The only bit of criticism I have for the game is it certainly gives \"not like the other girls\" vibes at times, but I think this is quite easy to get over.\n\nIn conclusion: the visuals are stunning,  the music is beautiful and knows exactly when to kick in, the platforming elements are fantastic, and it’s story and themes are spectacular without a single word. Truly a must-play.\n\n10/10",

Otherwise, I'd be inclined to give it a miss.\n\nFrom a gameplay perspective, there's not really much to hook a new player. There's a long period at the start where you're expected to randomly interact with people, but given no reason why you should do so. The whole socializing and partying thing isn't intuitive unless you're a person who'd normally be into that, and there's little in the game that pushes you in that direction. As a result, progressing as far as the story actually starting is often the result of accident at best. It took me 4 hours of just wandering around, not knowing what I was supposed to be doing or why.\n\nOnce you're able to program there's a bit more direction and less frustration, but you're still not given much reason for doing it until later on.\n\nAll in all, stick around if you're really invested in getting to the programming.

Cool that they wanted to try something different, but I really dont feel like leveling every god damn car in the game just to modify it. If you wanted multiple of same car you would have to level those duplicate cars you purchase. My experience with the physics is just... eh. I mean I sure do love loosing grip just from barely tapping the gas. Constantly fighting my wheel just to stay stable. Driving its probably fine for controller players, I wouldnt on wheel. Credits are only used to buy cars now. Also kinda runs like crap. All i wanted was a Gran Turismo on PC and this... this is not it. Game is mid, move on me thinks.\n\nEdit: I put in a request for a refund and Valve did indeed approve it. I thought I was over the time limit for sure. Don't be me and spend 100 USD for early access.

      "Look, I love Magic. It's my favorite game of all time. I met my wife through MTG. I'll be playing it until the day I die.\n\nBut if you're new to the game, and not established on Arena, don't pick it up. It's horrendously difficult to build a collection in this game, doubly so if you're not a fan of playing draft. While they have made incredibly minor adjustments that have been generally positive, the economy on this platform is impossible to do well in. The sheer number of games you have to play to amass any kind of respectable, and more importantly, functional collection of cards is not worth it for just a casual player.\n\nOf course, you can circumvent the grind with money, but that of course is the literal definition of Pay 2 Win.

      "I love this game. I've clocked over 300 hours in it through Origin (on my ONE character xD ). It's an excellent game, even despite it being an \"open world faffaround simulator\" which was all the rage at the time.\n\nAnd finally on Steam!? Yay! Or yay..?\n\nBut, as we know, we can't have good things. Massive thumb down to the EA Origin \"integration\" in Steam. EA, how about just stop being such massive ducks?\n\nThis is the same \"we hate our customers\" behaviour expressed by d-bags like Ubisoft and Epic. Only that EA sort of makes it worse. They *know* how much people hate the unnecessary and malicious Uplay \"integration\" that Ubisoft have forced on us for several years. Seeing this, EA decides that doing the exact same thing, with their total-garbage Origin client made even worse, is surely the only way to harass the customers enough to be worthy of the EA brand. \n\nDO NOT BUY OR LINK your Steam account if you own the game on Origin from earlier. \nIf you buy a game on Steam, which you already own on Origin, it will overwrite your Origin game.\nIf you then refund the game on Steam, this will remove the game from Origin too (even if you already own it there!), and you'll spend hours in line to get a hold of customer support. Then you must chat with bots, or people who are so void of understanding (and likely not paid near enough to care) that they might as well be bots. And if you're lucky, you might, after going through 4 or 5 different \"agents\", finally get to talk to a person that comprehends English and is authorised to do anything beyond telling you \"they'll discuss it with their team\". Then you might get your game back. \nBut! You won't get back the GOTY. Because the Steam-Orgin-GOTY overwrites your Origin GOTY. And when refunding, via Steam, you're left with a dumb/lame/placeholder copy of the GOTY in your Origin library, which doesn't work, but somehow just lingers there. Then you need to get a Digital Deluxe Edition + all DLC to get back to where you were.\n\nThis [integration] is such a tremendous show of manure, that I'm actually left wondering if EA planned it. Did Andrew Wilson take one of his billions of pocked change and say \"hey, we should make an extra effort here, to make sure that this integration is as frustrating and poorly implemented as possible, but still functional, such that things are barely limping along but just barely, because nothing is as frustrating as something that just barely sorta works but only sorta, and only by the skin of its teeth. That'll teach those entitled peasants.\"\n\nSo yeah. Great game. Bad EA.\n\nUpdate! A new Origin experience: The EA App! An all new website, wrapped inside an all new Electron wrapper!

      "Sitting here at 2 am, gazing at the glowing screen, having just finished Kentucky: Route Zero, I blink and hesitate. I retype this paragraph several times. I push away from the table, stumble into kitchen, pour some bourbon trying not to clink the bottle against the glass. My wife is asleep in the next room and I loathe to disturb her dreams.\n\nI will not insult this game with such banalities as rating or vulgar list of pros and cons. Doing all that would be like rating a poem by word count, very accurate and of absolutely no use to anyone.\nI can only describe Kentucky: Route Zero as a feeling. Shortness of breath, tightness in the chest, a lump in a throat.  A slight vertigo. It's that acceptance that comes after the anger, when you're putting everything in order in preparation. A longing for the good old times that never were and you only imagined them and kept thinking about them until they seemed real. It's coming back to your parents' home for a funeral. It's that sinking feeling you get when you close a book you just finished and the real world reasserts itself. \nI could go on, but what's the point? I'm writing this more for myself than anyone else.\n\nKentucky: Route Zero put a splinter in my heart. It's not big or harmful, but it's there and every once in a while it hurts.",
      "No Man’s Sky is like a guy who owes you $1,000 from 6 years ago coming back with $10,000 to repay you after you thought the money was gone.\n\nI really like this game. I’ve been playing it for years on and off, returning after every major update to see the state of things. No man’s Sky might be a fantastic game now, but you gotta always remember how it all begun. When the game first came out it could best be described to had been as wide as the ocean, but having the depth of a puddle. \n\nThe game has improved so much from when it came out that it is easily one of my favorite space exploration games nowadays. One of the greatest redemption stories in video game history. It’s almost like they used the money they earned from sales  to actually improve the game. \n\nI love the idea of having this massive sandbox shared experience, where coincidentally anybody can stumble upon my little bases I scattered, mines, etc. I also love flying around the stars in my ship, discovering new planets, finding weird animals, plants, geography…\n\nThe sense of adventure and the thrill of finding some new world makes me have so much fun. If you like exploring and just taking your time  doing things, this game is a must, and I highly recommend it. \n\nThe truth is no matter what you think of the game we should all be grateful of what we’ve gotten. If No Man’s Sky was made by EA, all these updates throughout the years would probably have been released as $60 new games each.\n\nI’ll be honest, at this rate and with these devs I have a feeling No Man’s Sky has a better chance of of becoming what Star Citizen strives to be than Star Citizen.\n\nEvery now and then though, whenever I see a game trailer that I really enjoy, I like to remember the state of this game when it first came out and how awful it was. It keeps me in check and helps my expectations stay grounded.\n\n10/10",
      "Absolutely Don't understand all the negative reviews for this game. \n\nFirst off: this game is a RogueLite in that death is permanent, be prepared for this. Death is a part of the game and you are NOT losing progress by dying.. it's death mechanic is very much like Rogue Legacy in that you keep progress that carries on to your next character when you begin again. Dying also isn't like you lost more than 45 minutes of your time. Every single game in this genre will have plenty of deaths involved before you FINALLY get that first win (in most cases). Some people are going to need to spend some time grinding levels, dying and repeat until they have enough sticker slots open to overpower things. Keep that in mind going into it. You retain your level and any big upgrades you acquire when you die so you are NOT starting from scratch every single time like you would in most rogue likes. \n\nI normally wouldn't review a game so early but I saw the negative reviews pouring in and felt I needed to add some counters to it. \n\nThe second thing: the art/music/atmosphere is absolutely brilliant for a game in this genre where most games of this nature tend to be relatively grim. As with most roguelike/lites its procedurally generated so the map, enemies and what have you will be different each time. \n\nThird: the forced timer before you have to fight the boss is a bit jarring at first as i've never played a game of this type where I have limited time to actually get there.. but it's kind of brilliant really because it adds a completely different layer to the game in that you have to manage your time very well. What do you think you have time to do before the inevitable? Do you want to run around and grind exp killing trash mobs? Or do you think that time could be better spent knocking some dungeons out (time halts when in dungeons so take your time in these) and getting some gear and arguably more exp than you would just wandering the map. Also, you absolutely have plenty of time to explore the map as there are shrines (you have to find them but the map isn't huge), that you can pay a special currency to add another day of time to the clock. If you see a review complaining about the timer and they have less than an hour in the game... take that with a grain of salt. \n\nFour: The combat is pretty simple but well done. There is a surprising amount of depth to it as well when you start buying and finding more powerful weapons (toys) that can do a variety of things and synergize pretty well together. Enemy variety is pretty good so far, each time you level up it adds more enemy variety to encounter around the map. \n\nFive: dungeons are fairly simple and a good mix of mini puzzles and fun combat encounters. \n\nIf you enjoy roguelike/lite games DEFINITELY give this a spot in your library to see what it has to offer. So far I'd put it 8-9/10 but I don't quite have the amount of time necessary to feel comfortable ranking it against other rogue games. I may edit this once I get to a point to see how much replayability it has but until then I'm eager to keep sending swords into a meat grinder and just adding to my power each time. Please look at how much time people have in a game before rating their reviews and taking their word. .5 hours is not enough time to really warrant a helpful review... nor is 6 in my case but I really don't want this game to be DoA\n\nEdit: Just beat Mormo for the second time.. trust me when i say you can make the timer go on infinitely. I Don't want to spoil anything BUT head to dungeons and kill as many enemies as you can to save up gold and another currency, and make a good loop around each area of the map and you'll find all sorts of neat things. As for bugs, I've had none and I'm at 13 hours of steady play. Don't waste time killing EVERY enemy that's in the open areas cause that will eat too much of your time, but focus on finding dungeons and the hidden npc encounters. I had my timer extended to approx. 8 days in game time and I also found a way to permanently increase the amount of time I have on subsequent runs. Give it a chance, learn how the game works before being upset about the timer.",

Made by the same people who made rollercoaster tycoon and man did they deliver on this. For me it's the small things in a game that matter and did they really take the time to make sure this was as polished as it could be. Not sure if anyone remembers when they announced another rollercoaster tycoon a while back, and everyone was super excyited to find out what it was, and it ended up being some dumbass phone app? Well imagine all that excyitment, but instead of them coming out with that stupid app they came out with this bad boy. This is exactly what everyone was wishing and hoping for (just different name).

      "9 studios, 3000 people working on the game and this is what we got... Best selling and most advanced COD ever made its debut as a technical disaster. People getting banned for no reason, couldn't able to play the game due to crashes and very bad, laggy servers. And after 2 months from the launch, most of the issues aren't fixed. Just like everything else in the game.\n\nBeen playing the game since launch on Battle.net and this game hasn't got any further. It's just another unfinished AAA game.\n\nSince this game contains Campaign (not included in this review), MP, DMZ and Warzone, this might be a long review. So here is the [b] TL;DR [/b]\n[b] Pros: [/b]\n[list]\n    [*]Gunplay & sounds such as airstrike, guns etc.\n    [*]Weapon tuning\n    [*]Al Mazrah\n    [*]New battle pass and backpack system\n    [*]Proximity chat\n    [*]3rd person modes\n[/list]\n\n[b] Cons: [/b]\n[list]\n    [*]New 3D Audio which is worse than previous game. Leads to inconsistent audio and makes impossible to hear footsteps\n    [*]Movement\n    [*]UI\n    [*]Lots of improvement from Warzone not included in this game such as option to remove or wear gas mask\n    [*]Lots of bugs and issues, unfinished product\n    [*]Animations takes too long if you don't have fast hands. Some gun reloads can be considered as inspecting\n    [*]TTK (Time To Kill)\n    [*]Much worse SBMM than previous game\n    [*]Too many bots in DMZ and their god tier accuracy\n    [*]Bad designed multiplayer maps\n    [*]Big maps in multiplayer but not enough players to fill the map\n    [*]Camper friendly designed maps and gameplay\n    [*]Flashbangs and stuns. If you got flashbanged/stunned, just leave the kbm/controller\n    [*]Not enough contracts in Warzone\n    [*]Not able to create our own perk package\n    [*]Disconnected from Steam\n    [*]The price\n    [*]Infinity Ward's realism obsession\n[/list]\n\n[b] Some bugs/issues the game has/had: [/b]\n[list]\n    [*]Crashing a vehicle into a mountain sometimes causes server to crash\n    [*]Respawning as mortar(a.k.a cluster) strike\n    [*]When enemy used voice chat, people's names that appear on the left side might stay there until you close the game\n    [*]Unregistered hits such as melee\n    [*]Broken anti-cheat that bans people for no reason\n    [*]Unable to move for the rest of the match when you deploy recon drone sometimes\n    [*]Disappearing HUD after using airstrikes\n    [*]Getting 10 kills in a match gets you shadowbanned\n[/list]\n\nAnd the list goes on.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h1] Long Version [/h1]\n\n[h3] Multiplayer [/h3]\n\nKinda fun to play. Game's less buggy mode is either multiplayer nor campaign. But beware, you'll find yourself playing one of the worst designed maps in COD, maybe even in gaming history. And there is the Infinity Ward fetish; big maps but not enough players to fill the map. Vanguard was bad too but in my opinion, they did one thing right which was the matchmaking up to 20v20 in a single map. This game needs the same thing because most of the maps are HUGE.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h3] DMZ [/h3]\n\nThey called DMZ in beta state but they should've called it alpha or pre-alpha. Just a mode where you get in, do some contracts or some faction missions and get out. No economy etc. Nothing exists to keep it alive. Once you finished your faction missions and the 7 weapon cases, you're basically done with this mode.\n\nBots are way too much aggressive, it's not even fun. You get almost no armor if you don't purchase it from the buy and there are bots everywhere, shooting from far away, dealing tons of damage that will knock you out immediately. Beware, if you're skilled player or SBMM decided you're, bots will have higher accuracy. All thanks to SBMM.\n\nThere is also another map you can play which is called Building 21. The idea is really good in my opinion and it changes the whole atmosphere of the game. No mini-map, armored bots (annoying af), limited equipment and mini bosses. There are times where you'll see an enemy from away but you might not think that was the enemy if their skin is black/dark.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h3] Warzone [/h3]\n\nOh boy, Bugzone my beloved. I don't know where to start. First month in a nutshell: launch the game, crash, repeat.\n\nThis game is really [b] 2.0 [/b] because they abandoned everything what made Warzone unique/good and tried something different.\n\nTTK (Time to Kill) and movement what makes Warzone 2.0 not enjoyable. Can you kill fast? Yes. Can you get killed fast? Yes. Seems fair right? But if you're a rusher like me and someone is camping in the corner (which is the 80% of the community, sadly), most of the time you have zero chance to react. You need 3 plates to stay alive otherwise you'll die almost immediately. They need to adjust ttk a bit. I think long range ttk is kinda ok but close and medium, not at all. Akimbo's and Fennec will insta-delete you in close range. RPK, Kastov 762 and TAQ-V are so powerful in medium and long range. If there was a bit movement in this game, it might help you get out some situations, even with this ttk. \n\nYou thought Warzone had bad audio? Wait until you play Warzone 2.0. They managed to create a [b][i] new 3d audio [/i][/b] which is worse than the previous Warzone. You can play this game with no sound without a problem because you're not able to hear any footsteps.\n\nIW obsessed with realism but they forgot we are here to play COD, not something like Tarkov. Animations that takes forever to end etc. If I wanted to play something realistic, I wouldn't be here playing COD. But hey, lets take a look at their [b][i] realism [/i][/b] logic.\n\n[b] IW Realism Logic [/b]\n[list]\n    [*]9mm pistol can kill you with 3 shots while you're fully armored but 50 cal. sniper requires 2 headshots\n    [*]Melee > Bullets\n    [*]Jump out in a vehicle while driving so fast and get no damage\n    [*]Heli dropped 1 meter above the ground explodes\n    [*]Truck going faster than most of the cars\n    [*]You can't armor up/reload the gun while running and not able to fire a single bullet while sliding but, you can run & jump while you're carrying 100 rounds lmg, 50 cal. sniper and 50 rounds smg at the same time\n[/list]\n\nMuch more can be added to the list above. I think IW continue to provide/develop the engine and gunplay but for the love of god, stay the hell out of anything else about gameplay because your decisions made this game less enjoyable.\n\nThis game is pain but I don't know why I'm still playing it. Still, not recommended in its current state.",
      "A fantastic rogue-lite where dying doesn't mean a hard reset. In death your character is succeeded by one of their offspring and all of your earned skills, talents, equipment and gold are passed down from one generation to the next, ensuring that even the weakest of players can still make progress. After each death you are given the choice of three characters that are randomised from a pool of three to eight classes (depending on how many you unlock) who are given randomly drawn traits and abilites; some good, some bad. The castle itself is also randomised keeping the game fresh despite there only being four environments.\n\nAll in all, I found it a thoroughly addictive game despite minimal experience in the genre beforehand and would recommend it to anyone who merely thought \"that looks interesting\" as they skimmed over the Steam store page.",

I'm not going to study guides and waste more time on this game just so I can dig the nuggets of fun out of this wasted youth simulator. I will say that it did a really good job of making me role-play an awkward alcoholic with no job prospects and zero understanding of how to talk to women, living out of a ****** hotel room. But I've already played the real life version of that, so I can't recommend it. If you want to play a fun game about programming, go with Human Resource Machine. If you want a good role-playing game about hackers, go with Shadowrun.

      "Stellaris is the contemporary 4X sci fi galactic empire grand strategy to play.  The spiritual successor to ancient space exploration games like Master of Orion and Star Wars: Rebellion.  Start out with just your homeworld and send out scout ships and colonies until you've got your own star empire. \n\nManage your population, tell them what to build, design your own spaceships and fleet structures, and then get pounded into the dirt by the far too cheaty AI... yeah, it's another one of those games where because it's hard to make the AI smart, Paradox decided instead to just make the AI units cheat and become ridiculously overpowered.\n\nI have to say the game is probably far too difficult even if you set all the difficulty to the easiest levels, it's unclear what the developers were thinking, but you can mod the game easily in Steam Workshop to make it viable to play single player. \n\nAs with all Paradox games the DLC pricing is murder, and it adds very little to the core game experience, so my advice is to grab this on sale if you were a fan of MOO, go straight to Steam Workshop and mod it until it's playable, and then you'll have a perfect time sink well worth your money.",
      "For those of you still harbouring hesitations about \"walking simulators\"...here's one I'd definitely recommend you try.\n\n   So yes, it's quite linear, and no, it probably doesn't have an enormous amount of replayability. It's also quite short - about two to three hours - so I guess it's not that cheap at twenty buckaroonies. It is, however, one of the strongest examples of interactive storytelling you will ever enjoy, and an oddly varied experience given the bits of the game in which you briefly get to play the roles of cats, owls, and...well, I don't want to give too much away. Let's just say Tim Burton would be jealous (seeing what a boring old hack he's become these days).\n\n   For anyone who loves a good story in a game, with a willingness to sacrifice a bit of agency in order to have that superior narrative experience...it's a bit of a no-brainer. As for the rest of you, well: you only live once. And they do say variety is the spice of life. So if you only try one walking simulator before dismissing the entire genre, this could well be the one. Truly magical, wonderful stuff. And a bit of a tear-jerker at times, too.\n\nVerdict: 9.5/10.\n\n(PS Anyone claiming there is no \"gameplay\" in this title is either a drooling idiot, or hasn't played the game in its entirety.

      "[b]Note: This review won't be about the game or the story itself really- it's the same trilogy we fell in love with. Rather, this review is to primarily focus on the changes between the original games and the Legendary Edition.[/b]\n\n[h1][u]Graphics:[/u][/h1]\nThe most obvious changes are the graphics, and wow does it stand out. In all three games, especially in Mass Effect 3 did it look very polished, detailed, and rendered beautifully. The lighting as well as the scenery stood out, more visually than before and the special effects as well as the atmosphere ... all in 4k. Characters also look polished and not as ugly anymore, though the models in Mass Effect 1 definitely aren't going to look as good as those in ME 2 & 3.\n\n[h1][u]Photo Mode:[/u][/h1]\nSurprisingly something we didn't ask for, but was much needed. Now it's very easy to pause the game whenever (even during combat) and just zoom in, rotate the camera, change filters, adjust the brightness or blur out the background to make the characters focused, ect. The amount of screenshots and pictures I took is insane, and a very welcome edition to this game. Trust me, go to Discord or Reddit devoted to Mass Effect, and the amount of pictures is staggering.\n\n[h1][u]Controller Support:[/u][/h1]\nUnlike the previous games on PC, they did not come with Controller Support. You would of had to install a program online or do specific steps in getting it to work with your controller, and even then it was a pain. Now you can just use an Xbox One controller or a PC controller without issue. As someone who grew up playing on console, this was a must have for me to enjoy the game more.\n\n[h1][u]Changes:[/u][/h1]\nWhile I didn't think they would do it, a number of things (appearances, design, events, ect) have been changed. I came across a few things they changed for the better, and one in particular is a spoiler in ME 3, but it was so good to see them change (involves Tali). The biggest changes are likely in ME 1, with environment changes and how the layout looks, along with the fact combat is more smooth and balanced in ME 1 now. In ME 2 & 3, it's unchanged for the most part, but the interface as well as quality of life improvements are there.\n\n[h1][u]Problems:[/u][/h1]\nI won't lie, despite I loved playing Legendary Edition, there was numerous problems I came across. One major issue stemmed from collision. In ME 1, 2, and 3, sometimes Shepard will find himself going over terrain or passing over into a wall, only to get stuck and nothing will fix that unless you restart a save or the mission itself. Another issue is the flare being incredibly bright at times, even toning it down to it's lowest, the flare and 'shine' of things can be blinding. Sometimes lip syncing is a bit off (ME 1 and ME 3 had a few instances of this) and followers not popping in at times. There is also no multiplayer which was a massive let down. I loved the multiplayer in ME 3, being able to play any race was so incredible and the wave of enemies per round was exciting to survive in with my friends. I wish they included it.\n\nMy biggest issue with all 3 games was the AI. At times, the enemy AI can be dumb to auto bot levels depending on the circumstances. I played on Insanity and ME 2 had every enemy become an auto bot, always aiming for me in a split second with 100% perfect accuracy and never aiming for anyone else, even walking PAST my allies to shoot me. Then you have my AI squadmates being very broken or dumb, depending on again, the circumstances. In ME 1, they were so useless it was painful. In ME 2, they were alright but had some dumb moments. In ME 3, they could carry me and I would look at my phone as they did all the work (if you build them right). Balance and AI are a big problem in Legendary, and I hope they improve AI for everyone's sanity.\n\n[h1][u]Worth It?[/u][/h1]\nTruth be told, if you want to relive the trilogy and have an excuse, I say go for it. The price is reasonable despite a lot of people want the game cheaper or free if they own the original games already. But if you think about it, all 3 games ($20 each) plus every DLC released are free in Legendary Edition. But apart from that, despite I did very much enjoy playing this trilogy all over again, the changes aren't that big in scope. Mostly just better graphics, better framerate, adjustments in combat and adding a few changes to scenes / design of things. If you're a huge fan like me and don't mind, then yea it is worth. But if you aren't that impressed with the perks of Legendary Edition, you aren't missing out on too much. Legendary Edition is like the old trilogy but in nicer paint, polished, and got some upgrades. But even with that said, this was such a treat and I enjoyed every moment, even with the stacked cons. Amazing series overall, a must have whether it's the older games or Legendary Edition.",

I went and looked at the store page, My Brother/Friend Ethan-Winters Just Told Me this game in the steam store now, so went ahead and bought it. After buying it, went and started up the game some day later. Went into the game, saw another model character that looks like mine, I thought it was an AI because I had thought it was a single player game. So I decided to play along with it, we went through the story, it progressed quite fast, mainly because we both did not really bother to check out other things. The more I played, the more I realized that the guy I was playing with was most definitely not an AI, it was a genuine player. As we went through the story, our cooperation got smoother, we no longer have a solo player attitude, we would signal to each other, wait for each other and walked, fly with each other. It was smoothing, relaxing, a truly unique experience. Even with the setbacks we had throughout our progression, we never gave up, we stuck together from the desert till the end, when one of us screwed up, we patiently waited for the other, chiming to the person where we are. I remember at the end, when i screwed up a jump and did not see the other player, I was genuinely scared, sad, I frantically searched for the person but to no avail. I was distraught, sad and disappointed but I continued onward. When I went up, there he was, chiming for me, assuring me that he had not left yet. I felt happy, comforted when I saw the person waiting for me and together we finished the story. I am not one to do reviews, but it was such a unique experience among my years of gaming that I had to share it. Thank you, punks for the experience, truly thank you. And thank you, for bothering to read my review.\n\ni'll never forget our journey kind stranger.\n\nThis wasn't a game, it was an experience. I highly recommend you do this.",

I like games like Portal 2, The Talos Principle, and there is no point to compare this games, because they are completly different, even if they have few common things like solving riddles and story with fresh look at some philosophical questions. Point is that every one of them including The Swapper is good at what it do, and every one of them is unique. For me it is pleasure to play this game beacause of it atmospheric well done design, riddles and questioning the meaning of existence.",
      "New edit: The developers have made the steam workshop available, but as an Oceanic user I don't have direct access to the workshop and I can't upload mods. It seems to be only available to Chinese modders, much like the previous 3rd party software. The problem appears to be covered up and not solved.\n\nEdit: Modding capability is now available. The devs are using a 3rd part chinese workshop that we all hate (thanks devs), however you can use Nexus Mods instead. Simply go to the Tale of Immortal nexus page and download any mod, then add it into the local mod section provided in the mod category. Then you're good to go.\n\nBe aware that currently, from what I've seen, the IDs mods use are generated at mod creation and multiple mods have a chance of ID conflict (breaking the mod/s). So if you have problems this may be the reason.\n\n\nOfficial English translation is available. The devs have mentioned 90% is translated, but I believe it won't impact gameplay. Players who haven't launched the game before will be switched to English automatically.\n\nIf you have launched the game before you will have to do the following: in the main menu select 语言 and change 简体中文 to English (Alpha) and restart the game.\n\nFor my review: Having played the game, I can say it's both good and bad. It failed to meet my expectations but I still enjoyed the game and will recommend it. The art is fantastic. The combat is fun but lacking compared to other action & slash titles (there is a lot they could do with it). Quests aren't very clear and their incentives are bad making it hard to get invested. You don't get anything really unique or interesting from quests as far as I've played.\n\nProgression is the most disappointing part of the game. It's a mix of crafting, gathering and looting to acquire items that will either enable you to advance or give you a stronger stat-boost when you do advance. Every realm does the same thing, only requiring different items at the new area/s that open up for that realm. This is a shame. Progression is the area that has the most potential in this game and yet is the most tacked on part, mostly an afterthought.\n\nThe developers could've made each realm advancement unique, with different gameplay mechanics for each one that ties into the unique aspects of the area/realm they're in. This would be a fantastic way to give a sense of freshness to each area the player explores and make them engage more actively in said area rather than rushing through it as we do now.\n\nProgression could've been the strongest part of this game but they ended up making it the weakest. Again, it's a shame. I see so much potential that just isn't capitilised on. Overall this is an experience I'd recommend. But I'd only play it once in its current state.",
      "[h1]Prelude[/h1]\n\nWorld's Dawn is relaxing/life simulation game. While it's inspired by Harvest Moon series (probably FoMT, BtN or other's  before 2004), farming isn't the core gameplay of this game. It's developed since 2010 with RPG Maker VX, so personally i wouldn't compare this game with other game which have higher price or far bigger development budget.\n\n\n[h1]Story/Character[/h1]\n\nThe main story of World's Dawn is similar with Harvest Moon series before 2004. You move to a village with goal saving the the village. To progress the main story, basically you need to do 5 things such as farming, friendship & romance. While the main story isn't outstanding, it's better than i expected for Life/Farming Sim game.\n\nSugar Blossom Village has fair amount of lore & festival. There are few interesting secrets waiting to be discovered with OKish reward. The festivals are very fun & enjoyable, it's unique experience that i don't get on many Life/Farming Sim game. There are 4-5 festivals on each season to keep you engaged, although 2 of them are market festival.\n\nThere are 24 characters in this game, with 8 more as you progress the story. Each character are unique with decent writing. Each of them has decent amount of conversation lines for many occasion (take a walk with your dog, after marriage proposal, before/after festival, about new villagers, etc.). It's best part of World's Dawn, although i hardly can remember their name.\n\n\n[h1]Visual/Audio[/h1]\n\nEach character has lovely art style. I like it since doesn't lean too much towards cutesy/anime artstyle which is common on today's Farming Sim game. Most marriage candidate also have 4 different portraits depending on the season, which is nice addition.\n\nThe general visual of the game feels dull though, even considering it's RPGMaker game. It fares better during Winter & some festival though. Each season also looks quite different, so it's far more than simple reskin. Animal need better sprite/animation though.\n\nThe soundtrack is decent & it doesn't feel boring hearing it many times. Each seasons & some area have it's own soundtrack, although it's something you'd expect from Farming Sim game. The audio effect/SFX is only average though. On a side note, i also wish each marriage candidate has a bit more voice acting.\n\n\n[h1]General gameplay[/h1]\n\nWorld's Dawn core gameplay isn't farming, there are so many things you could do (fishing, mining, social interaction, etc.). I'd say World's Dawn is a bit of everything. The game offer little progression though, so the gameplay feel stale after 2 seasons. Combining that & linear story, this game has no replayability value.\n\nThe control is easy to learn, although little awkward. But due to limitation of RPG Maker engine, you can't rebind any action. While there are 2 free hotkey for item, you only can bind shovel & watering can. It makes barn work rough.\n\nI also experience few bugs. None of those are game breaking, but could annoy you. Here are few that i could remember,\n> Few achievement not unlocked on Steam\n> Some items sometimes not shown on inventory if you spam button up/down/enter/back\n> 99 maximum item quantity, where additional item you obtained simply gone. I proved it by through item shipping & cooking\n\n\n[h1]Game mechanics[/h1]\n\nThis section review each game mechanics in more detail. Here's rough meaning of sign that i use in this section,\n> (+) Positive, neat game mechanics or i like the game mechanics\n> (*) Neutral, average, acceptable or what i expect from Life Sim/Farming Sim game\n> (-) Negative, poor game mechanic or i hate the game mechanic\n\n[b]Energy[/b]. (*) First of all, running deplete your energy. (-) At beginning of game, you only have small energy capacity  so you can't do all tasks. There are many ways to replenish your energy in this game. (-) Consuming food/beverage is rather useless/costly, (*) while resting on bench is fine option only when you have time to spare. (+) But hot spring restore 100% energy which only took 20 minutes (once per day). (+) It's really powerful mechanic after energy capacity is increased. (*) You can use Eden Fruit to permanently increase your energy, (+) where you can obtain all of them within first 2 seasons.\n\n[b]Farming[/b]. Just like most Farming Sim game, there are 4 seasons with different crops for each seasons. (*) Your farmland is limited to 40 tiles & possible upgrade only give 12 additional tiles. (*) There are only 3 crops for each season, excluding Wheat which can be planted on any season. (*) Initially your watering can only can water 1 tile at a time, but later you can get upgrade which water 3x3 tile. (+) The upgrade could be obtained with small amount of coin & watering few hundred tiles which could be obtained quickly.\n\n[b]Animal[/b]. (*) You can have 5 types of animal: Chicken, Cow, Horse, Dog & Cat. (*) For first 3 animal, there's nothing much to do besides feed, interact, brush and bring them outside. (+) You just need to ring bell to bring all livestock inside/outside though, which is convenient. (+) Dog is quite helpful, you can send him on errand & bark on spot which contain an item. (*) The cat only act cute though.\n\n[b]Fishing[/b]. (+) While fishing is also good way to earn coin, (-) it has really poor mechanic/balance. (*) It takes an hour to fish, where you only can get one fish with initial tool (Fishing Rod). (-) After you upgrade your Fishing Rod into Landing Net, the mini game isn't changed where you must hook one fish at a time. (-) Finally, you need to spend 20 hours to get 1st upgrade & 70 hours to get 2nd upgrade. I really don't like this since each upgrade let you catch larger variety of fish.\n\n[b]Mining[/b]. It's quite simple, you destroy stone, get raw gemstones & refine it to jewels. The cave only has 5 depth where lower depth has better drop rate/quality. (+) It's really powerful way to earn coin, especially after pickaxe upgrade & increase maximum energy. (*) RNG is involved to determine which raw gemstones & jewel you get. (*) But since 2 process use RNG, there's small possibility you're very lucky & vice versa.\n\n[b]Cooking[/b]. Basically i find it's unwelcoming. (-) You could miss chance to buy 3 out of 4 cooking utensils from TV program. (-) The next chance is either next year or festival on Fall/Winter. (*) Finding recipe also take some time, coin, effort or trial-and-error (only for mixture). (-) Many recipes (excluding mixture) need lots of ingredients where some of them only available on certain season, where i barely cook anything until Fall.\n\n[b]Social interaction[/b]. (*) Giving item is fastest way to increase villager favorability. (+) The good thing is the game has manual which list what each character likes, although you need to find out their favorite item by yourself. (+) You also can talk to them, join certain festival & take part time jobs to increase their favorability.\n\n[b]Other[/b].\n> (+) There's TV in your house which gives some useful information, (*) although you only can see tomorrow weather forecast from 6 PM onward\n> (*) To see list of festival, you need to buy calendar or see someone's else at their home\n> (*) There's no portable map, so you have to remember village environment or going to sign which show village map\n> (+) Clothing has some impact on gameplay, (*) although the description is somehow confusing\n> (*) LockBall control is somehow awkward & locking mechanic is confusing, (+) although it's fun for me\n> (+) Event-specific mini games is short, but fun while it's lasted\n> (*) Foraging is just average, but has decent importance on this game\n> (+) No tedious item management, everything is stored on your knapsack\n\n\n[h1]Closure[/h1]\n\nWhile i have some criticism on the gameplay, the story & character are best part of World's Dawn. I find this game very fun for first 2.5 seasons & quite fun for later 1.5 seasons. If you're looking for relaxing game with good character/story & unpunishing gameplay, you'll like this game.\n\nP.S. **** 8K char limit!",

      "UPDATE: This remains to be one of the best games I have ever played. The company that created the game though... One more launcher that is completely unnecessary.

Many of the things I struggled with have been already fixed and there is no need to disclose them. \n\nAll in all, one of the best games in the last few years (even a decade).",
      "To be completely honest, throughout my entire playthrough, I was thinking on giving this game a \"Not Recommended\" but it really wouldn't have deserved it. This game is at the same time both very difficult to recommend as to not recommend. It is really a beatiful and extremely original game, with a pretty well told interesting story. However, the problem it has is that it doesn't really work as a puzzle game. Puzzle solutions don't make logical sense most of the time and you end up brute forcing your way through most of the game. This means trying every posibility until something works and moves the story foward, and this is just not good puzzle design. This also distracts you from the story being told, which is in itself not so easy to understand, it requirers you to be paying attention to details, so your brain has to be constantly switching between \"puzzle mode\" and \"story mode\". Anyway, you can tell a lot of love was put into this game, and that is why I ultimately recommend it.\n7.5/10-",

      "Let's get this straight real quick, if you are brand new to this game and want to buy it, it can be anywhere from a 1-3 star game in your eyes. The game is full of a bunch of glitches, bugs, and somewhat odd mechanics. When starting off, you may find yourself absolutely hating the game, as some of the things that happen are fairly adgetating. Once you have put in some time to figure out some of the major flaws, and how to avoid or fix them, this game is one of the best out there by far. You can do just about anything in this game, from PVP to roleplay. People you meet on this game will most likely be from your worst nightmares, but alot of the time you can meet people that you will know forever. Ever since my first day, I still play with friends that I made on day 1. However, do not trust anyone off the bat. The game can be extremely relaxing and laid back, if you play it that way and avoid the toxic or sweaty players. But if you want some major action, you can jump into a heavily populated PVP server and battle for hours. Personally, I give the game 5/5 now that I have learned how to prevent and fix a lot of the possibly game-ruining glitches and bugs. There is so much to do and learn in this game that I find it very hard to get bored of it. From the people, to the gameplay, this game will test your guts. Do not buy this game if you are expecting something perfect, but if you work around the rough points, you will play this game forever. It is one of the most immersive games ever made, and you will find yourself literally playing until you can't. I don't remember the last time I got off of DayZ and started playing another game, rather than getting off completely.\n\nA few hours later...\nIn love...",
      "This is less of a review and more of me gushing about how much im enjoying myself, but you can still get a idea of what the game is from it. I am not usually a puzzle game player, or even a \"chill\" game player. im usually all about quick shooters, fighters, and platformers, but i decided to give this game a shot and i am very glad i did. with a mechanic as simple as pushing trees i thought that it would be simple enough for me to have a good time, the last time i played a puzzle game was BaBa is You and i put 14 hours into it and never got past word 3, it was just too much for me. but this game manages to still be challenging even with it laying all the pieces out in front of me, it introduces new features not by putting one in a level and saying good luck, it makes you do something you have done before but gives a new outcome, because you never got to do that thing in that exact way before, and when puzzles start requiring you to do those things you wonder how you ever got that far without doing one of those things before. all of the mechanics and solutions also are based in logic, all your doing is pushing things, so you dont have to suspend your current understanding of things to learn a new mechanic. The world of the game is also very relaxing and sucks me right in, its a museum of the \"past\" of humans that takes place in the far future from the perspective of monsters who dont really understand human culture, and it is hilarious! the music is very chill and moves with your actions, when you push something in a specific way the music also does a specific things, and its part of the reason this game is so relaxing. most other puzzle games i have played frustrate me when i get stuck on a puzzle for a long time, but seeing the monster relax helps me relax and keep a level head to get to the next museum exhibit. i dont know how to end this review but if you read it i hope you dont feel like i wasted your time!",
      "I'm going to write an honest review for this game since A LOT of people seem to be very biased.\n\nThis is not a perfect game. No 2K basketball game will ever be a perfect game. Does that mean this game is bad? No. Should you hold off on the game for now? Probably.\n\nLet's start with the positives:\n\n- A lot of people seem to gloss over the fact that 2K rehauled a lot of mechanics for this game. Shot meters feel more legitimate, this game is MUCH much more realistic (fouls, shot tendencies, etc...) This game is better and more fluid to control, and the gameplay reflects each players' ratings (defense, shots, etc...) much more accurately.\n\n- Online play seems to be better and more fluid. I've yet to encounter any latency issues online with quick play and the such.\n\n- MyCareer is MUCH better than last years. There is no cheesy story and the cutscenes feel much more integrated into the game. Orange Juice and dynamic duos are a great idea in general. The UI for MyCareer (and the game in general) is so much cleaner and more functional.\n\n- The game is visually beautiful, not much else to say on the matter.\n\nNow, the cons:\n\n- Help defense is broken. It's quite ridiculous that 2K hasn't fixes this lingering issue in such a long time but it's still there. This is a BIG issue in MyCareer and not quite as bad in other modes since you can manually control players.\n\n- Stat allocation is broken. This is a huge issue in MyCareer and has deterred me from playing the mode any more until 2K fixes this issue. Introducing the idea of stats that can only be raised in practice is actually quite a neat idea. However, these boosts are not permanent, even though 2K has stated they are. This is detrimental and demoralizing and discourages players from playing the game more. Limit caps are ridiculously strict as well. 2K NEEDS to fix these issues ASAP.\n\n- Numerous glitches.\n\n- 2K introduced broken mechanics along with the good mechanics. Ankle breakers are now pathetically easy to pull off (using Stephen Curry behind the back moves is a surefire way to have your defender fall). Moving screens are now a thing. \n\nI would hold off on buying this game until 2K patches it. There are just too many issues with the game that prevent it from being a playable game. I like this game. I really do. That's why I'm hoping 2K listens to the community and starts working on the issues at hand immediately.",
      "Playing this game for the first time six years after its initial release proved to be a delight in disguise.

      "[i]While the artwork and combat remain enjoyable, the story, writing, and pacing were a major letdown.[/i]  \n\n***\nMINOR SPOILERS BELOW. If you're going to play the game, play before reading.\n***\n\n[b]The mature storylines, hard-hitting decisions, beautiful worldbuilding, and tight writing that made the first two so immersive is not present in this game.[/b] (You'll notice immediately that the writing for the caravan in the capital is [i]particular[/i] trite, awkward to read, and uninteresting.)\n\nUnfortunately, it's not just the writing that's weak. [i]The pacing is off.[/i] Antecedents are confusing, characters you'd expect to speak don't, events that should have been foreshadowed come out of nowhere. More frustrating are the serious character continuity \"errors,\" and arcs that disappear, change, or go nowhere. [i]In short, the events, decisions, and conflict from the previous games do not appear or resolve in a way that was suggested by the previous two[/i].\n\n\nHere's one example. In Banner Saga 2, Fosolt is unexpectedly rescued by Bolverk. [i]\"I have a message for Alette from the dead varl king,\" [/i]he said. That's pretty intriuging! Maybe there's a mystery, an oracle, an item, or just cool information about the Varl and their strange king? Maybe there'll finally be context about the bridge decision!\n\n[i]No! He has nothing interesting to say or add, and then his storyline just gets dropped and forgotten.[/i]\n\nWell, Bolverk's been possessed by Bellower! Gosh, who knows what Bellower will say? In fact, I can't wait to find out what happens to Bellower's body! \n\nWell, actually, Bolver's [i]not[/i] possessed, not really, certainly not like it was implied last game, and Bellower's body -- [i]a primary focus of the first two games[/i] -- isn't mentioned [i]once[/i]\n\nOr how about how they casually mention that Eyvyn is not only the [i]head[/i] of the Valka order, but also that he's had periodic bursts of hereditary madness all along? That's... odd. And it's not presented as an well-thought out [i]reveal[/i] or anything. It's presented matter-of-factly, like they were trying to ret-con in a less interesting story, or were tone deaf.\n\nYou'll notice that all the characters are underutilized and have unfulfilled storylines/tensions. Hakon has hard choices to make; Canary's a little crazy; Yrsa is mysterious; Gil's in love with Alette, etc. Will these build into choices? Reveals? Dependent endings based on choices? Will there be discussions referencing the past? Reflections on travels? Hints of despair?\n\nNo. In mine, Gil was [i]murdered[/i] and no one even bothered to reference it. Canary's situation never comes to a head. You never have to choose between Varls and Humans. Murdering people doesn't make people threaten to leave. Ubin returns randomly as an uber Varl and he's... learned the horseborne's language? Travelled the southlands? In like, a month? In a way that doesn't advance the plot? It's just... weakly done.\n\n\nThere are [i]so many[/i] examples like this, where the stories don't quite fit correctly, where what you picked up on in the early games about the [i]mysteries[/i] and the [i]world[/i] and what made it a [i]vibrant[/i] place were forgotten about by the writers. [b]The result is that it the game plays out in unsatisfying ways, in tenseless scenarios made vapid by watered-down morality, an inability to leverage the situation in fun ways, and low-quality writing, paucity of choice-making, a lack of exploration, lack of plot twists, simplified overworld mechanics -- all culminating in an almost staggeringly one-dimensional and shallow ending.[/b]\n\nThe Banner Saga series was always an experience that was greater than the sum of its part. An [i]experience[/i]. Of being [i]riveted[/i] to the computer, checking the map, worrying over supplies, guessing at mysteries, having my breath taken away at each hill. Unfortunately, that's not the case in this game. \n\n\nGameplay-wise, it's also a bit of a letdown. Combat is fun-ish, but you can make invincible character combinations and the mechanics don't even try to deal with this. There's an interesting new reinforcement mechanic that's not used heavily, and never pushes you like you think the end of the world would. You never really have to split up your forces. There's no novelty. Like maybe using a hero in a battle makes them fatigued, so you have to switch them up? Maybe you can station them different places, making them unusable for combat? Maybe you need to choose eight for a secret mission caravan? Maybe dream sequences? No, nothing like that. \n\nThe overworld gameplay had some changes that never really felt significant. Moreover, quite a bit felt taken away. You can't rest, do training missions, no longer weigh food vs upgrades. One example of all thise tone deafness was Iver's march through the destroyed world was consistently at \"Great Morale!\"\n\nThere didn't seem to be many flavor choices (\"Do we hang the criminals or let them join us?\"), including much less on social themes (\"Should women fight, if it disturbs the traditionally-minded men?\" \"One clan's rowdy, what do we do?\" \"They threaten to leave if so and so isn't banished\"), and less delayed results and fewer significant decisions, including among the game's built-up tensions among the factions. \n\n\nThere's also some cases of development [i]feeling[/i] cheap. Remember opening Banner Saga 2, and feeling that it was [i]fresh[/i], and [i]upgraded[/i]? There's little to make you feel that way here. The artwork is okay, but the environments feel more generic, with less variety, and the surreal landscapes in the darkness aren't especially interesting to look at for long periods of time. Iver is voiced by Bolverk's voice actor, and they sound exactly the same. The new title system is a fun idea, but is visually integrated into the game's menu system with the finesse of a cheap mod. \n\nThere's a moment in the game where the screen goes black for scrolling text and voiceover narration explaining the upcoming mechanic. Um, a character can't explain that? It was similar how the many two second animations are used, not to supplement the story, but to [i]replace[/i] written portions, making you feel unsure about what's going on. And finally, the game's pretty short, without fun combat challenges or interesting newgame+ challenges. \n\n\nWhat's [i]particularly[/i] frustrating is that the game's release date was moved forward four months. I don't know the story why, but I do know that a few more months of polish and story embellishment might have delivered the beautiful, grippingly interactive story we were hoping for. Because this is a watered down version of the previous two in just about every way.\n\nThis negative review is for whatever processes lead to this mediocre finale.\n\n---\n\n[i]Here's a plot that would have made more sense. Zephyr arrives and speaks to you secretly. There's a god that's still alive! Neat, now we'll finally get more story on that. Yay, fun caravan mode, now we need to take longships somewhere interesting!\n\nBut uh-oh! There's a Sundr villain going there as well, with an army of dredge! But at least now we'll finally get more story about the Sundr! \n\nThe god reveals something interesting, talks about Juno, the sun, gives a means to protect the city and help Iver. But when you return to the city, now the king and rugga and the factions have devolved into fighting based on your choices. How are you going to handle this? Which of many possibilities will ascend to the throne? How will you defend the city? And what mystery lies beneath the mountain of the city...\n\nFor Iver's caravan, there should be pockets of dredge villages kept alive by Spellsingers. Now you need to decide to plunder them or not! More stuff to do! Maybe go to the remains of the Varl capital first? Fight warped Valka? Realize deceptions, machinations, corruption, hear stories? Find new characters, have old ones die?\n\nInstead there... wasn't a plot?[/i]",
      "Early Access Review:\nPros: \n- Hilarious flavor text in the form of Books and Proverbs. Seriously, someone took a lot of time creating all that.\n- Really enjoyable music\n- Beautiful pixel art\n- Engaging and interesting story\n- Overall very fun introduction to a huge world\n- Highly responsive dev team that's not only advacing on completion of the game but actively listens to their already large community of players\n- There's a lot of secrets and things to do that you might run out of time to do before the end of the year deadline. You may find yourself needing to play the early access a few times to find everything.\n\nCons:\n- This is early access folks, there's going to be a few bugs here and there\n- The early access content ramps up really fast and gets very interesting and then ends with you really wanting to know what's next.

I like that certain map changes and Story decisions are dependant on some side quests and on each other.\n\nNow to the sad part:\n\nTencent recently bought Techland which was controversial at first, but then DL points were added which made a lot of people mad at Tencent and partially Techland, understandably.\nThey Including me don't want the game to die out because a greedy company wants to make some quick buck.\n\nAlthough i have to say myself, other Tencent bought games still are quite enjoyable.\n\nI just hope that Techland does the right thing in future and makes the current state of DL points less predatory and more Cosmetic based pure.\n\nIn it current state we still have no knifes without Bundles, but that was before Tencent so the blame for that goes to Techland, but i am excited for future updates and playing Dying light 2, even without buying DL points :)\n\nI'll give this game a solid 7/10 for the bugs, microtransactions but also because it has good gameplay and community reach\n\n(I have edited my original negative review about the pure rant about DL points because i also wanted to consider current gameplay and more)",
      "Great game for the most part.\nI do not like how they made a rpg with twitch aspects though.\nMy characters are supposed to be strong and agile not me on the keyboard.\nDo not expect to beat the island master(2nd ending) unless your very agile with your fingers.\nAt 50 years old it is impossible to get him down past 3/4 health.\nToo much twich and not enough character skill.\nGames like might and magic you never had to be agile with the keyboard.\nGuess this one goes under my \"Ending too hard category\"",

      "Basic game, extremely well done. Like going home and eating your mom's food after decades on the road.\n\nEditing the review to mention some of the flaws of the game:\n- the level design in general is not that great, with every tiny room requiring some mindlessly easy puzzle to be solved first. Eventually it just feels like a chore.\n- not sure if it's something with my steam deck, but I had to put both the game's and the screen's brightness to the max to be able to see things; before that I was constantly missing objects and having trouble with moving around because some soil path looked like a hole in the ground or something.\n- while the game is 2d, there's a lot of different layers of height and depth that get mixed in together and may be hard to tell apart. You often don't know if some platform can be climbed onto or jumped out of until you try to do it.\n- battle system gets repetitive after a while.\n\nDespite those problems, the game is still great and more than make up for those things in other areas.",
      "[h1] DiRT4 a review and comparison with DiRT Rally [/h1]\n\nAfter 100 hours in Dirt Rally and another 40 in Dirt 4 I feel like I am finally able to give a good comparison of both games while also reviewing Dirt 4. This review will be comprised of 5 categories of which \"Handling and Realism\" is the most important for me at least.\n\n[u] Handling and Realism [/u]\nIt is immediately clear that Dirt 4 is less focused than Dirt Rallye being a sequel to Dirt 3 rather than Dirt Rally but this does not mean Dirt 4 is less realistic than Dirt Rally.\nOn the contrary cars have more weight and are not as floaty as in Dirt Rally. There is no more pogo jumping over bumps and driving techniques like lifting/breaking before jumps are actually useful. In general weight transfer is much better in Dirt 4 than in Dirt Rally lockups are more present than in Dirt Rally encouraging good driving and on-throttle braking. \nGrip levels are quite high in places probably because of the added car weight at least on gravel stages. On tarmac Dirt 4 is way better than Dirt Rally still not very good since there is no tire flex but cars do not seem to drive on rails grip is significantly lowered compared to Dirt Rally and cars are more lively.\nThe real issue Dirt 4 seems to have is on-throttle traction. In general cars have to much traction especially when driving RWD cars on-throttle oversteer is not as progressive as you would expect on a gravel road and traction breaks very sudden thus playing with the gas is not as effective in creating oversteer as it should be making RWD cars quite boring and stale compared to AWD and FWD cars. Weather does not affect handling too much on gravel and tarmac which is a bit of a shame since it seems like there are tools in place for simulating aquaplaning. On snow weather has no affect on handling whatsoever. While both games have deforming snow banks in Sweden leaning still does not really work since the snow banks in both games just feel like guard rails with some padding attached to them more deformation would be better. Damage models are great and internal damage seems to occur more often than in Dirt Rally but the damage model is far from realistic and just not punishing enough a hardcore mode would be very much appriciated since all the necessary tools seem to be in place.\nFFB hasn't much changed since Dirt Rally it still requres a lot of tweaking and is missing many effects and settings other sims like iRacing, Assetto Corsa and RaceRoom have.\nNonetheless Dirt 4 has a more realistic driving experience than Dirt Rallye. \n\n[u] Tracks [/u]\nCodemasters has put a lot of effort into highlighting the procedural track generation tool of Dirt 4. While it is an intriguing idea to have countless tracks and endless content the execution lacks variety. It seems as if the tool is combining certain premade sections procedually. The issue could be fixed if codemasters creates  [b] many [/b] more sections the algorithm can choose from. Also a track editor where users could make their own track sections and tracks would help mitigate repetition and prolong the games lifecycle. Also rally stages are quite short compared to their real life counterparts which can exceed 40km more than twice the length of Dirt 4's longest stages. Codemasters is keen to make Rally stages longer but claims that the Ego engine cant handle stages longer than ~18km. Still repetition is way smaller than in Dirt Rally which has maybe 20 hours worth of original content. The selection of locations is limited due to licensing but diverse enough. Rallycross has more tracks and is more fleshed out than in Dirt Rally while retaining the official FIA branding and Landrush is a nice addition to the game while not necessarily needed.\n\n[u] Cars [/u]\nThe car selection lacks a bit. While most of the really important rallye cars are in the game some classes like WRC are missing completely due to licensing issues making R5 the fastest available class in the game for rallying. Rallyecross on the other hand has all cars you can really wish for since Codemasters hold the license for the FIA World Rallycross Championship.\n\n[u] Graphics [/u]\nOverall the graphics haven't improved much since Dirt Rally. While lighting and effects have improved the overall looks of the game are hindered by the quite repetitive stages. Also variation is very big while sometimes really beautiful e.g. a stage after some rain Dirt 4 can come across really stale looking. Still the game does not look bad the engine just needs a  refresh. \n\n[u] Sound [/u]\nLike the graphics Dirt 4's sound didn't really improve since Dirt Rally. Sounds are generally informative but not much more also Dirt 4 has some layering issues and you probably need some adjusting to get a good mix. The co-driver is really good considering the tracks are procedually generated but bad camber call-outs would be appreciated. Really nothing bad but nothing special either.\n\n[u] In Conclusion [/u]\nWhile Dirt 4 may not be a perfect game in any sense, it improves upon Dirt Rally and still delivers a good challange. Many of the general directions are IMHO correct. Going to procedually generated stages is the way to go in the future but still needs a lot improvement and polish to really become what it is intended to be. Also a better damage system and further evolution of the handling would be much appreciated but still the basics are done right so if you were on the fence buying this game give it a try.",

      "Edit: ARCANE HALLOWS REVIEW (Written Feb. 19 2021)\n\nRoguelike Enthusiast's Caveat: The player's progression is directed in a much longer scale over multiple playthroughs due to the nonlinear nature of exploration unlike Hades or Skul. There is also a higher focus on evading stage hazards than said roguelites, with more control in how you start your run than needing to worry about coordinating a build throughout.\n\nNew Player's Verdict: The most recent large update for the game now makes the game well worth the price. Overall changes to the game makes the early-game far more approachable and increased the player's survivability all around while easing power progression.\n\nNew Resolve system for making powerups far less punishing is great. They added features to reroll power up selections as they add more, same with being able to rerolling character selection now that they added (two more very fun and powerful) new classes. The Skeleton Key, one such new randomized power up, addressed my issues with Fairy Chests which are a major source of character progression. \n\nEvery class offers such a unique playstyle while also having great power in their own right (though right now I feel the weakest classes are Ranger and Mage)\n\nNow if we could be able to rechallenge bosses we've beaten that would put me over the moon\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW (Written Feb. 4 2021)\n\nAbridged Verdict: Wait for Arcane Hallows Update (Feb. 18 2021) before purchasing for total content volume that matches RL1 along with additional QoL changes\n\nThe latest update as of writing this review (Far Shores) added 2 whole new areas, I bought EA awhile back but didn't really play much until this update, as the amount of content in the game effectively tripled between the areas, new classes, and QoL additions.\n\nGame is more accessible than RL1 for sure, but seems harder to get into than Hades, especially for people not used to roguelites. Namely, its far more punishing and harder to recover from mistakes.\n\nThings I love: The whimsical charm, the much more varied aesthetics of biomes as well as each biome having unique structures (Axis Mundi being a long hallway that makes it more akin to a Classicvania stage is genius). Classes having much more unique and pronounced playstyles adds much replayability. Boss mechanics and designs are much more complex this time around and the way they test your mastery of heirlooms is excellent. The new Armor System as a separate way to reinforce HP and the Mastery system to get steady stat increases go a long way to helping player progression. I'm seriously hooked on the gameplay loop in a way that I wasn't with RL1, every class is so much fun, and I'm so looking forward to the next update!\n\nMy Gripes: Runes are a total gamechanger that can make your life so much easier. Unfortunately the Fairy Chests that contain them are randomly spawned, and as a new player whether you can actually find and survive to one is a steep uphill road, and sometimes they just aren't possible without a specific class. The execution required for some challenges will be extremely difficult for more casual players and thus their ability to progress overall will be greatly hampered without the likes of things such as a soulsteal rune to recover HP. If there's an algorithm that sorts relative difficulty of Fairy Chest rooms, I would like if there were a way to increase the likelihood of creating Fairy Chest rooms if the player hasn't found any, and gradually make them more accessible until the player finds one. Additionally I would like if every Fairy Chest contained runes until you find them all in a biome, as I've gotten hordes of Gemstones from Fairy Chests before getting another rune or rune upgrade\n\nRelics. I'm looking forward to the Resolve system update because as of now, the hits to max HP are incredibly devastating, especially if you don't find a room that can give you the nectar to increase your max HP again (and even then its a huge gamble since you take a lot of damage from it). Most of them don't really feel worth the tradeoff as of right now, unless you find the War Drum to continually increase damage. If we can get a vendor to \"rent\" one (1) relic among a selection of ones we found for a certain amount of gold or something, similar to heirs that start with a relic without losing max HP would add a certain level of accessibility without removing the randomness aspect of roguelikes\n\nWhile all enemy attacks are technically possible to evade, this isn't always the case when you have certain combinations of enemies (Frostens and Aqua Braces in a room with a floor thats all spikes is so mean ; A;). Sometimes you'll spawn into a room next to a Warg that will immediately headbutt you before you can react and suddenly you take 70 damage. I would appreciate if certain enemies were stationary upon entering a room so you have time to process and react accordingly.\n\nEnemy damage scales extremely fast as you move through the map, along with their attacks becoming more frantic or complex, without means to restore HP and Armor through the specific runes, most classes' having lower max HP get real squishy.\n\nOne of the Duelist class's main attraction is that their talent gives them invulnerability windows with a roll, but it can't always be used of you're in a tight position without much room to move. I hope that they add a small invul window to the Dash heirloom, with runes to increase that window, but make it much smaller than the Duelist's (say 1/5th the time of whatever the window is of Duelist's talent)\n\nAnyways, despite my misgivings with the game I listed here, the game is really fun and a lot more accessible and varied than the original game, wait for it to go on sale and pick it up!",
      "Don't play this game. \n\nWhen you realise you almost completed it and the 112% is approaching, you start to think \"What the fuck am I going to play after this?\".\n\nThe lore is incredible.\nThe gameplay is so hard sometimes, but extremely satisfying. \nThe bosses are super hard, yet super fun.\nThe OST is insane.\n\nIf you never played Hollow Knight and you are about to begin your journey in Hallownest, bapanada to you.\nYou're very lucky and I am very jealous.",
      "I've played a fair amount of games during my time using Steam.\n\nI've never felt as emotionally moved by one as I have with OneShot.\n\nI don't know if anyone reading this has played Transistor, but if you are familiar with and enjoyed that game, continue reading for a little context. (I'm going to put it in spoilers because it contains an integral part of how the game functions, which is likely better for you to experience on your own, rather than learn about it from a third party. Be warned!)\n[spoiler]\nTransistor and OneShot are very different games, but both of them share a similarity in that they have been the most emotionally moving games I've played in my entire life. They both have a huge emphasis on characters, both the one you play as and the ones you interact with or are around you. They also both have brilliantly-developed environments, The combination of these two things is one of the major factors in why I've gotten so immersed in them previously.\n\nHowever, OneShot affected me notably more strongly and for much longer than Transistor, and that is for a very discernable reason. In Transistor, you experience the stories of the characters. When it all ends, you're still a third party, experiencing things through the \"eyes\" of the protagonist.\n\nOneShot, on the other hand, features *you* as basically an integral part of the story. Because of this slight difference (which may seem negligible or gimmicky at first), OneShot basically destroyed me emotionally by the end - not necessarily because of how it ended, but that it ended at all. It wasn't just story of some other charismatic protagonists that came to a close.\n\nIt was mine, and with it, my connection to everything that happened in the game.\n\nIt's really hard to put into words... but I really wanted to put this somewhere, in hopes that someone understands and agrees. :D\n[/spoiler]\n\nAnyways, random game comparison tangent over. It's a phenomenal game - easily one of tmy favorite games of all time, my only complaint being that it ended. Extremely solid 10/10.\n\nIf you enjoy story-driven adventures like Transistor, Undertale, Night in the Woods, etc., this is basically a must-buy.\n",

I played MC on and off for over ten years and generally, you get over that sense of impending danger, and bases built with teamwork don't feel that fulfilling. \n\nValheim fixes all that.

Both games are very good.\n- OBJECTION, YOUR HONOR!\n\nHow can it be a hate crime if my client loved doing it?\n- [h1]Dishonored 2.[/h1]\n[i]If old Samuel could see me now...[/i]\n\n[b][u]Introduction[/u][/b]\nAt its core, Dishonored 2 is little more than a mechanically and narratively contiguous continuation of the Dishonored formula. This isn't a bad thing - the first Dishonored was one of the best stealth-action games of all time - but innovation is too often overlooked in the games industry. DH2 does bring some nuance to the franchise, but new drawbacks are packaged in as well. Put plainly, Dishonored 2 is a game I adore just as much as the original, but there are aspects that certainly left me wishing for better.\n\n[b][u]Plot[/u][/b]\nThe game begins 15 years following Empress Jessamine's assassination, and her daughter, Empress Emily Kaldwin, has ruled the isles since that time. Her father and Lord Protector, Corvo Attano, advises and keeps close watch over her at court. Quickly after Dishonored 2's opening however, the Duke of Serkonos, Luca Abele, comes to Emily's royal tower - bearing a gift. He brings Emily's supposed long lost aunt, Delilah Kaldwin, who then immediately stages a coup in a bid to take the throne. She is successful, and you must escape the city of Dunwall as either Emily or Corvo (more on that later). You then travel to Karnaca, the capital of Serkonos, where you begin a personal crusade to [i]take back what's yours.[/i]\n\n[b][u]Technical Revamp[/u][/b]\nShifting focus for a look at DH2's presentation, the game is gorgeous. There's a hint of the old, comic-book-like aesthetic that was present in the original game, but the graphical fidelity has been greatly improved in this sequel. The textures, lighting, animations, visual effects, and environments are all elegantly rendered. It's easily one of the most beautiful games of 2016. As for the audio; sound effects and voices are realistic, and the OST is as iconic, if not more so than the first game's. Although, when it comes to performance, Dishonored 2 clearly falters. DH2 was a technical mess on launch, and while it runs decently now; some bugs, stutters, and crashes still persist. Overall the presentation is good, but the performance is surely sub-par.\n\n[b][u]Setting & Exploration[/u][/b]\nAs stated earlier, Dishonored 2 is set in Serkonos's city of Karnaca; known as The Jewel of the South. Gone are the dark grays and subdued browns of Dunwall, as Karnaca replaces them with bright, pastel blues and yellows. The metropolis has distinct cultural differences from Dunwall as well, whether it's the widespread use of wind-power over whale oil, or Karnaca's reliance on silver mining to employ its working class. In terms of level design, DH2's stages are much more expansive than anything seen in the first game too. There's lots to explore in every district of Karnaca, especially when verticality and hidden locations are taken into account. There's several routes toward all objectives as well; emphasizing Arkane's \"play your way\" motto. All considered, Dishonored 2's game world is exceedingly well-built.\n\n[b][u]Depth in the Details[/u][/b]\nOne of the most effective ways DH2 differentiates itself from its predecessors is through what I'd call 'structural gimmicks.' To break up the standard pacing, a couple of the game's missions have special set-pieces which can completely turn gameplay convention on its head. An example of this is the 'Clockwork Mansion' on the fourth level. This inventor's home has levers in essentially every chamber that reconfigures a room's layout - such as turning a trophy room into a grand hall. These levers can be used to access new areas or evade enemies, and even reveal traversable spaces behind the walls. It's this degree of imaginative design depth that distinguishes Dishonored 2 from most other games in its genre.\n\n[b][u]Stealth & Combat[/u][/b]\nMoving over to the core gameplay loop, not much has changed from the first game. The stealth and combat are still just as exquisitely implemented as before, with only a couple of refinements. The deviations that come to mind are that drop-assassinations can now be used non-lethally as drop-knockouts, and assassination animations are a much more brutal (but cathartic) spectacle to watch than before. Dishonored 2's central mechanics are near flawless to be sure, but this sequel suffers by adding few new gameplay elements to the mix. Except - well - there is one big feature I've neglected to elaborate on as of yet.\n\n[b][u]Emily [i]or[/i] Corvo[/u][/b]\nIn Dishonored 2, you can play as either Emily Kaldwin, [i]or[/i] Corvo Attano. When Delilah first takes the throne you get a moment to choose one or the other, after which the character you don't pick is turned into a cold, stone statue. Both Emily and Corvo have separate voice actors and personalities, but they share the same goal throughout the game's duration: to save the last of their family, and reclaim the throne for the true Kaldwin heiress. After receiving the mark of The Outsider, Emily and Corvo have different magical abilities too. Where Corvo has blink, Emily has far reach; or where Corvo can stop time, Emily can chain together the lives of her enemies, and kill or incapacitate several people at once. All in all, the decision to allow the player to progress the campaign as either Emily or Corvo was a stroke of brilliance in my estimation.\n\n[b][u]Main Story[/u][/b]\nReturning to the main story - it's another point of criticism for me. There are some magnificent aspects; such as the nostalgic callbacks to events in the first Dishonored or reappearances of some of the original game's best characters, but all considered most of the writing is retreading a beaten path. Just as in Dishonored 1, the game flows from mission to mission where the chief objective is simply to eliminate a key player obstructing your path to the throne. This is perfectly fine from a gameplay perspective, but it can lead to a bit of déjà vu from a narrative outlook. Dishonored 2's writing quality isn't poor, but it doesn't distance itself from the comfortable story-staging of its predecessor, making it feel slightly lazy.\n\n[b][u]A Reactive World[/u][/b]\nOn the other side of the same coin, the narrative reactivity of Dishonored 2's world to your choices is truly admirable. Playing DH2 in high chaos; where you murder many people throughout the game, results in huge environmental storytelling changes compared to low chaos. Here's an example. If you flood the streets of Karnaca red with blood, subsequent levels show you've harmed the city's inhabitants before you even arrive. Citizens’ moods and perceptions will have soured as they become depressed or monstrous in the wake of their crumbling city - causing suicides and murders to spike throughout Karnaca. And corpses bring bloodflies, which further tarnishes The Jewel of the South in a vicious cycle. You can, of course, avoid all this... by showing a whole lot of care in your actions toward others.\n\n[b][u]Conclusion[/u][/b]\nWhen all is said and done, the Dishonored formula is a fantastic one that it's hard to not have fun with. Karnaca is riddled with environmental detail, the stealth mechanics are flawless, combat is devilishly enjoyable, and the game judges you intelligently on your choices. The Dishonored IP is incredibly strong... The tweaks provided are appreciable; I just wish DH2 had made a concerted effort to make it even stronger. But, god-dammit, I enjoyed Dishonored 2 way too much over it's 20+ hour campaign to critique it any longer. Get the game and play it - despite all my pissy complaints, you won't be disappointed.\n\n[h1]Personal Rating: 9/10 - Absolutely Outstanding[/h1]\n- I've played a fair amount of games during my time using Steam.\n\nI've never felt as emotionally moved by one as I have with OneShot.\n\nI don't know if anyone reading this has played Transistor, but if you are familiar with and enjoyed that game, continue reading for a little context. (I'm going to put it in spoilers because it contains an integral part of how the game functions, which is likely better for you to experience on your own, rather than learn about it from a third party. Be warned!)\n[spoiler]\nTransistor and OneShot are very different games, but both of them share a similarity in that they have been the most emotionally moving games I've played in my entire life. They both have a huge emphasis on characters, both the one you play as and the ones you interact with or are around you. They also both have brilliantly-developed environments, The combination of these two things is one of the major factors in why I've gotten so immersed in them previously.\n\nHowever, OneShot affected me notably more strongly and for much longer than Transistor, and that is for a very discernable reason. In Transistor, you experience the stories of the characters. When it all ends, you're still a third party, experiencing things through the \"eyes\" of the protagonist.\n\nOneShot, on the other hand, features *you* as basically an integral part of the story. Because of this slight difference (which may seem negligible or gimmicky at first), OneShot basically destroyed me emotionally by the end - not necessarily because of how it ended, but that it ended at all. It wasn't just story of some other charismatic protagonists that came to a close.\n\nIt was mine, and with it, my connection to everything that happened in the game.\n\nIt's really hard to put into words... but I really wanted to put this somewhere, in hopes that someone understands and agrees. :D\n[/spoiler]\n\nAnyways, random game comparison tangent over. It's a phenomenal game - easily one of tmy favorite games of all time, my only complaint being that it ended. Extremely solid 10/10.\n\nIf you enjoy story-driven adventures like Transistor, Undertale, Night in the Woods, etc., this is basically a must-buy.\n\n- This game surprised me in how good it was. I had heard about it, like everyone, and also like a lot of people I had dismissed it as a watered-down Dark Souls clone with a Star Wars skin, and let it collect dust in my Steam collection.\n\nI was wrong. The game's combat is tight and polished, just the right difficulty on Normal. The movement, the general game feel, is superb. The game has a competent story with excellent characterizations, character arcs, dialogue, exposition, world-building, and pacing.  The music feels like top-shelf Star Wars without being a lazy copypasta of John Williams's score (though you'll hear sprinklings of familiar motifs throughout, of course). \n\nThere are collectibles (they are all cosmetics), but it's a tasteful, reasonable amount of them, and they are distributed in a way that feels fun instead of like a chore, and you're never pressured into collecting them with menus or reminders; they are entirely optional in both a technical and a psychological sense. I actually found it fun to collect new appearances in order to play dress-up \"Fashion Souls\". \n\nThere are bosses, and they are challenging but not frustrating. Definitely easier than Dark Souls's harder bosses like Ornstein or Artorias, but still tricky enough that it feels rewarding to overcome them.\n\nIf I had to describe this game in two words, it would be \"just right\". There is just the right amount of each little element that it feels fun, never tedious, never like a grind. I'm a jaded old man who has seen it all and who is not easy to entertain, and I found this game extremely refreshing. If you read this review during the sale where it's only 3.99 USD, get it immediately.\n- [h2] Visual Novel Reviews [/h2]\n\n[b] TLDR [/b] Two scenes, no customization, no choices, character development needs work, but the Extremely short story delivered (If you know what I mean) a whopping 38 minutes of game play for me. \n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [th]Question[/th]\n        [th]Answer[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Buy Again[/td]\n        [td]No, I wouldn't.

This is the second game that this developer has released, so I am not disappointed that I spent 5$ dollars on a game that they created, but I will say that I will think Long and Hard (No Pun Intended) before purchasing another game from this studio.\n- G.A.R.B.A.G.E\n\nuhm idk man, it was but it just isn't, you know? because I don't know??? lots of bugs, cinematics are rushed, game is rigged, friends cheat... FUCKS THIS SHIET\n- As i previously stated, i was going to play through metro fully and i have done so, so here is my update to this review. \nThis game is not the best selling triple A game in the world and it may have some bugs (like a table that wasnt solid or the objects in that room lol) however it is a decent game. the story is decent and the characters voices are way off but they sorta make up for it with their personalities. \n\nExploration in this game is by far one of the most interesting in my opinion and the way your character acts in the enviroment makes it more interesting aswell, for example wiping your visor when it gets dirty (wasnt that helpful for me in my play through but it was a nice touch) and your visor taking damage in combat adds to the immersive feel of this wasteland/paradise almost. Scavenging weapons and parts and combining them to make better equipment is quite intriguing and quick to do if you can find the parts. \n\nat the end of the day my final review of this is its a good game i would play it again even if it is a bit clunky sometimes (atleast it was for me lmao)\n\n\n\n\n\nOh and hopefully my punctuation is good enough so no one passes out this time lmao\n- good sales pitch for a game. i guess that's the point of being a kickstarter-based video game. everything related to specifically your character and the character action related feels fantastic and looks great and i feel like it scratches an itch no other game really does, and the environments and your animations look great. and yet you're seeing this on a negative review.\n\n-the progression involved with exploring unreality until you stumble onto where you think you should go is miserable. it looks like a mega man x4 level had a bad trip, headache inducing and aimless. the process of finding a lot of secrets is either the trite \"you have a movement powerup, backtrack here and move up there\" sorta deal, or invisible wall shit that i've never been a fan of without decent tells (which admittedly the game sometimes does!)\n\n-combat almost entirely takes place in closed off arenas (not necessarily a bad thing, this game draws heavy inspiration from DMC which does similar) and with the same cast of like 10~ enemies. poise is a chore, even after trivializing the process with the time bomb and the grounded down charge attack, and particular enemies like the guy with the red sword and the caped man are incredibly annoying. there are 2 different instances of an enemy either doing a short version or annoyingly long version of an attack with 0 tell. A lot of the combat is trivial on hard, don't know about\n\n-bosses are a mixed bag. some of them you can loop poise breaks. some of them 2 or 3 tap you. the last one does the latter, makes you slog through a nintendo-ass hands and face boss before you are put up against bootleg senator armstrong with an unskippable cutscene and no checkpoint after the boring phase 1. huge waste of time.\n\n-too many levels just feel empty and lifeless. just a pleasant looking floral jog from arena to arena, felt like nothing and left no impression. \n\n-the movement feels like it has the potential to be insane. there's a million options that all can really push how much distance you can get, and there's a learning curve with how you sequence them all, and there's an entirely separate learning curve with pulse fly though that mechanic feels mostly untapped. \n\n-for a game with a speedrun timer and that kind of carpal tunnel inducing movement, it's really weird that there's not a \"reset to checkpoint\" button or any way to fast travel back to the airship. feels INCREDIBLY bad when you're lost and checking every nook and cranny for where to go next, or when you've ran yourself out of pulse meter when trying to pulse fly in locations that aren't littered with the blue pulse bulbs. special shoutouts to the pyramid, you can screw up especially when trying to do it early and the run is completely dead, but you have to just sit there and wait while you scroll through twitter or whatever. \n\n-music and voice acting quality was all over the place. i'm not more than a hobbyist but a lot of the voices sound like they were recorded on a variety of audio hardware, run through audacity w/ noise reduction and normalization, and tossed in. it's an indie game so please don't take this as the worst critique in the world, i'm sure the VAs were all fellow hobbyists/amateurs and there's literally nothing wrong with that, but a good handful of the yells, insults, and grunts were doing NOTHING for me. some of the music just sounds like penis music, i can't think of a better term. there were definitely a few great tunes on the atmospheric end of things but overall some of them, in particular 2 or 3 boss themes, just kinda sucked. also the segues between combat and atmospheric music was not executed well at all for several areas.\n\n-the fog level in particular had a lot of stuttering especially during combat. not looking forward to the braindead \"works fine on my machine\" type of people, but i'm on a ryzen 9 3900x, a 5900XT sapphire pulse, and 32 GB of 3600mhz ram. I'm pretty sure a machine with a tenth of the power should be able to run a gamemaker studio 2 game, it's on the switch and that thing's basically a leapfrog.\n\ni really wanted to like this game but like i said at the start, it feels like a sales pitch (albiet a great one) with everything not related to the selling point feeling tacked on. I hope this dev learns more about level design in particular and keeps making more games, because this game really does feel like it's designed to appeal to me w/ the mix of genres and the list of inspirations this game seems to wear on its sleeve.\n\ntldr the angled dash memory doesn't let you wavedash, and ur left in a crappy sticky sliding animation when you try. 1/10 can't believe i played this game\n\n- Graphics of Quake, atmosphere of Blood, brutality of Doom, some weapons of Hexen/Heretic, drunkenness and trashiness of Redneck Rampage, and some weird quirkiness from Half-Life  = GOTY\n- Early review right now after a quick hour of play.\n\nLater Alligator (and I swear I'm not biased towards this game at all) is a gorgeously 2d-animated, primarily point-and-click, cartoony romp through Alligator New York City. Everyone's alligators. The gameplay itself is simplistic; unlike normal point-and-click games of this style that you might have come to expect, there's no picking up items, there's no real big decision making. It crosses over more with Professor Layton-style gameplay, wandering around the city and picking up little collectibles by clicking on various pieces of the environment.\n\nScattered in between these are a plentiful trove of minigames in all sorts of styles. As far as I can tell, they begin to increase in complexity the further you go through (for reference, the first minigame is pretty much not fail-able; you're asked to track a Queen in 3 Card Monte, however the hapless alligator running the game barely moves the cards and flails on the two that *aren't* the queen.)\n\nHowever, it seems that the gameplay and the minigames are meant more as a vehicle for the whimsical comedy of the writing and the eclectic cast of characters present throughout the city. Each character is quirky and fun in their own way, with their own little story. And that's the real draw of this game. \n\nSo this game so far doesn't particularly lend itself to anyone looking to challenge themselves. But if you just want some good feelings, a laugh, and a spot of relaxation, Later Alligator delivers in spades.\n- Ahh, CrossCode.\nLet's start this review with what this game does right.\n\nPros:\nEverything. There review is complete. But on a serious note I'll elaborate.\n\nThis game starts out very generically. You got an amnesia stricken heroine. You got fairly archetypal characters. The story is the typical trying to figure out your past. But it's not. I lied about all that, that only covers the first 10-15 hours then you see drastic changes in the pace and tone. The story turns out to be well done, not the best, but enjoyable. 8/10 for story and characters.\n\nLet's talk about gameplay. It's perfect, seriously. The pacing of combat is fairly quick. There's a decent variety of enemy types which nearly all of them have some sort of unique trait. Your skill set leaves you with a lot of variety and different tools to take on different situations. I have yet to get bored of it, despite the fact combat isn't inherently profitable for most of the game. Puzzles. You have timing puzzles, logic puzzles, memory puzzles, enemy based puzzles. It's all there. It's all enjoyable. They're quite varied, no two puzzles feel the same. This game has over 200 'maps'. And just about every 'map' has a puzzle or two (optional or not). Ez 10/10.\n\nArt design. I'm a sucker for 16 and 32 bit graphics. The level designer, this guy made the game. He created some beautiful and interconnected maps with nearly everything having purpose. In all honesty, I have never seen design quality this high, it even beats out SquareSoft games (you know before they became that crappy company that is SE). 10/10 again.\n\nCharacter design. It works. Not the best. Not bad. The characters look the way they should. Lukas' nose drives me crazy, it's huge. But Holiday Man is solid. 7/10.\n\nMusic. Some of it's great. Some of it annoyed ME (but I'm picky). They stayed true to what they were trying to make. But it's obvious their composer was no Yasunori Mitsuda. But still, what I enjoyed, I really enjoyed. 8/10.\n\nDid I enjoy it? Every single minute of it. Even when I was confused. \"I WILL figure this puzzle out.\" 35/40, based off my personal taste, but CrossCode is as damn near perfect as you can get.\n- Don't play this game. \n\nWhen you realise you almost completed it and the 112% is approaching, you start to think \"What the fuck am I going to play after this?\".\n\nThe lore is incredible.\nThe gameplay is so hard sometimes, but extremely satisfying. \nThe bosses are super hard, yet super fun.\nThe OST is insane.\n\nIf you never played Hollow Knight and you are about to begin your journey in Hallownest, bapanada to you.\nYou're very lucky and I am very jealous.\n- If you are into space opera, transhumanism, cyperpunk-esque narratives, you're going to have a great time with this one. Even with my rampant ADHD, this game has kept my focus for a lot longer than most games. \n\nThe music is banging and the story is rich and diverse with a lot of awesome twists and turns. \n\nGo and grab your chits and buy some drugs.\n- I knew Journey is a great game,maybe one of the best video games in history,but...\n\nI didn't know why so many people moved by such a simple gameplay.\nI didn't know why people had a Journey-Fever,even players just bought PS3 only for this game.\nI didn't know how close a relationship could be in 100mins only.\nI didn't know how bad i wished to go back to the peak and stay with my friend i'll never meet again.\n\nNow I Know.\n\n“It is better to walk with a friend in the dark than alone in the light” – Helen Keller\n\nIt was an interesting experience for me, I had never played this game nor heard of it until recently. I went and looked at the store page, My Brother/Friend Ethan-Winters Just Told Me this game in the steam store now, so went ahead and bought it. After buying it, went and started up the game some day later. Went into the game, saw another model character that looks like mine, I thought it was an AI because I had thought it was a single player game. So I decided to play along with it, we went through the story, it progressed quite fast, mainly because we both did not really bother to check out other things. The more I played, the more I realized that the guy I was playing with was most definitely not an AI, it was a genuine player. As we went through the story, our cooperation got smoother, we no longer have a solo player attitude, we would signal to each other, wait for each other and walked, fly with each other. It was smoothing, relaxing, a truly unique experience. Even with the setbacks we had throughout our progression, we never gave up, we stuck together from the desert till the end, when one of us screwed up, we patiently waited for the other, chiming to the person where we are. I remember at the end, when i screwed up a jump and did not see the other player, I was genuinely scared, sad, I frantically searched for the person but to no avail. I was distraught, sad and disappointed but I continued onward. When I went up, there he was, chiming for me, assuring me that he had not left yet. I felt happy, comforted when I saw the person waiting for me and together we finished the story. I am not one to do reviews, but it was such a unique experience among my years of gaming that I had to share it. Thank you, punks for the experience, truly thank you. And thank you, for bothering to read my review.\n\ni'll never forget our journey kind stranger.\n\nThis wasn't a game, it was an experience. I highly recommend you do this.\n- The fact that this VN used to be the highest rated game that hasn't been released outside Japan until, well, it was released outside Japan says it all. A must-buy position for every VN enthusiast and an insteresting position for any other player. Criminally underplayed (~55% of purchased copies haven't been started yet), true hidden gem. Consider buying it when on sale.\n- The playtime I have on Steam is nowhere close to the amount of time I've put into this game on Xbox.\n\nWhen I first heard of Tetris Effect back in 2018, I was so mesmerized by the visuals the game had. Everything looked amazing, and I really wanted to try and play it. Shame I didn't have a PS4.\n\nThe game had a multiplayer release on Xbox, and when I first heard about it, I bought a copy instantly, finally ready to experience the game on PC.\n\nI'm not exaggerating when I say that buying this game actually changed my life.\nWhen I bought this game I not only got to play one of my favorite games in a completely unique experience, but I managed to find an amazing community to boot. Since then, I've accomplished so much in the game, befriended lots of people, and managed to change several aspects of myself.\n\nThis game has been a perfect mixture of visual, auditory, and emotional presentation, and it's given me tons of inspiration for multiple projects.\n\nIf you're shrugging this game off as \"just Tetris\", please take a look at a playthrough. Calling this game \"just Tetris\" is a massive injustice to the creativity, effort, love, and time that the development team have put into this.\n\nI have been following this game for nearly a year now. I wouldn't have it any other way.\n- Bullet hell? Check.\nAwesome animations? Check.\nBoss fights? Check.\nSongs from favorite artists? Check.\nParty mode? Check.\nMultiplayer/online mode? Check.\nBest physics? Check.\nOk that list is good... for now\n- !!!!READ TO THE BOTTOM OR SCROLL!!!!\n       !!!!69 FREE PACKS + MORE CARDS AND COSMETICS CODES!!\n                        \n I did this for the NEW community:)         \n !!MAKE SURE TO UPVOTE AND OR AWARD SO EVERYONE NEW CAN SEE!!\n\ni have played almost all the MTG online iterations, MTG 2012 2013 2014, DUEL, MTGO, Magic the Gathering Online \nTactics, and now Arena. \nMTG 2012-2014 were fun but they were limited to the cards released those years\nMagic the Gathering Online was cool, you could trade and sell cards, do actual cube and draft with bought packs, but the interface was dated even after the update..\nMagic duels was sold to us as the end all, going forward no new program just duels and they would add sets as they released..(It wasn't, they didn't)\n\nMTG Arena (this one) has done everything they said and they did not abandon it after a few years.

MULTIPLAYER SKYRIM LETS GO\" - In short don't do that. This isn't going to be like playing Skyrim, Oblivion, Morrowind. \n\nIt is when it all comes down to the core an MMO, it's set in Tamriel, it sounds like Tamriel and the storylines feel like an Elder Scrolls game. However being an MMO, it has a lot of grindy MMO style quests. And don't get me wrong, it's bewildering at first, all these mechanics, all these places to go....and before the 'One Tamriel' update if you chose the wrong faction, you were screwed, in a place all on your own surrounded by all these people who are WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY higher level than you. But thankfully they changed all of that. The game scales now, so you can rock up to a dungeon with your level V300 mate, and still have some fun slicing up enemies.\n\nSo I saw a friend playing the other day, and spent a few hours installing this to join him (By the way its like 70 Gig...If you have slow internet prepare for a few days of download), I got back on it after not playing for 14 months, but this time I was playing with a friend who was already Veteran Level 250, So I was in luck, he introduced me to everything and I got used to all the deconstructing of equipment to get my blacksmithing up, showed me about dungeons and bascially got me to enjoy the grind. I think my previous time was a bit lackluster because I got dropped in the middle of the Aldmeri Dominion on my own, without any of my friends. So I left.\n\nNow I know what I'm doing, and keep in mind I usually hate MMO's never played WoW or anything like that, this is the first one. I'm enjoying myself, I'm triple digits into this game time-wise and I don't see it stopping now. We've made a guild for noobies. To help them out, and get them to enjoy the game also. Because the community is nice...but you still get the elitist fucks from any competitive game kicking you out of dungeons because you're only level 14. But you won't get that when you're in a guild, having people to play with and explain all the mechanics did help, a lot. I've even gone as far as to buy this AGAIN on steam just to collect my hours and so on.\n\nAdd-ons are awesome being able to mod basic features of the game to help with information and quality of life improvements is a must. I'll provide an essential mods pack if any of you wish to know.\n\nFor those of you who actually got this far into this, well done. I didn't think I'd keep you captivated long enough to get to the end.\n\nIf any of you are new to the game, on EU server and would like to join a guild to show you the way, add me or visit our [url=www.godsofsalt.com]website[/url] and join us on teamspeak, or just message us in game @diseasedcrow.\n\nBut all in all if you like Elder Scrolls and you think you want to try this, just do, I'm glad I gave it a second chance.\n- - - READ IF USING 2K / 1440P RESOLUTION - -\n\nGoing to Fullscreen within the game seems to screw everything up at 1440p, but not 1080p.\n\nTo get around this edit the ini file:\n\nAspectRatio=1\nDispFull=1\nDispX=32\nDispY=32\nDispW=2560\nDispH=1440\nAngle=0\nVsync=0\n\nIf you can rotate your 2K monitor, set it to 150%.

Once there you are presented with a database of footage from a 1990s, where you must piece together what happened.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\nWithout spoiling anything, since this game is all story based, you are revisiting video clips of seven separate interviews trying to piece together what exactly happened. When you start off, you are placed in front the pc with the word “murder” already typed in. With this simple word, you are given, you must, delve deeper into the story, and form your own conclusion as to what happened, but the more you go deeper into the mystery, the more confused you may become; perhaps even discarding your previous assumption many times before coming to a conclusion that does not go against her story.    \n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nThis game is not a conventional game in terms of gameplay. Instead, you are watching videos and finding potential terms that could lead you to more videos which will reveal more as to her past and what, and who was involved in this incident. Some might not like this, so if the idea of an exclusively story based game does not appeal, do not bother. It is an interesting concept, and very captivating if you play it without any distractions, perhaps more interesting if you play it with a friend and try to piece the mystery together (much like I did).\n\n[h1]Verdict: 8.5/10[/h1]\n\nIf you enjoyed this review, or found it helpful, please feel free to follow our curator [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/WeLoveKawaiiNekos#curation]here.[/url]\n- [h1]Diary: Dandara: Trails of Fear Edition[/h1]\n\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\n\n[table]\n[tr][td][b]Gameplay[/b][/td][td]Quick Gameplay, Interesting Movement Mechanics, Projectile based weapon, helping characters unlocks more paths[/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][b]Story[/b][/td][td]Interesting main story, fun side characters[/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][b]Graphics[/b][/td][td]Nice 2D pixel art[/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][b]Sound[/b][/td][td]Main Menu has nice sound effects, jumping from surface to surface sounds great[/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][b]Controls[/b][/td][td]Great controls, no need to remapping[/td][/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[table]\n[tr][td][h2]Day 1 - 3/23/2020[/h2][/td][/tr]\n[tr][td]I started up this game, not expecting much, and man oh man was I surprised. This game has fascinating gameplay, being able to jump from one surface of salt to another so smoothly and quickly. It makes the game different from others, because the movement and how you go around the map is so different. \n\nThe checkpoint system was a little odd to me. Your progress is still \"saved\" when you trigger a mechanic, it's just that the flag sets your spawn location. So there is no need to fret if you die after doing something important.\n\nI also got to use the stat system a lot today, and man, it reminds me of Dark Souls. If you die, you leave behind your salt, and you have to go back to collect it. Once you do, you can, of course, use it to buy upgrades from the tents for your character. Which is a nice way to choose how you want your character to grow. I like when my healing potions heal a lot, for example, instead of having a lot of base hp right from the start.

If you are thinking of playing this game, DO NOT LOOK AT YOUTUBE FOR ANY HINTS. There is no losing the game, and there is no winning the game, but if you look at youtube, you will lose a lot of the thematic feel of the game.\n\nI REPEAT, DO NOT LOOK AT YOUTUBE OR ANY OTHER GUIDE. YOU WILL MISS OUT ON AN EXPERIENCE.\n\nSaying that, Yume Nikki is a interactive experience following a young woman's dreams. By sifting through her dreams, you may come to conclusions about the player character's life, or you may find yourself reflecting on events in your life. I heartily reccomend this game to those who like mystery and speculation.\n- [b][i]AMID EVIL[/i] is very much [i]Quake[/i] 1 level design in a [i]Hexen[/i]/[i]Heretic[/i] universe.[/b] It's well done. We're a bit spoiled this year with outstanding '90s FPS shooters. Personally, I prefer both [i]Ion Maiden[/i] and [i]DUSK[/i] over this title for the following reasons:\n\n1) I find [i]AMID EVIL[/i] to be a bit generic in terms of theme; the fantasy setting could use a bit more to set it apart.\n\n2) I prefer real or low fantasy weapons/guns over wands and totally high fantasy weapons. Now, don't get it twisted - I appreciate that these high fantasy weapons exist, but yeah, they leave something to be desired. I miss reloading and all of that. \n\n3) The level design in [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is much more 'sprawling' (for lack of a better term) just like the original [i]Quake[/i]. Most levels are indoors in what feels like an underground compound (at the time of writing this review). I personally like the backwoods feel of [i]DUSK[/i], or the dystopian cityscape of [i]Ion Maiden[/i] far more. I want to look up at the sky in most levels.\n\n4) The enemy design is different than the other two games I mention, which is good - but they all mostly have a 'same' kind of feel. The enemies are all super fast, so most of your efforts are focused on running backwards while fending them off. It's fun, but gunplay isn't quite as fun as the other two games for this particular reason.\n\n5) The font and overall menu system definitely feels 'Early Access'. I know the font is being worked on, which is desperately needed. \n\n6) My favorite way to play the game is Endless mode - and I feel like that's a flaw in itself. It's the opposite for me with [i]DUSK[/i]. I want to fall in love with the campaign, but eh, there isn't really any story or anything all that interesting to suck me in. The secrets are super easy to find compared to the other two games, too.\n\n7) No multiplayer. Now, I really don't care about this - but who designs a game in this genre without building this in from the ground up? You know the community is going to whine about this. Questionable design decision to say the least.\n\n[b]Well, it sounds like I just dumped all over the game.[/b] Please don't get me wrong. [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is a welcome addition to the genre. The *great news* is that this is not just some reskin of [i]DUSK[/i] - it certainly is it's own thing. And that's really important. \n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+Fairly polished game for Early Access\n+It's the most modern version of the original [i]Quake[/i] we've seen this year\n+Well optimized\n+Lots of content right now\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-The universe is generic\n-No multiplayer\n-The font is too hard to read\n-Music is nothing to write home about\n-The secrets are easy, and there really aren't all that many of them\n-Weapons could use more 'oomph' to them; also we should be able to use the special ability when we want to as opposed to it autotriggering\n\n[b]I was psyched out of my mind for [i]AMID EVIL[/i] - and while it is certainly good - I think I'll be focused more on [i]DUSK[/i] and [i]Ion Maiden[/i].[/b] Because, let's face it, gaming time is valuable and we can't play everything.\n- Since when I played Plants vs Zombies, years ago, I looked for its great soundtrack composer Laura Shigihara, finding her Twitter profile. She was talking about a game she was developing, named Rakuen or something like this, and the whole project sounded awesome. I promised to myself that I would buy it the day it was released.  \n\nTo be exact, I only got motivated to register a Steam account specifically in order to buy Rakuen, even if other games were bought before and after it.  Also, even if I found a blog and YouTube videos where Laura talked about Rakuen's development, I didn't read or watch any of it, to avoid creating wrong or misguided expectations. \n\nAnd it was worth the wait. This is an awesome piece of art.\n\nAs a story, Rakuen has a well developed and thoughtful plot, deep and diverse characters, balanced and pleasant pace. \n\nVisually, Rakuen has colorful and elegant graphics, with easily recognizable sprites and detailed scenarios.\n\nThe gameplay is fluid, with simple but entertaining puzzles, not too hard, not too easy, and with rock solid programming.\n\nFinally, Rakuen's music is delightful, perfectly syncronized with the feelings inspired by the plot.\n\nRakuen provoke chuckles, tears and smiles. It brings back a warmth sometimes we forget that exist. It became one of my favorite games ever, and I doubt its place will ever be taken by another title.\n\nThank you Laura, thank you very much for Rakuen.\n- I called Grandma a bitch. Grandma immediately murdered me. 10/10 would die again.\n- Ever wanted to be a futuristic dual wielding samurai drummer with a penchant for slicing boxes? No? You didn't even know that was a thing? Well you will after playing this. \n\nProbably the most satisfying rhythm game out there, Beat Saber turns sword thrusts into dance. With notes expertly timed to the music and directional swipes that lead smoothly into each other creating an almost choreographed flow, you will find yourself naturally completing songs and feeling boss after every single track.\n\nWith a choice of difficulty settings and a huge array of modifiers, it is accessible to many skill levels and makes it perfect for newcomers, parties or just to simply show off VR, while remaining a huge challenge for those who wish to test themselves on the most hardcore difficulties.\n\nBeat Saber is a game that probably should be on the radar of any VR user, as it's pretty visuals and reliance on your motions makes it a perfect fit for VR. If you don't have this game I highly recommend you pick it up, as when you do, you may just find it hard to put it down.\n\nNow if you will excuse me, I have a few more hardcore songs I have to embarrass myself attempting.\n- Let's say you capture a prisoner after a bloody raid on your colony. Do you want to:\n\n1. Let them go in the hopes of improving relations with the attackers? YOU CAN DO THAT.\n\n2. Heal them and have colonists talk to them about how great your colony is until they join? YOU CAN DO THAT.\n\n3. Have a colonist with a high medical skill remove their liver to transplant into an alcoholic colonist? YOU CAN DO THAT.\n\n4. Have a colonist with a low medical skill remove their organs just for practice? YOU CAN DO THAT.\n\n5. Eat them because you forgot to stock up on food for the winter? YOU CAN DO THAT.\n\nReally, what else do you need in a game?\n- A forward-hurtling psychedelic tube shooter with a tremendous sense of speed and odd, zen relaxation. The closest thing I have to compare it to is probably [i]Rez[/i]: if you liked that, definitely give this a whirl.\n\nConversions of arcade classics and legends are commonplace. But an arcade [i]myth?[/i] Only one springs to mind: [b]POLYBIUS[/b]. There one minute and gone the next, so they say - an enigmatic arcade cabinet installed and removed by mysterious men in black: rumours of people hooked to the screen and unable to remember or communicate what they saw afterwards, save for that it was immersive, fast, colourful, and strangely hypnotic. A fly-by-night company that went out of business? A government mind control experiment? Probably not, no. A hoax. An urban legend. A myth.\n\nBut a myth was all Jeff Minter needed. If you're previously unfamiliar with Jeff Minter and his stable Llamasoft, he's been creating weird arcade-inspired games and \"lightsynths\" (as in, the inspiration for Milkdrop and other music visualisers) out of a barn in Wales since the 1980s. His creations are marked by being fast, psychedelic, and strangely sheep-themed, generally in search of the kind of gameplay that invites the player to get \"in the zone\". And so it is here.\n\nIn search of a new original creation, he turned his mind to the arcade legend Polybius as inspiration, and his interpretation is oddly faithful:[list]\n[*]Immersive: it supports VR if you have it, wrapping you into the game world - it draws you into the screen even if you don't.\n[*]Fast: capable of and designed for very high-refresh rates if you can support them.\n[*]Colourful: look at the screenshots, you get the idea.\n[*]Hypnotic: hurtling forwards shooting abstract things in tunnel patterns seems like it would be intense, and it is, but - [i]Relax. Just look at the centre of the screen as you move forward. Go through the horns. Let it take you[/i].[/list]\n\nOnce you get the hang of it and start relaxing into it and getting into that sense of flow, it's curiously calming. I can see myself bringing this out for a quick session after a stressful day: it's particularly good to dip into. Long sessions might result in seeing patterns on the walls, Tetris-style.\n\nIt's not for everyone: Minter's games never have been. In particular, you may wish to skip this one if you have sensory conditions that make you susceptible to motion sickness, or photosensitive epilepsy.\n\nGood music too, and doesn't need high specs either. Recommended.\n- The game vaguely reminds me of Yume Nikki and Strange Telephone due to thematic similarities, but in the end, I think it managed to be something completely different - I don't want to compare it directly to Undertale, but I got those narrative vibes as well. Unlike its exploration-based relatives, UNREAL LIFE is somewhat of a linear game, but the areas tend to loop around into the hub when using waypoints, occasionally involving some backtracking and optional achievements (including a game within a game). It took me about 6 hours to get 2 bad endings on the same playthrough, that said I am missing more than half of the achievements and probably other endings as well. Despite its modest art style, I think the locations and the world design were very good, granted the game settings are very limited for the price. The writing and characters were the highlight of the experience for me, I would say I enjoyed about 95% of the dialogue and world-building, despite being a very text-heavy game. The game tells a story in a unique way where the character can extract memories from the objects that she touched, unlocking potential hints that you will need to solve puzzles.\n\nYour room works as a hub area to which you can return for manual saves or the minigame, additionally to connecting all areas with a waypoint system, but you don't have to worry too much about those as the checkpoints are very frequent. Generally, the gameplay is just exploring 2D levels, picking up items, and occasionally solving creative sequence puzzles. The character keeps track of 3 different memories that may contain clues if you managed to miss them - it's hard to do because the important text is color-coded. I want to give the devs credit for actually putting some originality into puzzle mechanics, they were fun and not difficult enough to drag the game down. However, when the character learns about a hidden item from the memory, you have to click in the correct spot with no indication, which is perfectly fine, I only wish I realized it sooner. For any Yume fans out there, the game works as a psychedelic visual candy, with many dream-like environments and themes to navigate. \n\n[i]In a way, playing through this game reminded me of the first time I finished watching Spirited Away, the journey so immersive it left me in a state of melancholy. Do you ever get a feeling that you changed as a person after finishing a game? [/i]\n\n[h1] Pros: [/h1]\n\n+ fun characters, enjoyable narrative \n+ multiple endings and optional achievements \n+ creative puzzle based on memory mechanics \n+ nice variety of locations\n+ awesome soundtrack \n\n[h1] Feedback: [/h1]\n\n[u] Some Nitpicks [/u] - I ended up playing on a controller, but if you are using a mouse you have to drag the character around, it would be nice to have the clicking option instead - if it has one I don't know how to activate it. I was slightly confused by the main menu controls when using a controller, but if you can't figure out the buttons you can select the options with the mouse. I wish you just had the visual Q like \"new game\", \"load game\" and so on. Sometimes to progress you may have to talk to characters multiple times, so just make sure that you exhaust all dialogue before moving on. On a side note, you can softlock the game if the water turtle pushes you against the platform (not a big deal, reload 10 second checkpoint). Overall, I don't have any real issues with the game, mostly the story felt like sliding on a big stick of butter.  \n\n[b] Overall Thoughts: 9/10 [/b]\n\nIs it worth $20? Well, it's a really good game for this niche genre if you like those types of ambient/psychedelic games like Dreaming Sarah - it feels bigger and more ambitious than most. There is no question that devs put so much love into the project, but it's still a niche game at the end of the day. My skepticism slowly faded away as the game kept being compelling in the storytelling and enjoyable locations. As someone that plays many games that occupy the same space, I can't really imagine a game that offers much more than that. For me, it was a special game, and by 'special' I mean like it hit a nerve, got pretty personal. \n\n[code]Review By: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/31294838-Hidden-Gem-Discovery/ [/code]\n- It's a R@PE SIMULATOR. Games like this should not be played. I was tempted to play, and will do so for a few hours in future, may be a demon has possessed me...or may be I just don't waste my money that I have spent on it. But really, you should not encourage these games. Who have not bought this game, plz don't buy.\n- This game is really special. I'm a 50 year old man with an emotional structure made largely of mud and thumbtacks, and I had to bite the inside of my jaw in a parts to keep from tearing up. \n\nMany people seem to equate an \"adult game\" with gore and violence or explicit imagery. Nothing wrong with those types of games, I have and will continue to enjoy them. This game explores mature themes on relationships and mortality and doesn't pull any punches, without being cheap or manipulative. In that sense, its the most adult game I've ever played. \n\nI won't ever forget it. If this sounds like something you'd be interested in, stop reading and buy it. Its a slow burn, and you won't be invested until you've spent some time with the characters in the story. In the end, the payoff is tremendous.\n- I pay money for early access\nA lot of bug but developer dont care you feedback just update useless money sea and let player survivel in game without water\n\nNow developer just want reset you save that i play 33hr to build\n\nHowever, New story so fucking soggy \nI have play this game before update can see some timeline \n\nNew update dont care everything you can get in late chapter of the game without vehicle. Just run in and die \n\nStory so confuse if you new plyer and play in this update you will get bad and confuse experience\n\n\nI disappointed to this dev \n\nBut interest in concept of this game\n\nI suggest you to buy when it already full game\n\nDont waste your time in early access with dev who’s not care supporter\n- -This game is like the combination of old PC sidescroller like Duke Nukem (pre-3d), NES Contra, and arcade Metal Slug with 80s /90s cyberpunk and action movie tropes.\n-The cheesy humor, plot, and music is top notch. Might look like a shallow nostalgia at a glance but once you played it, they even spiritually nailed the silliness of similar games/story in that era. The guns, the character acting and lines, the costume design, etc.\n-It's not as fast paced as I thought it would be. But actually that makes it relaxing to play. Easy to get into and the challenge is just right for me without being frustrating. \n-I like how the enemies and characters are pretty diverse. \n-I haven't finished the game but I feel like this game will have similar replay value like Streets of Rage 4. Not because of there are many things to do or getting better at the game but because it's somehow just simply tight, fun, and arcadey to replay.\n- [h1]Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Save scumming is a game-play mechanic and the game is balanced around the player being able to quick-save and reload whenever they want.\n[*] The game seems highly objective oriented, and I wish there was more optional treasures to collect, as I am a pirate.\n[*] While many guard situations appear to have a clear solution,  you can always just brute-force your way through or take another less contrived route, so the game doesn't devolve into a stealth puzzle game.\n[*] Post-game summary shows your route and enemy eliminations at hyper speed, and is always a fun watch at the end of a level.\n[/list]\nI really enjoy finally having a top-down style stealth game. Games such as Hard West and Divinity: Original Sin 2 also featured stealth elements but they were sorely lacking in favor of the turn based combat of the game. Furthermore, this game has pirates, making it an instant hit (for me).\n- 5/10 Too difficult to be any fun playing the game on normal. got at least 10 more hours offline\n+ they put in cheats to make the game actually playable. turned them on after finishing the 2nd world\ni went with 2 dashes and dash assist after all those wrong way dashes.....\n- people who cheat get the same achievements as people who dont, so whats the point???\n- no steam workshop, people could make fun levels unlike the entire game.....\n- one of those dumb meta storys\n- dashes got me killed all the time, janky. towerfall had way better dash system\n+ you can skip the storys, helps when replying levels over and over looking for that dumb B side track\n- F2P update: Hey it's free now! STDs are free - avoid it.\n\nIt was great at the start, I put many hours into it. \n\nAaaand now it's aggressively monetised, forces all this microtransaction garbage on you, battle pass rubbish, skins, emotes, crates, more than one premium currency.\n\nAND they have the gall to ask £26.99 RRP for this? $30 to have the privilege of paying more money.\n\nMake it free at this point, you want to be Fortnite so bad.\n\nYou either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.\n- This is like, the End of Evangelion of RPGmaker games.\n- Falcom's Action RPG Masterpiece.\n\nbest story in the series. it follows the latest adventure of Adol and his companions, stranded in an island and slowly uncovering their secrets. the tight, but well developed cast are absolutely the best written characters in the series. from party member to your fellow castaways all have developed motivation, personality and charm. \n\nalot of the horribad translation and voice acting have been fixed, and it finally got the treatment it deserve as a masterpiece. \n\nthe gameplay is an evolution of the modern Ys game. at its core, ys 8 is an action RPG where you control adol and several other party members with unique set of skills, moveset, weapons and super attack. each character represent an attack type (slash, pierce, smash) that are pitted against various enemies with certain weaknesses. great variety of enemies, amazing boss battles, music and story. \n\non release, there seems to be a big problem for the port, but as far as i know, everything has been patched to very good level of stability. over 70 hours, the game crashed twice (and saved by the intuitive autosave system), run flawlessly 60 FPS and 1440p without a single slowdown. \n\n10/10 game go buy so we get monstrum nox on PC.\n- A fantastic rogue-lite where dying doesn't mean a hard reset. In death your character is succeeded by one of their offspring and all of your earned skills, talents, equipment and gold are passed down from one generation to the next, ensuring that even the weakest of players can still make progress. After each death you are given the choice of three characters that are randomised from a pool of three to eight classes (depending on how many you unlock) who are given randomly drawn traits and abilites; some good, some bad. The castle itself is also randomised keeping the game fresh despite there only being four environments.\n\nAll in all, I found it a thoroughly addictive game despite minimal experience in the genre beforehand and would recommend it to anyone who merely thought \"that looks interesting\" as they skimmed over the Steam store page.\n- Steins;Gate Elite is a great Visual Novel when looked at in isolation. The main problem is that Steins;Gate (the original) exists. I don't mind the difference in art styles, that is a matter of personal preference anyway. Graphics in Elite are a lot more animated, images in the original are more static but also more detailed. What I have an issue with is the missing parts in the story.\n\nThere are a few situations where Elite eliminates choices when compared to the original. I won't spoil details, but in one of the early chapters you can choose to ignore or answer a phone call, leading to alternate branches in the story (they join again soon after, but each branch still contains unique content). Well, you can choose in the original. In Elite, you automatically answer the phone, the other branch is no longer in the game.\n\nAt a later point in the game, I noticed that quite a sizeable chunk of a previously linear story progression (not even an alternate branch) concerning Faris was completely cut out. Again, I won't spoil details in case you just want to decide which version of the game to get and don't know the story yet. It has been some time since I played the original, so I might have missed more instances of missing story parts, but at least this one part was really obvious.\n\nThe missing branches and parts are not really relevant to the overall story, but you probably want them if you want to know more about the characters. Elite is more streamlined, but at least all of the alternate endings are still here. So while there is missing stuff compared to the original, there is quite a bit more when compared to the anime. Then again, the anime added more story after the true ending of the original game. I was hoping that Elite added (and maybe fleshed out) this extra content as well, but no luck here, Elite ends at the same point as the original.\n\nIf you don't mind the art style of the original, play that one instead. The second game (Steins;Gate 0) only exists in it's original form anyway. Elite might still be worth it if heavily discounted since it is the only way to get the \"free\" Linear Bounded Phenogram. You can justify it as buying LBP and getting Elite as a free extra.\n- I even set a calendar reminder so that I could get this on release. I wish I hadn't bothered. Going great guns until I got to the passage. Game over as I can't progress. Tried allsorts to drop the jammer but unable to do so. I guess it is a case of waiting for all the bugs to get resolved.\n- EDIT:\n\nWhile I have played Squad quite a bit for a few years, the large update named \"V6.0 Infantry Combat Overhaul\" unfortunately did not sit well with me.\n\nThe goals for the update:\n\n- Increase length of fights.\n- Reduce the impact of lone wolfs (solo players).\n- Increase emphasis on teamwork mechanics, which mainly meant supression.\n- Increase gunplay diversity, to create choices between optics, since the old meta meant that the magnified optics were greatly outperforming iron sights and holo sights.\n\nWhile I do not disagree with some of the goals, the implementation of them left a lot to be desired.\n\nAfter the update most gunfights became a mess of supression, without either side being able to effetively kill each other beyond 200m.\nGunhandling was also drastically nerfed, creating the sense that your character has never held a rifle before, or even used an optic for that matter.\n\nI can unfortunately no longer recommend this game, since I myself no longer feel drawn to play it.\n\nIf enough changes are made, I may revisit the game and this review, but for now there are better options out there.\n\n\n** OLD REVIEW ** \n\nCan the game be amazing and fun - yes! Do I recommend this for everyone? - No.\n\nThe experience of the game largely depends on what servers / communities you play with. If you play the core game with no moderation (no rules or admins), the game will become a race to make the first unit and lock others out and a race to get armor, then proceed to rush the enemy and end up spawnkilling them near their main spawn.\n\nIf you play on moderated servers with established rules and active admins, then you may experience a great sense of teamplay - other times not so much.\n\nBefore you buy it though...\n\n- Microphone and willingness to use it is REQUIRED for a good experience (People will quickly kick or become hostile towards you, if you do not communicate)\n- This is not battlefield or call of duty, running of solo to pull off 360 noscopes will probably get you kicked/ killed.\n- You will die without knowing from where and you will get into situations in which you have no option to survive, especially if you're new to tactical shooters.\n- You will end up running... A lot..\n- Armor is not like battlefield or call of duty, you need a driver, gunner, commander and possibly a loader (has a machinegun). Where you hit the enemy matters as much as what you hit him with (Armor piercing on his front turret will likely bounce, but even a high explosive may hurt if you can hit him up the rear)\n\nStill here... ?\n\nIf I haven't scared you off, here are my personal tips:\n- Play. The. Tutorial.  Like really...\n- Try different graphic settings, shadows especially makes a big difference in enemy visibility (game looks better with them though)\n- Start as infantry and pick rifleman, but remember to join a squad.\n- Find a server that seems to have active admins and have a ruleset you agree with.\n- Try NOT to give up when you die, generally it isn't worth throwing away a ticket to respawn if you have friendlies within 100m. Sometimes it is the right choice, but before you know which is which, it's a good idea to hold on for a medic.\n- Not all squad leaders know what they're doing, do not be afraid to join another squad if it turns out your squad leader is a fool.\n- Defending is often as important (if not more), than attacking... But you may end up waiting 30 minutes without getting shot at or shooting anyone.\n\n\nAs you can probably tell... Squad is a community based game, with in-depth enough mechanics, while also being easily accessable.\nIf you want a good sense of what the game is, check out some lesser known streamer playing it (bigger streamers will often give you the wrong sense of what a game is like)\n\nHope this helped you make an informed decision.\n\nbut for now there are better options out there.\n- So, I only found this game because my favorite Vtuber Miilkywayz on Twitch played it. It seemed pretty interesting but when she started making her own cards. As an IRL witch I was WAY more interested. The game itself is great, I love making cards and learning their meanings and seeing how how the story changes changes based on your deck and the cards drawn. And the replaybility of it is amazing given its price. 10/10 from me. Need more games like this.\n- I've been completely in love with this game ever since the Mojam prototype \"Wasteland Kings\" was released. It's an insanely fun, fastpaced \"roguelike-like\" or \"roguelite\" with randomly generated worlds and tons of weapons to find. On top of that, the developers stream the development of the game on tuesdays and thursdays over at Twitch and they release updates to the game every week. To me, this is the best game of its kind and I've put tons of hours into mastering it (and I still die. Often. It's difficult okay?).\n- IMHO this game is highly over-hyped, glad I only spend a few € and bought it at sale.\n\n- Basic concept of dungeon crawling with horror is copied from D&D Ravenloft or Call of Cuthullu. So nothing new here. \n- Story is simple and stereotypical: Old man evokes some unnamed horror in a cursed mansion that curses the land...  \n- Graphics are nicely painted ... but still painted, so outdated concept. It's a indy game, ok ... and maybe some gamers still love playing games on their 386er personal computers from 1990 ...\n- The gameplay itself is IMHO stale, because it's always the same: go into a dungeon. Fight. Grind. Survive.\n- Stress could be an interesting factor, but not in the way it is implemented. In its current form is nothing but a second health bar, which is either difficult or expensive to heal. It makes the game not more complex or more interesting but only more frustrating. Stress could be interesting, if it had different stages with different effects. But in its current form and the difficulty of the game itself it is simply idiotic to take stressed heroes into battle. \n- Random number generator is bad. Really bad. Maybe intentional bad? Who knows...?\n\nThe game itself is grind, more grind, and … grind. Combined with the lame story and the frustration it is a game for masochists and people that want to become one.\n- SICK Art Style\nSICK Mechanics\nSICK Game\n- Upon further play, the game wasn't super luck based, it just doesn't do a great job explaining core mechanics that are crucial to gameplay. It has a more hands off, let the player discover how this works type of playstyle, but a simple line of dialogue alluding to these features would have been nice. That said, the story is really gripping, the gameplay (once learned) is fun, and overall, I definitely think it's worth $20.\n- Simply fantastic. Probably the best TRUE RPG I've ever played. Your choices matter, dialogue options matter, the order in which you do things matter, even such small things such as the items you hold in your hand matter. Every build is viable, go heavy in Physical stats and you'll have difficulty solving things Logically, but maybe you can brute force your way through something. Go heavy in Logic and you'll be weak in a one-to-one fight, but maybe you'll be so fast to figure things out that it'll never come to that. You'll see things that the dim-witted brute with high Physical didn't. Failure is encouraged, there are many routes in the game you cannot open without failing something else first.\n\nA true combat system does not exist. At all. Physical altercations are decided through dice rolls based on how you've built your character. And virtually all of them are optional. I like this decision a lot. I've always found it immersion-breaking in RPGs when you're just running around the countryside, killing every bandit or animal that comes your way. This one keeps fights realistic with REAL consequences depending how things go.\n\nBarring having to restart my game once due to a bug (quicksave often, autosaves are few), the game had no major technical issues. There was a single point in the game where a vital skill check required a specific skill to be built, and I'm not sure if there were any alternate routes. I couldn't find any, just had to savescum the check. Aside from that, you have options as to how to approach everything. I'm not sure if that was an oversight or if I just missed something.\n\nCan't go into the story much without spoilers (and you DON'T want it spoiled, it's great.) But it's very well-written and even hilarious at some points. But don't be fooled, it's not a comedy game. It tackles very serious topics such as Fascism, Communism, Mental Illness, Addiction, and many other things.\n\nOverall an amazing RPG experience that I cannot recommend enough. Will definitely play through this several times to see how things go with different builds. Highly suggest you purchase this if you have any interest.\n- Great game... who need 1 or 2 years of development. tl;dr: mid game turn into a micromanagment hell.\n\nThe game is fantastic until a certain point. You start as a mercenary, one party, 50-150 soldiers doing missions, small battles or bigger fights joining armies. Good graphics, brutal engagments with 200-1000 units at the same time if your computer can handle, playing as a soldier is a blast.\n\nThe problems start when you get a few towns and a bigger family, the micromanagement never stops and gets worse overtime. You have to physically move your party to towns to fix their issues. When your lords get captured & escapes, they'll go into a random town until you pick em again, then you'll have to reform the party. Same with caravanes for trading, if they get captured, you'll have to go in his town and recreate the caravan. You have to partially fill towns with soldiers, manually, from your own soldiers. All the little fun things of the beginning soon become a hassle, as you can't delegate. Messengers are not a thing.\n\nYou can't manage a town at a distance, you can't tell a party member to move to a location or guard a territory, they do whatever they want if they're out of your army / party, so you have to do it yourself. Either you're leading your huge army to fight what is basically an enless war mid game, or you take care of your cities while the rest of your faction fight... with various success. Some commanders are pretty good, other will throw waves of recruits at highly trained arbalists in the open backed with cavalry. Protip: don't be a recruit in an imperial army.\n\nYou can't tell a party you created to guard an area or to kill all bandits attacking your villagers, it's up to you, or the IA if it feel like it. Worst, if you let the parties you created roam around (parties = group of 70-200 soldiers under a lord) they can be (temporarily) drafted in other armies of your kingdom... and you'll have to physically move to the army, talk to the leader and pay some reputation to get them back. Of course, large armies are slow. This leads the the next problem, swarms.\n\nMy worst fear is not a massive army, it's an army disbanded in the middle of my territory. The small parties usually start raiding all villages in the vicinity while being too fast to be catched by a big army. Raided villages impact your town / castle loyalty and gold quite heavily. Sure, you could disband your army and hunt them yourself... but that makes you take a step back, and all your parties would reform under another army you can't control. And man, some army commanders are really, really stupid. Verdun style charge in the open against walls of archers, cavalry in a forest vs pikemens, you name it. I can't count the time i had parties wiped in someone else army. But let's say you managed to capture the lords burning your villages.\n\nThe capture system is broken. Captured lords escape A LOT. I had some escape 20 seconds after being captured. They never stay in a jail for more than a few in game days. Once they escape, they magically teleport to their hometown, rebuild a fast 80 mens army in the blink of an eye and go back to raiding villages. AI \"cheat\" with recruits, they will always find soldiers in town, even if they're empty for you. Executions you say?\n\nIf you execute a lord, no matter how much of an A-hole he/she is, the whole faction will hate you. He raided dozens of villages and killed hundreds of peasants? Still not good enough. You just can't kill a lord without suffering heavy consequences down the line, and you'll need those lords to be friendly later. Worth to mention, capturing the leader of a faction won't stop a war.\n\nLast - peace / war is on/off. I had 600 days of continuous war, followed by 600 days of complete peace in the entire map (due to a bug apparently), and i'm now back at 300 days of war. Not a single day of peace, when one war stop another start immediatly. They will just never, ever stop fighting. Can't catch a breath, can't leave the front of your lose towns.\n\nOh and the main quest randomly failed after 875 days or so.\n\nI would still recommand the game, it's really fun for a while but it need a HUGE QoL update.\n\n- unprofessional review:\n\nits a really deep lore kind of game, very cool!\nit has some horror and grinding elements which i always love\ni havent finished the game just yet tho \nthe visuals are very cute\nas soon as i bought it was hooked!\noke theres many more but im to lazy to type :joy:\n\nover all ill give it a 10/10\nvery interesting lore wise\n- I appreciate the sincerity of Jusant. You can tell its creators have placed genuine care into their product, which has made the experience of playing it joyful and kind.\nThe visuals are stunning, the mechanics are not overwhelming, the soundtrack is soothing, and the puzzles are not frustrating. A great climbing game all around with an easy-to-follow yet gripping narrative. \nHopefully, Ukrainian localization will also be added soon.\n\n- \"We'll take the top, and it'll be a happy ending. Just like in Dragon Quest.\" - Ichiban Kasuga.\n- Beautifully drawn and atmospheric\n\nAmazing sound\n\nSimple to play yet gives just the right amount of challenge without being frustrating\n\nI played and finished it in one sitting, Mainly because I was riveted from start to finish\nYes its 3-4 hours long but you will enjoy every minute of it\nI don't think I will ever understand whats going on with the story...but somehow I think that was the intention\n\nHighly recommended and definitely best indie game of the year, perhaps the last 5 years\n- This is trash, I mean if you eat shit for breakfast I'm sure you'll like it.  You have to pay to have access to graphics better than the PS2's, also your stuff gets deleted every week. All there is to do is punch a couple zombies.  Don't get this game.\n- I finished the game on keyboard and had some pretty good fun with it.\n\nno way in hell am i going to try and S-rank all the levels, though.\n\nEDIT: this morning I woke up and thought \"well i'll only try to S-rank level 1 and then i'll put it down\", so that's the story of how i S-ranked every level in the game.\n- I vividly remember the moment when I gave up on Fallout 3: I was the ruins of some city, with a grey sky looming over the shredded grey concrete shells of buildings, and vast chunks of broken grey highway was wrapped up against, around, over and under huge chunks of grey concrete. My companion had gotten stuck somewhere in the grey sea of rubble for the umpteenth time, and it just suddenly struck me: This game isn't fun. It's just depressing.\n\nA few years later, I recalled this experience to a friend of mine, and he assured me: \"Fallout 4 isn't grey. It's got colors. And it's good.\" Having banked 1410 hours in game, I would have to say he was right.\n\nIs Fallout 4 good RPG? Nope. The story is rubbish, the characters extremely shallow, and the skill tree is very meh. If you hate VATS, like I do, the skill tree is complete rubbish. Is it good because it is bug free and has good DLC's? Nope. Is it good because it's the best shooter ever? Nope. Fallout 4 is good game because it's fun, and it's fun because it's a decent shooter, with an OK open world, good atmosphere and a sense a humor. Slap some of the 1000's of existing mods on that, and there's a decent chance that the next time you emerge from the elevator of Vault 111, switching to the catchy tunes of Diamond City Radio as you ready your gun and take in the not-grey landscape, you'll be smiling, just like I do.\n\nUpdate: Due to the recent Skyrim \"update\", breaking mods and introducing paid mods, and a similar downgrade being reported as coming for Fallout 4, I can no longer recommend this game, or any other Bethesda product.\n- [h1]SDHQ STEAM DECK PERFORMANCE REVIEW:[/h1]\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th] Follow our [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42495043/]curator[/url] page for more Steam Deck reviews and our [url=https://twitter.com/SteamDeckHQ]Twitter[/url] for immediate updates on all SDHQ content including reviews, news, and more!\n[/th][/tr][/table]\n\n\n[i]This review is based ONLY on performance of the game on the STEAM DECK.[/i]\n\n\n[h1]The Game Itself:[/h1]\n\n\nChained Echoes is a 16-bit era inspired JRPG which sees you travel across the varied, war-stricken continent of Valandis to bring an end to the war between the 3 kingdoms. With a world filled with charming characters, vicious foes, and bakers that use wood as an ingredient, you will fight in turn-based combat utilizing a complex equipment and skill system to fend for yourself. Chained Echoes also features a customizable airship, tons of items to loot and craft, a 30-40 hour playtime, no random encounters, and a fantastic soundtrack inspired by the PSX era. Will you be able to bring peace to Valandis?\n\nHonestly, I absolutely love this game. The 16-bit style graphics, the attention to small little details, the woven in humor, and the combat mechanics all shine bright here. The combat doesn't feel sluggish and I actually felt a desire to talk to the NPCs sprinkled across the world, which is not a normal feeling for me. I also liked that, if I started a conversation with a NPC, I could still walk away. I wasn't forced to hear everything that they needed to say. Overall, as a game, I can't recommend this one enough!\n\n\n[h1]Steam Deck Performance:[/h1]\n\n\nYeah it runs near perfectly here. Without any changes, you can keep 60 FPS with 6.5 - 7 hours of battery on a full charge. It may not come as a surprise based on the game's graphical quality, but it is still wonderful.\n\nI did encounter a couple stutters here and there, which stalled the game for a solid 1 second, but that was it. This tended to happen on the first attack in combat or entering into a new place, but it wasn't consistent or enough to stop me from enjoying the game.\n\nChained Echoes brings back a lot of memories when playing it. Not because it is something I played before, but because it reminds me of the good times I had with older JRPGs. Chrono Trigger is a big one that I loved from the SNES era and this game gave me those same feelings I had playing back in the day. On top of that, the game performs beautifully on the Deck without any setting changes. I am happy to say it gets our Best on Deck rating! If you enjoy the SNES JRPG era, this is an easy must-buy.\n\n\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th] [url=https://steamdeckhq.com/]SDHQ[/url] is a website made for curating Steam Deck news, guides, and providing optimization/builds for games on the Deck.\n[/th][/tr][/table]\n- I was hoping for a good game but I can't believe the positive reviews. Really annoying on a personal level. If you like your hand held and revel in 3rd person view then enjoy, but I think it's terrible. I was on the mountain jumping across a platform. \"Press ENTER\" to 'grab' it suggests. I press ENTER and what do you know? Nothing happens. Well, you die continually because what it tells you to do (zzzzz) doesn't work. Ah, maybe this is part of the 'difficulty'...hahahaha.\n\nNot a patch on any Far Cry or GTA even though these are full of directions. First Tomb Raider I've bought and definitely the last. What is it with games these days telling you what to do every step of the way: Do this...do that....go here....find item...take item...drop item...fire now.....pull lever...talk....rest....jump.... quit game and uninstall, ya that's the best option. As this game is created for a dumbed-down society or tailored for intellectually challenged meercats, some of us can see where the industry is heading. What happened to thinking for yourself???\n\nI don't need to progess far in this game because the first 10 minutes says enough. Do this, do that, blah blah blah...\n- This game is the greatest middle finger to all the money-grubbing AAA games out there. It's reasonably priced, it's intelligent, it gives freedom to your epic adventure, and last but not least, this game doesn't have any loot-box and micro-transaction nonsense!\n\nGreat work Larian Studios. This game will go down as a cult classic!!\n- Playing this game for the first time six years after its initial release proved to be a delight in disguise. With all the memes and jokes established, I was finally able to understand what the fuss was all about back in 2011. Despite not having the best gameplay, story or graphics out there, something about this title just made me want to finish every quest I deemed worth completing. \n\n9/10 - mods recommended\n- This game is so good! I actually teared up with some of the conversations (Nightgaunt and Riptide anyone??) and I definitely wasn't expecting that. All of the dialogue is super natural and the relationship's progress really cute. I honestly can't believe this game is free\n- I really, really wanted to like this game.\n\nI preface this review by saying that Guacamelee 1 is in my top 10 games of all time. I've been a gamer for 33 years. Sotn, Chrono Trigger, and FFVII are my go-tos. G-Melee 1 is a charming and original romp through a metroidvania style genre.\n\nGuacamelee 2 fails so ridiculously hard, it actually makes me sad when I think about it. The puzzles are uninspired, the abilities don't really feel enjoyable, and the platforming elements are just unforgivingly tight for the sake of it. I had all the \"schools\" maxed out before the end, it didnt make me feel any more powerful. I didn't have that super saiyan mode like in GM 1.\n\nThe final bossfight is a 3/10 compared to the first game where it is at BARE MINIMUM 9/10.\n\nI wish I could rank this game higher because I adore the original. However, this became a slog several hours before I could finish it. I would not recommend this to anyone, ever. It's light on the humor and story, it requires you to be invested in the previous game. The mechanics aren't new and they threw in some unnecessary tight, like razor thin, platforming into the game.\n- So the game can be played I believe in flat screen and VR, I played in VR. You play the game in a third person prospective controlling a spirit dog. The concept is easy, get the people to the light beam, but that's easier said than done. It was very nearly a short game play video as i become really stuck to the point i nearly quit but I tried, tried and tried again until i did it. It very much reminded of a game i use to play as a kid called lemmings only in this one it doesn't matter if the people fall of the edge. Its a very challenging game, one where you can just sit and try to figure it all out. I thought it would get repetitive but each level is very different from the last. I have a game play video in which i get a bit frustrated lol if you wanted to check out some game play. https://youtu.be/7VPsLnDDDlQ\n- THIS REVIEW IS FOR VERSION 1.3 \n\nStarbound is the space game that all people who crave space games like I do will enjoy. \n\nFrom playing with your friends and colonizing an entire star sytem to role playing as a galactic bounty hunter, this game truly offers what all of us enjoy. \n\nPros \n+ Unique art style \n+ Infinite procedurally generated universe \n+ Creative alien races that are completely customizable \n+ Pets unique to each race \n+ A heart wrenching story that [Spoilers] makes you a hero \n+ Crafting system that requires a plethora of materials \n+ Mining and harvesting isn't a grind \n+ Materials can be acquired through pickaxes, drills, mechs, and the infamous and upgradable Matter Manipulator \n+ Devs constantly working to update and add new features \n+ Every planet is different with several contributing features such as weather, temperature, radiation, and colonization \n+ Many different generated structures such as buildings and towns that generate on some of the planets, with origins of each race \n+ An upgrading and advancement tree that takes time and effort that is always enjoyable. Exploration is necessary to advance upon it, is unique to each race, and customizable to each player \n+ Crew members can be added to your ship, but I'll say more later \n+ Your own space station can be created for players and NPCs to visit \n+ You can create and fully cutomize a mech to fly through space and stomp along the ground \n+ You can visit and trade inside of other space stations full of NPCs / other players \n+ You can create colonies for NPCs to live in \n+ Treasures can be discovered pretty much anywhere \n+ Tech can give you powers like dashing, jumping, and morphing into a ball \n+ The bosses get harder and are all quite cleverly created \n+ The quests link into the web of connections that advance your tech, systems, and story \n+ Moddable in any way you like, from the intro scene to Robbie Rotten's clothes \n+ Vehicles such as hover bikes and boats are available. \n+ Port forwarding isn't required to host games, your friends can join you through Steam at any time \n+ Tiny easter eggs and hints from the devs can be found throughout the game \n+ It's fairly cheap price-wise, I mean it's a fourth of No Man's Sky and four hundred times better \n+ The soundtrack is beautiful and has brought tears to my eyes more times than I'd like to admit \n+ So many possibilities that can lead to my 700 plus hours on this game \n\nNeutralities \n~ The universe doesn't feel losslessly empty and gigantic, it's fairly easy to get from star to star \n~ Life is extremely abundant \n~ 2D and pixelated; the graphics aren't 'next gen' \n\nCons \n- You can't customize the exterior of your ship \n- Crew members are a little dumb AI-wise and not extremely useful \n- It's a bit slow paced, which a lot people don't like [strike] because they all are stupid and get bored way too fast and don't have the drive to actually work for anything [/strike] but I love it. \n\nTL;DR \n* It's a great space exporation game with a web of slow-ish paced advancement that's extremeley wide in possibilites and customization.\n* Much of the game is unique, including the races, planets, stars, and generated structures. \n* If you don't like it, you probably don't like space games :p\n- I don't understand why everyone is saying to stay out of the house? I went inside, they were super nice loving and caring people. The dude that owns the place is a butcher and has all kinds of quality meat. We had BBQ and showed me around the wheat farm. And his grandma, she can't see or hear very well, but she's incredibly sweet. They're both looking after a baby that's ABSOLUTELY ADORABLE!\n\nI don't get what all the fuss is about, I enjoyed my visit.\n- Gone Home is... okay. There's nothing particularly terrible about it, but it's hardly this amazing, revelatory experience that it's been portrayed as in the media. It's just a very short, straightforward game of exploration, in which a fairly simple story of teenage love and rebellion is fed to you through bits and pieces of notes and spoken journal entries you find while exploring a large, abandoned house. But this game does absolutely nothing innovative, unlike the pre-release hype proclaimed. There have been hundreds of games with more compelling stories, and this game introduces no original mechanics. I took my time and explored the entire house, and I beat the game in three sessions totalling 81 minutes.\n\nAgain, it's not bad, it's just an utter ripoff for $20. I got it in a large Humble Bundle package, paying about a dollar for it, and it's decent value at that price, but there's no way I'd pay more than five bucks, and even that is stretching it. I'd be pissed if I'd paid full retail for it. You can find many many games that will be far more engrossing, more entertaining, and just plain longer at this price point.\n- I only have 3 hours in this game but I can say it ain't worth £45. Graphics are trying to look cool but just look crap. Glitched unit textures. Runs well doesn't crash but I just hate the changes from the old total war games. Unit icons look crap I can't tell what is what. My general dies there are no notifications. Can't find how much ammo archers have. No tutorial at all. Tried attacking a tier 1 settlement only to lose everything to the towers. I'd rather play rome 2. I really hate the general idea, the fact that any old general can rock up and kill 600 men is stupid.\n- If Hayao Miyazaki directed a video game I feel like it'd be something like Owlboy. By which I mean; stunning visuals, incredible soundtrack and a wonderful story. The three intertwine so well that I'd consider it to be my Ocarina of Time for Pixel Platformers.\nAnd an indie game that's so damn beautiful it made me write my first review.\n- This game vs. HOI3:\n---------------------\n\nAdvantages:\n\n1.) The production system is more interesting and engaging, and far more balanced than the old IC system of HOI3. \n2.) The unit creation system is far more in depth and interesting, featuring many different brigade types and support companies, allowing you to change your divisions however you would like. \n3.) This game is far more stable than HOI3.\n4.) This game is updated regularly and has bugfixes regularly too, with content being added free along with every DLC. \n5.) The modding community of HOI4 is far larger with excellent mods such as Kaiserreich, Millenium Dawn, Red World, and Endseig.\n6.) HOI4 muliplayer is actually playable without making you want to shoot yourself.\n7.) China is no longer something Japan can take within 2 months.\n8.) An actual peace conference system and ideologies that actually impact the game.\n9.) Far easier to get into than HOI3.\n10.) Less railroading and the AI wont spaz if you do something ahistorical.\n11.) Planes are no longer as cancer as they used to be.\n12.) Far less micromanagement if you choose not to want to micro.\n13.) A better tutorial (still not a great one though.)\n\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n1.) The research system is bare bones in comparison to HOI3.\n2.) The War in the Pacific is basically nonexistant and naval warfare is awful (to be improved with next patch, being released eventually:tm:)\n3.) People dont really join the war in HOI4 unless theyre directly attacked, making continents like South America completely useless due to the fact that none of the countries there ever do anything but still build up their military, contributing lag.\n4.) Due to the game's engine, it can only use a single one of your processing cores, meaning regardless of your computer quality the game will run kinda slowly.\n5.) Speaking of slowly, the game is poorly optimized and frame loss is extremely common, especially 1942 onwards, when majors can have upwards of 300+ divisions. \n6.) The AI is often braindead, doing hilariously incompetent things such as charging endlessly into your lines, removing all its troops from your front, leaving major areas completely undefended, and completely ignoring the aerial aspect of the war.\n7.) Specific AI are even more braindead than the rest, specifically island nations, or nations that otherwise need to use navies and airforces more. Yes, the Japanese, American, and British AI are some of the worst in the game. In a WW2 game. \n8.) Your allies are completely useless and often you will find yourself doing all the fighting yourself, or even being hindered by your own allies. Playing as Germany the Italians likely wont place a single division in North Africa. In D-Day, you will either be the only one contributing anything or your allies will contribute so much that the supply is ruined and your troops all die of attrition. As the USSR you will recieve 0 lend lease, and as China you will get absolutely no support from the west. \n9.) HOI3 is a lot cheaper than HOI4\n\n\nOther things which I feel are worth mentioning but arent really advantages or disadvantages:\n\n1.) HOI4 contains a lot more alt-history options, which while not for everyone, are fun to try out. \n2.) The focus-tree system is something completely different from anything in HOI3.\n3.) The game has a less in-depth OOB(Order of Battle), which while to some people is nice because theyre bad with OOB, others dislike. Specifically this game lacks corps. \n4.) The battle-planning system of HOI4, while easier to use than the one in HOI3, is still flawwed. In HOI3 it did absolutely nothing, but in this game it is a core part of playing. Unless you want to mircomanage every single division, like you did in HOI3, you will use this system. \n5.) While simpler, the game still possesses a learning curve.\n\n------------------------\n\nOverall: \n\nHOI4 is a far less grounded and historical experience than HOI3. Is this a good or bad thing? That depends on your perspective. HOI4 obviously has significant advantages over HOI3 in certain areas but many consider HOI3 to be an overall better game. Personally I recommend HOI3 if you want a more micro-intensive, historical experience, and HOI4 if you want to just sit back and relax for a couple hours murdering millions of people. \n\nPersonally I would suggest either game, but thats just me.\n- You had me at creating adventure log, well actually no, at the starting song perhaps. How many years have I been waiting for full fledge, non portable DQ since DQVIII in PS2 ?\n\nThis PC port is a great one, neat and very beautiful. I was playing at 4k/~30fps and since my GPU is not fast enough I switched to 1440p/~50-60fps instead. I wish more and more JRPGs to do PC concurrent launch like this one. A day later I switched back to 4k and change internal resolution to 80% then it was pretty much perfect.\n\n- You can choose default A/B button.\n- You can choose resolution and 30/60 FPS mode. There is a way to unlock 60+ FPS for gaming monitors, google it.\n- You can invert cameras both ways.\n- You can choose classic battle mode.\n- You can press L3 and enjoy the view.\n- Load time is non-existence with SSD.\n- Ultra Widescreen is NOT supported. Waiting for mods at the moment.\n- Keyboard and Mouse is fine but playing with controller is wayy better.\n- Fully customisable keys / controllers.\n- Story synopsys at game loading screen.\n- Silent Protagonist.\n- Full voice cutscenes.\n- Auto-run button.\n- You can jump.\n- An Excelent, well polished shmup(except for one technical fault) with great graphics and music.\n\nNot much to say other than it has fun boss fights with some creative bullet patterns, you have a gauge that fills up and when activated it doubles your fire power, and also you have bombs. If you have bombs and you get hit, you lose all of your bombs instead of just dying straight out, so you essentially have 2 hit points. You have a graze meter as well, meaning that if bullets pass by you it fills that meter up, when it is full, all bullets around you are basically nullified, and any enemy you kill, any bullets it fired at you will also get nullified. When you pass through the nullifeid bullets, it will fill the first gauge I mentioned so you can go ape s**t more often.\n\nIt's fairly simple, but the pace of the game takes a little while to get used to, the speed of your ship releative to the bullets is a little too slow but it's not game breaking. The only major issue is that my controller is not detectable by the game so I have to use joytokey, so I can't make full use of my controllers analog controls.\n- Not what the developers promised.\nFeels like a graphics mod for Chivalry.\n\nI'm not a fan of Chivalry either. I had some fun with it, but couldn't bear the clunkiness and wished for intuitive controls and realistic fights. Mordhau promised exactly that. \nAlthough it's equally clunky und even more buggy.\n\nAlso it doesn't offer the option to play in private rooms with your friends (duel mode) or only on paid servers. Inviting a friend to a local match should be a standard feature.\n\nAll the new content and features don't really matter - it's a PvP fighting game. I need only a couple of weapons that work, not 100+ that don't.\n- This game is meditation, the thought-cleansing effect of driving a thousand kilometres along the highway cannot be understated. Occasionally poor AI choices behind the wheel may spike your blood pressure but overwhelmingly ETS2 is a relaxing thing to stick on after a rough day. And if that's not enough you can just drive into oncoming traffic in your indestructible death machine.\n\nAn alternate title for this game could be \"Zen and the Art of Logistics\".\n- Minesweeper influenced design feels like a fresh take on the Slay-the-Spire-like genre.  Now that I've won with all six classes, and done some of the unlockable difficulty levels, I feel that I've gotten my money's worth with the game, and I have enjoyed the time I've spent so far, but I don't expect great longevity beyond this point.\n\nI do have some minor gripes:\n\n* The pacing on unlocking new classes feels too slow.  It would be nice if the approach was the fairly standard one of unlocking a new class when you win with the previous one, but here there is a currency which is acquired throughout runs, and I found that I usually had to have two winning runs with the previous class to earn enough currency to unlock a new one.\n* Optimal play with some classes requires memorizing tiles which are revealed, and then on later turns these tiles are hidden.  Taking damage because I misremembered what was hidden behind a tile feels unfun and at-odds with what the game otherwise wants to be.\n* I would prefer if the harder difficulty settings were unlocked from the get-go, rather than grinding through easier difficulty settings to find the challenge.\n\nOtherwise, though, it's a fun game with an adorable art style, and not just a clone of the other Spire-likes around.  Recommended if your expectation is to get ten hours or so of strategic puzzling.\n- I backed this game back at the end of September 2013 and have finally played it through to completion. \n\nCandle is a beautifully unique game which takes elements from puzzle, platforming and point and click adventures. The puzzles, although sometimes frustratingly difficult, are all different and use different mechanics keeping the game engaging and fresh. Teku's Candle is such a interesting game mechanic that I really enjoyed getting to know and learn. As previously said, the game looks and sounds absolutely stunning. I don't think I have seen a game that looks this good before and that is attritubuted to every character and scene being hand drawn. Controls can be a bit finicky but not game breaking and you can easily adjust too. I would recommend getting this game because it provides a great whole experience.\n- The good news is the driving physics, fuel and tire mechanics, and multiplayer design are the best the series has ever been. However, the overall package, performance, and presentation are significantly lacking in this game at launch. Unless you're desperate, hold off on purchasing this game until the developers have had time to put in additional content and fix the numerous bugs and the odd design choices they've made that I think may need to be changed. There's a lot of work that needs to be done on this game for it to be considered a complete racing game.\n \nThe performance on an 8700K+RTX4070 has been inconsistent at 1440p. While playing with frame rate unlocked at a mix of ultra and high settings I can get FPS into the high 80s but this is accompanied by regular drops of about 20 FPS so I felt it required the 60 FPS lock setting which was a bit disappointing. The other disappointment comes in how the game looks, which frankly is not visually pleasing even at the highest possible settings and generally just not a sharp enough picture no matter what you adjust.\n\nSo overall it’s a bit of a mixed bag. The racing itself is engaging and fun but the choices the developers have made with this game for presentation and functionality leave much to be desired. If it receives good post-launch support it may correct a lot of those issues but at launch it’s a bit disappointing and I do not recommend buying it.\n- Do I really have to write this review? I am just one in thousands of people who wrote a positive reveiw for Garry's Mod. Chances are, this review will never convince someone to buy Garry's Mod. It'll just be lost in the 100,000 positive reviews out there. Well, here I go anyway.\n\n\"Where do I start?\" This is the question asked by anyone playing Gmod for their first time. It's also my question that I ask about this review I am writing. Hmm...\n\n_The gameplay...the gameplay...hmm... Well, there's singleplayer sandbox. You can do...uh, whatever you want really. Just addon a few addons, and you can be entertained for hours. Battle NPCs, make cool scenes for cool screenshots, explore maps, be a superhero (spiderman addon!), and much, much, much, much- you get my point, right? Almost all content is user-generated. Make your own content! Multiplayer. In Multiplayer Gmod you can roleplay. I'm talking normal RP (DarkRP), Military RP, Star Wars RP, etc, etc. In multiplayer Gmod, you can battle, prophunt (yay), hide 'n seek, and much, much, more.\n\n_Graphics? I'll rate the graphics...drumroll please... 7/10. This game is and older game. Came out in 2006. I guess the graphics are good for 2006, and people enjoy the game and don't complain much about the graphics, but I'm not gonna lie, they are outdated and look old. It's not 2006 anymore.\n\n_Hear the bullets flying. The zombies growling. The people chatting. The boxes jumping... The sound in this game is great! Every sound is loud and clear, and there are a varitey of sounds.\n\n_Play this game. Play it again. Play it some more. Play some now, and play some later. Play it over and over. Play it as long as you want.\n\n_My Personal opinion. Get this game. Now. Get Gmod on sale or not. I'm not gonna stop playing it for a while and I'm already at 50+ hours of playtime. I love this game! WAIT! Before you go and buy this, then you wonder why there are all the missing maps and errors in most games, get Counter Strike: Source, so ALL the textures are supported. You need it to play MOST multiplayer games.\n\n\nGameplay: 9/10\nGraphics: 7/10\nStory: N/A\nSound: 8/10\nReplayability: 10/10\n\nOverall 8.5\n\nEven though, this is one positive review on Garry's Mod, out of the thousands of positive reviews that have been submitted Garry's Mod, I hope this one convinces you to buy... Gmod\n\n-Star_Hawk_\n- Joined the Discord Server to get a sense of the toxic, immature, insulting community. If the Discord server is not moderated, which is the first impression for new players, then you know in what state the game is.\n- It looked old when it was released. Now it's downright ugly. The gunplay is clunky. The physics are terrible. The bugs are ever present.\n\nThe RPG mechanics are top notch. The choices you make matter.\n\nOne of the greatest games ever made.\n- EDIT: I nominated this game for game of the year (2023)\n\nLong ago I had heard about this game and how detailed and intricate it could be, and how you could spend hours upon hours building the massive empire of dwarves only for it to all come crashing down in some spectacular but unforeseen way.  Then I got into Rimworld briefly and thought it was ok, but it tended toward chaos a bit too much for my liking.  THEN I heard this game was coming to steam and I eagerly awaited it.\n\nIt's not necessarily that I was too good to play a game with mostly ascii/character graphics (I used to play them a lot back in the 1980s).  I was more intimidated by the depth of the game and not knowing if there was a wiki for it (there is) or how I'd find help if I needed it (I'm sure there's a ton of communities JUST for this game).  I expected that when it came to Steam, it'd be beefed up and worth the wait.\n\nWell it finally arrived and I think I'm STILL a bit intimidated by the sheer amount of options you have... mostly because it's not just me that I have to worry about, but a whole community of dwarves.  In the case of something like minecraft, I could dig a whole intricate tunnel and if stuff starts to go bad, I just high-tail it out of there and recover until I can go back and finish it.  In Dwarf Fortress though, if stuff starts to go bad, you can't just leave.  You are encouraged to deal with the adversity and push onward in the name of greatness... or something.\n\nIn a way it's like role playing, except you don't have to roll character sheets and you don't really control any of the characters directly.  You make decisions about where to mine, what trees to chop down, what to build, what to trade, what to plant, and for every thing there is a season (turn turn turn).  You're forced to deal with death, birth, attacks, sickness, madness, and a ton of other things that I have no idea are coming.  \n\nI keep thinking \"I could do better\" and I start a new game, but then I start to realize that no matter what I do, I'm never gonna have a perfect game, or a game where everything goes exactly according to plan.  I am eventually going to have to buckle down and stick to one game save to see it through.\n\nIf you're like me and starting something new holds a lot more interest than continuing an existing project (ADHD?) you may have difficulty with this game.  At the same time you may become so engrossed in it that you lose track of time and suddenly it's 6am and you wonder why you stayed up all night digging holes.  I'm starting to feel a bit of the madness myself.  (it's almost 4:30am as I write this)\n\nIn any case, it's probably not for everyone, but I'd say if you're unsure, find the non-steam version and try that, and if you can grok what's going on and it interests you, definitely buy this and support the developers... OR buy this and try to stay under the 2 hour refund  limit while you learn the basics (Good luck with that, it'll be 6 hours before you know what happened).  I believe this game is worth the money though (full price).  If you were going to wait for a sale you'd be waiting a long time anyway.  \n\nTL;DR If this looks interesting to you, don't wait! Buy now.  If you aren't sure, do a bit of research and come back and buy it.\n- Phat beatsies,\nSelf-deprecating humour that gives me self affirmation,\nPanders to my need for nostalgic nods,\nPlays smoothly, and so doesn't leave me stuck for hours helping me to feel like I have higher than average intelligence,\nMesses about with you based on the assumption of previous adventure game experience, which leads to making me go \"heh\" outloud more than three times.\n\nMildly amusing, could use more super space dust.\nPlayed on the \"hard\" difficulty option but activated other options out of curiosity, would recommend it for the extra shenanigans.\n\nIf I had to give it a score 8/10,\nWould pay for the soundtrack, that ear crack is cash money.\n\nA hell of a lot of work was put into this game & I suggest you press \" J \" on as many screens as you can handle to get some insight on the thought process behind this game, the effort and imagination that went into it.\n\nThe missing 2 points:\nfew bugs to work out, ain't no big but in a game where you are going to be thinking \"it's not progressing because I haven't mashed the appropriate non-sensical things together\" it needs to not bug out.\n\nSoundtrack not yet out - nah not actually taking points away from that, it'll be out soon as I understand it, but I need that fix Mr. Shellburger.\n- Instead of spending 30€+ on a game you'll never play, buy this. For 2€ you'll get more than your money's worth.\n- This was a impulse buy for me just have seeing the new \"Fury Road\", but its a great game so far was kinda shocked it ran smooth right out the gate seems like today you gotta wait a week or month before a game can run proper though. Anyways beatufiful lighting, models / textures look good, vehicle combat / driving is fun, and vehicle customization is cool too. The on foot combat feels a little too straight foward though, the gore animations are kinda boring though, like feels like its a Xbox/360 game in that way, and collecting scrap can get a little repetitive. My final thought yea this game is worth getting but if you haven't played id's \"RAGE\", I'd reccomend getting that first, it's a extremely simmilar although kinda diffrent scenario game that will quench your Mad Max thirst.\n- *LOOK INTO SAFETY/SECURITY RISKS BEFORE BUYING THIS GAME*\n\n     Playing this game online can be risky as hackers are able find your IP address, mess with your in-game / weapons / health / money, find out your personal information, install rats on your PC & even get into your computer. Although this isn't super common it's still a legitimate thing that people need to know about & should look into before spending their money on this game. It doesn't happen as much to random players but Streamers have to play this game in offline mode whenever they stream themselves playing otherwise the hackers will mess with whatever they're doing by trying to get them banned. \nPlease google \"Black ops 3 PC security risks 2022\". It really is a shame that Treyarch isn't coming back to fix this very serious problem in their game, but let's be real Activision  more than likely isn't letting them. \n\nTL;DR: Be cautious of potential security issues, but I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes Call of Duty Zombies / zombies in general or who wants to get into the Call of Duty Zombies franchise.\n\nNow for my review:\n     Best call of duty game ever for Zombies. Definitely can be a challenge to find multiplayer matches nowadays but zombie matches aren't hard to find as long as you're playing the \"popular\" maps. The \"less popular\" maps are more difficult to find a match on but it's still possible, especially if you search for a match at the right time of day. This goes for multiplayer as well, if you search for a match during specific times you will be more likely to find matches (I'm not entirely sure when these times are so I wont even leave my guess here). This is likely because of people in different time-zones getting up / getting off work or school and getting on the game.\n     This game is the best thing to ever happen to the Zombies series in terms of gameplay, storyline, progression & more. There are endless tasks, items & surprises in each map that keep you coming back for more and having a different experience each time! It truly is a wonderful & fun game that has offered me more re-play ability than any other game I've ever experienced, especially with custom zombies/mod tools. With community made maps there's literally endless maps/levels to play on, & because of mod tools we not only have the remakes that come with Zombies Chronicles but we also have the visually stunning remakes of Mob of the Dead, Call of the Dead & Town, with Buried as well as Die Rise on the way for 2023/2024! I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes Call of Duty Zombies / zombies in general or who wants to get into the Call of Duty Zombies franchise.\n- theres 2 options with this game, either you play the original without mods wich is still a very good game\nor you have the untitled goose, matt from wii sports, sans undertale, and barack obama fight on top of a mcdonalds\n\n10/10 game\n- Big improvement over the first game. \n\nCombat is much more enjoyable and the boss fights actually have some interesting patterns and design. I had some issues with taking damage when being too close to the boss which was frustrating but not too huge of an issue. Boss patterns felt fair and it felt like I really learned the fight in and out by the time I beat them.\n\nPersonally I found the overworld a bit less visually interesting than the first; though travelling back and forth between two different worlds was a nice touch. The overworld also has lot of mazes, much more than I remember in the first game. That being said, I spent much less time not knowing how to progress in the game which is nice.\n\nAudio-Visual presentation is excellent as to be expected. Though I also felt the narrative to be more interesting this time around. I was able to follow the narrative pretty well and the plot even has some pretty good twists. Overall another improvement over the first game.\n\nIn general I found this a lot less frustrating to play than the first game; allowing for the game's good points to work better. Given this I have a much easier time recommending this than the first game, which was always a very cautious recommendation from me. It should be noted that this game has many references to the prequel so it should be played before this; even if doing so is a bit rough. If the third game improves on this I would have very little issue recommending the whole trilogy.\n\n\n- If you played the OG this is basically the same but with a few added side stories you can unlock as you complete different routes in the game. The extra dlc maybe would take you a bit over an hour to complete all of them if you speed through it, but does not have any optional dialogue so it's more of just some lore and extra character interactions. Still pretty solid dlc if you are a fan and want a little bit of extra stuff :)\n- It's a pretty game, but there's no option for manual saves, and autosaves only happen once in a great while instead of immediately after solving each puzzle or progressing through conversations. I also felt like the walking was extremely clunky with the mouse and keyboard, and I'd prefer click-to-walk.\n- 1. Mea Culpa > Ruego Al Alba\n2. combat feels much better\n3. oops no instakill traps\n4. [strike]bleeding crown prayer is too strong[/strike] wtf, just got the time stop prayer\n- This does what I wish AAA RPGs with narratives would do; choices actually feel like they make an impact and the gameplay changes that reflect this are dynamic in nature and provide meaningful differences in the conversations.\n\nIt doesn't feel this way on a macro scale, the meaning is more in the individual encounters with some exceptions. To word it a little differently, I felt like my choices had very little impact on the story as a whole and I could easily (a little too easily) steer the final outcome at any time but, within individual interrogations, what I chose to do had a major affect on the immediate narrative.\n\nThat being said, it is a wonderful game to play for four to six hours on a Sunday and at $15 USD it is cheap and entertaining enough to only need a single playthrough to feel like you've gotten your money's worth. Although I haven't started my second playthrough, I'm already thinking about when I want to sit down and have another go.\n- I have played OSU!, Muse Dash and stepmania plenty and I gotta say that this does not feel like a rhythm game at all. The premise of matching the shape of the map to music sounds interesting but some of the songs I feel like are not mapped out correctly. Or in general this game relies less on music cues and more on visual cues? It felt like maps are only 50% related to the song and you have to ignore what you hear because the map randomly demands patterns that have no matching audio equivalent and everything becomes pure visual memorization.\n- A masterpiece of a game that had it's potential destroyed by EA's stupidity to release it between a new COD and BF game :( :( this game is worth the full price just for the single player campaign alone, the movement and shooting mechanics in this game is top notch and many other games have tried to mimic it. I've played through the single player 4 times now (twice on ps4, once on xbox and once on pc) and every single time the game has been a blast, trust me play it :) I really hope respawn/ea make titanfall 3\n- Do yourself a favor.  Go in as blind as possible.  Don't look at any guides.  The system of getting pages of the manual that you can't fully understand is a stroke of genius.\n\nAlso I haven't found a waterfall that *doesn't* have a secret behind it.\n\n**EDIT: Finished the game**\n\nI'll admit for many of the later \"post-game puzzles\" I looked at a guide for.  The in game language is very difficult to decipher blindly, and if you're not familiar with English you probably shouldn't even bother.  \n\nThe surprising thing about this game is you can pretty much do any puzzle at any given time once you get one or two specific items, but because of how the manual is handled, you'll never know how until you see the pages (or experiment a lot)\n\nI think the most amount of tries I've spent on a boss fight was 7-8, but nothing is stopping you from exploring more and finding stat boosts.\n- We need a 60fps patch ASAP. Having 30fps content on PC in [current year] is not acceptable.\n\nOther than that the game is pretty solid! It looks great, it plays great, the story was good imo, the characters are interesting and the amount of solo content is decent.\n\nHowever, the gear system is not as elaborate as in Mk11 and the microtransations are NOT a welcome sight. Denuvo also has to go. If Harada agreed that the addition of Denuvo in Tekken 7 was a mistake, so should NetherRealm.\nI also don't like that 2 characters that are going to be in the Kombat Pass are already in the game (Ermac and Quan Chi). Just give us these characters and come up with other ones for the KP. This is super greedy and lazy.\nIt's even worse than Sektor and Cyrax in MK11, at least you didn't let us play them, period. this time you decide to not make them playable (even thought they work for the AI) AND sell them at a later date? That's awful.\n\nThe game is good but needs improvement and shouldn't ship with performance issues, 30fps content, microtransactions, Denuvo and greedy DLC tactics. I would put a \"meh\" review if I could because of the negatives but for that reason I have to say \"no\".\n- I have a serious love/hate relationship with Sea of Thieves. It is both one of the best games I have ever played and one of the most frustrating games I have ever played, all wrapped into one. The gameplay of Sea of Thieves is INCREDIBLE. The sailing is the best in any game I have ever played. The feeling of exploration and discovery as you blast through treasure hunts and puzzles and mysteries is unlike any feeling you can get from any other game. The cooking mechanic, the healing from food, the not-terrible fishing mechanic... all subsystems that prop up the rest of the gameplay are unique and interesting in their own right. The land-based combat is relatively uninspired, yet still satisfying when part of the greater picture that the game presents. Some of my favorite memories in gaming, full stop, come from completing long nights on the high seas or doing long-form content available in the game. The game is gorgeous, some of the best ocean/water graphics in any game. The rest of the game is equally beautiful while perfectly conveying the environment of the map you are in. I swear to Gaben that I can freaking smell the wet sand or sulfurous lava on some of these islands. The music and sound design are some of the best in the industry. Outright, the game is incredible. \n\nBUT... Sea of Thieves sweaties ruin the game for me. There is absolutely nothing worse than having a night full of fun absolutely destroyed by some player who's enjoyment of the game is derived from eliminating anyone else's fun. I understand that PvP is part of the \"pirate life\", but it is by far the worst part of the game by far. I would be willing to pay money, hell a freaking monthly subscription, for the opportunity to play SoT as a strictly PvE game with just my friends and the rest of the server populated by bots. I actively avoid playing the game now because of how many of my last play sessions started with me spawning at an outpost and subsequently being sunk less than 15 feet off the dock by some sweaty that hasn't seen sunlight since the Obama administration. I know that this is an incredibly unpopular opinion in the greater SoT-sphere, but part of the enjoyment of games is letting players enjoy them how they wish, and I really freaking wish that I could enjoy the aspects of SoT that are fun to me without being the plaything of those pirates who live only to ruin the fun of others.\n\n【グループB】\n- [h1]An old classic that's fresher than lots of today's titles.[/h1]\n\n[i]Day of the Tentacle[/i] first launched in 1993. I remember, because I was a teenager then and couldn't play it as my PC didn't meet the minimum requirements! This was actually the sequel to an earlier game, [i]Maniac Mansion[/i], which was released in 1987. I played [i]Maniac Mansion[/i] a few years after it came out, but did not complete it as the game's movement and controls were just too dated and clunky for me (even back then) to be bothered with. \n\nPlaying [i]Maniac Mansion[/i] is not at all necessary in order to enjoy [i]Day of the Tentacle[/i], though those who have will definitely find greater connection to the game's characters, especially the Edison family.\n\n23 years later, [i]Day of the Tentacle Remastered[/i] is essentially the same as it was before, but with sleeker graphics and a more modernised interface. While the story hasn't changed, it surprisingly (or not) hasn't aged one bit either - tentacle mutates and seeks to conquer the world, and only you (and your friends) can stop him! Though straightforward, the game's charm is in its various amusing time travel locations and the weird and wonderful characters you meet along the way. This is a prime example of where [i]\"it's all about the journey, not the destination.\"[/i]\n\n\n[h1]Yays![/h1]\n\n+ Vibrant, colourful, hi-res cartoon-style graphics.\n+ Well-designed rooms, locations and scenery.\n+ Fully voiced, with good voice acting for the most part. (The guy who plays Dr Fred is awesome.)\n+ Interesting, memorable characters.\n+ Fun, amusing story.\n+ Wacky humour.\n+ Clear goals.\n+ Cool easter eggs. (Under \"achievements\".)\n+ Contains a free game ([i]Maniac Mansion[/i])!\n+ Puzzles are mostly enjoyable and require some creative thinking.\n+ Many gameplay hours.\n+ Trading cards.\n\n[h1]Nays.[/h1]\n\n- [url=steamcommunity.com/app/388210/discussions/0/392184522713202518/]Audio starts stuttering[/url] after a while, due to memory problems.\n- Achievements remain hidden, even after the game is completed, so you can't see what you're missing.\n- Some puzzles have illogical or nonsensical solutions.\n- Bugs: e.g. When looking at one of the items, Laverne's voice sounds when Bernard speaks.\n- No mouse command to fast-forward dialogue; instead, you have to press \".\" which is really inconvenient, especially when the whole point of a point-n-click game is to [i]not[/i] have to use your keyboard!\n- Some counter-intuitive puzzle set-ups: E.g. For the videotape puzzle, a button which looks like the \"STOP\" button, is actually the \"RECORD\" button. Anyone who's ever used a VCR or tape recorder would know that the square symbol denotes \"STOP\", while the round button denotes \"RECORD\". \n- Hoagie's periodic belches sound absolutely disgusting!\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nThis was a hugely enjoyable experience from start to finish. Though the nostalgia factor played a part in my case, even if you've never heard of the [i]Maniac Mansion[/i] series, as long as you count yourself a point-n-click adventure game fan, this is a must-play because it just gets so many things right. Add to that the timeless plot and wacky characters, and you have yourself a game that will play just as fresh & new decades down the road.\n\n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [td][u]Disclaimer:[/u] [i]Game played for free, with many thanks to my dear friend [url=steamcommunity.com/id/kflorence]KFlo[/url]. :)[/i][/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n- [b]My playtime:[/b] 14.5h (based on Steam, 100% achievement)\n[b]Grindy Achievement(s):[/b] Yes (1+ achievement).\n[b]Optional Achievement(s):[/b] Yes (33 achievements).\n[b]Difficult Achievement(s):[/b] No.\n\n[h1]Intro[/h1]\nYou wake up in a place you don't recognize. Greeted by a traffic light, you tried to remember what was happening. It turns out that you have a unique ability: reading an object's memory. As unreal as it sounds, [b]UNREAL LIFE[/b] tries to help you make sense of everything through a series of adventures and events.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n- Multiple endings, with variations of bad endings and one true ending\n- Cleverly-executed puzzles\n- Subtle hints in case you're stuck\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n- Unable to skip cutscenes\n- People who have trouble with flashing lights can't fully experience the game\n\n[h1]Should you buy this game?[/h1]\n[b]Yes.[/b]\n[i]If you like to play atmospheric games, buy this at a sale. People who have problems with flashing lights should avoid this game since the game isn't as good as it is with some options turned off.[/i]\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1]In-Depth Review[/h1]\n\n[h3]Visuals[/h3]\nThe developer spends a lot of effort crafting beautiful, quality cutscenes. Some scenes show the beauty of the night sky while others show what the main character is feeling from close range. Food images look so carefully made that I couldn't believe that it was a pixelated image at first. Every scene does a good job in supporting the story, combined with the relaxing music that is running in the background.\n\nBlurry effects are applied on the screen, whether it's just to make a certain area stand out or create a cool-looking effect for the cutscenes. The game relies on a lot of transitions in its cutscenes, some can leave you shocked with the inverted images and flashes of red colors at intense moments. People that have problems with these can soften the red color in the option with the downside of making the scene to be less effective. Moreover, since the option affects all red colors in the game, some scenes will look weird with the faded color.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441881358 \n\n[h3]Story[/h3]\nThe story is a relaxing one, set in a place where people are helpful and empathetic to your actions. Every character gives a positive vibe through their attitude and kindness, supporting you whenever you are down or helping you to enjoy the moment. Reading the interaction between characters warm my heart, especially when accompanied by the relaxing music that is playing in the background.\n\nThe storytelling is wonderfully done with the combination of visuals and music to let you drown in the story. Sometimes, an intense moment kicks in, changing the scenery into one full of effects and transitions. The fast-paced music also helps to set the mood with its upbeat tone, increasing the intensity. The ending is told in a similar manner, although instead of an intense moment, it crafts a touching scene instead that is fit for an ending. Some people will find a small part of the ending not to make any sense, although luckily, it won't affect the overall experience.\n\n[h3]The Game[/h3]\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nThe game is focused on reading memories of an object to progress. Your hidden ability to read an object's memory by touching it will help you to solve various tasks, ranging from looking a lost object to finding a hidden area. There are some limitations though - some objects have no memories that you can read while other objects can't be interacted with until they are discovered. Fortunately, they are quite easy to discover as long as you spam the space button and/or pay attention to the dialogues.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441881785 \n\n[b]Puzzles and Minigames[/b]\nThe rest of the gameplay is focused on the usual adventure games where you have to pick up items and use them to pass through the area. Most problems that you will have to solve has the same theme as the building you are in. It's nice to see how puzzles are related to the corresponding area while still being unique at the same time.\n\nMost puzzles and minigames are easy to solve except for a select few. I found the last one to be the trickiest because not only does it cover a huge area, but it also requires you to use the mechanic from a previous area, something which never happened in other puzzles. It's still easy to solve as long as you are attentive enough, but if you happen to get stuck, the game offers subtle hints in the form of memories that you can read.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441883206 \n\n[b]Length and Replayability[/b]\nI finished the game in 9.7h after experiencing all the bad endings. Although the game only offers one manual save slot, it has an extra checkpoint slot that you can load before the story branches off. A hidden secret can also be found after you finished the game, which might take a long time to find due to its randomness. I found it to be a waste of time though, especially since there isn't much that you can learn from the secret. You'll also be left with more questions than answers, giving more reason not to look for them unless if you are an achievement hunter or the curious type.\n\n[b]Problems[/b]\nDespite the game requires you to restart the game several times, you can't skip the cutscenes. Some parts of the game will lead you to a bad ending and the unskippable cutscenes can take a significant amount of time if you don't know how to bypass it. Moreover, checkpoints tend to be placed minutes before the story branches off, wasting more of your time. Lastly, the game isn't very clear whenever it autosaves your game. I had to save manually whenever I took a break from the game because of this.\n\n[h1]Specs[/h1]\nIntel Core i5-9300H 2.40GHz, 8GB RAM, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nThe game has a lot of elements that complement each other. The nice-looking visuals, the calm and relaxing music that can heat up in intense moments, the superb effect - everything blends well to make the story stands out. The detailed cutscenes are done well to capture the emotion that can't be portrayed with a simple portrait and character animation, while portraits are expressive enough to handle simple expressions. The game is designed with quality in mind and although it can be slow sometimes, the relaxing music helps you to savor the moment.\n\n[quote]This game was reviewed with a key provided by the developer for free through [url=https://discord.gg/xc22zZP]Reviewers' Paradise[/url], a group that connects both developers and reviewers in one place[/quote]\n\n[quote]Visit SaveOrQuit.com for detailed game reviews, posted daily![/quote]\n- No additional account, no unnecessary launcher, no denuvo, no epic exclusivity, no microtransactions, just a video game as it always should be..\n- I bought the game and the mechanics are fun! The battle system is super impactful and just FEELS fun. It really gives you a sense of satisfaction. And it has interesting elements that really every game should have... but the UI sucks, the classes are genderlocked, and there are so many systems going on at once it's annoying. Like something as simple as a constant notification in the middle of the screen of some other person or random guild you know nothing about doing quests or getting skill points. It's a fun game, but has WAAAY too many minor (except genderlocked classes. Genderlock is never a minor thing) problems that just add up making it annoying to play\n- Before you play this, make sure you play these games in order. That is:\n- To the moon\n- Finding Paradise\n- Imposter factory.\n\nAs for this game, it is another gorgeous story that takes you on a journey into the realm of memories. I encourage you to play these games blindly and to read nothing about the story because that's what I did, and I was surely surprised and mindblown. As for the ending of this game, I am still processing it to this day!\n\nI can't wait to play the next game by Freebird Games.\n- Smooth beats, sick moves.\n\nOlliOlli was the best endless runner/rock hard skateboard move combo game I'd played in months. Well, the best just got better!\n\nWhy's it better? Polish, nollies, the aforementioned beats and some added smoothing.\n\nRad.\n- As i previously stated, i was going to play through metro fully and i have done so, so here is my update to this review. \nThis game is not the best selling triple A game in the world and it may have some bugs (like a table that wasnt solid or the objects in that room lol) however it is a decent game. the story is decent and the characters voices are way off but they sorta make up for it with their personalities. \n\nExploration in this game is by far one of the most interesting in my opinion and the way your character acts in the enviroment makes it more interesting aswell, for example wiping your visor when it gets dirty (wasnt that helpful for me in my play through but it was a nice touch) and your visor taking damage in combat adds to the immersive feel of this wasteland/paradise almost. Scavenging weapons and parts and combining them to make better equipment is quite intriguing and quick to do if you can find the parts. \n\nat the end of the day my final review of this is its a good game i would play it again even if it is a bit clunky sometimes (atleast it was for me lmao)\n\n\n\n\n\nOh and hopefully my punctuation is good enough so no one passes out this time lmao\n- Simply fantastic. Probably the best TRUE RPG I've ever played. Your choices matter, dialogue options matter, the order in which you do things matter, even such small things such as the items you hold in your hand matter. Every build is viable, go heavy in Physical stats and you'll have difficulty solving things Logically, but maybe you can brute force your way through something. Go heavy in Logic and you'll be weak in a one-to-one fight, but maybe you'll be so fast to figure things out that it'll never come to that. You'll see things that the dim-witted brute with high Physical didn't. Failure is encouraged, there are many routes in the game you cannot open without failing something else first.\n\nA true combat system does not exist. At all. Physical altercations are decided through dice rolls based on how you've built your character. And virtually all of them are optional. I like this decision a lot. I've always found it immersion-breaking in RPGs when you're just running around the countryside, killing every bandit or animal that comes your way. This one keeps fights realistic with REAL consequences depending how things go.\n\nBarring having to restart my game once due to a bug (quicksave often, autosaves are few), the game had no major technical issues. There was a single point in the game where a vital skill check required a specific skill to be built, and I'm not sure if there were any alternate routes. I couldn't find any, just had to savescum the check. Aside from that, you have options as to how to approach everything. I'm not sure if that was an oversight or if I just missed something.\n\nCan't go into the story much without spoilers (and you DON'T want it spoiled, it's great.) But it's very well-written and even hilarious at some points. But don't be fooled, it's not a comedy game. It tackles very serious topics such as Fascism, Communism, Mental Illness, Addiction, and many other things.\n\nOverall an amazing RPG experience that I cannot recommend enough. Will definitely play through this several times to see how things go with different builds. Highly suggest you purchase this if you have any interest.\n- You play as a girl dashing through enemies by pressing 2 buttons. That's literally it. Each stage is the length of a song and as you play more you'll unlock more songs. \n\n\nI highly recommend this game if you're a 5 year old who can be easily entertained.\n- It's hard to recommend Spelunky 2. Not because it is a bad game, but because it can be frustrating. As with most roguelikes, dying means going back to the beginning. In Spelunky however, nothing carries over to future runs. All you get to bring in to your next run is your own experience and knowledge; And when half the things in the game kill you instantly or stunlock you to death, having a great run end in a quick death can be damaging to one's will.\n\nThankfully, your own experiences count a great deal towards your progress. Most hazards and enemies in Spelunky 2 have a very simple and predictable behaviour. But keeping track of everything on the screen is still a challenge. Enemies and traps will also work together (or against each other) and still bring your demise somehow. Either by bumping your helplessly stunned body into other enemies and traps, or enemies having their own flaming corpse launched towards you and your flammable jetpack. It's actually quite funny sometimes. A good deal of entertainment can be had recording your own amazingly nonsensical deaths.\n\nSpelunky 2 improves upon Spelunky HD's gameplay by adding split paths, which allow for more variety and decision-making in your runs while staying true to the feeling and style of previous entries. It also adds a back layer to each level, allowing for more secrets to be kept. After successfully completing your first run, you can try to discover these secrets and find hidden bosses and areas and even different endings!\n\nAnyway, you might enjoy the game if you're a masochist or something.\n- I played the demo and instantly became enamored. The mix of Slay the Spire-style deck-building with elements of the ship combat from FTL: Faster Than Light is an absolutely fascinating mix, and the \"single-axis\" movement system adds a whole extra layer that I've never seen in anything except the Mega Man: Battle Network series.\n\nI bought the full game within the first hour of being available. After having played for nearly 4 hours at the time of writing, my opinion hasn't changed in the slightest. I already love what's available and so far I feel like I've barely scratched the surface.\n\nI can't wait to see what awaits in the future for this awesome title.\n\nEDIT: As a small addition, I will say: I beat my very first run, which is set to the lowest difficulty (Normal). I jumped up to Hard to try to unlock a new ship, and I haven't been able to beat a run since then. It's probably just that I'm bad, all things considered, but be aware that the changes made with difficulty increases are probably more impactful than they may seem.\n\nAlso I wanna say to the devs: thank you for launching the game with mod support and working on making it easier! But also please look into getting Steam Workshop support if you can!\n- Pros:\n> Decent selection of interior desing elements\n> Uncommon but interesting gameplay idea if you're into interior design and building\n> Fair price for amount of activities you get in base game\n> Gameplay leght\n> Regural updates\n\nCons:\n> You can't change location of windows in the house - some are placed in awkward places thus creating decent rooms becomes difficult\n> Game optimisation is questionable for such graphics  -  with RX vega 56 I barely get 60 fps \n> No replayability on same save file - once you sell property you cannot do it again\n> Once property is sold there's only some screenshots but no actual way to look around again\n> No steam workshop or mods\n\nIdeas for possible future updates:\n> Add floor plan design feature - building and demolishing walls 10 times is frustrating\n> Add ability to build custom houses and change locations of windows\n> Add ability to enter sold properties\n> Increase game performance\n\nDLCs:\n> HGTV DLC adds moderate amount of additional jobs\n> Garden DLC adds alot of activities outside the house but is a bit buggy. In my opinion some features should be in base game\n- Katana ZERO? More like, Katana ZERO CONCLUSION.\n\nI had too high expectation on this game, I thought it was going to be Hotline Miami but better.\nIn the end I still prefer Hotline Miami, specifically Hotline Miami 2.\n\nOne thing I dislike is the lack of combo scoring system. \nIt's a good way to make the players act fast and execute their actions flawlessly, instead the game only has a timer bar that never runs out as a way to motivate the player to go fast.\n\nI am aware how \"pointless\" game scores are.\nBut seeing a number going up feels good.\n\nWhat happens when you kill an enemy in Hotline Miami?\n - You get to see a number pops out, and the score goes up indicating that you are doing good!\n - Satisfying bloody hit sound.\n - Throbbing light on the edge of the map.\n - Randomized dead sprite of the enemy, sometimes they get dismembered depending on the weapon.\n\nIn Katana ZERO you'd get :\n - A \"fwoob\" sound.\n - A same dying animation of the enemy getting knocked and bleed to death. Instead of getting decapitated or something.\n - Flashy slash effect.\n\nAt one point I wondered on why should I even bother killing the enemies when it didn't reward me with anything in the room with a minecart. \nWhen having the enemy being killed by the minecart or the player makes no difference.\n\n[spoiler]More like Katana ZERO REWARD. I think this is it, exactly why I am disappointed by it. Imagine playing soulsbornekiro or Hollow Knight without earning any kind of currency??? Killing the enemies would feel pointless.[/spoiler]\n\nIt's basically way more fun and rewarding to kill an enemy in Hotline Miami than Katana ZERO.\n\nThen there are other stuff like...\nUnfun stealth gameplay. \nRollspamming without consequence.\nBeing able to endlessly doing a mid air attack without having to touch the ground first.\n\nThere are also waaaay too many checkpoints in my opinion, it encouraged me to just brute force everything with roll spamming without having to worry about starting over.\nThe rooms could've been a bit bigger and longer. But also less room, quality over quantity.\n\nAnd finally, the story.\nI was intrigued by it but it just ended abruptly with a \"To be continued\".\nIt's like they only wrote 50% of it then slapped a \"To be continued\" and called it a day.\nThe game seems to rely heavily on \"mentioning stuff off screen that player will never get to see\" to tease the player.\nI already knew that the game is going to be short, but I didn't expect it to be this disappointing. \n\nIt's not a bad game, I just had the wrong expectation.\n\nI might change it to positive if I was satisfied by the DLC.\nOr maybe after beating the hard mode, I heard it's more fun.\n- This game is far away in another galaxy from being anything but a 3/10 in my book. \nGame consists of a tack on level system with a few skills, corny jokes that make you cringe, copy paste worlds with sliding on ice, mud, or leaves depending on the world your on with vines to climb certain walls again....depending on the world your on, no dismemberment except on animals and main characters. Further all planets feel the same and after quite a few hours in the game I struggle to continue playing because of the cut and dry gameplay to where you will fight a couple animals, do some very linear parkour, then do a puzzle that will most likely include a sphere that you need to put into said location to unlock a door as such. graphics are eh..and I have to say the battlefront 2 campaign had more thought than this garbage. save your money and don't buy this\n- So um, I don't usually write reviews like this or much at all really. I mostly make unfunny jokes and call it a review or something super generic. I guess I'll just write whats on my mind.\n\nI really liked this game.\nI felt like I was a kid again playing Super Mario 64.\nSometimes I get tired of shooting guns. Or slashing fantasy monsters with some shiny sword. Or saving the magic land from evil. Or using hyper combos I never remember. Or collecting resources to build a quirky town. Or time managing some distant farm. Or driving some tricked out vehicles. Or investing in status points to make super strong characters. Or following a long and convoluted plot with crazy lore.\n\nSometimes I just wanna run and jump around while I pick up some cool looking stuff.\nI, uh, had a lot fun playing this game. \nThanks.\n- This game is great and is worth the cost, I have not tried it in VR yet but I imagine it's great....I have a slight urge to join the US military all of a sudden...\n- i would recomend it because the physics are great, the game has 8 or 9 level packs (i dont know if there will be a 9th because there are 7 at the time of this review) the units are diverse, there are a lot of secret units to find and i dont know for the final boss because the most expensive unit artimis isnt a good final boss like the dark pesant in the alphas but i hope that the games final boss unit is actually hard to kill and requires more than 7 archers because that wasnt hard or anything hopefully they will make the most expensive unit actually overpowered and unballanced because that would be a great final boss, the sandbox mode is great i like the custom campains , the custom units arent out yet so i cant say anything about that over all this game is worth the money and if its near a sale time like a few days away from a sale then get it on sale if not then just get it you wont regret it and if it lage turn off all the graphics settings\n- I have played OSU!, Muse Dash and stepmania plenty and I gotta say that this does not feel like a rhythm game at all. The premise of matching the shape of the map to music sounds interesting but some of the songs I feel like are not mapped out correctly. Or in general this game relies less on music cues and more on visual cues? It felt like maps are only 50% related to the song and you have to ignore what you hear because the map randomly demands patterns that have no matching audio equivalent and everything becomes pure visual memorization.\n- Oh, that The Resident Evil (The RE)… One of the best stories in the gaming industry! The Capcom is well done that decided to remake games. Many players criticize The RE3, but I understand them, the game is quite short, there are no horror elements in the game. But the game has become easier, for example, a knife does not wear out. The players did not forget to criticize the Nemesis too, saying that there is no element of surprise and persecution, and there’s no sense of the constant presence of someone, who can mutilate you. The Nemesis means in English as “a good script”. However, the game creators tried to convey the atmosphere of The RE and the horror that the doomed city is filled with. Well-chosen actors, excellent voice acting, correctly conveyed the atmosphere of the city. I would add more moving elements on the destroyed streets of the city, like people or zombies\nTotal score: 8.5/10\n- With almost 300 hours of Destiny 2 (D2) back on Battle.net (the Blizzard launcher), let me give this perspective/advice for new players, specifically with regards for the F2P offering that is Destiny 2: New Light, with a few more holistic thoughts sprinkled throughout:\n\nThis overall game is very good. It doesn't always live up to its promise (the first mission of every campaign is always the most polished thing aside from the raids/dungeons), but when it does, it [b]really[/b] shines.\n\nThe gunplay is unrivaled. The visual/audio feedback is great, the handling feels really good, and enemies really pop when you take them out. Expect nothing less from the studio that brought us grunt birthday parties.\n\nThe game is better in a fireteam. Now that the base game is F2P [though with considerably less content than it used to be/I would like], this should be easier than ever for most activities. That said, a huge majority of my playtime was done solo. It can get tricky at times (\"Darkness Zones\" in certain missions prevent respawning but allow for revives, so solo players have a distinct disadvantage there). \n\nWith that said, dungeons (currently 'The Shattered Throne', 'Pit of Heresy', 'Prophecy' which is free to all players, 'Grasp of Avarice', 'Duality', and 'Spire of the Watcher') and raids (\"Last Wish\" from Forsaken, \"Garden of Salvation\" from Shadowkeep, \"The Deep Stone Crypt\" from Beyond Light, 'Vow of the Disciple' from Witch Queen, as well as 'Vault of Glass' and 'King's Fall' from D1 - both of which are both free to all players) are best experienced with a team, so don't shy away from LFG group-finder options like the Discord, official app, or any number of other sites (just make sure to accurately describe your experience, level, and gear. 'Tis only polite). \n\nOf the matchmade multiplayer offerings, I enjoy Gambit (PvPvE, reminds me of the Black Ops Zombies 4z4 mode done right), jump into the occasional Strike (PvE, matchmade fireteams running campaign-like missions), and have no interest in Crucible (PvP, it's fine I guess, but I've never liked PvP that's dependent in large part on personal progression - especially in the competitive modes like Trials of Osiris and Iron Banner)\n\nDon't be afraid to ignore content - this is absolutely the kind of game where you can set your own goals. Want a specific exotic gun? Look up where it drops and focus on grinding that content. Want a specific roll on a random roll gun? Find the best possible farming (or crafting) method and go to town. Chase down some of the exotic questions that the game clutters up your quest page with, or just goof around doing things that you find fun while absolutely ignoring all signposts.\n\nSome stuff just won't be explained in game. It's not as bad as Warframe (much less need for a wiki) but some things are still obscured. Feel free to look up Xur (exotic weapon vendor who visits on weekends) and other hidden exotics tied to specific activities, lost sectors, patrol locations, or quest chains.\n\nFor anything that you can't easily find online - reach out and find a sherpa. The community for this game tends to be pretty great, and enough of us have spent enough time leaning specific parts of it (e.g. raids) or just mechanics in general (\"What are random rolls? Which do I keep?\") that we'd be happy to jump onto discord (there are a bunch for PC, just check out the subreddit sidebar linked below) and answer any and all questions you may have. \n\nThe fact that a representative chunk of this game is free makes this the perfect time to dip your toes in without emptying out your wallet. Any other questions about this game as a product (\"Should I pay for DLC? Is Eververse worth it?\") should absolutely be researched elsewhere.\n\nIf you're looking for a place to start with the F2P content, finish the intro missions in the Cosmodrome. New and returning players are semi-regularly upgraded to a new light level floor, but means that you can miss out on the \"learning the ropes\" parts of the game that come with working your way through the New Light quest chain or unlocking different subclasses. [As of Beyond Light, all of the campaign content through Forsaken are not currently accessible. Release order was Red War (launch campaign) > Forsaken > Shadowkeep > Beyond Light > Witch Queen, followed by the upcoming expansions Lightfall > Final Shape.]\n\nEyes up, guardian.\n\nFootnotes for people yelling at me in the comments:\n-All of this is my opinion. Feel free to hold your own and disagree with mine.\n-I generally enjoy grinding, looter shooters, FPS's, and weird sci-fi space magic. Halo, Borderlands, Warframe, and CoD Zombies are some of my most-played and favorite games.\n-As far as I can tell, anything that is not strictly subjective in the above is factually correct [as of Season of Plunder, with updates noted throughout. This game changes quite a bit over time, so make sure to do your own research before spending money on it]. If I've missed something, feel free to point it out in the comments and I'll do my best to update this periodically. \n-This review previously made mention of both content vaulting and weapon sunsetting. These practices have both been discontinued as of Season of Plunder. However, it is not clear at this if or when power capped or vaulted may return/be uncapped, if ever.\n\n-----------------\nTL:DR: It's good. Not perfect, but really good. And since it's free, you can get a really good sense of if this game is for you without paying for any of it. You can play almost any activity solo pretty easily except for a handful of endgame activities. If you're overwhelmed at first, just play through the Cosmodrome missions while you get your feet under you, or ask a veteran player for help.\n-----------------\n\nSites to use (List was compiled at Shadowkeep launch, but most of it should still be relevant/useful)\n\n    \nBeginner's Guide (Current as of Beyond Light) - https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/49007\n\nThe DTG Subreddit - /r/DestinyTheGame on Reddit - https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/\n\nDestiny Item Manager (mange your inventory from your browser even while in-game, essential to avoid unneeded trips back to the tower) - app.destinyitemmanager.com\n\nDestiny 2 Checklist (Lists out everything to do as well as when it resets in-game) - www.d2checklist.com/\n\nLight gg (Database of in-game items, useful for looking up random rolls) - https://www.light.gg/\n\nBraytech org (Lots of overlapping features, but I really like their maps) - braytech.org/\n\nDatto (Destiny Youtuber / 24:02 Raider who posts lots of useful/educational content, including exotic guides) - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkmAjbIecTIjTQctolYeuDw\n\nIf you've played D2 on another system, check out the CrossSave page (https://www.bungie.net/7/en/crosssave) on the Bungie net official site respectively to get all of your content and progression moved over to Steam.\n\nStory Recap up through Shadowkeep (Spoilers Destiny 1 / D1, and D2, obviously) (My name is Byf on YouTube: The Complete Story of Destiny!

Not a bad game by any means, has the same charm as the original S.K., but why pay for it here if you can get it free with the original (now called Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove).\n\n- The best game ever made by Valve. Great story, beautiful dialogues with funny jokes, interesting puzzles, perfect atmosphere and a lot of fun in co-op with friends. You made a great work, Valve, and thank You for this absolute masterpiece.\n10/10.\n- If you want to cut your teeth on the Final Boss of box-pushing puzzle games, then have I got the game for you.\n\nRight out of the gate SSR offers a somewhat uneven mix of real head-scratchers and what I can only describe as pity puzzles, but quickly reveals itself to be the sort of puzzler that mandates particularly extensive sessions of staring at the seemingly inconsequential number of tiles onscreen and poking experimentally at them until something starts to click. This demands a little more patience than I ordinarily have, but I was starting to appreciate the design as I acclimatized to it.\n\nThen I arrived at The Great Tower level (in only the second subsection of the overworld), which all at once foists about 4 times more pieces on you than you've dealt with previously, while simultaneously introducing a Z-axis and the concept of using pieces as platforms mid-puzzle.\n\nSSR does have a well-executed and forgiving Undo function with basically unlimited storage which is a great thing to have up until the time spent rewinding would outweigh the time spent to simply restart the puzzle and do over; the only way it could be made practical on a level that large would be if you had a full-on timeline scrubber like in the rerelease of Duke Nukem 3D.\n\nThere's patience, there's logic, and then there's [b]this.[/b] I play puzzle games to try and [i]relieve[/i] stress, not the other way round. It's a solid design, and I'd probably recommend it to the REALLY die-hard logicians and puzzle fanatics. To the sort like me who enjoy puzzles but prefer there to be some sort of ceiling to their complexity, Gaben help you if you're going to try and soldier through this thing. I would even call Infinifactory a lot more accessible than this is.\n- Holy crap.\n\nPowerful.\n\nThis game explores some serious life issues: Abuse. The pain of childhood, and of parenthood. Manhood and womanhood. Strength. Loss.\n\nThis game had me near crying at several points. The story is freaking powerful. It's also remarkably well written, and downright hilarious at times. \n\nAnd the gameplay? \n\nIt's fun enough that I want to play through it again right after beating it. This turn-based RPG is sometimes brutally difficult, in part because it slaps many old-school conventions in the face (e.g., sleeping can be dangerous). Battles are challenging. Tactical thinking is essential since many enemies are VERY dangerous and you're frequently outnumbered. I really applaud the AI as it keeps you on your toes. \n\nThe game doesn't hold your hand. There is no map, compass, or any attempt to make navigation easier. You just have to remember your way around, though there are plenty of memorable environments. \n\nCharacters will force you to make decisions with lasting consequences. There are dozens of hard choices to make along the journey, which brings me to another topic the game explores: decision. Will you save your friends, or your stuff? I got very attached to the buddies I picked up, only to have them devoured by a mutant, or bail on me when I least expected it. You just never know what you'll face, nor what to choose. Thinking back to many of those times, I don't know what I should have done. All the options sucked. \n\nBut I can't help asking myself, \"Did I make the right choice?\" \n\nHighly recommended.\n- [h1]I enjoyed the game. Negative reviews can be more helpful though. One negative review can't hurt.[/h1]\n\nI'll keep the pros short:\n - Stress reliever\n - You can kill people in interesting ways\n - Mods can enhance this experience further\n\nCons:\n\n - The performance is pretty shit, so you will probably have to play with lower simulation settings, which aren't that good. Duh.\n\n - The base game is bland. Game is driven entirely by the workshop and your ability to create your own contraptions. Not a problem for me, maybe a problem for someone else.\n\n - The game can get boring pretty quickly because the loop is repetitive: spawn human, kill, repeat. This is coming from someone with over 400 hours played.\n\n - Not really game related, but if you don't like sticking around in communities that are often toxic, childish, annoying and the members are often kids or younger teens [spoiler](I would name a few examples but I feel like angering more than 1 fandom is a death sentence)[/spoiler], then avoid the community and stay away as far as possible and just grab your mods and run. Avoid the workshop comment sections, or just a lot of stuff in the workshop, the community tab, etc. It's just full of self-entitled kids who think they're hot shit.\n\n- Not sure how true this is nowadays, but some things on the workshop are just like farm spam, meaning the trending page was often filled with spam.\n\nRead the comments for anything I possibly missed to add but someone else mentioned.\n\nIn short:\nBuy the game if you like violence and looking like a crazy person that people wanna avoid from fear. It's pretty cool.\nDon't buy it if you aren't interested in that.\n\n[spoiler]The only reason I enabled comments is to possibly show how correct the community point is.[/spoiler]\n- Playing this game instantly brought back memories of me playing TMNT, Battletoads, Double Dragon, and Streets of Rage, with my little brother on the NES and Sega Genesis in the early 90s. Luckily this game doesn’t feature TMNT’s ridiculous water level or Battletoads' sadistic peed bike level. The graphics are perfect, the controls are great, the soundtrack is awesome (especially the Wu-Tang stage, and the Shredder stage), and the levels and overworld map are fun to navigate. I’ve played through the story mode with all 7 characters and have played through the arcade mode multiple times solo and many times in multiplayer and I’ve enjoyed every bit of it. This game is so much fun.\n\nThere are a few things I wish existed though. I wish there were more playable characters. I wish that you did not lose your 7 character’s progress in story mode when you start a new game. I wish you could see the difficulty level of the online arcade game you are joining. I wish there were cumulative stats you could see for arcade and story mode that showed the number of times you completed a stage, how many enemies you knocked out, objects you’ve destroyed, stage times, combo streaks, times taunted, etc. I wish you could create your own turtle and assigned moves, specials, jumps, taunts, and colors.\n- Getting 100% was... very fun in this cute metroid-vania where you basically act as your own level designer.\n\napproximate amount of time to 100%: 20-30 Hours\nEstimated achievement difficulty: 5/10\nMinimum number of playthroughs needed: One (Most likely 2 if you go in blind)\nMultiplayer achievements: No.\nMissable achievements: Yes. Sequence Break, \nPoint of no return: No. After the game's ending you can return and explore.\nGrinding Achievements:  No.\nDLC-Only achievements: No.\nTime-gated achievements: No.\nSpeed-run achievements: Yes. 4 hour Speed run (and another 4 hour Speedrun but with 100% Secrets/gold etc...)\nRNG-achievements: No.\nIs there a good guide available: I recommend Demajen's Guide on steam with the super usefull map.\nDoes difficulty affect achievements: Yes, Medium recommended. (There's also a 0 death achievement)\nFirst achievement unlock: Defeat the first boss in the tutorial temple.\n\n* I can't remember how this game ended up in my account (might have been some promotional giveaway...) but I'm so glad it did.\n\nThis game has some of the best Quality of life I've seen. It's extremely enjoyable and the 100% journey is challenging but not too problematic. Wholeheartedly recommend this one.\n- I read the negative reviews and backlash against DoubleFine, but I thought that I would be OK even if the game had some bugs and wasn't quite finished, so I picked it up anyway. That was a mistake.\n\nThe game is not just unfinished, its in an Alpha state. Which is sad, because I definetly would enjoy the game if it was done. As it is, the game is entertaining for a couple hours, then quickly grows tiresome and frustrating. The bugs are not crippling, but taken as a whole they represent a game that is very unbalanced and grates on you over time. \n\nIf DF-9 ever hits the $5 pile, pick it up. otherwise pass.\n- Do I really have to write this review? I am just one in thousands of people who wrote a positive reveiw for Garry's Mod. Chances are, this review will never convince someone to buy Garry's Mod. It'll just be lost in the 100,000 positive reviews out there. Well, here I go anyway.\n\n\"Where do I start?\" This is the question asked by anyone playing Gmod for their first time. It's also my question that I ask about this review I am writing. Hmm...\n\n_The gameplay...the gameplay...hmm... Well, there's singleplayer sandbox. You can do...uh, whatever you want really. Just addon a few addons, and you can be entertained for hours. Battle NPCs, make cool scenes for cool screenshots, explore maps, be a superhero (spiderman addon!), and much, much, much, much- you get my point, right? Almost all content is user-generated. Make your own content! Multiplayer. In Multiplayer Gmod you can roleplay. I'm talking normal RP (DarkRP), Military RP, Star Wars RP, etc, etc. In multiplayer Gmod, you can battle, prophunt (yay), hide 'n seek, and much, much, more.\n\n_Graphics? I'll rate the graphics...drumroll please... 7/10. This game is and older game. Came out in 2006. I guess the graphics are good for 2006, and people enjoy the game and don't complain much about the graphics, but I'm not gonna lie, they are outdated and look old. It's not 2006 anymore.\n\n_Hear the bullets flying. The zombies growling. The people chatting. The boxes jumping... The sound in this game is great! Every sound is loud and clear, and there are a varitey of sounds.\n\n_Play this game. Play it again. Play it some more. Play some now, and play some later. Play it over and over. Play it as long as you want.\n\n_My Personal opinion. Get this game. Now. Get Gmod on sale or not. I'm not gonna stop playing it for a while and I'm already at 50+ hours of playtime. I love this game! WAIT! Before you go and buy this, then you wonder why there are all the missing maps and errors in most games, get Counter Strike: Source, so ALL the textures are supported. You need it to play MOST multiplayer games.\n\n\nGameplay: 9/10\nGraphics: 7/10\nStory: N/A\nSound: 8/10\nReplayability: 10/10\n\nOverall 8.5\n\nEven though, this is one positive review on Garry's Mod, out of the thousands of positive reviews that have been submitted Garry's Mod, I hope this one convinces you to buy... Gmod\n\n-Star_Hawk_\n- I was excited to play this after playing Persona 5 and Persona 5 Royal (my introductions to the series) to death.  This game was raved about and I thought, if it's more of the same then this should be great...\n\nThe major problem I have with this game is that it's so painfully obvious that it's a game made 13 years ago.  It's not a bad game, the look and feel of the Persona series is there and the characters are interesting etc.  But at the same time whenever I played this game, I just wanted to go back and play P5R instead.  Everything is just better in P5R.  The dungeons for example, the difference is night and day.  P5R's dungeons have so much more life to them, and look so much better.  Most of the environments in this game look like dull coloured LEGO sets put together.  It looks like it was originally on a handheld console (despite the remaster).  The other major example is the voice acting.  My god, some of the voice acting in 4G is on par with some of the worst Square Enix efforts.  Audio balancing is terrible as well.  And then there's the subjective stuff.  I personally much prefer P5R's soundtrack over this one, aside from maybe a couple of songs that were cool.  The setting of Tokyo is much more interesting and dynamic than this hokey town in the middle of nowhere.  The characters themselves I found much more engaging in 5R.  This was particularly helped by the quality of voice acting.  I think \n\nI'm glad that people are able to experience this game again on a more available platform.  I think potentially if I had played this back when it was released, I would probably have a different opinion of this game.  If you like Persona games and can look beyond what's dated badly, then the core game is very much the same.  If you were a fan already, this is a quality refresh to the game.  However, if you're like me and experienced the future of this series before playing this, I dont recommend it.  P5R provides the same gameplay but adds so much more.  It's a shame we cannot get that game on Steam instead.\n- My god.. Capcom did it. They saved the franchise. I'm honestly shocked. \n\nWhen the first teaser dropped I thought for sure this would just be a P.T. copy which I was sort of okay with. Turns out I was wrong. This is a classic Resident Evil game. Like, RE1 classic. Complete with puzzle solving, INVENTORY MANAGEMENT, and tense stressful boss encounters. The game brings back the storage box system even! I can't stress enough how amazing this game is as a long time RE fan. If you're one too, do yourself a favor and pull the trigger on this one. Best game since RE4.... May even be better.\n- Overall, as a single player game Wargroove 2 is a tremendous improvement over the first game. The campaign is well designed and engaging, the writing is much improved and overall the gameplay is fun. The new roguelike conquest mode is a much more entertaining side thing than the godawful Arcade in 1, as well.\n\nAs a primary single player game, I hated Wargroove 1, and I can say that 2 has turned my opinion around - this game is fun, I finished the campaign and craved more, which is all you can really say! The only thing I really missed from 1 was the Puzzle mode, but maybe it'll show up in a future update? Who knows.\n\nThe major downsides is that the user interface is still the same terrible user interface that WG1 had without significant improvements, and the AI is still absolutely atrocious so playing even Vs maps against the AI is going to be pretty dull, but that hasn't changed from the first game. The soundtrack is not quite as catchy either.\n\nBut unlike WG1, I enjoyed my time with WG2 in spite of these shortcomings, and if you ever have a choice between the two, skip WG1 and just go straight into WG2.\n- If you played the OG this is basically the same but with a few added side stories you can unlock as you complete different routes in the game. The extra dlc maybe would take you a bit over an hour to complete all of them if you speed through it, but does not have any optional dialogue so it's more of just some lore and extra character interactions. Still pretty solid dlc if you are a fan and want a little bit of extra stuff :)\n- You had me at creating adventure log, well actually no, at the starting song perhaps. How many years have I been waiting for full fledge, non portable DQ since DQVIII in PS2 ?\n\nThis PC port is a great one, neat and very beautiful. I was playing at 4k/~30fps and since my GPU is not fast enough I switched to 1440p/~50-60fps instead. I wish more and more JRPGs to do PC concurrent launch like this one. A day later I switched back to 4k and change internal resolution to 80% then it was pretty much perfect.\n\n- You can choose default A/B button.\n- You can choose resolution and 30/60 FPS mode. There is a way to unlock 60+ FPS for gaming monitors, google it.\n- You can invert cameras both ways.\n- You can choose classic battle mode.\n- You can press L3 and enjoy the view.\n- Load time is non-existence with SSD.\n- Ultra Widescreen is NOT supported. Waiting for mods at the moment.\n- Keyboard and Mouse is fine but playing with controller is wayy better.\n- Fully customisable keys / controllers.\n- Story synopsys at game loading screen.\n- Silent Protagonist.\n- Full voice cutscenes.\n- Auto-run button.\n- You can jump.\n- Very fun game. Best wave shooter on the market that I've ever seen. The roguelike nature of it is very fun. Each run hits you with different challenges in building your weapons.\n\nBiggest critiques - \n1. Achievements locked behind multiplayer in a dead game. God I hate when devs do this. It luckily lets you play through normal mode when queuing, but its still very annoying. The last achievement I needed was \"get to wave 50 of multiplayer gauntlet mode\". I've so far been able to play 2 games of multiplayer. One, my partner had no voice coms. Second, my partner started with extremely staticy voice coms and it cut out at about wave 5. We pushed through to wave 48. Aaaaaaaaaand network error. It took about an hour and a half to get that far just for the game to crash and lose it all. Devs, please stop hiding achievements behind multiplayer when you know full well your game won't have a huge online player base.\n\n2. You get TWO GUN ARMS! This is AMAZING AND AWESOME! Except for the fact that a ton of the attachments for your weapons affect every part on your gun. So by not just making one super mega death arm, you are effectively chopping your total strength into two parts. There are a few pieces that only give you buffs for \"dual wielding\" or having a firing barrel on each arm. But these are not very common, and the stats you get from them pale in comparison to just making a super gun on one arm and keeping the other arm clenched for punching enemies that get up to your face, or putting on a single melee weapon on the other hand for the same purpose. \n\n3. The variety of guns is fun, but in the end it ends up turning into \"hold the fire button, aim for enemies, walk in a circle to trick enemy aim as best as possible, and occasionally punch an enemy that gets to you\". The biggest change to this system is getting either the rocket launcher or the Barrel Barrel which shoots massive barrels at the enemies. They have a very slow fire rate and do best when aiming the shots more precisely. But even then, with some weapons having a spooling time, and others outputting a hale of bullets, the best strategy is to just keep the trigger held 24/7 and strafe your aim from enemy to enemy.\n\nI really enjoyed my time with this game, but don't try to 100% it. The multiplayer achievement isn't worth it. Network is terrible. There's too much going on on screen when you have 2 players in the mix so crashing is likely. If I were the Completionist I would give this game a rating of Finish It. Play through the game with all the unique starting bonuses, all the difficulties. But stay away from multiplayer unless you have a friend to dedicate multiple hours to trying the gauntlet with.\n- As a Spider-Man fan, this game is a real treat. It was fantastic 4 years ago on release for the PS4, and it's even more fantastic now that it's finally on PC. If you're a Spidey fan, especially one who deeply appreciates the mythos and the message is represents, then this game is 100% for you. The writing, visuals, audio and gameplay are all wonderful, through and through. It's a true labour of love, Insomniac did an incredible job. Bring on the Miles Morales port!\n- HOW?? WHY?? WHY IS THIS GAME SO GOOD?? IT HAS NO REASON TO BE THIS GOOD WTF?\nThe trailers or advertisements will not even give anything close to a sense on how good this story, build up, characters and mechanics (did I mention the story?) really is.\n\nShu Takumi and Yasumasa Kitagawa, you've done it again, from Ace Attorney to this. I can 100% say if you haven't played this game, you are definitely missing out.\n\n10/10!!!\n- It is a total eyegasm with a captivating story/lore. If you're even a tiny bit interested in anything f*cked-up and mysterious (SCP-like), buy this.\n\nFrom the gameplay perspective, it is simply good. Nothing mind-blowing, but good nonetheless.\n\nI've completed the game with a couple of sidequests (there are more for me) in about 13 hours, and there are two story DLC + the Expeditions mode, so I anticipate at least another 10+ hours of gameplay. Which is great for the price.\n\nUpdate: I've put in ~10 more hours to complete the Foundation DLC. It is a good DLC, and brings a few more hours of joy living in this world. It also has some sick areas (like that dark cave with the TV). The overall design is a bit more dull, but I enjoyed the story.\n- Overall the concept and idea of the game is good and I would recommend it. It is worth the price for the amount of fun time you can have with it.\n\nPositives:\n+ Initially the game gives you some good frights and tension\n+ Variety of characters, ethnics and aesthetics to pick and chose from\n+ Variety of skills and abilities that are mostly unique and some have good synergy\n+ Variety of maps\n+ DLC costs are fair\n+ Skin costs are fair\n+ One of very few companies who communicates with the community\n+ A lot of good license characters available\n+ The game has a tutorial that explains the basics\n+ Various ways to play the game (stealth / agressive)\n\nNegatives:\n- A few bugs here and there\n- Some really annoying perks / addons on killers / survivors like 1 shot long range axes (to name an example), keys and moris (to name a few more)\n- Toxic community - Not everyone is toxic but a large portion of players are but lets be real you get that in every game these days\n- Matchmaking is pretty bad (but DBD is trying to fix this)\n- Sometimes unfair hit detection - Some hits look like you are being smacked way out of range or as a killer you see the grab animation on a survivor and then it just cancels out\n- Steep learning curve / unforgiving gameplay. You either have to learn and improve and adapt and overcome or you will be having a bad time as you climb ranks.\n- WTF, this isn’t gaming! Where are my lootboxes and micro transactions?!\n\nMy main thought after I beat GRIS was, \"I don't really understand anything that just happened, but it sure was pretty.\"\n\nI was absolutely amazed how a game with zero actual dialogue could move me to tears, just on strenght of its visuals and music. In general, the whole theme of dealing with grief/depression spoke to me in a way that I didn't expect.  It's one of those games you play to \"feel\" more than for the gameplay itself.\n\nI have PTSD from dealing with my wife getting a boyfriend, and this game made me cry several times while playing it. Especially during the scene where you're swimming away from the eel. That symbolism to me perfectly captures the feeling of trauma recovery. I'd spent time finding the little lights throughout that section of the game and activating the turtle which ultimately saved me from my own darkness and helplessness.\n\nIt felt like hope. It was such a good representation of how the coping skills I'd learned and the hard work I'd put in were finally seeming to pay off. It's when you're at your weakest that you learn how strong you actually are. I cried like a baby during and after that scene. It made me realize how much I've actually overcome, and how grateful I am to be free.\n\nGris truly is a beautiful game and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a slow paced experience. The only bit of criticism I have for the game is it certainly gives \"not like the other girls\" vibes at times, but I think this is quite easy to get over.\n\nIn conclusion: the visuals are stunning,  the music is beautiful and knows exactly when to kick in, the platforming elements are fantastic, and it’s story and themes are spectacular without a single word. Truly a must-play.\n\n10/10\n- Love Anemone\nLove Cal\nLove Tangent\nLove Dys\nLove Marz\nLove Tammy\nLove Sym\nLove Nomi\nLove Rex\nWe don't talk about Vace\n- I'll lay it out. If you're really interested in the hacking mechanic, that might be sufficient reason to play this game. Otherwise, I'd be inclined to give it a miss.\n\nFrom a gameplay perspective, there's not really much to hook a new player. There's a long period at the start where you're expected to randomly interact with people, but given no reason why you should do so. The whole socializing and partying thing isn't intuitive unless you're a person who'd normally be into that, and there's little in the game that pushes you in that direction. As a result, progressing as far as the story actually starting is often the result of accident at best. It took me 4 hours of just wandering around, not knowing what I was supposed to be doing or why.\n\nOnce you're able to program there's a bit more direction and less frustration, but you're still not given much reason for doing it until later on.\n\nAll in all, stick around if you're really invested in getting to the programming. Otherwise, it's an exercise in frustration and shallow conversations that's not really a lot of fun.\n\nArt's gorgeous though, so the game has that going for it at least.\n- They added \"Precision\" mode for the mouse under controls, which is pretty much raw mouse movement. YAY!\n\nAnyway, one of my favorite games of all time easily at this point. Incredible story, fun combat, and awesome world. A must play for sure, especially if you've never played it before on Play-Station (like me). It also has a New Game Plus mode that unlocks different NG+ only armor that are insane.\n\nI played at normal, and aside from the Valkyries the other bosses are a cakewalk. Maybe play on hard or hardest.\n- [h1]I enjoyed the game. Negative reviews can be more helpful though. One negative review can't hurt.[/h1]\n\nI'll keep the pros short:\n - Stress reliever\n - You can kill people in interesting ways\n - Mods can enhance this experience further\n\nCons:\n\n - The performance is pretty shit, so you will probably have to play with lower simulation settings, which aren't that good. Duh.\n\n - The base game is bland. Game is driven entirely by the workshop and your ability to create your own contraptions. Not a problem for me, maybe a problem for someone else.\n\n - The game can get boring pretty quickly because the loop is repetitive: spawn human, kill, repeat. This is coming from someone with over 400 hours played.\n\n - Not really game related, but if you don't like sticking around in communities that are often toxic, childish, annoying and the members are often kids or younger teens [spoiler](I would name a few examples but I feel like angering more than 1 fandom is a death sentence)[/spoiler], then avoid the community and stay away as far as possible and just grab your mods and run. Avoid the workshop comment sections, or just a lot of stuff in the workshop, the community tab, etc. It's just full of self-entitled kids who think they're hot shit.\n\n- Not sure how true this is nowadays, but some things on the workshop are just like farm spam, meaning the trending page was often filled with spam.\n\nRead the comments for anything I possibly missed to add but someone else mentioned.\n\nIn short:\nBuy the game if you like violence and looking like a crazy person that people wanna avoid from fear. It's pretty cool.\nDon't buy it if you aren't interested in that.\n\n[spoiler]The only reason I enabled comments is to possibly show how correct the community point is.[/spoiler]\n- Plays and looks just like the Park Ranger and Cruise Director HOG series, if you enjoyed those then you will likely enjoy this series. Game is composed of hidden object scenes and simple puzzle transitions that have a loose story to bridge the movement between them. The hidden object scenes follow an older couple as they take their grandchildren to a variety of European counties on their vacation, they sprinkle in a few interesting facts between each location. There are collectibles in each scene along with a raccoon. I overall enjoyed it for a laid back experience and the weirdly fun photostock based scenes. It took me about 2.5 hours to play through the game along with the bonus scenes/puzzles.\n- If I could get my money back, I would. AI as usual is hot garbage, cant even take turns without getting LITERALLY BODIED by the AI drivers. The new progression system really sucks. Cool that they wanted to try something different, but I really dont feel like leveling every god damn car in the game just to modify it. If you wanted multiple of same car you would have to level those duplicate cars you purchase. My experience with the physics is just... eh. I mean I sure do love loosing grip just from barely tapping the gas. Constantly fighting my wheel just to stay stable. Driving its probably fine for controller players, I wouldnt on wheel. Credits are only used to buy cars now. Also kinda runs like crap. All i wanted was a Gran Turismo on PC and this... this is not it. Game is mid, move on me thinks.\n\nEdit: I put in a request for a refund and Valve did indeed approve it. I thought I was over the time limit for sure. Don't be me and spend 100 USD for early access. Thanks Valve, you're the best!\n- Look, I love Magic. It's my favorite game of all time. I met my wife through MTG. I'll be playing it until the day I die.\n\nBut if you're new to the game, and not established on Arena, don't pick it up. It's horrendously difficult to build a collection in this game, doubly so if you're not a fan of playing draft. While they have made incredibly minor adjustments that have been generally positive, the economy on this platform is impossible to do well in. The sheer number of games you have to play to amass any kind of respectable, and more importantly, functional collection of cards is not worth it for just a casual player.\n\nOf course, you can circumvent the grind with money, but that of course is the literal definition of Pay 2 Win. It's a mobile game economy through and through.\n- I love this game. I've clocked over 300 hours in it through Origin (on my ONE character xD ). It's an excellent game, even despite it being an \"open world faffaround simulator\" which was all the rage at the time.\n\nAnd finally on Steam!? Yay! Or yay..?\n\nBut, as we know, we can't have good things. Massive thumb down to the EA Origin \"integration\" in Steam. EA, how about just stop being such massive ducks?\n\nThis is the same \"we hate our customers\" behaviour expressed by d-bags like Ubisoft and Epic. Only that EA sort of makes it worse. They *know* how much people hate the unnecessary and malicious Uplay \"integration\" that Ubisoft have forced on us for several years. Seeing this, EA decides that doing the exact same thing, with their total-garbage Origin client made even worse, is surely the only way to harass the customers enough to be worthy of the EA brand. \n\nDO NOT BUY OR LINK your Steam account if you own the game on Origin from earlier. \nIf you buy a game on Steam, which you already own on Origin, it will overwrite your Origin game.\nIf you then refund the game on Steam, this will remove the game from Origin too (even if you already own it there!), and you'll spend hours in line to get a hold of customer support. Then you must chat with bots, or people who are so void of understanding (and likely not paid near enough to care) that they might as well be bots. And if you're lucky, you might, after going through 4 or 5 different \"agents\", finally get to talk to a person that comprehends English and is authorised to do anything beyond telling you \"they'll discuss it with their team\". Then you might get your game back. \nBut! You won't get back the GOTY. Because the Steam-Orgin-GOTY overwrites your Origin GOTY. And when refunding, via Steam, you're left with a dumb/lame/placeholder copy of the GOTY in your Origin library, which doesn't work, but somehow just lingers there. Then you need to get a Digital Deluxe Edition + all DLC to get back to where you were.\n\nThis [integration] is such a tremendous show of manure, that I'm actually left wondering if EA planned it. Did Andrew Wilson take one of his billions of pocked change and say \"hey, we should make an extra effort here, to make sure that this integration is as frustrating and poorly implemented as possible, but still functional, such that things are barely limping along but just barely, because nothing is as frustrating as something that just barely sorta works but only sorta, and only by the skin of its teeth. That'll teach those entitled peasants.\"\n\nSo yeah. Great game. Bad EA.\n\nUpdate! A new Origin experience: The EA App! An all new website, wrapped inside an all new Electron wrapper! For an all new Frustrating(TM) experience and much better hogging of your PC performance.\n- Sitting here at 2 am, gazing at the glowing screen, having just finished Kentucky: Route Zero, I blink and hesitate. I retype this paragraph several times. I push away from the table, stumble into kitchen, pour some bourbon trying not to clink the bottle against the glass. My wife is asleep in the next room and I loathe to disturb her dreams.\n\nI will not insult this game with such banalities as rating or vulgar list of pros and cons. Doing all that would be like rating a poem by word count, very accurate and of absolutely no use to anyone.\nI can only describe Kentucky: Route Zero as a feeling. Shortness of breath, tightness in the chest, a lump in a throat.  A slight vertigo. It's that acceptance that comes after the anger, when you're putting everything in order in preparation. A longing for the good old times that never were and you only imagined them and kept thinking about them until they seemed real. It's coming back to your parents' home for a funeral. It's that sinking feeling you get when you close a book you just finished and the real world reasserts itself. \nI could go on, but what's the point? I'm writing this more for myself than anyone else.\n\nKentucky: Route Zero put a splinter in my heart. It's not big or harmful, but it's there and every once in a while it hurts.\n- No Man’s Sky is like a guy who owes you $1,000 from 6 years ago coming back with $10,000 to repay you after you thought the money was gone.\n\nI really like this game. I’ve been playing it for years on and off, returning after every major update to see the state of things. No man’s Sky might be a fantastic game now, but you gotta always remember how it all begun. When the game first came out it could best be described to had been as wide as the ocean, but having the depth of a puddle. \n\nThe game has improved so much from when it came out that it is easily one of my favorite space exploration games nowadays. One of the greatest redemption stories in video game history. It’s almost like they used the money they earned from sales  to actually improve the game. \n\nI love the idea of having this massive sandbox shared experience, where coincidentally anybody can stumble upon my little bases I scattered, mines, etc. I also love flying around the stars in my ship, discovering new planets, finding weird animals, plants, geography…\n\nThe sense of adventure and the thrill of finding some new world makes me have so much fun. If you like exploring and just taking your time  doing things, this game is a must, and I highly recommend it. \n\nThe truth is no matter what you think of the game we should all be grateful of what we’ve gotten. If No Man’s Sky was made by EA, all these updates throughout the years would probably have been released as $60 new games each.\n\nI’ll be honest, at this rate and with these devs I have a feeling No Man’s Sky has a better chance of of becoming what Star Citizen strives to be than Star Citizen.\n\nEvery now and then though, whenever I see a game trailer that I really enjoy, I like to remember the state of this game when it first came out and how awful it was. It keeps me in check and helps my expectations stay grounded.\n\n10/10\n- Absolutely Don't understand all the negative reviews for this game. \n\nFirst off: this game is a RogueLite in that death is permanent, be prepared for this. Death is a part of the game and you are NOT losing progress by dying.. it's death mechanic is very much like Rogue Legacy in that you keep progress that carries on to your next character when you begin again. Dying also isn't like you lost more than 45 minutes of your time. Every single game in this genre will have plenty of deaths involved before you FINALLY get that first win (in most cases). Some people are going to need to spend some time grinding levels, dying and repeat until they have enough sticker slots open to overpower things. Keep that in mind going into it. You retain your level and any big upgrades you acquire when you die so you are NOT starting from scratch every single time like you would in most rogue likes. \n\nI normally wouldn't review a game so early but I saw the negative reviews pouring in and felt I needed to add some counters to it. \n\nThe second thing: the art/music/atmosphere is absolutely brilliant for a game in this genre where most games of this nature tend to be relatively grim. As with most roguelike/lites its procedurally generated so the map, enemies and what have you will be different each time. \n\nThird: the forced timer before you have to fight the boss is a bit jarring at first as i've never played a game of this type where I have limited time to actually get there.. but it's kind of brilliant really because it adds a completely different layer to the game in that you have to manage your time very well. What do you think you have time to do before the inevitable? Do you want to run around and grind exp killing trash mobs? Or do you think that time could be better spent knocking some dungeons out (time halts when in dungeons so take your time in these) and getting some gear and arguably more exp than you would just wandering the map. Also, you absolutely have plenty of time to explore the map as there are shrines (you have to find them but the map isn't huge), that you can pay a special currency to add another day of time to the clock. If you see a review complaining about the timer and they have less than an hour in the game... take that with a grain of salt. \n\nFour: The combat is pretty simple but well done. There is a surprising amount of depth to it as well when you start buying and finding more powerful weapons (toys) that can do a variety of things and synergize pretty well together. Enemy variety is pretty good so far, each time you level up it adds more enemy variety to encounter around the map. \n\nFive: dungeons are fairly simple and a good mix of mini puzzles and fun combat encounters. \n\nIf you enjoy roguelike/lite games DEFINITELY give this a spot in your library to see what it has to offer. So far I'd put it 8-9/10 but I don't quite have the amount of time necessary to feel comfortable ranking it against other rogue games. I may edit this once I get to a point to see how much replayability it has but until then I'm eager to keep sending swords into a meat grinder and just adding to my power each time. Please look at how much time people have in a game before rating their reviews and taking their word. .5 hours is not enough time to really warrant a helpful review... nor is 6 in my case but I really don't want this game to be DoA\n\nEdit: Just beat Mormo for the second time.. trust me when i say you can make the timer go on infinitely. I Don't want to spoil anything BUT head to dungeons and kill as many enemies as you can to save up gold and another currency, and make a good loop around each area of the map and you'll find all sorts of neat things. As for bugs, I've had none and I'm at 13 hours of steady play. Don't waste time killing EVERY enemy that's in the open areas cause that will eat too much of your time, but focus on finding dungeons and the hidden npc encounters. I had my timer extended to approx. 8 days in game time and I also found a way to permanently increase the amount of time I have on subsequent runs. Give it a chance, learn how the game works before being upset about the timer.\n- Mixed review, so I will list the good and bad:\n\nGood:\n-Fun to play with friends\n-You have stuff to do for 20+ hours\n-Exploring and survival is done well\n-In creative you can build a pirate ship\n\nBad:\n-Sometimes lag\n-Sometimes trouble locating islands\n-Alone this is boring (sorry shark, you are not enough company)\n-My alpaca named Marcel keeps dying because he refused to eat (fixed now but rip 4 Marcels)\n\nEdit:\n+New engine and rudder added much control\n+New islands are easily explored by one person\n+Lore added\n+Finally you can charge your empty batteries\n+Finally you can too farm honey on your raft\n+Character models to find\n-Biofuel consumption and making is a meh for me\n-If you add saltwater too fast to the filter you lose the empty bottle or cup\n- DLC and Bugs prove this company is Garbage.\n- Refunded.\n\nFeels like they released the wrong game files - half the game seems to be broken or missing...\nBasic functions such as zooming in and out, no tutorial, huge amounts of buttons that don't have any impact. Good idea, terrible execution.\n- \"it's a puzzle game dressed up as a wargame\"\n\n1. puzzle games don't have this much randomness\n\n2. it uses authentic hex wargame conventions/mechanics so it's more of a puzzle game built out of a wargame\n\n3. you can take the puzzle element out of it by customizing your game.yml file to allow +5 turns, then play each scenario slow\n- You know that feeling when you are hesitant to buy a game because you're worried you might waste your money on something that might be a crap game in the end, get boring, and not sure if you should believe all the ratings because you dont know if everyone has the same interests and likes as you? well this game is the bomb diggity, straight up. Made by the same people who made rollercoaster tycoon and man did they deliver on this. For me it's the small things in a game that matter and did they really take the time to make sure this was as polished as it could be. Not sure if anyone remembers when they announced another rollercoaster tycoon a while back, and everyone was super excyited to find out what it was, and it ended up being some dumbass phone app? Well imagine all that excyitment, but instead of them coming out with that stupid app they came out with this bad boy. This is exactly what everyone was wishing and hoping for (just different name). Do I reccomend you buy this game? hell yes. will it be exactly what you are wishing for when you fist clicked this game to see the game play and reviews? sure as cocks will. But will it be just as fun as the original?.... YOU BET YOUR MOMS TITS IT WILL BE. \n\nPROS:                                \nbeen one since 1990\n\nCons:\nYou'll never know how fun it is till you buy it.\n- 9 studios, 3000 people working on the game and this is what we got... Best selling and most advanced COD ever made its debut as a technical disaster. People getting banned for no reason, couldn't able to play the game due to crashes and very bad, laggy servers. And after 2 months from the launch, most of the issues aren't fixed. Just like everything else in the game.\n\nBeen playing the game since launch on Battle.net and this game hasn't got any further. It's just another unfinished AAA game.\n\nSince this game contains Campaign (not included in this review), MP, DMZ and Warzone, this might be a long review. So here is the [b] TL;DR [/b]\n[b] Pros: [/b]\n[list]\n    [*]Gunplay & sounds such as airstrike, guns etc.\n    [*]Weapon tuning\n    [*]Al Mazrah\n    [*]New battle pass and backpack system\n    [*]Proximity chat\n    [*]3rd person modes\n[/list]\n\n[b] Cons: [/b]\n[list]\n    [*]New 3D Audio which is worse than previous game. Leads to inconsistent audio and makes impossible to hear footsteps\n    [*]Movement\n    [*]UI\n    [*]Lots of improvement from Warzone not included in this game such as option to remove or wear gas mask\n    [*]Lots of bugs and issues, unfinished product\n    [*]Animations takes too long if you don't have fast hands. Some gun reloads can be considered as inspecting\n    [*]TTK (Time To Kill)\n    [*]Much worse SBMM than previous game\n    [*]Too many bots in DMZ and their god tier accuracy\n    [*]Bad designed multiplayer maps\n    [*]Big maps in multiplayer but not enough players to fill the map\n    [*]Camper friendly designed maps and gameplay\n    [*]Flashbangs and stuns. If you got flashbanged/stunned, just leave the kbm/controller\n    [*]Not enough contracts in Warzone\n    [*]Not able to create our own perk package\n    [*]Disconnected from Steam\n    [*]The price\n    [*]Infinity Ward's realism obsession\n[/list]\n\n[b] Some bugs/issues the game has/had: [/b]\n[list]\n    [*]Crashing a vehicle into a mountain sometimes causes server to crash\n    [*]Respawning as mortar(a.k.a cluster) strike\n    [*]When enemy used voice chat, people's names that appear on the left side might stay there until you close the game\n    [*]Unregistered hits such as melee\n    [*]Broken anti-cheat that bans people for no reason\n    [*]Unable to move for the rest of the match when you deploy recon drone sometimes\n    [*]Disappearing HUD after using airstrikes\n    [*]Getting 10 kills in a match gets you shadowbanned\n[/list]\n\nAnd the list goes on.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h1] Long Version [/h1]\n\n[h3] Multiplayer [/h3]\n\nKinda fun to play. Game's less buggy mode is either multiplayer nor campaign. But beware, you'll find yourself playing one of the worst designed maps in COD, maybe even in gaming history. And there is the Infinity Ward fetish; big maps but not enough players to fill the map. Vanguard was bad too but in my opinion, they did one thing right which was the matchmaking up to 20v20 in a single map. This game needs the same thing because most of the maps are HUGE.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h3] DMZ [/h3]\n\nThey called DMZ in beta state but they should've called it alpha or pre-alpha. Just a mode where you get in, do some contracts or some faction missions and get out. No economy etc. Nothing exists to keep it alive. Once you finished your faction missions and the 7 weapon cases, you're basically done with this mode.\n\nBots are way too much aggressive, it's not even fun. You get almost no armor if you don't purchase it from the buy and there are bots everywhere, shooting from far away, dealing tons of damage that will knock you out immediately. Beware, if you're skilled player or SBMM decided you're, bots will have higher accuracy. All thanks to SBMM.\n\nThere is also another map you can play which is called Building 21. The idea is really good in my opinion and it changes the whole atmosphere of the game. No mini-map, armored bots (annoying af), limited equipment and mini bosses. There are times where you'll see an enemy from away but you might not think that was the enemy if their skin is black/dark.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h3] Warzone [/h3]\n\nOh boy, Bugzone my beloved. I don't know where to start. First month in a nutshell: launch the game, crash, repeat.\n\nThis game is really [b] 2.0 [/b] because they abandoned everything what made Warzone unique/good and tried something different.\n\nTTK (Time to Kill) and movement what makes Warzone 2.0 not enjoyable. Can you kill fast? Yes. Can you get killed fast? Yes. Seems fair right? But if you're a rusher like me and someone is camping in the corner (which is the 80% of the community, sadly), most of the time you have zero chance to react. You need 3 plates to stay alive otherwise you'll die almost immediately. They need to adjust ttk a bit. I think long range ttk is kinda ok but close and medium, not at all. Akimbo's and Fennec will insta-delete you in close range. RPK, Kastov 762 and TAQ-V are so powerful in medium and long range. If there was a bit movement in this game, it might help you get out some situations, even with this ttk. \n\nYou thought Warzone had bad audio? Wait until you play Warzone 2.0. They managed to create a [b][i] new 3d audio [/i][/b] which is worse than the previous Warzone. You can play this game with no sound without a problem because you're not able to hear any footsteps.\n\nIW obsessed with realism but they forgot we are here to play COD, not something like Tarkov. Animations that takes forever to end etc. If I wanted to play something realistic, I wouldn't be here playing COD. But hey, lets take a look at their [b][i] realism [/i][/b] logic.\n\n[b] IW Realism Logic [/b]\n[list]\n    [*]9mm pistol can kill you with 3 shots while you're fully armored but 50 cal. sniper requires 2 headshots\n    [*]Melee > Bullets\n    [*]Jump out in a vehicle while driving so fast and get no damage\n    [*]Heli dropped 1 meter above the ground explodes\n    [*]Truck going faster than most of the cars\n    [*]You can't armor up/reload the gun while running and not able to fire a single bullet while sliding but, you can run & jump while you're carrying 100 rounds lmg, 50 cal. sniper and 50 rounds smg at the same time\n[/list]\n\nMuch more can be added to the list above. I think IW continue to provide/develop the engine and gunplay but for the love of god, stay the hell out of anything else about gameplay because your decisions made this game less enjoyable.\n\nThis game is pain but I don't know why I'm still playing it. Still, not recommended in its current state.\n- A fantastic rogue-lite where dying doesn't mean a hard reset. In death your character is succeeded by one of their offspring and all of your earned skills, talents, equipment and gold are passed down from one generation to the next, ensuring that even the weakest of players can still make progress. After each death you are given the choice of three characters that are randomised from a pool of three to eight classes (depending on how many you unlock) who are given randomly drawn traits and abilites; some good, some bad. The castle itself is also randomised keeping the game fresh despite there only being four environments.\n\nAll in all, I found it a thoroughly addictive game despite minimal experience in the genre beforehand and would recommend it to anyone who merely thought \"that looks interesting\" as they skimmed over the Steam store page.\n- >Be me\n>Move to new city for job offer\n>Go straight to bed when I arrive, but still oversleep and miss meeting with business contact\n>Have a message, but no contact information, so at suggestion of greasy hotel guy, I start randomly asking people on the street and café if they’re who I’m looking for\n>No luck, but random stranger points me to a club\n>Meet a cool chick who actually doesn’t treat me like a jerk\n>She has a boyfriend\n>Sad feelings\n>She invites me to a cool party anyway\n>Second person I talk to gives me a drink that really messes me up\n>Black out within first half hour of party\n>Wake up at cool chick’s house, she’s on her way to work\n>For some reason when I try to talk to her, I come across as a total stalker type.\n>Go to sleep\n>Next day, watch a train crash over some sort of secret agent\n>Mysterious hooded figure shows up, looms over g-man, then flees\n>Finally, some content, I think\n>Follow mysterious figure\n>Go into store, chase her into the basement\n>Door locks behind her\n>Weird guy there, gives me some backstory I promptly forget\n>Ask him every question that comes to me, but it won’t advance the plot\n>Wander around, not sure what to do\n>Not having fun\n>Meet a cool guy\n>He gives me a hacking device\n>Tells me he’ll teach me how to use it some other time\n>So much waiting\n>Finally run into guy who hired me and told me to move to this town\n>Tells me I’m fired\n>Go back to club\n>See cool chick\n>(only one of two people who actually treats me like a human being)\n>Talk to her\n>She calls me a stalker, I’m not sure why\n>Unable to defend myself\n>Weird basement guy tells me not to worry, invites me to another party\n>All I do is wander around and go to parties\n>Flashbacks of my real 20’s\n>Kill time until party by opening random doors and hacking a frying pan\n>Maybe I started a fire\n>Pass out in front of weird laser gate\n>Did I get electrocuted, or did I just fall asleep?\n>Go back to party\n>Weird guy tells me to loosen up and talk to girls\n>Girls all give me cold shoulder\n>Against better judgement, I drink several beers\n>Carry empties around with me because I can’t set them on counter\n>Weird guy tells me about a test\n>Won’t tell me how to take test, where to take test, or what I need to know to pass test\n>Worst party ever\n>Cool chick shows up again\n>She’s actually happy to see me\n>Try not to sound like stalker, kinda succeed, but I think I’m missing half the conversation\n>Also, I think cool chick might have a drinking problem\n>Me too, I’m staggering around\n>Drink coffee to try and sober up\n>Doesn’t work\n>Not having fun\n>Leave party\n>Kick lamp\n>Go to bed\n>Not tired enough to fall asleep\n>Wander around town, stumbling drunk, at 5 AM\n>Flashbacks to a dark time in my real life\n>Take drugs so time passes faster, flashbacks intensify\n>Talk to strangers since what else am I supposed to do\n>No one wants to talk to me\n>Cringingly accurate simulator of awkward college party years\n>Not fun game\n\nI hear from other reviews that this game starts to pick up after this point, but I can't do it anymore. I've already invested a lot of time and energy into this game for little to no return. I'm not going to study guides and waste more time on this game just so I can dig the nuggets of fun out of this wasted youth simulator. I will say that it did a really good job of making me role-play an awkward alcoholic with no job prospects and zero understanding of how to talk to women, living out of a ****** hotel room. But I've already played the real life version of that, so I can't recommend it. If you want to play a fun game about programming, go with Human Resource Machine. If you want a good role-playing game about hackers, go with Shadowrun. If you want to pay money and spend your leisure time feeling really depressed about your 20's, then I can recommend Else Heart.Break(), but maybe you'd be better off talking to a friend about it instead.\n- Stellaris is the contemporary 4X sci fi galactic empire grand strategy to play.  The spiritual successor to ancient space exploration games like Master of Orion and Star Wars: Rebellion.  Start out with just your homeworld and send out scout ships and colonies until you've got your own star empire. \n\nManage your population, tell them what to build, design your own spaceships and fleet structures, and then get pounded into the dirt by the far too cheaty AI... yeah, it's another one of those games where because it's hard to make the AI smart, Paradox decided instead to just make the AI units cheat and become ridiculously overpowered.\n\nI have to say the game is probably far too difficult even if you set all the difficulty to the easiest levels, it's unclear what the developers were thinking, but you can mod the game easily in Steam Workshop to make it viable to play single player. \n\nAs with all Paradox games the DLC pricing is murder, and it adds very little to the core game experience, so my advice is to grab this on sale if you were a fan of MOO, go straight to Steam Workshop and mod it until it's playable, and then you'll have a perfect time sink well worth your money.\n- For those of you still harbouring hesitations about \"walking simulators\"...here's one I'd definitely recommend you try.\n\n   So yes, it's quite linear, and no, it probably doesn't have an enormous amount of replayability. It's also quite short - about two to three hours - so I guess it's not that cheap at twenty buckaroonies. It is, however, one of the strongest examples of interactive storytelling you will ever enjoy, and an oddly varied experience given the bits of the game in which you briefly get to play the roles of cats, owls, and...well, I don't want to give too much away. Let's just say Tim Burton would be jealous (seeing what a boring old hack he's become these days).\n\n   For anyone who loves a good story in a game, with a willingness to sacrifice a bit of agency in order to have that superior narrative experience...it's a bit of a no-brainer. As for the rest of you, well: you only live once. And they do say variety is the spice of life. So if you only try one walking simulator before dismissing the entire genre, this could well be the one. Truly magical, wonderful stuff. And a bit of a tear-jerker at times, too.\n\nVerdict: 9.5/10.\n\n(PS Anyone claiming there is no \"gameplay\" in this title is either a drooling idiot, or hasn't played the game in its entirety. There's interaction and \"mini-games\" aplenty.)\n- Honestly I've put over 400 hours into 20XX and this game is even better! Even though it's unfinished as of current it's still a fantastic time and truly stands out on it's own.\n- The amount of love and fun that went into this game is astounding. If you like minigames, memes, fun, and a challenge, check this game out. The “ending” was a bit lackluster, in my opinion, but it did not taint my views on the game and I had an overwhelmingly fun time with it. Definitely recommend!\n- This game is great and is worth the cost, I have not tried it in VR yet but I imagine it's great....I have a slight urge to join the US military all of a sudden...\n- [b]Note: This review won't be about the game or the story itself really- it's the same trilogy we fell in love with. Rather, this review is to primarily focus on the changes between the original games and the Legendary Edition.[/b]\n\n[h1][u]Graphics:[/u][/h1]\nThe most obvious changes are the graphics, and wow does it stand out. In all three games, especially in Mass Effect 3 did it look very polished, detailed, and rendered beautifully. The lighting as well as the scenery stood out, more visually than before and the special effects as well as the atmosphere ... all in 4k. Characters also look polished and not as ugly anymore, though the models in Mass Effect 1 definitely aren't going to look as good as those in ME 2 & 3.\n\n[h1][u]Photo Mode:[/u][/h1]\nSurprisingly something we didn't ask for, but was much needed. Now it's very easy to pause the game whenever (even during combat) and just zoom in, rotate the camera, change filters, adjust the brightness or blur out the background to make the characters focused, ect. The amount of screenshots and pictures I took is insane, and a very welcome edition to this game. Trust me, go to Discord or Reddit devoted to Mass Effect, and the amount of pictures is staggering.\n\n[h1][u]Controller Support:[/u][/h1]\nUnlike the previous games on PC, they did not come with Controller Support. You would of had to install a program online or do specific steps in getting it to work with your controller, and even then it was a pain. Now you can just use an Xbox One controller or a PC controller without issue. As someone who grew up playing on console, this was a must have for me to enjoy the game more.\n\n[h1][u]Changes:[/u][/h1]\nWhile I didn't think they would do it, a number of things (appearances, design, events, ect) have been changed. I came across a few things they changed for the better, and one in particular is a spoiler in ME 3, but it was so good to see them change (involves Tali). The biggest changes are likely in ME 1, with environment changes and how the layout looks, along with the fact combat is more smooth and balanced in ME 1 now. In ME 2 & 3, it's unchanged for the most part, but the interface as well as quality of life improvements are there.\n\n[h1][u]Problems:[/u][/h1]\nI won't lie, despite I loved playing Legendary Edition, there was numerous problems I came across. One major issue stemmed from collision. In ME 1, 2, and 3, sometimes Shepard will find himself going over terrain or passing over into a wall, only to get stuck and nothing will fix that unless you restart a save or the mission itself. Another issue is the flare being incredibly bright at times, even toning it down to it's lowest, the flare and 'shine' of things can be blinding. Sometimes lip syncing is a bit off (ME 1 and ME 3 had a few instances of this) and followers not popping in at times. There is also no multiplayer which was a massive let down. I loved the multiplayer in ME 3, being able to play any race was so incredible and the wave of enemies per round was exciting to survive in with my friends. I wish they included it.\n\nMy biggest issue with all 3 games was the AI. At times, the enemy AI can be dumb to auto bot levels depending on the circumstances. I played on Insanity and ME 2 had every enemy become an auto bot, always aiming for me in a split second with 100% perfect accuracy and never aiming for anyone else, even walking PAST my allies to shoot me. Then you have my AI squadmates being very broken or dumb, depending on again, the circumstances. In ME 1, they were so useless it was painful. In ME 2, they were alright but had some dumb moments. In ME 3, they could carry me and I would look at my phone as they did all the work (if you build them right). Balance and AI are a big problem in Legendary, and I hope they improve AI for everyone's sanity.\n\n[h1][u]Worth It?[/u][/h1]\nTruth be told, if you want to relive the trilogy and have an excuse, I say go for it. The price is reasonable despite a lot of people want the game cheaper or free if they own the original games already. But if you think about it, all 3 games ($20 each) plus every DLC released are free in Legendary Edition. But apart from that, despite I did very much enjoy playing this trilogy all over again, the changes aren't that big in scope. Mostly just better graphics, better framerate, adjustments in combat and adding a few changes to scenes / design of things. If you're a huge fan like me and don't mind, then yea it is worth. But if you aren't that impressed with the perks of Legendary Edition, you aren't missing out on too much. Legendary Edition is like the old trilogy but in nicer paint, polished, and got some upgrades. But even with that said, this was such a treat and I enjoyed every moment, even with the stacked cons. Amazing series overall, a must have whether it's the older games or Legendary Edition.\n- Imagine releasing an \"update\" that breaks peoples games/ mods, JUST SO YOU CAN PUT A BANNER AD IN THE MENU FOR BL3. Just WOW.\n- I bought this piece of shit with 50 other games.\nIt is as if some great sculptor , sculpted out of a great feculence.\nI do honestly admire your efforts.

I went and looked at the store page, My Brother/Friend Ethan-Winters Just Told Me this game in the steam store now, so went ahead and bought it. After buying it, went and started up the game some day later. Went into the game, saw another model character that looks like mine, I thought it was an AI because I had thought it was a single player game. So I decided to play along with it, we went through the story, it progressed quite fast, mainly because we both did not really bother to check out other things. The more I played, the more I realized that the guy I was playing with was most definitely not an AI, it was a genuine player. As we went through the story, our cooperation got smoother, we no longer have a solo player attitude, we would signal to each other, wait for each other and walked, fly with each other. It was smoothing, relaxing, a truly unique experience. Even with the setbacks we had throughout our progression, we never gave up, we stuck together from the desert till the end, when one of us screwed up, we patiently waited for the other, chiming to the person where we are. I remember at the end, when i screwed up a jump and did not see the other player, I was genuinely scared, sad, I frantically searched for the person but to no avail. I was distraught, sad and disappointed but I continued onward. When I went up, there he was, chiming for me, assuring me that he had not left yet. I felt happy, comforted when I saw the person waiting for me and together we finished the story. I am not one to do reviews, but it was such a unique experience among my years of gaming that I had to share it. Thank you, punks for the experience, truly thank you. And thank you, for bothering to read my review.\n\ni'll never forget our journey kind stranger.\n\nThis wasn't a game, it was an experience. I highly recommend you do this.\n- You are an astronaut, you wake up in a rescue rocket, and against your wills you are shot from Theseus space station on Chori V planet. After landing on the planet you find a strange device that helps you get back on board and survive until help arrives.\n\nGreat game, get it on sale, because it is a bit short. I like games like Portal 2, The Talos Principle, and there is no point to compare this games, because they are completly different, even if they have few common things like solving riddles and story with fresh look at some philosophical questions. Point is that every one of them including The Swapper is good at what it do, and every one of them is unique. For me it is pleasure to play this game beacause of it atmospheric well done design, riddles and questioning the meaning of existence.\n- New edit: The developers have made the steam workshop available, but as an Oceanic user I don't have direct access to the workshop and I can't upload mods. It seems to be only available to Chinese modders, much like the previous 3rd party software. The problem appears to be covered up and not solved.\n\nEdit: Modding capability is now available. The devs are using a 3rd part chinese workshop that we all hate (thanks devs), however you can use Nexus Mods instead. Simply go to the Tale of Immortal nexus page and download any mod, then add it into the local mod section provided in the mod category. Then you're good to go.\n\nBe aware that currently, from what I've seen, the IDs mods use are generated at mod creation and multiple mods have a chance of ID conflict (breaking the mod/s). So if you have problems this may be the reason.\n\n\nOfficial English translation is available. The devs have mentioned 90% is translated, but I believe it won't impact gameplay. Players who haven't launched the game before will be switched to English automatically.\n\nIf you have launched the game before you will have to do the following: in the main menu select 语言 and change 简体中文 to English (Alpha) and restart the game.\n\nFor my review: Having played the game, I can say it's both good and bad. It failed to meet my expectations but I still enjoyed the game and will recommend it. The art is fantastic. The combat is fun but lacking compared to other action & slash titles (there is a lot they could do with it). Quests aren't very clear and their incentives are bad making it hard to get invested. You don't get anything really unique or interesting from quests as far as I've played.\n\nProgression is the most disappointing part of the game. It's a mix of crafting, gathering and looting to acquire items that will either enable you to advance or give you a stronger stat-boost when you do advance. Every realm does the same thing, only requiring different items at the new area/s that open up for that realm. This is a shame. Progression is the area that has the most potential in this game and yet is the most tacked on part, mostly an afterthought.\n\nThe developers could've made each realm advancement unique, with different gameplay mechanics for each one that ties into the unique aspects of the area/realm they're in. This would be a fantastic way to give a sense of freshness to each area the player explores and make them engage more actively in said area rather than rushing through it as we do now.\n\nProgression could've been the strongest part of this game but they ended up making it the weakest. Again, it's a shame. I see so much potential that just isn't capitilised on. Overall this is an experience I'd recommend. But I'd only play it once in its current state.\n- [h1]Prelude[/h1]\n\nWorld's Dawn is relaxing/life simulation game. While it's inspired by Harvest Moon series (probably FoMT, BtN or other's  before 2004), farming isn't the core gameplay of this game. It's developed since 2010 with RPG Maker VX, so personally i wouldn't compare this game with other game which have higher price or far bigger development budget.\n\n\n[h1]Story/Character[/h1]\n\nThe main story of World's Dawn is similar with Harvest Moon series before 2004. You move to a village with goal saving the the village. To progress the main story, basically you need to do 5 things such as farming, friendship & romance. While the main story isn't outstanding, it's better than i expected for Life/Farming Sim game.\n\nSugar Blossom Village has fair amount of lore & festival. There are few interesting secrets waiting to be discovered with OKish reward. The festivals are very fun & enjoyable, it's unique experience that i don't get on many Life/Farming Sim game. There are 4-5 festivals on each season to keep you engaged, although 2 of them are market festival.\n\nThere are 24 characters in this game, with 8 more as you progress the story. Each character are unique with decent writing. Each of them has decent amount of conversation lines for many occasion (take a walk with your dog, after marriage proposal, before/after festival, about new villagers, etc.). It's best part of World's Dawn, although i hardly can remember their name.\n\n\n[h1]Visual/Audio[/h1]\n\nEach character has lovely art style. I like it since doesn't lean too much towards cutesy/anime artstyle which is common on today's Farming Sim game. Most marriage candidate also have 4 different portraits depending on the season, which is nice addition.\n\nThe general visual of the game feels dull though, even considering it's RPGMaker game. It fares better during Winter & some festival though. Each season also looks quite different, so it's far more than simple reskin. Animal need better sprite/animation though.\n\nThe soundtrack is decent & it doesn't feel boring hearing it many times. Each seasons & some area have it's own soundtrack, although it's something you'd expect from Farming Sim game. The audio effect/SFX is only average though. On a side note, i also wish each marriage candidate has a bit more voice acting.\n\n\n[h1]General gameplay[/h1]\n\nWorld's Dawn core gameplay isn't farming, there are so many things you could do (fishing, mining, social interaction, etc.). I'd say World's Dawn is a bit of everything. The game offer little progression though, so the gameplay feel stale after 2 seasons. Combining that & linear story, this game has no replayability value.\n\nThe control is easy to learn, although little awkward. But due to limitation of RPG Maker engine, you can't rebind any action. While there are 2 free hotkey for item, you only can bind shovel & watering can. It makes barn work rough.\n\nI also experience few bugs. None of those are game breaking, but could annoy you. Here are few that i could remember,\n> Few achievement not unlocked on Steam\n> Some items sometimes not shown on inventory if you spam button up/down/enter/back\n> 99 maximum item quantity, where additional item you obtained simply gone. I proved it by through item shipping & cooking\n\n\n[h1]Game mechanics[/h1]\n\nThis section review each game mechanics in more detail. Here's rough meaning of sign that i use in this section,\n> (+) Positive, neat game mechanics or i like the game mechanics\n> (*) Neutral, average, acceptable or what i expect from Life Sim/Farming Sim game\n> (-) Negative, poor game mechanic or i hate the game mechanic\n\n[b]Energy[/b]. (*) First of all, running deplete your energy. (-) At beginning of game, you only have small energy capacity  so you can't do all tasks. There are many ways to replenish your energy in this game. (-) Consuming food/beverage is rather useless/costly, (*) while resting on bench is fine option only when you have time to spare. (+) But hot spring restore 100% energy which only took 20 minutes (once per day). (+) It's really powerful mechanic after energy capacity is increased. (*) You can use Eden Fruit to permanently increase your energy, (+) where you can obtain all of them within first 2 seasons.\n\n[b]Farming[/b]. Just like most Farming Sim game, there are 4 seasons with different crops for each seasons. (*) Your farmland is limited to 40 tiles & possible upgrade only give 12 additional tiles. (*) There are only 3 crops for each season, excluding Wheat which can be planted on any season. (*) Initially your watering can only can water 1 tile at a time, but later you can get upgrade which water 3x3 tile. (+) The upgrade could be obtained with small amount of coin & watering few hundred tiles which could be obtained quickly.\n\n[b]Animal[/b]. (*) You can have 5 types of animal: Chicken, Cow, Horse, Dog & Cat. (*) For first 3 animal, there's nothing much to do besides feed, interact, brush and bring them outside. (+) You just need to ring bell to bring all livestock inside/outside though, which is convenient. (+) Dog is quite helpful, you can send him on errand & bark on spot which contain an item. (*) The cat only act cute though.\n\n[b]Fishing[/b]. (+) While fishing is also good way to earn coin, (-) it has really poor mechanic/balance. (*) It takes an hour to fish, where you only can get one fish with initial tool (Fishing Rod). (-) After you upgrade your Fishing Rod into Landing Net, the mini game isn't changed where you must hook one fish at a time. (-) Finally, you need to spend 20 hours to get 1st upgrade & 70 hours to get 2nd upgrade. I really don't like this since each upgrade let you catch larger variety of fish.\n\n[b]Mining[/b]. It's quite simple, you destroy stone, get raw gemstones & refine it to jewels. The cave only has 5 depth where lower depth has better drop rate/quality. (+) It's really powerful way to earn coin, especially after pickaxe upgrade & increase maximum energy. (*) RNG is involved to determine which raw gemstones & jewel you get. (*) But since 2 process use RNG, there's small possibility you're very lucky & vice versa.\n\n[b]Cooking[/b]. Basically i find it's unwelcoming. (-) You could miss chance to buy 3 out of 4 cooking utensils from TV program. (-) The next chance is either next year or festival on Fall/Winter. (*) Finding recipe also take some time, coin, effort or trial-and-error (only for mixture). (-) Many recipes (excluding mixture) need lots of ingredients where some of them only available on certain season, where i barely cook anything until Fall.\n\n[b]Social interaction[/b]. (*) Giving item is fastest way to increase villager favorability. (+) The good thing is the game has manual which list what each character likes, although you need to find out their favorite item by yourself. (+) You also can talk to them, join certain festival & take part time jobs to increase their favorability.\n\n[b]Other[/b].\n> (+) There's TV in your house which gives some useful information, (*) although you only can see tomorrow weather forecast from 6 PM onward\n> (*) To see list of festival, you need to buy calendar or see someone's else at their home\n> (*) There's no portable map, so you have to remember village environment or going to sign which show village map\n> (+) Clothing has some impact on gameplay, (*) although the description is somehow confusing\n> (*) LockBall control is somehow awkward & locking mechanic is confusing, (+) although it's fun for me\n> (+) Event-specific mini games is short, but fun while it's lasted\n> (*) Foraging is just average, but has decent importance on this game\n> (+) No tedious item management, everything is stored on your knapsack\n\n\n[h1]Closure[/h1]\n\nWhile i have some criticism on the gameplay, the story & character are best part of World's Dawn. I find this game very fun for first 2.5 seasons & quite fun for later 1.5 seasons. If you're looking for relaxing game with good character/story & unpunishing gameplay, you'll like this game.\n\nP.S. **** 8K char limit!\n- Even with over 500 years difference between us, Andreas is one of the most relatable characters I've played this year because I too would rather try to ineffectively solve random mysteries than directly confront my depression.\n- Buy if you want an average sandbox game. Don't buy for the mediocre story, boss battles or repetitive missions.\n\n\nMGO: I want to like it, but it has so many problems.\n\n-until recently had no push-to-talk\n-peer-to-peer connections meaning lag depending on the host, and being sent back to lobby if the host leaves. CQC also will lag where you will grapple back and forth.\n-no text chat\netc.\n- Two words: Modding Heaven. This is probably one of the most modular games I've ever played. \n\nYou wanna play Mount and Blade in a historical time period instead of Calradia? OK, which one? Don't answer, it doesn't matter, there's probably a mod for it. \n\nWanna add in some magic and play in a fantasy universe? There's mods for that. \n\nHow about a game set in the modern day? Or in a sci-fi universe? Or a post-apocalypse wasteland? Or the Wild West? Or maybe something specific like throwing your hat into the Game of Thrones, or defending the World of Men in Lord of the Rings, or taking over the Empire from Star Wars?\n\nPerhaps you'd like to set sail on the seven seas as a pirate in a nautical adventu-! Oh, wait, OK, there aren't any of -those-. \n\n...but there's mods for all of the others, with even more being made every day! \n\n\nI guarantee, if you buy this and are open to modding your game, you will never go another year without playing Warband. Maybe a week, maybe a few months-- but just when you think you're done with it, you'll find another mod based on your favorite movie series popping up to pull you back in. \n\nIt is worth well above whatever you'll pay for it.\n\n\n- UPDATE: This remains to be one of the best games I have ever played. The company that created the game though... One more launcher that is completely unnecessary. The performance with the 'next-gen' update is horrible. I have half the fps I used to have on the very same rig and that is after going lower with the settings that I used to have. Why did you have to do this b U Ll $I t?\n\n\nThe best way to embrace the true greatness of this game is to look on how the series has improved since the first and the second part of The Witcher. You simply won't find anything that hasn't changed for the better.\n\n- Vast open world that IS NOT randomly created and filled with dull stuff,\n- Story which engages you from the first 10 minutes to the very end,\n- Graphics, even despite the whole controversy of a thing called downgrade, still makes this game THE BEST LOOKING RPG ever created,\n- Soundtrack, it finally goes back to the style presented originally in The Witcher 1, something that makes you forget that's just the video game, it gives you the feeling you are in there, in some village, city or that you are fighting with someone / something, which turns every single battle into an unforgettable memory,\n- Every single side quest, and believe me, there is A LOT of them, is actually a little story that keeps you playing with the same force as the main quests - I call it - a new quality in RPGs,\n- Choices and their impact on the story - even a small choice that seems insignificant at the time can wage on the whole world around you,\n- THIS GAME IS MATURE, finally a game dealing with a lot of subjects which are usually handled very childishly or not at all,\n- Combat - nothing more to add, it's decent, though it's nothing to be praised really, you won't be able to mash buttons and win - you have to dodge, use signs, and on higher difficulties get yourself ready to have an oil for a specific enemy and a bomb to be able to put an end to his or her misery.\n\nThe Witcher 3 is not a game without its flaws, although nothing that can't be fixed - some balance issues, economy basically showing Geralt as a very wealthy person (who he should not be), small performance problems like stuttering in Novigrad and in my opinion very limited after the end content (fixed by the expansions). Many of the things I struggled with have been already fixed and there is no need to disclose them. \n\nAll in all, one of the best games in the last few years (even a decade).\n- To be completely honest, throughout my entire playthrough, I was thinking on giving this game a \"Not Recommended\" but it really wouldn't have deserved it. This game is at the same time both very difficult to recommend as to not recommend. It is really a beatiful and extremely original game, with a pretty well told interesting story. However, the problem it has is that it doesn't really work as a puzzle game. Puzzle solutions don't make logical sense most of the time and you end up brute forcing your way through most of the game. This means trying every posibility until something works and moves the story foward, and this is just not good puzzle design. This also distracts you from the story being told, which is in itself not so easy to understand, it requirers you to be paying attention to details, so your brain has to be constantly switching between \"puzzle mode\" and \"story mode\". Anyway, you can tell a lot of love was put into this game, and that is why I ultimately recommend it.\n7.5/10-\n- unprofessional review:\n\nits a really deep lore kind of game, very cool!\nit has some horror and grinding elements which i always love\ni havent finished the game just yet tho \nthe visuals are very cute\nas soon as i bought it was hooked!\noke theres many more but im to lazy to type :joy:\n\nover all ill give it a 10/10\nvery interesting lore wise\n- Let's get this straight real quick, if you are brand new to this game and want to buy it, it can be anywhere from a 1-3 star game in your eyes. The game is full of a bunch of glitches, bugs, and somewhat odd mechanics. When starting off, you may find yourself absolutely hating the game, as some of the things that happen are fairly adgetating. Once you have put in some time to figure out some of the major flaws, and how to avoid or fix them, this game is one of the best out there by far. You can do just about anything in this game, from PVP to roleplay. People you meet on this game will most likely be from your worst nightmares, but alot of the time you can meet people that you will know forever. Ever since my first day, I still play with friends that I made on day 1. However, do not trust anyone off the bat. The game can be extremely relaxing and laid back, if you play it that way and avoid the toxic or sweaty players. But if you want some major action, you can jump into a heavily populated PVP server and battle for hours. Personally, I give the game 5/5 now that I have learned how to prevent and fix a lot of the possibly game-ruining glitches and bugs. There is so much to do and learn in this game that I find it very hard to get bored of it. From the people, to the gameplay, this game will test your guts. Do not buy this game if you are expecting something perfect, but if you work around the rough points, you will play this game forever. It is one of the most immersive games ever made, and you will find yourself literally playing until you can't. I don't remember the last time I got off of DayZ and started playing another game, rather than getting off completely.\n\nA few hours later...\nIn love...\n- This is less of a review and more of me gushing about how much im enjoying myself, but you can still get a idea of what the game is from it. I am not usually a puzzle game player, or even a \"chill\" game player. im usually all about quick shooters, fighters, and platformers, but i decided to give this game a shot and i am very glad i did. with a mechanic as simple as pushing trees i thought that it would be simple enough for me to have a good time, the last time i played a puzzle game was BaBa is You and i put 14 hours into it and never got past word 3, it was just too much for me. but this game manages to still be challenging even with it laying all the pieces out in front of me, it introduces new features not by putting one in a level and saying good luck, it makes you do something you have done before but gives a new outcome, because you never got to do that thing in that exact way before, and when puzzles start requiring you to do those things you wonder how you ever got that far without doing one of those things before. all of the mechanics and solutions also are based in logic, all your doing is pushing things, so you dont have to suspend your current understanding of things to learn a new mechanic. The world of the game is also very relaxing and sucks me right in, its a museum of the \"past\" of humans that takes place in the far future from the perspective of monsters who dont really understand human culture, and it is hilarious! the music is very chill and moves with your actions, when you push something in a specific way the music also does a specific things, and its part of the reason this game is so relaxing. most other puzzle games i have played frustrate me when i get stuck on a puzzle for a long time, but seeing the monster relax helps me relax and keep a level head to get to the next museum exhibit. i dont know how to end this review but if you read it i hope you dont feel like i wasted your time!\n- I'm going to write an honest review for this game since A LOT of people seem to be very biased.\n\nThis is not a perfect game. No 2K basketball game will ever be a perfect game. Does that mean this game is bad? No. Should you hold off on the game for now? Probably.\n\nLet's start with the positives:\n\n- A lot of people seem to gloss over the fact that 2K rehauled a lot of mechanics for this game. Shot meters feel more legitimate, this game is MUCH much more realistic (fouls, shot tendencies, etc...) This game is better and more fluid to control, and the gameplay reflects each players' ratings (defense, shots, etc...) much more accurately.\n\n- Online play seems to be better and more fluid. I've yet to encounter any latency issues online with quick play and the such.\n\n- MyCareer is MUCH better than last years. There is no cheesy story and the cutscenes feel much more integrated into the game. Orange Juice and dynamic duos are a great idea in general. The UI for MyCareer (and the game in general) is so much cleaner and more functional.\n\n- The game is visually beautiful, not much else to say on the matter.\n\nNow, the cons:\n\n- Help defense is broken. It's quite ridiculous that 2K hasn't fixes this lingering issue in such a long time but it's still there. This is a BIG issue in MyCareer and not quite as bad in other modes since you can manually control players.\n\n- Stat allocation is broken. This is a huge issue in MyCareer and has deterred me from playing the mode any more until 2K fixes this issue. Introducing the idea of stats that can only be raised in practice is actually quite a neat idea. However, these boosts are not permanent, even though 2K has stated they are. This is detrimental and demoralizing and discourages players from playing the game more. Limit caps are ridiculously strict as well. 2K NEEDS to fix these issues ASAP.\n\n- Numerous glitches.\n\n- 2K introduced broken mechanics along with the good mechanics. Ankle breakers are now pathetically easy to pull off (using Stephen Curry behind the back moves is a surefire way to have your defender fall). Moving screens are now a thing. \n\nI would hold off on buying this game until 2K patches it. There are just too many issues with the game that prevent it from being a playable game. I like this game. I really do. That's why I'm hoping 2K listens to the community and starts working on the issues at hand immediately.\n- Playing this game for the first time six years after its initial release proved to be a delight in disguise. With all the memes and jokes established, I was finally able to understand what the fuss was all about back in 2011. Despite not having the best gameplay, story or graphics out there, something about this title just made me want to finish every quest I deemed worth completing. \n\n9/10 - mods recommended\n- I realise this is intended to be a darkly humored game, but it is still fucked up nonetheless. I just can't fathom how such degraded humor can be seen as funny.\n- [i]While the artwork and combat remain enjoyable, the story, writing, and pacing were a major letdown.[/i]  \n\n***\nMINOR SPOILERS BELOW. If you're going to play the game, play before reading.\n***\n\n[b]The mature storylines, hard-hitting decisions, beautiful worldbuilding, and tight writing that made the first two so immersive is not present in this game.[/b] (You'll notice immediately that the writing for the caravan in the capital is [i]particular[/i] trite, awkward to read, and uninteresting.)\n\nUnfortunately, it's not just the writing that's weak. [i]The pacing is off.[/i] Antecedents are confusing, characters you'd expect to speak don't, events that should have been foreshadowed come out of nowhere. More frustrating are the serious character continuity \"errors,\" and arcs that disappear, change, or go nowhere. [i]In short, the events, decisions, and conflict from the previous games do not appear or resolve in a way that was suggested by the previous two[/i].\n\n\nHere's one example. In Banner Saga 2, Fosolt is unexpectedly rescued by Bolverk. [i]\"I have a message for Alette from the dead varl king,\" [/i]he said. That's pretty intriuging! Maybe there's a mystery, an oracle, an item, or just cool information about the Varl and their strange king? Maybe there'll finally be context about the bridge decision!\n\n[i]No! He has nothing interesting to say or add, and then his storyline just gets dropped and forgotten.[/i]\n\nWell, Bolverk's been possessed by Bellower! Gosh, who knows what Bellower will say? In fact, I can't wait to find out what happens to Bellower's body! \n\nWell, actually, Bolver's [i]not[/i] possessed, not really, certainly not like it was implied last game, and Bellower's body -- [i]a primary focus of the first two games[/i] -- isn't mentioned [i]once[/i]\n\nOr how about how they casually mention that Eyvyn is not only the [i]head[/i] of the Valka order, but also that he's had periodic bursts of hereditary madness all along? That's... odd. And it's not presented as an well-thought out [i]reveal[/i] or anything. It's presented matter-of-factly, like they were trying to ret-con in a less interesting story, or were tone deaf.\n\nYou'll notice that all the characters are underutilized and have unfulfilled storylines/tensions. Hakon has hard choices to make; Canary's a little crazy; Yrsa is mysterious; Gil's in love with Alette, etc. Will these build into choices? Reveals? Dependent endings based on choices? Will there be discussions referencing the past? Reflections on travels? Hints of despair?\n\nNo. In mine, Gil was [i]murdered[/i] and no one even bothered to reference it. Canary's situation never comes to a head. You never have to choose between Varls and Humans. Murdering people doesn't make people threaten to leave. Ubin returns randomly as an uber Varl and he's... learned the horseborne's language? Travelled the southlands? In like, a month? In a way that doesn't advance the plot? It's just... weakly done.\n\n\nThere are [i]so many[/i] examples like this, where the stories don't quite fit correctly, where what you picked up on in the early games about the [i]mysteries[/i] and the [i]world[/i] and what made it a [i]vibrant[/i] place were forgotten about by the writers. [b]The result is that it the game plays out in unsatisfying ways, in tenseless scenarios made vapid by watered-down morality, an inability to leverage the situation in fun ways, and low-quality writing, paucity of choice-making, a lack of exploration, lack of plot twists, simplified overworld mechanics -- all culminating in an almost staggeringly one-dimensional and shallow ending.[/b]\n\nThe Banner Saga series was always an experience that was greater than the sum of its part. An [i]experience[/i]. Of being [i]riveted[/i] to the computer, checking the map, worrying over supplies, guessing at mysteries, having my breath taken away at each hill. Unfortunately, that's not the case in this game. \n\n\nGameplay-wise, it's also a bit of a letdown. Combat is fun-ish, but you can make invincible character combinations and the mechanics don't even try to deal with this. There's an interesting new reinforcement mechanic that's not used heavily, and never pushes you like you think the end of the world would. You never really have to split up your forces. There's no novelty. Like maybe using a hero in a battle makes them fatigued, so you have to switch them up? Maybe you can station them different places, making them unusable for combat? Maybe you need to choose eight for a secret mission caravan? Maybe dream sequences? No, nothing like that. \n\nThe overworld gameplay had some changes that never really felt significant. Moreover, quite a bit felt taken away. You can't rest, do training missions, no longer weigh food vs upgrades. One example of all thise tone deafness was Iver's march through the destroyed world was consistently at \"Great Morale!\"\n\nThere didn't seem to be many flavor choices (\"Do we hang the criminals or let them join us?\"), including much less on social themes (\"Should women fight, if it disturbs the traditionally-minded men?\" \"One clan's rowdy, what do we do?\" \"They threaten to leave if so and so isn't banished\"), and less delayed results and fewer significant decisions, including among the game's built-up tensions among the factions. \n\n\nThere's also some cases of development [i]feeling[/i] cheap. Remember opening Banner Saga 2, and feeling that it was [i]fresh[/i], and [i]upgraded[/i]? There's little to make you feel that way here. The artwork is okay, but the environments feel more generic, with less variety, and the surreal landscapes in the darkness aren't especially interesting to look at for long periods of time. Iver is voiced by Bolverk's voice actor, and they sound exactly the same. The new title system is a fun idea, but is visually integrated into the game's menu system with the finesse of a cheap mod. \n\nThere's a moment in the game where the screen goes black for scrolling text and voiceover narration explaining the upcoming mechanic. Um, a character can't explain that? It was similar how the many two second animations are used, not to supplement the story, but to [i]replace[/i] written portions, making you feel unsure about what's going on. And finally, the game's pretty short, without fun combat challenges or interesting newgame+ challenges. \n\n\nWhat's [i]particularly[/i] frustrating is that the game's release date was moved forward four months. I don't know the story why, but I do know that a few more months of polish and story embellishment might have delivered the beautiful, grippingly interactive story we were hoping for. Because this is a watered down version of the previous two in just about every way.\n\nThis negative review is for whatever processes lead to this mediocre finale.\n\n---\n\n[i]Here's a plot that would have made more sense. Zephyr arrives and speaks to you secretly. There's a god that's still alive! Neat, now we'll finally get more story on that. Yay, fun caravan mode, now we need to take longships somewhere interesting!\n\nBut uh-oh! There's a Sundr villain going there as well, with an army of dredge! But at least now we'll finally get more story about the Sundr! \n\nThe god reveals something interesting, talks about Juno, the sun, gives a means to protect the city and help Iver. But when you return to the city, now the king and rugga and the factions have devolved into fighting based on your choices. How are you going to handle this? Which of many possibilities will ascend to the throne? How will you defend the city? And what mystery lies beneath the mountain of the city...\n\nFor Iver's caravan, there should be pockets of dredge villages kept alive by Spellsingers. Now you need to decide to plunder them or not! More stuff to do! Maybe go to the remains of the Varl capital first? Fight warped Valka? Realize deceptions, machinations, corruption, hear stories? Find new characters, have old ones die?\n\nInstead there... wasn't a plot?[/i]\n- Early Access Review:\nPros: \n- Hilarious flavor text in the form of Books and Proverbs. Seriously, someone took a lot of time creating all that.\n- Really enjoyable music\n- Beautiful pixel art\n- Engaging and interesting story\n- Overall very fun introduction to a huge world\n- Highly responsive dev team that's not only advacing on completion of the game but actively listens to their already large community of players\n- There's a lot of secrets and things to do that you might run out of time to do before the end of the year deadline. You may find yourself needing to play the early access a few times to find everything.\n\nCons:\n- This is early access folks, there's going to be a few bugs here and there\n- The early access content ramps up really fast and gets very interesting and then ends with you really wanting to know what's next. This is really only a con because I'm really impatient and want the full game asap. ;)\n- The message Dusk delivers is, \"Hey, have you ever wanted to play Quake or Doom, except that it takes place in Silent Hill? Don't worry, neither has literally anyone else, but you're welcome!\"\n- First of all, I really like the Game, it's Gameplay is wonderful and i really enjoy the parkour to combat mix in it. Although i noticed a lot of bugs especially in COOP i still enjoy logging on the game.\n\nThe Story is good but doesn't need a upgrade in my opinion. I like that certain map changes and Story decisions are dependant on some side quests and on each other.\n\nNow to the sad part:\n\nTencent recently bought Techland which was controversial at first, but then DL points were added which made a lot of people mad at Tencent and partially Techland, understandably.\nThey Including me don't want the game to die out because a greedy company wants to make some quick buck.\n\nAlthough i have to say myself, other Tencent bought games still are quite enjoyable.\n\nI just hope that Techland does the right thing in future and makes the current state of DL points less predatory and more Cosmetic based pure.\n\nIn it current state we still have no knifes without Bundles, but that was before Tencent so the blame for that goes to Techland, but i am excited for future updates and playing Dying light 2, even without buying DL points :)\n\nI'll give this game a solid 7/10 for the bugs, microtransactions but also because it has good gameplay and community reach\n\n(I have edited my original negative review about the pure rant about DL points because i also wanted to consider current gameplay and more)\n- Great game for the most part.\nI do not like how they made a rpg with twitch aspects though.\nMy characters are supposed to be strong and agile not me on the keyboard.\nDo not expect to beat the island master(2nd ending) unless your very agile with your fingers.\nAt 50 years old it is impossible to get him down past 3/4 health.\nToo much twich and not enough character skill.\nGames like might and magic you never had to be agile with the keyboard.\nGuess this one goes under my \"Ending too hard category\"\n- They added \"Precision\" mode for the mouse under controls, which is pretty much raw mouse movement. YAY!\n\nAnyway, one of my favorite games of all time easily at this point. Incredible story, fun combat, and awesome world. A must play for sure, especially if you've never played it before on Play-Station (like me). It also has a New Game Plus mode that unlocks different NG+ only armor that are insane.\n\nI played at normal, and aside from the Valkyries the other bosses are a cakewalk. Maybe play on hard or hardest.\n- [h1] My tier S game [/h1]\n\n[b] This game is fantastic! [/b]\n- Well-incentivised exploration\n- No bs OP bosses, no random encounters, no pointless fetch quests \n- Packed with content; lots of it\n- Mini games and a variety to the gameplay\n- No need to play the first instalment of the series (8bit adventure 1)\n- The last boss fight is epic\n- Memorable cast of characters \n- No grinding needed; you will be OP just by playing it\n- Basic game, extremely well done. Like going home and eating your mom's food after decades on the road.\n\nEditing the review to mention some of the flaws of the game:\n- the level design in general is not that great, with every tiny room requiring some mindlessly easy puzzle to be solved first. Eventually it just feels like a chore.\n- not sure if it's something with my steam deck, but I had to put both the game's and the screen's brightness to the max to be able to see things; before that I was constantly missing objects and having trouble with moving around because some soil path looked like a hole in the ground or something.\n- while the game is 2d, there's a lot of different layers of height and depth that get mixed in together and may be hard to tell apart. You often don't know if some platform can be climbed onto or jumped out of until you try to do it.\n- battle system gets repetitive after a while.\n\nDespite those problems, the game is still great and more than make up for those things in other areas.\n- [h1] DiRT4 a review and comparison with DiRT Rally [/h1]\n\nAfter 100 hours in Dirt Rally and another 40 in Dirt 4 I feel like I am finally able to give a good comparison of both games while also reviewing Dirt 4. This review will be comprised of 5 categories of which \"Handling and Realism\" is the most important for me at least.\n\n[u] Handling and Realism [/u]\nIt is immediately clear that Dirt 4 is less focused than Dirt Rallye being a sequel to Dirt 3 rather than Dirt Rally but this does not mean Dirt 4 is less realistic than Dirt Rally.\nOn the contrary cars have more weight and are not as floaty as in Dirt Rally. There is no more pogo jumping over bumps and driving techniques like lifting/breaking before jumps are actually useful. In general weight transfer is much better in Dirt 4 than in Dirt Rally lockups are more present than in Dirt Rally encouraging good driving and on-throttle braking. \nGrip levels are quite high in places probably because of the added car weight at least on gravel stages. On tarmac Dirt 4 is way better than Dirt Rally still not very good since there is no tire flex but cars do not seem to drive on rails grip is significantly lowered compared to Dirt Rally and cars are more lively.\nThe real issue Dirt 4 seems to have is on-throttle traction. In general cars have to much traction especially when driving RWD cars on-throttle oversteer is not as progressive as you would expect on a gravel road and traction breaks very sudden thus playing with the gas is not as effective in creating oversteer as it should be making RWD cars quite boring and stale compared to AWD and FWD cars. Weather does not affect handling too much on gravel and tarmac which is a bit of a shame since it seems like there are tools in place for simulating aquaplaning. On snow weather has no affect on handling whatsoever. While both games have deforming snow banks in Sweden leaning still does not really work since the snow banks in both games just feel like guard rails with some padding attached to them more deformation would be better. Damage models are great and internal damage seems to occur more often than in Dirt Rally but the damage model is far from realistic and just not punishing enough a hardcore mode would be very much appriciated since all the necessary tools seem to be in place.\nFFB hasn't much changed since Dirt Rally it still requres a lot of tweaking and is missing many effects and settings other sims like iRacing, Assetto Corsa and RaceRoom have.\nNonetheless Dirt 4 has a more realistic driving experience than Dirt Rallye. \n\n[u] Tracks [/u]\nCodemasters has put a lot of effort into highlighting the procedural track generation tool of Dirt 4. While it is an intriguing idea to have countless tracks and endless content the execution lacks variety. It seems as if the tool is combining certain premade sections procedually. The issue could be fixed if codemasters creates  [b] many [/b] more sections the algorithm can choose from. Also a track editor where users could make their own track sections and tracks would help mitigate repetition and prolong the games lifecycle. Also rally stages are quite short compared to their real life counterparts which can exceed 40km more than twice the length of Dirt 4's longest stages. Codemasters is keen to make Rally stages longer but claims that the Ego engine cant handle stages longer than ~18km. Still repetition is way smaller than in Dirt Rally which has maybe 20 hours worth of original content. The selection of locations is limited due to licensing but diverse enough. Rallycross has more tracks and is more fleshed out than in Dirt Rally while retaining the official FIA branding and Landrush is a nice addition to the game while not necessarily needed.\n\n[u] Cars [/u]\nThe car selection lacks a bit. While most of the really important rallye cars are in the game some classes like WRC are missing completely due to licensing issues making R5 the fastest available class in the game for rallying. Rallyecross on the other hand has all cars you can really wish for since Codemasters hold the license for the FIA World Rallycross Championship.\n\n[u] Graphics [/u]\nOverall the graphics haven't improved much since Dirt Rally. While lighting and effects have improved the overall looks of the game are hindered by the quite repetitive stages. Also variation is very big while sometimes really beautiful e.g. a stage after some rain Dirt 4 can come across really stale looking. Still the game does not look bad the engine just needs a  refresh. \n\n[u] Sound [/u]\nLike the graphics Dirt 4's sound didn't really improve since Dirt Rally. Sounds are generally informative but not much more also Dirt 4 has some layering issues and you probably need some adjusting to get a good mix. The co-driver is really good considering the tracks are procedually generated but bad camber call-outs would be appreciated. Really nothing bad but nothing special either.\n\n[u] In Conclusion [/u]\nWhile Dirt 4 may not be a perfect game in any sense, it improves upon Dirt Rally and still delivers a good challange. Many of the general directions are IMHO correct. Going to procedually generated stages is the way to go in the future but still needs a lot improvement and polish to really become what it is intended to be. Also a better damage system and further evolution of the handling would be much appreciated but still the basics are done right so if you were on the fence buying this game give it a try.\n- BABA IS YOU\nGAME HAS PUZZLE\nPUZZLE IS CHALLENGE AND NOT UNFAIR\nPUZZLE IS FUN AND LOGIC\nGAME HAS MUSIC AND GRAPHIC\nMUSIC IS CHARMING\nGRAPHIC IS CHARMING AND CUTE\nGAME IS RECOMMEND \nGAME IS GOOD\nBUY IS WIN\n- Edit: ARCANE HALLOWS REVIEW (Written Feb. 19 2021)\n\nRoguelike Enthusiast's Caveat: The player's progression is directed in a much longer scale over multiple playthroughs due to the nonlinear nature of exploration unlike Hades or Skul. There is also a higher focus on evading stage hazards than said roguelites, with more control in how you start your run than needing to worry about coordinating a build throughout.\n\nNew Player's Verdict: The most recent large update for the game now makes the game well worth the price. Overall changes to the game makes the early-game far more approachable and increased the player's survivability all around while easing power progression.\n\nNew Resolve system for making powerups far less punishing is great. They added features to reroll power up selections as they add more, same with being able to rerolling character selection now that they added (two more very fun and powerful) new classes. The Skeleton Key, one such new randomized power up, addressed my issues with Fairy Chests which are a major source of character progression. \n\nEvery class offers such a unique playstyle while also having great power in their own right (though right now I feel the weakest classes are Ranger and Mage)\n\nNow if we could be able to rechallenge bosses we've beaten that would put me over the moon\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW (Written Feb. 4 2021)\n\nAbridged Verdict: Wait for Arcane Hallows Update (Feb. 18 2021) before purchasing for total content volume that matches RL1 along with additional QoL changes\n\nThe latest update as of writing this review (Far Shores) added 2 whole new areas, I bought EA awhile back but didn't really play much until this update, as the amount of content in the game effectively tripled between the areas, new classes, and QoL additions.\n\nGame is more accessible than RL1 for sure, but seems harder to get into than Hades, especially for people not used to roguelites. Namely, its far more punishing and harder to recover from mistakes.\n\nThings I love: The whimsical charm, the much more varied aesthetics of biomes as well as each biome having unique structures (Axis Mundi being a long hallway that makes it more akin to a Classicvania stage is genius). Classes having much more unique and pronounced playstyles adds much replayability. Boss mechanics and designs are much more complex this time around and the way they test your mastery of heirlooms is excellent. The new Armor System as a separate way to reinforce HP and the Mastery system to get steady stat increases go a long way to helping player progression. I'm seriously hooked on the gameplay loop in a way that I wasn't with RL1, every class is so much fun, and I'm so looking forward to the next update!\n\nMy Gripes: Runes are a total gamechanger that can make your life so much easier. Unfortunately the Fairy Chests that contain them are randomly spawned, and as a new player whether you can actually find and survive to one is a steep uphill road, and sometimes they just aren't possible without a specific class. The execution required for some challenges will be extremely difficult for more casual players and thus their ability to progress overall will be greatly hampered without the likes of things such as a soulsteal rune to recover HP. If there's an algorithm that sorts relative difficulty of Fairy Chest rooms, I would like if there were a way to increase the likelihood of creating Fairy Chest rooms if the player hasn't found any, and gradually make them more accessible until the player finds one. Additionally I would like if every Fairy Chest contained runes until you find them all in a biome, as I've gotten hordes of Gemstones from Fairy Chests before getting another rune or rune upgrade\n\nRelics. I'm looking forward to the Resolve system update because as of now, the hits to max HP are incredibly devastating, especially if you don't find a room that can give you the nectar to increase your max HP again (and even then its a huge gamble since you take a lot of damage from it). Most of them don't really feel worth the tradeoff as of right now, unless you find the War Drum to continually increase damage. If we can get a vendor to \"rent\" one (1) relic among a selection of ones we found for a certain amount of gold or something, similar to heirs that start with a relic without losing max HP would add a certain level of accessibility without removing the randomness aspect of roguelikes\n\nWhile all enemy attacks are technically possible to evade, this isn't always the case when you have certain combinations of enemies (Frostens and Aqua Braces in a room with a floor thats all spikes is so mean ; A;). Sometimes you'll spawn into a room next to a Warg that will immediately headbutt you before you can react and suddenly you take 70 damage. I would appreciate if certain enemies were stationary upon entering a room so you have time to process and react accordingly.\n\nEnemy damage scales extremely fast as you move through the map, along with their attacks becoming more frantic or complex, without means to restore HP and Armor through the specific runes, most classes' having lower max HP get real squishy.\n\nOne of the Duelist class's main attraction is that their talent gives them invulnerability windows with a roll, but it can't always be used of you're in a tight position without much room to move. I hope that they add a small invul window to the Dash heirloom, with runes to increase that window, but make it much smaller than the Duelist's (say 1/5th the time of whatever the window is of Duelist's talent)\n\nAnyways, despite my misgivings with the game I listed here, the game is really fun and a lot more accessible and varied than the original game, wait for it to go on sale and pick it up!\n- Don't play this game. \n\nWhen you realise you almost completed it and the 112% is approaching, you start to think \"What the fuck am I going to play after this?\".\n\nThe lore is incredible.\nThe gameplay is so hard sometimes, but extremely satisfying. \nThe bosses are super hard, yet super fun.\nThe OST is insane.\n\nIf you never played Hollow Knight and you are about to begin your journey in Hallownest, bapanada to you.\nYou're very lucky and I am very jealous.\n- I've played a fair amount of games during my time using Steam.\n\nI've never felt as emotionally moved by one as I have with OneShot.\n\nI don't know if anyone reading this has played Transistor, but if you are familiar with and enjoyed that game, continue reading for a little context. (I'm going to put it in spoilers because it contains an integral part of how the game functions, which is likely better for you to experience on your own, rather than learn about it from a third party. Be warned!)\n[spoiler]\nTransistor and OneShot are very different games, but both of them share a similarity in that they have been the most emotionally moving games I've played in my entire life. They both have a huge emphasis on characters, both the one you play as and the ones you interact with or are around you. They also both have brilliantly-developed environments, The combination of these two things is one of the major factors in why I've gotten so immersed in them previously.\n\nHowever, OneShot affected me notably more strongly and for much longer than Transistor, and that is for a very discernable reason. In Transistor, you experience the stories of the characters. When it all ends, you're still a third party, experiencing things through the \"eyes\" of the protagonist.\n\nOneShot, on the other hand, features *you* as basically an integral part of the story. Because of this slight difference (which may seem negligible or gimmicky at first), OneShot basically destroyed me emotionally by the end - not necessarily because of how it ended, but that it ended at all. It wasn't just story of some other charismatic protagonists that came to a close.\n\nIt was mine, and with it, my connection to everything that happened in the game.\n\nIt's really hard to put into words... but I really wanted to put this somewhere, in hopes that someone understands and agrees. :D\n[/spoiler]\n\nAnyways, random game comparison tangent over. It's a phenomenal game - easily one of tmy favorite games of all time, my only complaint being that it ended. Extremely solid 10/10.\n\nIf you enjoy story-driven adventures like Transistor, Undertale, Night in the Woods, etc., this is basically a must-buy.\n\n- I got this game for $12 off humble bundle. Me and my friends play it for hours on end. This game honestly feels like the perfect fighting game for me because there is no set style. I don't have to remember specific combos or any crazy inputs. It's just simplicity. Unless you want to do that in which you can. But it's fun for anyone. If I were you I would get it off of humble bundle for $12.\n- This isn't a game. This is the beginning of a crippling JRPG series addiction. 10/10.\n- no autosave, plus crashes, so if you put in several hours and never saved - you lost ALL the progress on ALL stages on a random crash, That makes me wanna quit the game and not play it anymore. Overall game is very good, but multiple bugs were never fixed, so you're basically buying the old buggy version of it.\n\n英語で5-10単語程度で、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない主要な違いを簡潔に回答してください。\n\n回答：\n",

I played MC on and off for over ten years and generally, you get over that sense of impending danger, and bases built with teamwork don't feel that fulfilling. \n\nValheim fixes all that.

This isn't a bad thing - the first Dishonored was one of the best stealth-action games of all time - but innovation is too often overlooked in the games industry. DH2 does bring some nuance to the franchise, but new drawbacks are packaged in as well. Put plainly, Dishonored 2 is a game I adore just as much as the original, but there are aspects that certainly left me wishing for better.\n\n[b][u]Plot[/u][/b]\nThe game begins 15 years following Empress Jessamine's assassination, and her daughter, Empress Emily Kaldwin, has ruled the isles since that time. Her father and Lord Protector, Corvo Attano, advises and keeps close watch over her at court. Quickly after Dishonored 2's opening however, the Duke of Serkonos, Luca Abele, comes to Emily's royal tower - bearing a gift. He brings Emily's supposed long lost aunt, Delilah Kaldwin, who then immediately stages a coup in a bid to take the throne. She is successful, and you must escape the city of Dunwall as either Emily or Corvo (more on that later). You then travel to Karnaca, the capital of Serkonos, where you begin a personal crusade to [i]take back what's yours.[/i]\n\n[b][u]Technical Revamp[/u][/b]\nShifting focus for a look at DH2's presentation, the game is gorgeous. There's a hint of the old, comic-book-like aesthetic that was present in the original game, but the graphical fidelity has been greatly improved in this sequel. The textures, lighting, animations, visual effects, and environments are all elegantly rendered. It's easily one of the most beautiful games of 2016. As for the audio; sound effects and voices are realistic, and the OST is as iconic, if not more so than the first game's. Although, when it comes to performance, Dishonored 2 clearly falters. DH2 was a technical mess on launch, and while it runs decently now; some bugs, stutters, and crashes still persist. Overall the presentation is good, but the performance is surely sub-par.\n\n[b][u]Setting & Exploration[/u][/b]\nAs stated earlier, Dishonored 2 is set in Serkonos's city of Karnaca; known as The Jewel of the South. Gone are the dark grays and subdued browns of Dunwall, as Karnaca replaces them with bright, pastel blues and yellows. The metropolis has distinct cultural differences from Dunwall as well, whether it's the widespread use of wind-power over whale oil, or Karnaca's reliance on silver mining to employ its working class. In terms of level design, DH2's stages are much more expansive than anything seen in the first game too. There's lots to explore in every district of Karnaca, especially when verticality and hidden locations are taken into account. There's several routes toward all objectives as well; emphasizing Arkane's \"play your way\" motto. All considered, Dishonored 2's game world is exceedingly well-built.\n\n[b][u]Depth in the Details[/u][/b]\nOne of the most effective ways DH2 differentiates itself from its predecessors is through what I'd call 'structural gimmicks.' To break up the standard pacing, a couple of the game's missions have special set-pieces which can completely turn gameplay convention on its head. An example of this is the 'Clockwork Mansion' on the fourth level. This inventor's home has levers in essentially every chamber that reconfigures a room's layout - such as turning a trophy room into a grand hall. These levers can be used to access new areas or evade enemies, and even reveal traversable spaces behind the walls. It's this degree of imaginative design depth that distinguishes Dishonored 2 from most other games in its genre.\n\n[b][u]Stealth & Combat[/u][/b]\nMoving over to the core gameplay loop, not much has changed from the first game. The stealth and combat are still just as exquisitely implemented as before, with only a couple of refinements. The deviations that come to mind are that drop-assassinations can now be used non-lethally as drop-knockouts, and assassination animations are a much more brutal (but cathartic) spectacle to watch than before. Dishonored 2's central mechanics are near flawless to be sure, but this sequel suffers by adding few new gameplay elements to the mix. Except - well - there is one big feature I've neglected to elaborate on as of yet.\n\n[b][u]Emily [i]or[/i] Corvo[/u][/b]\nIn Dishonored 2, you can play as either Emily Kaldwin, [i]or[/i] Corvo Attano. When Delilah first takes the throne you get a moment to choose one or the other, after which the character you don't pick is turned into a cold, stone statue. Both Emily and Corvo have separate voice actors and personalities, but they share the same goal throughout the game's duration: to save the last of their family, and reclaim the throne for the true Kaldwin heiress. After receiving the mark of The Outsider, Emily and Corvo have different magical abilities too. Where Corvo has blink, Emily has far reach; or where Corvo can stop time, Emily can chain together the lives of her enemies, and kill or incapacitate several people at once. All in all, the decision to allow the player to progress the campaign as either Emily or Corvo was a stroke of brilliance in my estimation.\n\n[b][u]Main Story[/u][/b]\nReturning to the main story - it's another point of criticism for me. There are some magnificent aspects; such as the nostalgic callbacks to events in the first Dishonored or reappearances of some of the original game's best characters, but all considered most of the writing is retreading a beaten path. Just as in Dishonored 1, the game flows from mission to mission where the chief objective is simply to eliminate a key player obstructing your path to the throne. This is perfectly fine from a gameplay perspective, but it can lead to a bit of déjà vu from a narrative outlook. Dishonored 2's writing quality isn't poor, but it doesn't distance itself from the comfortable story-staging of its predecessor, making it feel slightly lazy.\n\n[b][u]A Reactive World[/u][/b]\nOn the other side of the same coin, the narrative reactivity of Dishonored 2's world to your choices is truly admirable. Playing DH2 in high chaos; where you murder many people throughout the game, results in huge environmental storytelling changes compared to low chaos. Here's an example. If you flood the streets of Karnaca red with blood, subsequent levels show you've harmed the city's inhabitants before you even arrive. Citizens’ moods and perceptions will have soured as they become depressed or monstrous in the wake of their crumbling city - causing suicides and murders to spike throughout Karnaca. And corpses bring bloodflies, which further tarnishes The Jewel of the South in a vicious cycle. You can, of course, avoid all this... by showing a whole lot of care in your actions toward others.\n\n[b][u]Conclusion[/u][/b]\nWhen all is said and done, the Dishonored formula is a fantastic one that it's hard to not have fun with. Karnaca is riddled with environmental detail, the stealth mechanics are flawless, combat is devilishly enjoyable, and the game judges you intelligently on your choices. The Dishonored IP is incredibly strong... The tweaks provided are appreciable; I just wish DH2 had made a concerted effort to make it even stronger. But, god-dammit, I enjoyed Dishonored 2 way too much over it's 20+ hour campaign to critique it any longer. Get the game and play it - despite all my pissy complaints, you won't be disappointed.\n\n[h1]Personal Rating: 9/10 - Absolutely Outstanding[/h1]\n- I've played a fair amount of games during my time using Steam.\n\nI've never felt as emotionally moved by one as I have with OneShot.\n\nI don't know if anyone reading this has played Transistor, but if you are familiar with and enjoyed that game, continue reading for a little context. (I'm going to put it in spoilers because it contains an integral part of how the game functions, which is likely better for you to experience on your own, rather than learn about it from a third party. Be warned!)\n[spoiler]\nTransistor and OneShot are very different games, but both of them share a similarity in that they have been the most emotionally moving games I've played in my entire life. They both have a huge emphasis on characters, both the one you play as and the ones you interact with or are around you. They also both have brilliantly-developed environments, The combination of these two things is one of the major factors in why I've gotten so immersed in them previously.\n\nHowever, OneShot affected me notably more strongly and for much longer than Transistor, and that is for a very discernable reason. In Transistor, you experience the stories of the characters. When it all ends, you're still a third party, experiencing things through the \"eyes\" of the protagonist.\n\nOneShot, on the other hand, features *you* as basically an integral part of the story. Because of this slight difference (which may seem negligible or gimmicky at first), OneShot basically destroyed me emotionally by the end - not necessarily because of how it ended, but that it ended at all. It wasn't just story of some other charismatic protagonists that came to a close.\n\nIt was mine, and with it, my connection to everything that happened in the game.\n\nIt's really hard to put into words... but I really wanted to put this somewhere, in hopes that someone understands and agrees. :D\n[/spoiler]\n\nAnyways, random game comparison tangent over. It's a phenomenal game - easily one of tmy favorite games of all time, my only complaint being that it ended. Extremely solid 10/10.\n\nIf you enjoy story-driven adventures like Transistor, Undertale, Night in the Woods, etc., this is basically a must-buy.\n\n- This game surprised me in how good it was. I had heard about it, like everyone, and also like a lot of people I had dismissed it as a watered-down Dark Souls clone with a Star Wars skin, and let it collect dust in my Steam collection.\n\nI was wrong. The game's combat is tight and polished, just the right difficulty on Normal. The movement, the general game feel, is superb. The game has a competent story with excellent characterizations, character arcs, dialogue, exposition, world-building, and pacing.  The music feels like top-shelf Star Wars without being a lazy copypasta of John Williams's score (though you'll hear sprinklings of familiar motifs throughout, of course). \n\nThere are collectibles (they are all cosmetics), but it's a tasteful, reasonable amount of them, and they are distributed in a way that feels fun instead of like a chore, and you're never pressured into collecting them with menus or reminders; they are entirely optional in both a technical and a psychological sense. I actually found it fun to collect new appearances in order to play dress-up \"Fashion Souls\". \n\nThere are bosses, and they are challenging but not frustrating. Definitely easier than Dark Souls's harder bosses like Ornstein or Artorias, but still tricky enough that it feels rewarding to overcome them.\n\nIf I had to describe this game in two words, it would be \"just right\". There is just the right amount of each little element that it feels fun, never tedious, never like a grind. I'm a jaded old man who has seen it all and who is not easy to entertain, and I found this game extremely refreshing. If you read this review during the sale where it's only 3.99 USD, get it immediately.\n- [h2] Visual Novel Reviews [/h2]\n\n[b] TLDR [/b] Two scenes, no customization, no choices, character development needs work, but the Extremely short story delivered (If you know what I mean) a whopping 38 minutes of game play for me. \n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [th]Question[/th]\n        [th]Answer[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Buy Again[/td]\n        [td]No, I wouldn't.

This is the second game that this developer has released, so I am not disappointed that I spent 5$ dollars on a game that they created, but I will say that I will think Long and Hard (No Pun Intended) before purchasing another game from this studio.\n- G.A.R.B.A.G.E\n\nuhm idk man, it was but it just isn't, you know? because I don't know??? lots of bugs, cinematics are rushed, game is rigged, friends cheat... FUCKS THIS SHIET\n- As i previously stated, i was going to play through metro fully and i have done so, so here is my update to this review. \nThis game is not the best selling triple A game in the world and it may have some bugs (like a table that wasnt solid or the objects in that room lol) however it is a decent game. the story is decent and the characters voices are way off but they sorta make up for it with their personalities. \n\nExploration in this game is by far one of the most interesting in my opinion and the way your character acts in the enviroment makes it more interesting aswell, for example wiping your visor when it gets dirty (wasnt that helpful for me in my play through but it was a nice touch) and your visor taking damage in combat adds to the immersive feel of this wasteland/paradise almost. Scavenging weapons and parts and combining them to make better equipment is quite intriguing and quick to do if you can find the parts. \n\nat the end of the day my final review of this is its a good game i would play it again even if it is a bit clunky sometimes (atleast it was for me lmao)\n\n\n\n\n\nOh and hopefully my punctuation is good enough so no one passes out this time lmao\n- good sales pitch for a game. i guess that's the point of being a kickstarter-based video game. everything related to specifically your character and the character action related feels fantastic and looks great and i feel like it scratches an itch no other game really does, and the environments and your animations look great. and yet you're seeing this on a negative review.\n\n-the progression involved with exploring unreality until you stumble onto where you think you should go is miserable. it looks like a mega man x4 level had a bad trip, headache inducing and aimless. the process of finding a lot of secrets is either the trite \"you have a movement powerup, backtrack here and move up there\" sorta deal, or invisible wall shit that i've never been a fan of without decent tells (which admittedly the game sometimes does!)\n\n-combat almost entirely takes place in closed off arenas (not necessarily a bad thing, this game draws heavy inspiration from DMC which does similar) and with the same cast of like 10~ enemies. poise is a chore, even after trivializing the process with the time bomb and the grounded down charge attack, and particular enemies like the guy with the red sword and the caped man are incredibly annoying. there are 2 different instances of an enemy either doing a short version or annoyingly long version of an attack with 0 tell. A lot of the combat is trivial on hard, don't know about\n\n-bosses are a mixed bag. some of them you can loop poise breaks. some of them 2 or 3 tap you. the last one does the latter, makes you slog through a nintendo-ass hands and face boss before you are put up against bootleg senator armstrong with an unskippable cutscene and no checkpoint after the boring phase 1. huge waste of time.\n\n-too many levels just feel empty and lifeless. just a pleasant looking floral jog from arena to arena, felt like nothing and left no impression. \n\n-the movement feels like it has the potential to be insane. there's a million options that all can really push how much distance you can get, and there's a learning curve with how you sequence them all, and there's an entirely separate learning curve with pulse fly though that mechanic feels mostly untapped. \n\n-for a game with a speedrun timer and that kind of carpal tunnel inducing movement, it's really weird that there's not a \"reset to checkpoint\" button or any way to fast travel back to the airship. feels INCREDIBLY bad when you're lost and checking every nook and cranny for where to go next, or when you've ran yourself out of pulse meter when trying to pulse fly in locations that aren't littered with the blue pulse bulbs. special shoutouts to the pyramid, you can screw up especially when trying to do it early and the run is completely dead, but you have to just sit there and wait while you scroll through twitter or whatever. \n\n-music and voice acting quality was all over the place. i'm not more than a hobbyist but a lot of the voices sound like they were recorded on a variety of audio hardware, run through audacity w/ noise reduction and normalization, and tossed in. it's an indie game so please don't take this as the worst critique in the world, i'm sure the VAs were all fellow hobbyists/amateurs and there's literally nothing wrong with that, but a good handful of the yells, insults, and grunts were doing NOTHING for me. some of the music just sounds like penis music, i can't think of a better term. there were definitely a few great tunes on the atmospheric end of things but overall some of them, in particular 2 or 3 boss themes, just kinda sucked. also the segues between combat and atmospheric music was not executed well at all for several areas.\n\n-the fog level in particular had a lot of stuttering especially during combat. not looking forward to the braindead \"works fine on my machine\" type of people, but i'm on a ryzen 9 3900x, a 5900XT sapphire pulse, and 32 GB of 3600mhz ram. I'm pretty sure a machine with a tenth of the power should be able to run a gamemaker studio 2 game, it's on the switch and that thing's basically a leapfrog.\n\ni really wanted to like this game but like i said at the start, it feels like a sales pitch (albiet a great one) with everything not related to the selling point feeling tacked on. I hope this dev learns more about level design in particular and keeps making more games, because this game really does feel like it's designed to appeal to me w/ the mix of genres and the list of inspirations this game seems to wear on its sleeve.\n\ntldr the angled dash memory doesn't let you wavedash, and ur left in a crappy sticky sliding animation when you try. 1/10 can't believe i played this game\n\n- Graphics of Quake, atmosphere of Blood, brutality of Doom, some weapons of Hexen/Heretic, drunkenness and trashiness of Redneck Rampage, and some weird quirkiness from Half-Life  = GOTY\n- Early review right now after a quick hour of play.\n\nLater Alligator (and I swear I'm not biased towards this game at all) is a gorgeously 2d-animated, primarily point-and-click, cartoony romp through Alligator New York City. Everyone's alligators. The gameplay itself is simplistic; unlike normal point-and-click games of this style that you might have come to expect, there's no picking up items, there's no real big decision making. It crosses over more with Professor Layton-style gameplay, wandering around the city and picking up little collectibles by clicking on various pieces of the environment.\n\nScattered in between these are a plentiful trove of minigames in all sorts of styles. As far as I can tell, they begin to increase in complexity the further you go through (for reference, the first minigame is pretty much not fail-able; you're asked to track a Queen in 3 Card Monte, however the hapless alligator running the game barely moves the cards and flails on the two that *aren't* the queen.)\n\nHowever, it seems that the gameplay and the minigames are meant more as a vehicle for the whimsical comedy of the writing and the eclectic cast of characters present throughout the city. Each character is quirky and fun in their own way, with their own little story. And that's the real draw of this game. \n\nSo this game so far doesn't particularly lend itself to anyone looking to challenge themselves. But if you just want some good feelings, a laugh, and a spot of relaxation, Later Alligator delivers in spades.\n- Ahh, CrossCode.\nLet's start this review with what this game does right.\n\nPros:\nEverything. There review is complete. But on a serious note I'll elaborate.\n\nThis game starts out very generically. You got an amnesia stricken heroine. You got fairly archetypal characters. The story is the typical trying to figure out your past. But it's not. I lied about all that, that only covers the first 10-15 hours then you see drastic changes in the pace and tone. The story turns out to be well done, not the best, but enjoyable. 8/10 for story and characters.\n\nLet's talk about gameplay. It's perfect, seriously. The pacing of combat is fairly quick. There's a decent variety of enemy types which nearly all of them have some sort of unique trait. Your skill set leaves you with a lot of variety and different tools to take on different situations. I have yet to get bored of it, despite the fact combat isn't inherently profitable for most of the game. Puzzles. You have timing puzzles, logic puzzles, memory puzzles, enemy based puzzles. It's all there. It's all enjoyable. They're quite varied, no two puzzles feel the same. This game has over 200 'maps'. And just about every 'map' has a puzzle or two (optional or not). Ez 10/10.\n\nArt design. I'm a sucker for 16 and 32 bit graphics. The level designer, this guy made the game. He created some beautiful and interconnected maps with nearly everything having purpose. In all honesty, I have never seen design quality this high, it even beats out SquareSoft games (you know before they became that crappy company that is SE). 10/10 again.\n\nCharacter design. It works. Not the best. Not bad. The characters look the way they should. Lukas' nose drives me crazy, it's huge. But Holiday Man is solid. 7/10.\n\nMusic. Some of it's great. Some of it annoyed ME (but I'm picky). They stayed true to what they were trying to make. But it's obvious their composer was no Yasunori Mitsuda. But still, what I enjoyed, I really enjoyed. 8/10.\n\nDid I enjoy it? Every single minute of it. Even when I was confused. \"I WILL figure this puzzle out.\" 35/40, based off my personal taste, but CrossCode is as damn near perfect as you can get.\n- Don't play this game. \n\nWhen you realise you almost completed it and the 112% is approaching, you start to think \"What the fuck am I going to play after this?\".\n\nThe lore is incredible.\nThe gameplay is so hard sometimes, but extremely satisfying. \nThe bosses are super hard, yet super fun.\nThe OST is insane.\n\nIf you never played Hollow Knight and you are about to begin your journey in Hallownest, bapanada to you.\nYou're very lucky and I am very jealous.\n- If you are into space opera, transhumanism, cyperpunk-esque narratives, you're going to have a great time with this one. Even with my rampant ADHD, this game has kept my focus for a lot longer than most games. \n\nThe music is banging and the story is rich and diverse with a lot of awesome twists and turns. \n\nGo and grab your chits and buy some drugs.\n- I knew Journey is a great game,maybe one of the best video games in history,but...\n\nI didn't know why so many people moved by such a simple gameplay.\nI didn't know why people had a Journey-Fever,even players just bought PS3 only for this game.\nI didn't know how close a relationship could be in 100mins only.\nI didn't know how bad i wished to go back to the peak and stay with my friend i'll never meet again.\n\nNow I Know.\n\n“It is better to walk with a friend in the dark than alone in the light” – Helen Keller\n\nIt was an interesting experience for me, I had never played this game nor heard of it until recently. I went and looked at the store page, My Brother/Friend Ethan-Winters Just Told Me this game in the steam store now, so went ahead and bought it. After buying it, went and started up the game some day later. Went into the game, saw another model character that looks like mine, I thought it was an AI because I had thought it was a single player game. So I decided to play along with it, we went through the story, it progressed quite fast, mainly because we both did not really bother to check out other things. The more I played, the more I realized that the guy I was playing with was most definitely not an AI, it was a genuine player. As we went through the story, our cooperation got smoother, we no longer have a solo player attitude, we would signal to each other, wait for each other and walked, fly with each other. It was smoothing, relaxing, a truly unique experience. Even with the setbacks we had throughout our progression, we never gave up, we stuck together from the desert till the end, when one of us screwed up, we patiently waited for the other, chiming to the person where we are. I remember at the end, when i screwed up a jump and did not see the other player, I was genuinely scared, sad, I frantically searched for the person but to no avail. I was distraught, sad and disappointed but I continued onward. When I went up, there he was, chiming for me, assuring me that he had not left yet. I felt happy, comforted when I saw the person waiting for me and together we finished the story. I am not one to do reviews, but it was such a unique experience among my years of gaming that I had to share it. Thank you, punks for the experience, truly thank you. And thank you, for bothering to read my review.\n\ni'll never forget our journey kind stranger.\n\nThis wasn't a game, it was an experience. I highly recommend you do this.\n- The fact that this VN used to be the highest rated game that hasn't been released outside Japan until, well, it was released outside Japan says it all. A must-buy position for every VN enthusiast and an insteresting position for any other player. Criminally underplayed (~55% of purchased copies haven't been started yet), true hidden gem. Consider buying it when on sale.\n- The playtime I have on Steam is nowhere close to the amount of time I've put into this game on Xbox.\n\nWhen I first heard of Tetris Effect back in 2018, I was so mesmerized by the visuals the game had. Everything looked amazing, and I really wanted to try and play it. Shame I didn't have a PS4.\n\nThe game had a multiplayer release on Xbox, and when I first heard about it, I bought a copy instantly, finally ready to experience the game on PC.\n\nI'm not exaggerating when I say that buying this game actually changed my life.\nWhen I bought this game I not only got to play one of my favorite games in a completely unique experience, but I managed to find an amazing community to boot. Since then, I've accomplished so much in the game, befriended lots of people, and managed to change several aspects of myself.\n\nThis game has been a perfect mixture of visual, auditory, and emotional presentation, and it's given me tons of inspiration for multiple projects.\n\nIf you're shrugging this game off as \"just Tetris\", please take a look at a playthrough. Calling this game \"just Tetris\" is a massive injustice to the creativity, effort, love, and time that the development team have put into this.\n\nI have been following this game for nearly a year now. I wouldn't have it any other way.\n- Bullet hell? Check.\nAwesome animations? Check.\nBoss fights? Check.\nSongs from favorite artists? Check.\nParty mode? Check.\nMultiplayer/online mode? Check.\nBest physics? Check.\nOk that list is good... for now\n- !!!!READ TO THE BOTTOM OR SCROLL!!!!\n       !!!!69 FREE PACKS + MORE CARDS AND COSMETICS CODES!!\n                        \n I did this for the NEW community:)         \n !!MAKE SURE TO UPVOTE AND OR AWARD SO EVERYONE NEW CAN SEE!!\n\ni have played almost all the MTG online iterations, MTG 2012 2013 2014, DUEL, MTGO, Magic the Gathering Online \nTactics, and now Arena. \nMTG 2012-2014 were fun but they were limited to the cards released those years\nMagic the Gathering Online was cool, you could trade and sell cards, do actual cube and draft with bought packs, but the interface was dated even after the update..\nMagic duels was sold to us as the end all, going forward no new program just duels and they would add sets as they released..(It wasn't, they didn't)\n\nMTG Arena (this one) has done everything they said and they did not abandon it after a few years.

MULTIPLAYER SKYRIM LETS GO\" - In short don't do that. This isn't going to be like playing Skyrim, Oblivion, Morrowind. \n\nIt is when it all comes down to the core an MMO, it's set in Tamriel, it sounds like Tamriel and the storylines feel like an Elder Scrolls game. However being an MMO, it has a lot of grindy MMO style quests. And don't get me wrong, it's bewildering at first, all these mechanics, all these places to go....and before the 'One Tamriel' update if you chose the wrong faction, you were screwed, in a place all on your own surrounded by all these people who are WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY higher level than you. But thankfully they changed all of that. The game scales now, so you can rock up to a dungeon with your level V300 mate, and still have some fun slicing up enemies.\n\nSo I saw a friend playing the other day, and spent a few hours installing this to join him (By the way its like 70 Gig...If you have slow internet prepare for a few days of download), I got back on it after not playing for 14 months, but this time I was playing with a friend who was already Veteran Level 250, So I was in luck, he introduced me to everything and I got used to all the deconstructing of equipment to get my blacksmithing up, showed me about dungeons and bascially got me to enjoy the grind. I think my previous time was a bit lackluster because I got dropped in the middle of the Aldmeri Dominion on my own, without any of my friends. So I left.\n\nNow I know what I'm doing, and keep in mind I usually hate MMO's never played WoW or anything like that, this is the first one. I'm enjoying myself, I'm triple digits into this game time-wise and I don't see it stopping now. We've made a guild for noobies. To help them out, and get them to enjoy the game also. Because the community is nice...but you still get the elitist fucks from any competitive game kicking you out of dungeons because you're only level 14. But you won't get that when you're in a guild, having people to play with and explain all the mechanics did help, a lot. I've even gone as far as to buy this AGAIN on steam just to collect my hours and so on.\n\nAdd-ons are awesome being able to mod basic features of the game to help with information and quality of life improvements is a must. I'll provide an essential mods pack if any of you wish to know.\n\nFor those of you who actually got this far into this, well done. I didn't think I'd keep you captivated long enough to get to the end.\n\nIf any of you are new to the game, on EU server and would like to join a guild to show you the way, add me or visit our [url=www.godsofsalt.com]website[/url] and join us on teamspeak, or just message us in game @diseasedcrow.\n\nBut all in all if you like Elder Scrolls and you think you want to try this, just do, I'm glad I gave it a second chance.\n- - - READ IF USING 2K / 1440P RESOLUTION - -\n\nGoing to Fullscreen within the game seems to screw everything up at 1440p, but not 1080p.\n\nTo get around this edit the ini file:\n\nAspectRatio=1\nDispFull=1\nDispX=32\nDispY=32\nDispW=2560\nDispH=1440\nAngle=0\nVsync=0\n\nIf you can rotate your 2K monitor, set it to 150%.

Once there you are presented with a database of footage from a 1990s, where you must piece together what happened.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\nWithout spoiling anything, since this game is all story based, you are revisiting video clips of seven separate interviews trying to piece together what exactly happened. When you start off, you are placed in front the pc with the word “murder” already typed in. With this simple word, you are given, you must, delve deeper into the story, and form your own conclusion as to what happened, but the more you go deeper into the mystery, the more confused you may become; perhaps even discarding your previous assumption many times before coming to a conclusion that does not go against her story.    \n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nThis game is not a conventional game in terms of gameplay. Instead, you are watching videos and finding potential terms that could lead you to more videos which will reveal more as to her past and what, and who was involved in this incident. Some might not like this, so if the idea of an exclusively story based game does not appeal, do not bother. It is an interesting concept, and very captivating if you play it without any distractions, perhaps more interesting if you play it with a friend and try to piece the mystery together (much like I did).\n\n[h1]Verdict: 8.5/10[/h1]\n\nIf you enjoyed this review, or found it helpful, please feel free to follow our curator [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/WeLoveKawaiiNekos#curation]here.[/url]\n- [h1]Diary: Dandara: Trails of Fear Edition[/h1]\n\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\n\n[table]\n[tr][td][b]Gameplay[/b][/td][td]Quick Gameplay, Interesting Movement Mechanics, Projectile based weapon, helping characters unlocks more paths[/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][b]Story[/b][/td][td]Interesting main story, fun side characters[/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][b]Graphics[/b][/td][td]Nice 2D pixel art[/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][b]Sound[/b][/td][td]Main Menu has nice sound effects, jumping from surface to surface sounds great[/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][b]Controls[/b][/td][td]Great controls, no need to remapping[/td][/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[table]\n[tr][td][h2]Day 1 - 3/23/2020[/h2][/td][/tr]\n[tr][td]I started up this game, not expecting much, and man oh man was I surprised. This game has fascinating gameplay, being able to jump from one surface of salt to another so smoothly and quickly. It makes the game different from others, because the movement and how you go around the map is so different. \n\nThe checkpoint system was a little odd to me. Your progress is still \"saved\" when you trigger a mechanic, it's just that the flag sets your spawn location. So there is no need to fret if you die after doing something important.\n\nI also got to use the stat system a lot today, and man, it reminds me of Dark Souls. If you die, you leave behind your salt, and you have to go back to collect it. Once you do, you can, of course, use it to buy upgrades from the tents for your character. Which is a nice way to choose how you want your character to grow. I like when my healing potions heal a lot, for example, instead of having a lot of base hp right from the start.

If you are thinking of playing this game, DO NOT LOOK AT YOUTUBE FOR ANY HINTS. There is no losing the game, and there is no winning the game, but if you look at youtube, you will lose a lot of the thematic feel of the game.\n\nI REPEAT, DO NOT LOOK AT YOUTUBE OR ANY OTHER GUIDE. YOU WILL MISS OUT ON AN EXPERIENCE.\n\nSaying that, Yume Nikki is a interactive experience following a young woman's dreams. By sifting through her dreams, you may come to conclusions about the player character's life, or you may find yourself reflecting on events in your life. I heartily reccomend this game to those who like mystery and speculation.\n- [b][i]AMID EVIL[/i] is very much [i]Quake[/i] 1 level design in a [i]Hexen[/i]/[i]Heretic[/i] universe.[/b] It's well done. We're a bit spoiled this year with outstanding '90s FPS shooters. Personally, I prefer both [i]Ion Maiden[/i] and [i]DUSK[/i] over this title for the following reasons:\n\n1) I find [i]AMID EVIL[/i] to be a bit generic in terms of theme; the fantasy setting could use a bit more to set it apart.\n\n2) I prefer real or low fantasy weapons/guns over wands and totally high fantasy weapons. Now, don't get it twisted - I appreciate that these high fantasy weapons exist, but yeah, they leave something to be desired. I miss reloading and all of that. \n\n3) The level design in [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is much more 'sprawling' (for lack of a better term) just like the original [i]Quake[/i]. Most levels are indoors in what feels like an underground compound (at the time of writing this review). I personally like the backwoods feel of [i]DUSK[/i], or the dystopian cityscape of [i]Ion Maiden[/i] far more. I want to look up at the sky in most levels.\n\n4) The enemy design is different than the other two games I mention, which is good - but they all mostly have a 'same' kind of feel. The enemies are all super fast, so most of your efforts are focused on running backwards while fending them off. It's fun, but gunplay isn't quite as fun as the other two games for this particular reason.\n\n5) The font and overall menu system definitely feels 'Early Access'. I know the font is being worked on, which is desperately needed. \n\n6) My favorite way to play the game is Endless mode - and I feel like that's a flaw in itself. It's the opposite for me with [i]DUSK[/i]. I want to fall in love with the campaign, but eh, there isn't really any story or anything all that interesting to suck me in. The secrets are super easy to find compared to the other two games, too.\n\n7) No multiplayer. Now, I really don't care about this - but who designs a game in this genre without building this in from the ground up? You know the community is going to whine about this. Questionable design decision to say the least.\n\n[b]Well, it sounds like I just dumped all over the game.[/b] Please don't get me wrong. [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is a welcome addition to the genre. The *great news* is that this is not just some reskin of [i]DUSK[/i] - it certainly is it's own thing. And that's really important. \n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+Fairly polished game for Early Access\n+It's the most modern version of the original [i]Quake[/i] we've seen this year\n+Well optimized\n+Lots of content right now\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-The universe is generic\n-No multiplayer\n-The font is too hard to read\n-Music is nothing to write home about\n-The secrets are easy, and there really aren't all that many of them\n-Weapons could use more 'oomph' to them; also we should be able to use the special ability when we want to as opposed to it autotriggering\n\n[b]I was psyched out of my mind for [i]AMID EVIL[/i] - and while it is certainly good - I think I'll be focused more on [i]DUSK[/i] and [i]Ion Maiden[/i].[/b] Because, let's face it, gaming time is valuable and we can't play everything.\n- Since when I played Plants vs Zombies, years ago, I looked for its great soundtrack composer Laura Shigihara, finding her Twitter profile. She was talking about a game she was developing, named Rakuen or something like this, and the whole project sounded awesome. I promised to myself that I would buy it the day it was released.  \n\nTo be exact, I only got motivated to register a Steam account specifically in order to buy Rakuen, even if other games were bought before and after it.  Also, even if I found a blog and YouTube videos where Laura talked about Rakuen's development, I didn't read or watch any of it, to avoid creating wrong or misguided expectations. \n\nAnd it was worth the wait. This is an awesome piece of art.\n\nAs a story, Rakuen has a well developed and thoughtful plot, deep and diverse characters, balanced and pleasant pace. \n\nVisually, Rakuen has colorful and elegant graphics, with easily recognizable sprites and detailed scenarios.\n\nThe gameplay is fluid, with simple but entertaining puzzles, not too hard, not too easy, and with rock solid programming.\n\nFinally, Rakuen's music is delightful, perfectly syncronized with the feelings inspired by the plot.\n\nRakuen provoke chuckles, tears and smiles. It brings back a warmth sometimes we forget that exist. It became one of my favorite games ever, and I doubt its place will ever be taken by another title.\n\nThank you Laura, thank you very much for Rakuen.\n- I called Grandma a bitch. Grandma immediately murdered me. 10/10 would die again.\n- Ever wanted to be a futuristic dual wielding samurai drummer with a penchant for slicing boxes? No? You didn't even know that was a thing? Well you will after playing this. \n\nProbably the most satisfying rhythm game out there, Beat Saber turns sword thrusts into dance. With notes expertly timed to the music and directional swipes that lead smoothly into each other creating an almost choreographed flow, you will find yourself naturally completing songs and feeling boss after every single track.\n\nWith a choice of difficulty settings and a huge array of modifiers, it is accessible to many skill levels and makes it perfect for newcomers, parties or just to simply show off VR, while remaining a huge challenge for those who wish to test themselves on the most hardcore difficulties.\n\nBeat Saber is a game that probably should be on the radar of any VR user, as it's pretty visuals and reliance on your motions makes it a perfect fit for VR. If you don't have this game I highly recommend you pick it up, as when you do, you may just find it hard to put it down.\n\nNow if you will excuse me, I have a few more hardcore songs I have to embarrass myself attempting.\n- Let's say you capture a prisoner after a bloody raid on your colony. Do you want to:\n\n1. Let them go in the hopes of improving relations with the attackers? YOU CAN DO THAT.\n\n2. Heal them and have colonists talk to them about how great your colony is until they join? YOU CAN DO THAT.\n\n3. Have a colonist with a high medical skill remove their liver to transplant into an alcoholic colonist? YOU CAN DO THAT.\n\n4. Have a colonist with a low medical skill remove their organs just for practice? YOU CAN DO THAT.\n\n5. Eat them because you forgot to stock up on food for the winter? YOU CAN DO THAT.\n\nReally, what else do you need in a game?\n- A forward-hurtling psychedelic tube shooter with a tremendous sense of speed and odd, zen relaxation. The closest thing I have to compare it to is probably [i]Rez[/i]: if you liked that, definitely give this a whirl.\n\nConversions of arcade classics and legends are commonplace. But an arcade [i]myth?[/i] Only one springs to mind: [b]POLYBIUS[/b]. There one minute and gone the next, so they say - an enigmatic arcade cabinet installed and removed by mysterious men in black: rumours of people hooked to the screen and unable to remember or communicate what they saw afterwards, save for that it was immersive, fast, colourful, and strangely hypnotic. A fly-by-night company that went out of business? A government mind control experiment? Probably not, no. A hoax. An urban legend. A myth.\n\nBut a myth was all Jeff Minter needed. If you're previously unfamiliar with Jeff Minter and his stable Llamasoft, he's been creating weird arcade-inspired games and \"lightsynths\" (as in, the inspiration for Milkdrop and other music visualisers) out of a barn in Wales since the 1980s. His creations are marked by being fast, psychedelic, and strangely sheep-themed, generally in search of the kind of gameplay that invites the player to get \"in the zone\". And so it is here.\n\nIn search of a new original creation, he turned his mind to the arcade legend Polybius as inspiration, and his interpretation is oddly faithful:[list]\n[*]Immersive: it supports VR if you have it, wrapping you into the game world - it draws you into the screen even if you don't.\n[*]Fast: capable of and designed for very high-refresh rates if you can support them.\n[*]Colourful: look at the screenshots, you get the idea.\n[*]Hypnotic: hurtling forwards shooting abstract things in tunnel patterns seems like it would be intense, and it is, but - [i]Relax. Just look at the centre of the screen as you move forward. Go through the horns. Let it take you[/i].[/list]\n\nOnce you get the hang of it and start relaxing into it and getting into that sense of flow, it's curiously calming. I can see myself bringing this out for a quick session after a stressful day: it's particularly good to dip into. Long sessions might result in seeing patterns on the walls, Tetris-style.\n\nIt's not for everyone: Minter's games never have been. In particular, you may wish to skip this one if you have sensory conditions that make you susceptible to motion sickness, or photosensitive epilepsy.\n\nGood music too, and doesn't need high specs either. Recommended.\n- The game vaguely reminds me of Yume Nikki and Strange Telephone due to thematic similarities, but in the end, I think it managed to be something completely different - I don't want to compare it directly to Undertale, but I got those narrative vibes as well. Unlike its exploration-based relatives, UNREAL LIFE is somewhat of a linear game, but the areas tend to loop around into the hub when using waypoints, occasionally involving some backtracking and optional achievements (including a game within a game). It took me about 6 hours to get 2 bad endings on the same playthrough, that said I am missing more than half of the achievements and probably other endings as well. Despite its modest art style, I think the locations and the world design were very good, granted the game settings are very limited for the price. The writing and characters were the highlight of the experience for me, I would say I enjoyed about 95% of the dialogue and world-building, despite being a very text-heavy game. The game tells a story in a unique way where the character can extract memories from the objects that she touched, unlocking potential hints that you will need to solve puzzles.\n\nYour room works as a hub area to which you can return for manual saves or the minigame, additionally to connecting all areas with a waypoint system, but you don't have to worry too much about those as the checkpoints are very frequent. Generally, the gameplay is just exploring 2D levels, picking up items, and occasionally solving creative sequence puzzles. The character keeps track of 3 different memories that may contain clues if you managed to miss them - it's hard to do because the important text is color-coded. I want to give the devs credit for actually putting some originality into puzzle mechanics, they were fun and not difficult enough to drag the game down. However, when the character learns about a hidden item from the memory, you have to click in the correct spot with no indication, which is perfectly fine, I only wish I realized it sooner. For any Yume fans out there, the game works as a psychedelic visual candy, with many dream-like environments and themes to navigate. \n\n[i]In a way, playing through this game reminded me of the first time I finished watching Spirited Away, the journey so immersive it left me in a state of melancholy. Do you ever get a feeling that you changed as a person after finishing a game? [/i]\n\n[h1] Pros: [/h1]\n\n+ fun characters, enjoyable narrative \n+ multiple endings and optional achievements \n+ creative puzzle based on memory mechanics \n+ nice variety of locations\n+ awesome soundtrack \n\n[h1] Feedback: [/h1]\n\n[u] Some Nitpicks [/u] - I ended up playing on a controller, but if you are using a mouse you have to drag the character around, it would be nice to have the clicking option instead - if it has one I don't know how to activate it. I was slightly confused by the main menu controls when using a controller, but if you can't figure out the buttons you can select the options with the mouse. I wish you just had the visual Q like \"new game\", \"load game\" and so on. Sometimes to progress you may have to talk to characters multiple times, so just make sure that you exhaust all dialogue before moving on. On a side note, you can softlock the game if the water turtle pushes you against the platform (not a big deal, reload 10 second checkpoint). Overall, I don't have any real issues with the game, mostly the story felt like sliding on a big stick of butter.  \n\n[b] Overall Thoughts: 9/10 [/b]\n\nIs it worth $20? Well, it's a really good game for this niche genre if you like those types of ambient/psychedelic games like Dreaming Sarah - it feels bigger and more ambitious than most. There is no question that devs put so much love into the project, but it's still a niche game at the end of the day. My skepticism slowly faded away as the game kept being compelling in the storytelling and enjoyable locations. As someone that plays many games that occupy the same space, I can't really imagine a game that offers much more than that. For me, it was a special game, and by 'special' I mean like it hit a nerve, got pretty personal. \n\n[code]Review By: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/31294838-Hidden-Gem-Discovery/ [/code]\n- It's a R@PE SIMULATOR. Games like this should not be played. I was tempted to play, and will do so for a few hours in future, may be a demon has possessed me...or may be I just don't waste my money that I have spent on it. But really, you should not encourage these games. Who have not bought this game, plz don't buy.\n- This game is really special. I'm a 50 year old man with an emotional structure made largely of mud and thumbtacks, and I had to bite the inside of my jaw in a parts to keep from tearing up. \n\nMany people seem to equate an \"adult game\" with gore and violence or explicit imagery. Nothing wrong with those types of games, I have and will continue to enjoy them. This game explores mature themes on relationships and mortality and doesn't pull any punches, without being cheap or manipulative. In that sense, its the most adult game I've ever played. \n\nI won't ever forget it. If this sounds like something you'd be interested in, stop reading and buy it. Its a slow burn, and you won't be invested until you've spent some time with the characters in the story. In the end, the payoff is tremendous.\n- I pay money for early access\nA lot of bug but developer dont care you feedback just update useless money sea and let player survivel in game without water\n\nNow developer just want reset you save that i play 33hr to build\n\nHowever, New story so fucking soggy \nI have play this game before update can see some timeline \n\nNew update dont care everything you can get in late chapter of the game without vehicle. Just run in and die \n\nStory so confuse if you new plyer and play in this update you will get bad and confuse experience\n\n\nI disappointed to this dev \n\nBut interest in concept of this game\n\nI suggest you to buy when it already full game\n\nDont waste your time in early access with dev who’s not care supporter\n- -This game is like the combination of old PC sidescroller like Duke Nukem (pre-3d), NES Contra, and arcade Metal Slug with 80s /90s cyberpunk and action movie tropes.\n-The cheesy humor, plot, and music is top notch. Might look like a shallow nostalgia at a glance but once you played it, they even spiritually nailed the silliness of similar games/story in that era. The guns, the character acting and lines, the costume design, etc.\n-It's not as fast paced as I thought it would be. But actually that makes it relaxing to play. Easy to get into and the challenge is just right for me without being frustrating. \n-I like how the enemies and characters are pretty diverse. \n-I haven't finished the game but I feel like this game will have similar replay value like Streets of Rage 4. Not because of there are many things to do or getting better at the game but because it's somehow just simply tight, fun, and arcadey to replay.\n- [h1]Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Save scumming is a game-play mechanic and the game is balanced around the player being able to quick-save and reload whenever they want.\n[*] The game seems highly objective oriented, and I wish there was more optional treasures to collect, as I am a pirate.\n[*] While many guard situations appear to have a clear solution,  you can always just brute-force your way through or take another less contrived route, so the game doesn't devolve into a stealth puzzle game.\n[*] Post-game summary shows your route and enemy eliminations at hyper speed, and is always a fun watch at the end of a level.\n[/list]\nI really enjoy finally having a top-down style stealth game. Games such as Hard West and Divinity: Original Sin 2 also featured stealth elements but they were sorely lacking in favor of the turn based combat of the game. Furthermore, this game has pirates, making it an instant hit (for me).\n- 5/10 Too difficult to be any fun playing the game on normal. got at least 10 more hours offline\n+ they put in cheats to make the game actually playable. turned them on after finishing the 2nd world\ni went with 2 dashes and dash assist after all those wrong way dashes.....\n- people who cheat get the same achievements as people who dont, so whats the point???\n- no steam workshop, people could make fun levels unlike the entire game.....\n- one of those dumb meta storys\n- dashes got me killed all the time, janky. towerfall had way better dash system\n+ you can skip the storys, helps when replying levels over and over looking for that dumb B side track\n- F2P update: Hey it's free now! STDs are free - avoid it.\n\nIt was great at the start, I put many hours into it. \n\nAaaand now it's aggressively monetised, forces all this microtransaction garbage on you, battle pass rubbish, skins, emotes, crates, more than one premium currency.\n\nAND they have the gall to ask £26.99 RRP for this? $30 to have the privilege of paying more money.\n\nMake it free at this point, you want to be Fortnite so bad.\n\nYou either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.\n- This is like, the End of Evangelion of RPGmaker games.\n- Falcom's Action RPG Masterpiece.\n\nbest story in the series. it follows the latest adventure of Adol and his companions, stranded in an island and slowly uncovering their secrets. the tight, but well developed cast are absolutely the best written characters in the series. from party member to your fellow castaways all have developed motivation, personality and charm. \n\nalot of the horribad translation and voice acting have been fixed, and it finally got the treatment it deserve as a masterpiece. \n\nthe gameplay is an evolution of the modern Ys game. at its core, ys 8 is an action RPG where you control adol and several other party members with unique set of skills, moveset, weapons and super attack. each character represent an attack type (slash, pierce, smash) that are pitted against various enemies with certain weaknesses. great variety of enemies, amazing boss battles, music and story. \n\non release, there seems to be a big problem for the port, but as far as i know, everything has been patched to very good level of stability. over 70 hours, the game crashed twice (and saved by the intuitive autosave system), run flawlessly 60 FPS and 1440p without a single slowdown. \n\n10/10 game go buy so we get monstrum nox on PC.\n- A fantastic rogue-lite where dying doesn't mean a hard reset. In death your character is succeeded by one of their offspring and all of your earned skills, talents, equipment and gold are passed down from one generation to the next, ensuring that even the weakest of players can still make progress. After each death you are given the choice of three characters that are randomised from a pool of three to eight classes (depending on how many you unlock) who are given randomly drawn traits and abilites; some good, some bad. The castle itself is also randomised keeping the game fresh despite there only being four environments.\n\nAll in all, I found it a thoroughly addictive game despite minimal experience in the genre beforehand and would recommend it to anyone who merely thought \"that looks interesting\" as they skimmed over the Steam store page.\n- Steins;Gate Elite is a great Visual Novel when looked at in isolation. The main problem is that Steins;Gate (the original) exists. I don't mind the difference in art styles, that is a matter of personal preference anyway. Graphics in Elite are a lot more animated, images in the original are more static but also more detailed. What I have an issue with is the missing parts in the story.\n\nThere are a few situations where Elite eliminates choices when compared to the original. I won't spoil details, but in one of the early chapters you can choose to ignore or answer a phone call, leading to alternate branches in the story (they join again soon after, but each branch still contains unique content). Well, you can choose in the original. In Elite, you automatically answer the phone, the other branch is no longer in the game.\n\nAt a later point in the game, I noticed that quite a sizeable chunk of a previously linear story progression (not even an alternate branch) concerning Faris was completely cut out. Again, I won't spoil details in case you just want to decide which version of the game to get and don't know the story yet. It has been some time since I played the original, so I might have missed more instances of missing story parts, but at least this one part was really obvious.\n\nThe missing branches and parts are not really relevant to the overall story, but you probably want them if you want to know more about the characters. Elite is more streamlined, but at least all of the alternate endings are still here. So while there is missing stuff compared to the original, there is quite a bit more when compared to the anime. Then again, the anime added more story after the true ending of the original game. I was hoping that Elite added (and maybe fleshed out) this extra content as well, but no luck here, Elite ends at the same point as the original.\n\nIf you don't mind the art style of the original, play that one instead. The second game (Steins;Gate 0) only exists in it's original form anyway. Elite might still be worth it if heavily discounted since it is the only way to get the \"free\" Linear Bounded Phenogram. You can justify it as buying LBP and getting Elite as a free extra.\n- I even set a calendar reminder so that I could get this on release. I wish I hadn't bothered. Going great guns until I got to the passage. Game over as I can't progress. Tried allsorts to drop the jammer but unable to do so. I guess it is a case of waiting for all the bugs to get resolved.\n- EDIT:\n\nWhile I have played Squad quite a bit for a few years, the large update named \"V6.0 Infantry Combat Overhaul\" unfortunately did not sit well with me.\n\nThe goals for the update:\n\n- Increase length of fights.\n- Reduce the impact of lone wolfs (solo players).\n- Increase emphasis on teamwork mechanics, which mainly meant supression.\n- Increase gunplay diversity, to create choices between optics, since the old meta meant that the magnified optics were greatly outperforming iron sights and holo sights.\n\nWhile I do not disagree with some of the goals, the implementation of them left a lot to be desired.\n\nAfter the update most gunfights became a mess of supression, without either side being able to effetively kill each other beyond 200m.\nGunhandling was also drastically nerfed, creating the sense that your character has never held a rifle before, or even used an optic for that matter.\n\nI can unfortunately no longer recommend this game, since I myself no longer feel drawn to play it.\n\nIf enough changes are made, I may revisit the game and this review, but for now there are better options out there.\n\n\n** OLD REVIEW ** \n\nCan the game be amazing and fun - yes! Do I recommend this for everyone? - No.\n\nThe experience of the game largely depends on what servers / communities you play with. If you play the core game with no moderation (no rules or admins), the game will become a race to make the first unit and lock others out and a race to get armor, then proceed to rush the enemy and end up spawnkilling them near their main spawn.\n\nIf you play on moderated servers with established rules and active admins, then you may experience a great sense of teamplay - other times not so much.\n\nBefore you buy it though...\n\n- Microphone and willingness to use it is REQUIRED for a good experience (People will quickly kick or become hostile towards you, if you do not communicate)\n- This is not battlefield or call of duty, running of solo to pull off 360 noscopes will probably get you kicked/ killed.\n- You will die without knowing from where and you will get into situations in which you have no option to survive, especially if you're new to tactical shooters.\n- You will end up running... A lot..\n- Armor is not like battlefield or call of duty, you need a driver, gunner, commander and possibly a loader (has a machinegun). Where you hit the enemy matters as much as what you hit him with (Armor piercing on his front turret will likely bounce, but even a high explosive may hurt if you can hit him up the rear)\n\nStill here... ?\n\nIf I haven't scared you off, here are my personal tips:\n- Play. The. Tutorial.  Like really...\n- Try different graphic settings, shadows especially makes a big difference in enemy visibility (game looks better with them though)\n- Start as infantry and pick rifleman, but remember to join a squad.\n- Find a server that seems to have active admins and have a ruleset you agree with.\n- Try NOT to give up when you die, generally it isn't worth throwing away a ticket to respawn if you have friendlies within 100m. Sometimes it is the right choice, but before you know which is which, it's a good idea to hold on for a medic.\n- Not all squad leaders know what they're doing, do not be afraid to join another squad if it turns out your squad leader is a fool.\n- Defending is often as important (if not more), than attacking... But you may end up waiting 30 minutes without getting shot at or shooting anyone.\n\n\nAs you can probably tell... Squad is a community based game, with in-depth enough mechanics, while also being easily accessable.\nIf you want a good sense of what the game is, check out some lesser known streamer playing it (bigger streamers will often give you the wrong sense of what a game is like)\n\nHope this helped you make an informed decision.\n\nbut for now there are better options out there.\n- So, I only found this game because my favorite Vtuber Miilkywayz on Twitch played it. It seemed pretty interesting but when she started making her own cards. As an IRL witch I was WAY more interested. The game itself is great, I love making cards and learning their meanings and seeing how how the story changes changes based on your deck and the cards drawn. And the replaybility of it is amazing given its price. 10/10 from me. Need more games like this.\n- I've been completely in love with this game ever since the Mojam prototype \"Wasteland Kings\" was released. It's an insanely fun, fastpaced \"roguelike-like\" or \"roguelite\" with randomly generated worlds and tons of weapons to find. On top of that, the developers stream the development of the game on tuesdays and thursdays over at Twitch and they release updates to the game every week. To me, this is the best game of its kind and I've put tons of hours into mastering it (and I still die. Often. It's difficult okay?).\n- IMHO this game is highly over-hyped, glad I only spend a few € and bought it at sale.\n\n- Basic concept of dungeon crawling with horror is copied from D&D Ravenloft or Call of Cuthullu. So nothing new here. \n- Story is simple and stereotypical: Old man evokes some unnamed horror in a cursed mansion that curses the land...  \n- Graphics are nicely painted ... but still painted, so outdated concept. It's a indy game, ok ... and maybe some gamers still love playing games on their 386er personal computers from 1990 ...\n- The gameplay itself is IMHO stale, because it's always the same: go into a dungeon. Fight. Grind. Survive.\n- Stress could be an interesting factor, but not in the way it is implemented. In its current form is nothing but a second health bar, which is either difficult or expensive to heal. It makes the game not more complex or more interesting but only more frustrating. Stress could be interesting, if it had different stages with different effects. But in its current form and the difficulty of the game itself it is simply idiotic to take stressed heroes into battle. \n- Random number generator is bad. Really bad. Maybe intentional bad? Who knows...?\n\nThe game itself is grind, more grind, and … grind. Combined with the lame story and the frustration it is a game for masochists and people that want to become one.\n- SICK Art Style\nSICK Mechanics\nSICK Game\n- Upon further play, the game wasn't super luck based, it just doesn't do a great job explaining core mechanics that are crucial to gameplay. It has a more hands off, let the player discover how this works type of playstyle, but a simple line of dialogue alluding to these features would have been nice. That said, the story is really gripping, the gameplay (once learned) is fun, and overall, I definitely think it's worth $20.\n- Simply fantastic. Probably the best TRUE RPG I've ever played. Your choices matter, dialogue options matter, the order in which you do things matter, even such small things such as the items you hold in your hand matter. Every build is viable, go heavy in Physical stats and you'll have difficulty solving things Logically, but maybe you can brute force your way through something. Go heavy in Logic and you'll be weak in a one-to-one fight, but maybe you'll be so fast to figure things out that it'll never come to that. You'll see things that the dim-witted brute with high Physical didn't. Failure is encouraged, there are many routes in the game you cannot open without failing something else first.\n\nA true combat system does not exist. At all. Physical altercations are decided through dice rolls based on how you've built your character. And virtually all of them are optional. I like this decision a lot. I've always found it immersion-breaking in RPGs when you're just running around the countryside, killing every bandit or animal that comes your way. This one keeps fights realistic with REAL consequences depending how things go.\n\nBarring having to restart my game once due to a bug (quicksave often, autosaves are few), the game had no major technical issues. There was a single point in the game where a vital skill check required a specific skill to be built, and I'm not sure if there were any alternate routes. I couldn't find any, just had to savescum the check. Aside from that, you have options as to how to approach everything. I'm not sure if that was an oversight or if I just missed something.\n\nCan't go into the story much without spoilers (and you DON'T want it spoiled, it's great.) But it's very well-written and even hilarious at some points. But don't be fooled, it's not a comedy game. It tackles very serious topics such as Fascism, Communism, Mental Illness, Addiction, and many other things.\n\nOverall an amazing RPG experience that I cannot recommend enough. Will definitely play through this several times to see how things go with different builds. Highly suggest you purchase this if you have any interest.\n- Great game... who need 1 or 2 years of development. tl;dr: mid game turn into a micromanagment hell.\n\nThe game is fantastic until a certain point. You start as a mercenary, one party, 50-150 soldiers doing missions, small battles or bigger fights joining armies. Good graphics, brutal engagments with 200-1000 units at the same time if your computer can handle, playing as a soldier is a blast.\n\nThe problems start when you get a few towns and a bigger family, the micromanagement never stops and gets worse overtime. You have to physically move your party to towns to fix their issues. When your lords get captured & escapes, they'll go into a random town until you pick em again, then you'll have to reform the party. Same with caravanes for trading, if they get captured, you'll have to go in his town and recreate the caravan. You have to partially fill towns with soldiers, manually, from your own soldiers. All the little fun things of the beginning soon become a hassle, as you can't delegate. Messengers are not a thing.\n\nYou can't manage a town at a distance, you can't tell a party member to move to a location or guard a territory, they do whatever they want if they're out of your army / party, so you have to do it yourself. Either you're leading your huge army to fight what is basically an enless war mid game, or you take care of your cities while the rest of your faction fight... with various success. Some commanders are pretty good, other will throw waves of recruits at highly trained arbalists in the open backed with cavalry. Protip: don't be a recruit in an imperial army.\n\nYou can't tell a party you created to guard an area or to kill all bandits attacking your villagers, it's up to you, or the IA if it feel like it. Worst, if you let the parties you created roam around (parties = group of 70-200 soldiers under a lord) they can be (temporarily) drafted in other armies of your kingdom... and you'll have to physically move to the army, talk to the leader and pay some reputation to get them back. Of course, large armies are slow. This leads the the next problem, swarms.\n\nMy worst fear is not a massive army, it's an army disbanded in the middle of my territory. The small parties usually start raiding all villages in the vicinity while being too fast to be catched by a big army. Raided villages impact your town / castle loyalty and gold quite heavily. Sure, you could disband your army and hunt them yourself... but that makes you take a step back, and all your parties would reform under another army you can't control. And man, some army commanders are really, really stupid. Verdun style charge in the open against walls of archers, cavalry in a forest vs pikemens, you name it. I can't count the time i had parties wiped in someone else army. But let's say you managed to capture the lords burning your villages.\n\nThe capture system is broken. Captured lords escape A LOT. I had some escape 20 seconds after being captured. They never stay in a jail for more than a few in game days. Once they escape, they magically teleport to their hometown, rebuild a fast 80 mens army in the blink of an eye and go back to raiding villages. AI \"cheat\" with recruits, they will always find soldiers in town, even if they're empty for you. Executions you say?\n\nIf you execute a lord, no matter how much of an A-hole he/she is, the whole faction will hate you. He raided dozens of villages and killed hundreds of peasants? Still not good enough. You just can't kill a lord without suffering heavy consequences down the line, and you'll need those lords to be friendly later. Worth to mention, capturing the leader of a faction won't stop a war.\n\nLast - peace / war is on/off. I had 600 days of continuous war, followed by 600 days of complete peace in the entire map (due to a bug apparently), and i'm now back at 300 days of war. Not a single day of peace, when one war stop another start immediatly. They will just never, ever stop fighting. Can't catch a breath, can't leave the front of your lose towns.\n\nOh and the main quest randomly failed after 875 days or so.\n\nI would still recommand the game, it's really fun for a while but it need a HUGE QoL update.\n\n- unprofessional review:\n\nits a really deep lore kind of game, very cool!\nit has some horror and grinding elements which i always love\ni havent finished the game just yet tho \nthe visuals are very cute\nas soon as i bought it was hooked!\noke theres many more but im to lazy to type :joy:\n\nover all ill give it a 10/10\nvery interesting lore wise\n- I appreciate the sincerity of Jusant. You can tell its creators have placed genuine care into their product, which has made the experience of playing it joyful and kind.\nThe visuals are stunning, the mechanics are not overwhelming, the soundtrack is soothing, and the puzzles are not frustrating. A great climbing game all around with an easy-to-follow yet gripping narrative. \nHopefully, Ukrainian localization will also be added soon.\n\n- \"We'll take the top, and it'll be a happy ending. Just like in Dragon Quest.\" - Ichiban Kasuga.\n- Beautifully drawn and atmospheric\n\nAmazing sound\n\nSimple to play yet gives just the right amount of challenge without being frustrating\n\nI played and finished it in one sitting, Mainly because I was riveted from start to finish\nYes its 3-4 hours long but you will enjoy every minute of it\nI don't think I will ever understand whats going on with the story...but somehow I think that was the intention\n\nHighly recommended and definitely best indie game of the year, perhaps the last 5 years\n- This is trash, I mean if you eat shit for breakfast I'm sure you'll like it.  You have to pay to have access to graphics better than the PS2's, also your stuff gets deleted every week. All there is to do is punch a couple zombies.  Don't get this game.\n- I finished the game on keyboard and had some pretty good fun with it.\n\nno way in hell am i going to try and S-rank all the levels, though.\n\nEDIT: this morning I woke up and thought \"well i'll only try to S-rank level 1 and then i'll put it down\", so that's the story of how i S-ranked every level in the game.\n- I vividly remember the moment when I gave up on Fallout 3: I was the ruins of some city, with a grey sky looming over the shredded grey concrete shells of buildings, and vast chunks of broken grey highway was wrapped up against, around, over and under huge chunks of grey concrete. My companion had gotten stuck somewhere in the grey sea of rubble for the umpteenth time, and it just suddenly struck me: This game isn't fun. It's just depressing.\n\nA few years later, I recalled this experience to a friend of mine, and he assured me: \"Fallout 4 isn't grey. It's got colors. And it's good.\" Having banked 1410 hours in game, I would have to say he was right.\n\nIs Fallout 4 good RPG? Nope. The story is rubbish, the characters extremely shallow, and the skill tree is very meh. If you hate VATS, like I do, the skill tree is complete rubbish. Is it good because it is bug free and has good DLC's? Nope. Is it good because it's the best shooter ever? Nope. Fallout 4 is good game because it's fun, and it's fun because it's a decent shooter, with an OK open world, good atmosphere and a sense a humor. Slap some of the 1000's of existing mods on that, and there's a decent chance that the next time you emerge from the elevator of Vault 111, switching to the catchy tunes of Diamond City Radio as you ready your gun and take in the not-grey landscape, you'll be smiling, just like I do.\n\nUpdate: Due to the recent Skyrim \"update\", breaking mods and introducing paid mods, and a similar downgrade being reported as coming for Fallout 4, I can no longer recommend this game, or any other Bethesda product.\n- [h1]SDHQ STEAM DECK PERFORMANCE REVIEW:[/h1]\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th] Follow our [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42495043/]curator[/url] page for more Steam Deck reviews and our [url=https://twitter.com/SteamDeckHQ]Twitter[/url] for immediate updates on all SDHQ content including reviews, news, and more!\n[/th][/tr][/table]\n\n\n[i]This review is based ONLY on performance of the game on the STEAM DECK.[/i]\n\n\n[h1]The Game Itself:[/h1]\n\n\nChained Echoes is a 16-bit era inspired JRPG which sees you travel across the varied, war-stricken continent of Valandis to bring an end to the war between the 3 kingdoms. With a world filled with charming characters, vicious foes, and bakers that use wood as an ingredient, you will fight in turn-based combat utilizing a complex equipment and skill system to fend for yourself. Chained Echoes also features a customizable airship, tons of items to loot and craft, a 30-40 hour playtime, no random encounters, and a fantastic soundtrack inspired by the PSX era. Will you be able to bring peace to Valandis?\n\nHonestly, I absolutely love this game. The 16-bit style graphics, the attention to small little details, the woven in humor, and the combat mechanics all shine bright here. The combat doesn't feel sluggish and I actually felt a desire to talk to the NPCs sprinkled across the world, which is not a normal feeling for me. I also liked that, if I started a conversation with a NPC, I could still walk away. I wasn't forced to hear everything that they needed to say. Overall, as a game, I can't recommend this one enough!\n\n\n[h1]Steam Deck Performance:[/h1]\n\n\nYeah it runs near perfectly here. Without any changes, you can keep 60 FPS with 6.5 - 7 hours of battery on a full charge. It may not come as a surprise based on the game's graphical quality, but it is still wonderful.\n\nI did encounter a couple stutters here and there, which stalled the game for a solid 1 second, but that was it. This tended to happen on the first attack in combat or entering into a new place, but it wasn't consistent or enough to stop me from enjoying the game.\n\nChained Echoes brings back a lot of memories when playing it. Not because it is something I played before, but because it reminds me of the good times I had with older JRPGs. Chrono Trigger is a big one that I loved from the SNES era and this game gave me those same feelings I had playing back in the day. On top of that, the game performs beautifully on the Deck without any setting changes. I am happy to say it gets our Best on Deck rating! If you enjoy the SNES JRPG era, this is an easy must-buy.\n\n\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th] [url=https://steamdeckhq.com/]SDHQ[/url] is a website made for curating Steam Deck news, guides, and providing optimization/builds for games on the Deck.\n[/th][/tr][/table]\n- I was hoping for a good game but I can't believe the positive reviews. Really annoying on a personal level. If you like your hand held and revel in 3rd person view then enjoy, but I think it's terrible. I was on the mountain jumping across a platform. \"Press ENTER\" to 'grab' it suggests. I press ENTER and what do you know? Nothing happens. Well, you die continually because what it tells you to do (zzzzz) doesn't work. Ah, maybe this is part of the 'difficulty'...hahahaha.\n\nNot a patch on any Far Cry or GTA even though these are full of directions. First Tomb Raider I've bought and definitely the last. What is it with games these days telling you what to do every step of the way: Do this...do that....go here....find item...take item...drop item...fire now.....pull lever...talk....rest....jump.... quit game and uninstall, ya that's the best option. As this game is created for a dumbed-down society or tailored for intellectually challenged meercats, some of us can see where the industry is heading. What happened to thinking for yourself???\n\nI don't need to progess far in this game because the first 10 minutes says enough. Do this, do that, blah blah blah...\n- This game is the greatest middle finger to all the money-grubbing AAA games out there. It's reasonably priced, it's intelligent, it gives freedom to your epic adventure, and last but not least, this game doesn't have any loot-box and micro-transaction nonsense!\n\nGreat work Larian Studios. This game will go down as a cult classic!!\n- Playing this game for the first time six years after its initial release proved to be a delight in disguise. With all the memes and jokes established, I was finally able to understand what the fuss was all about back in 2011. Despite not having the best gameplay, story or graphics out there, something about this title just made me want to finish every quest I deemed worth completing. \n\n9/10 - mods recommended\n- This game is so good! I actually teared up with some of the conversations (Nightgaunt and Riptide anyone??) and I definitely wasn't expecting that. All of the dialogue is super natural and the relationship's progress really cute. I honestly can't believe this game is free\n- I really, really wanted to like this game.\n\nI preface this review by saying that Guacamelee 1 is in my top 10 games of all time. I've been a gamer for 33 years. Sotn, Chrono Trigger, and FFVII are my go-tos. G-Melee 1 is a charming and original romp through a metroidvania style genre.\n\nGuacamelee 2 fails so ridiculously hard, it actually makes me sad when I think about it. The puzzles are uninspired, the abilities don't really feel enjoyable, and the platforming elements are just unforgivingly tight for the sake of it. I had all the \"schools\" maxed out before the end, it didnt make me feel any more powerful. I didn't have that super saiyan mode like in GM 1.\n\nThe final bossfight is a 3/10 compared to the first game where it is at BARE MINIMUM 9/10.\n\nI wish I could rank this game higher because I adore the original. However, this became a slog several hours before I could finish it. I would not recommend this to anyone, ever. It's light on the humor and story, it requires you to be invested in the previous game. The mechanics aren't new and they threw in some unnecessary tight, like razor thin, platforming into the game.\n- So the game can be played I believe in flat screen and VR, I played in VR. You play the game in a third person prospective controlling a spirit dog. The concept is easy, get the people to the light beam, but that's easier said than done. It was very nearly a short game play video as i become really stuck to the point i nearly quit but I tried, tried and tried again until i did it. It very much reminded of a game i use to play as a kid called lemmings only in this one it doesn't matter if the people fall of the edge. Its a very challenging game, one where you can just sit and try to figure it all out. I thought it would get repetitive but each level is very different from the last. I have a game play video in which i get a bit frustrated lol if you wanted to check out some game play. https://youtu.be/7VPsLnDDDlQ\n- THIS REVIEW IS FOR VERSION 1.3 \n\nStarbound is the space game that all people who crave space games like I do will enjoy. \n\nFrom playing with your friends and colonizing an entire star sytem to role playing as a galactic bounty hunter, this game truly offers what all of us enjoy. \n\nPros \n+ Unique art style \n+ Infinite procedurally generated universe \n+ Creative alien races that are completely customizable \n+ Pets unique to each race \n+ A heart wrenching story that [Spoilers] makes you a hero \n+ Crafting system that requires a plethora of materials \n+ Mining and harvesting isn't a grind \n+ Materials can be acquired through pickaxes, drills, mechs, and the infamous and upgradable Matter Manipulator \n+ Devs constantly working to update and add new features \n+ Every planet is different with several contributing features such as weather, temperature, radiation, and colonization \n+ Many different generated structures such as buildings and towns that generate on some of the planets, with origins of each race \n+ An upgrading and advancement tree that takes time and effort that is always enjoyable. Exploration is necessary to advance upon it, is unique to each race, and customizable to each player \n+ Crew members can be added to your ship, but I'll say more later \n+ Your own space station can be created for players and NPCs to visit \n+ You can create and fully cutomize a mech to fly through space and stomp along the ground \n+ You can visit and trade inside of other space stations full of NPCs / other players \n+ You can create colonies for NPCs to live in \n+ Treasures can be discovered pretty much anywhere \n+ Tech can give you powers like dashing, jumping, and morphing into a ball \n+ The bosses get harder and are all quite cleverly created \n+ The quests link into the web of connections that advance your tech, systems, and story \n+ Moddable in any way you like, from the intro scene to Robbie Rotten's clothes \n+ Vehicles such as hover bikes and boats are available. \n+ Port forwarding isn't required to host games, your friends can join you through Steam at any time \n+ Tiny easter eggs and hints from the devs can be found throughout the game \n+ It's fairly cheap price-wise, I mean it's a fourth of No Man's Sky and four hundred times better \n+ The soundtrack is beautiful and has brought tears to my eyes more times than I'd like to admit \n+ So many possibilities that can lead to my 700 plus hours on this game \n\nNeutralities \n~ The universe doesn't feel losslessly empty and gigantic, it's fairly easy to get from star to star \n~ Life is extremely abundant \n~ 2D and pixelated; the graphics aren't 'next gen' \n\nCons \n- You can't customize the exterior of your ship \n- Crew members are a little dumb AI-wise and not extremely useful \n- It's a bit slow paced, which a lot people don't like [strike] because they all are stupid and get bored way too fast and don't have the drive to actually work for anything [/strike] but I love it. \n\nTL;DR \n* It's a great space exporation game with a web of slow-ish paced advancement that's extremeley wide in possibilites and customization.\n* Much of the game is unique, including the races, planets, stars, and generated structures. \n* If you don't like it, you probably don't like space games :p\n- I don't understand why everyone is saying to stay out of the house? I went inside, they were super nice loving and caring people. The dude that owns the place is a butcher and has all kinds of quality meat. We had BBQ and showed me around the wheat farm. And his grandma, she can't see or hear very well, but she's incredibly sweet. They're both looking after a baby that's ABSOLUTELY ADORABLE!\n\nI don't get what all the fuss is about, I enjoyed my visit.\n- Gone Home is... okay. There's nothing particularly terrible about it, but it's hardly this amazing, revelatory experience that it's been portrayed as in the media. It's just a very short, straightforward game of exploration, in which a fairly simple story of teenage love and rebellion is fed to you through bits and pieces of notes and spoken journal entries you find while exploring a large, abandoned house. But this game does absolutely nothing innovative, unlike the pre-release hype proclaimed. There have been hundreds of games with more compelling stories, and this game introduces no original mechanics. I took my time and explored the entire house, and I beat the game in three sessions totalling 81 minutes.\n\nAgain, it's not bad, it's just an utter ripoff for $20. I got it in a large Humble Bundle package, paying about a dollar for it, and it's decent value at that price, but there's no way I'd pay more than five bucks, and even that is stretching it. I'd be pissed if I'd paid full retail for it. You can find many many games that will be far more engrossing, more entertaining, and just plain longer at this price point.\n- I only have 3 hours in this game but I can say it ain't worth £45. Graphics are trying to look cool but just look crap. Glitched unit textures. Runs well doesn't crash but I just hate the changes from the old total war games. Unit icons look crap I can't tell what is what. My general dies there are no notifications. Can't find how much ammo archers have. No tutorial at all. Tried attacking a tier 1 settlement only to lose everything to the towers. I'd rather play rome 2. I really hate the general idea, the fact that any old general can rock up and kill 600 men is stupid.\n- If Hayao Miyazaki directed a video game I feel like it'd be something like Owlboy. By which I mean; stunning visuals, incredible soundtrack and a wonderful story. The three intertwine so well that I'd consider it to be my Ocarina of Time for Pixel Platformers.\nAnd an indie game that's so damn beautiful it made me write my first review.\n- This game vs. HOI3:\n---------------------\n\nAdvantages:\n\n1.) The production system is more interesting and engaging, and far more balanced than the old IC system of HOI3. \n2.) The unit creation system is far more in depth and interesting, featuring many different brigade types and support companies, allowing you to change your divisions however you would like. \n3.) This game is far more stable than HOI3.\n4.) This game is updated regularly and has bugfixes regularly too, with content being added free along with every DLC. \n5.) The modding community of HOI4 is far larger with excellent mods such as Kaiserreich, Millenium Dawn, Red World, and Endseig.\n6.) HOI4 muliplayer is actually playable without making you want to shoot yourself.\n7.) China is no longer something Japan can take within 2 months.\n8.) An actual peace conference system and ideologies that actually impact the game.\n9.) Far easier to get into than HOI3.\n10.) Less railroading and the AI wont spaz if you do something ahistorical.\n11.) Planes are no longer as cancer as they used to be.\n12.) Far less micromanagement if you choose not to want to micro.\n13.) A better tutorial (still not a great one though.)\n\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n1.) The research system is bare bones in comparison to HOI3.\n2.) The War in the Pacific is basically nonexistant and naval warfare is awful (to be improved with next patch, being released eventually:tm:)\n3.) People dont really join the war in HOI4 unless theyre directly attacked, making continents like South America completely useless due to the fact that none of the countries there ever do anything but still build up their military, contributing lag.\n4.) Due to the game's engine, it can only use a single one of your processing cores, meaning regardless of your computer quality the game will run kinda slowly.\n5.) Speaking of slowly, the game is poorly optimized and frame loss is extremely common, especially 1942 onwards, when majors can have upwards of 300+ divisions. \n6.) The AI is often braindead, doing hilariously incompetent things such as charging endlessly into your lines, removing all its troops from your front, leaving major areas completely undefended, and completely ignoring the aerial aspect of the war.\n7.) Specific AI are even more braindead than the rest, specifically island nations, or nations that otherwise need to use navies and airforces more. Yes, the Japanese, American, and British AI are some of the worst in the game. In a WW2 game. \n8.) Your allies are completely useless and often you will find yourself doing all the fighting yourself, or even being hindered by your own allies. Playing as Germany the Italians likely wont place a single division in North Africa. In D-Day, you will either be the only one contributing anything or your allies will contribute so much that the supply is ruined and your troops all die of attrition. As the USSR you will recieve 0 lend lease, and as China you will get absolutely no support from the west. \n9.) HOI3 is a lot cheaper than HOI4\n\n\nOther things which I feel are worth mentioning but arent really advantages or disadvantages:\n\n1.) HOI4 contains a lot more alt-history options, which while not for everyone, are fun to try out. \n2.) The focus-tree system is something completely different from anything in HOI3.\n3.) The game has a less in-depth OOB(Order of Battle), which while to some people is nice because theyre bad with OOB, others dislike. Specifically this game lacks corps. \n4.) The battle-planning system of HOI4, while easier to use than the one in HOI3, is still flawwed. In HOI3 it did absolutely nothing, but in this game it is a core part of playing. Unless you want to mircomanage every single division, like you did in HOI3, you will use this system. \n5.) While simpler, the game still possesses a learning curve.\n\n------------------------\n\nOverall: \n\nHOI4 is a far less grounded and historical experience than HOI3. Is this a good or bad thing? That depends on your perspective. HOI4 obviously has significant advantages over HOI3 in certain areas but many consider HOI3 to be an overall better game. Personally I recommend HOI3 if you want a more micro-intensive, historical experience, and HOI4 if you want to just sit back and relax for a couple hours murdering millions of people. \n\nPersonally I would suggest either game, but thats just me.\n- You had me at creating adventure log, well actually no, at the starting song perhaps. How many years have I been waiting for full fledge, non portable DQ since DQVIII in PS2 ?\n\nThis PC port is a great one, neat and very beautiful. I was playing at 4k/~30fps and since my GPU is not fast enough I switched to 1440p/~50-60fps instead. I wish more and more JRPGs to do PC concurrent launch like this one. A day later I switched back to 4k and change internal resolution to 80% then it was pretty much perfect.\n\n- You can choose default A/B button.\n- You can choose resolution and 30/60 FPS mode. There is a way to unlock 60+ FPS for gaming monitors, google it.\n- You can invert cameras both ways.\n- You can choose classic battle mode.\n- You can press L3 and enjoy the view.\n- Load time is non-existence with SSD.\n- Ultra Widescreen is NOT supported. Waiting for mods at the moment.\n- Keyboard and Mouse is fine but playing with controller is wayy better.\n- Fully customisable keys / controllers.\n- Story synopsys at game loading screen.\n- Silent Protagonist.\n- Full voice cutscenes.\n- Auto-run button.\n- You can jump.\n- An Excelent, well polished shmup(except for one technical fault) with great graphics and music.\n\nNot much to say other than it has fun boss fights with some creative bullet patterns, you have a gauge that fills up and when activated it doubles your fire power, and also you have bombs. If you have bombs and you get hit, you lose all of your bombs instead of just dying straight out, so you essentially have 2 hit points. You have a graze meter as well, meaning that if bullets pass by you it fills that meter up, when it is full, all bullets around you are basically nullified, and any enemy you kill, any bullets it fired at you will also get nullified. When you pass through the nullifeid bullets, it will fill the first gauge I mentioned so you can go ape s**t more often.\n\nIt's fairly simple, but the pace of the game takes a little while to get used to, the speed of your ship releative to the bullets is a little too slow but it's not game breaking. The only major issue is that my controller is not detectable by the game so I have to use joytokey, so I can't make full use of my controllers analog controls.\n- Not what the developers promised.\nFeels like a graphics mod for Chivalry.\n\nI'm not a fan of Chivalry either. I had some fun with it, but couldn't bear the clunkiness and wished for intuitive controls and realistic fights. Mordhau promised exactly that. \nAlthough it's equally clunky und even more buggy.\n\nAlso it doesn't offer the option to play in private rooms with your friends (duel mode) or only on paid servers. Inviting a friend to a local match should be a standard feature.\n\nAll the new content and features don't really matter - it's a PvP fighting game. I need only a couple of weapons that work, not 100+ that don't.\n- This game is meditation, the thought-cleansing effect of driving a thousand kilometres along the highway cannot be understated. Occasionally poor AI choices behind the wheel may spike your blood pressure but overwhelmingly ETS2 is a relaxing thing to stick on after a rough day. And if that's not enough you can just drive into oncoming traffic in your indestructible death machine.\n\nAn alternate title for this game could be \"Zen and the Art of Logistics\".\n- Minesweeper influenced design feels like a fresh take on the Slay-the-Spire-like genre.  Now that I've won with all six classes, and done some of the unlockable difficulty levels, I feel that I've gotten my money's worth with the game, and I have enjoyed the time I've spent so far, but I don't expect great longevity beyond this point.\n\nI do have some minor gripes:\n\n* The pacing on unlocking new classes feels too slow.  It would be nice if the approach was the fairly standard one of unlocking a new class when you win with the previous one, but here there is a currency which is acquired throughout runs, and I found that I usually had to have two winning runs with the previous class to earn enough currency to unlock a new one.\n* Optimal play with some classes requires memorizing tiles which are revealed, and then on later turns these tiles are hidden.  Taking damage because I misremembered what was hidden behind a tile feels unfun and at-odds with what the game otherwise wants to be.\n* I would prefer if the harder difficulty settings were unlocked from the get-go, rather than grinding through easier difficulty settings to find the challenge.\n\nOtherwise, though, it's a fun game with an adorable art style, and not just a clone of the other Spire-likes around.  Recommended if your expectation is to get ten hours or so of strategic puzzling.\n- I backed this game back at the end of September 2013 and have finally played it through to completion. \n\nCandle is a beautifully unique game which takes elements from puzzle, platforming and point and click adventures. The puzzles, although sometimes frustratingly difficult, are all different and use different mechanics keeping the game engaging and fresh. Teku's Candle is such a interesting game mechanic that I really enjoyed getting to know and learn. As previously said, the game looks and sounds absolutely stunning. I don't think I have seen a game that looks this good before and that is attritubuted to every character and scene being hand drawn. Controls can be a bit finicky but not game breaking and you can easily adjust too. I would recommend getting this game because it provides a great whole experience.\n- The good news is the driving physics, fuel and tire mechanics, and multiplayer design are the best the series has ever been. However, the overall package, performance, and presentation are significantly lacking in this game at launch. Unless you're desperate, hold off on purchasing this game until the developers have had time to put in additional content and fix the numerous bugs and the odd design choices they've made that I think may need to be changed. There's a lot of work that needs to be done on this game for it to be considered a complete racing game.\n \nThe performance on an 8700K+RTX4070 has been inconsistent at 1440p. While playing with frame rate unlocked at a mix of ultra and high settings I can get FPS into the high 80s but this is accompanied by regular drops of about 20 FPS so I felt it required the 60 FPS lock setting which was a bit disappointing. The other disappointment comes in how the game looks, which frankly is not visually pleasing even at the highest possible settings and generally just not a sharp enough picture no matter what you adjust.\n\nSo overall it’s a bit of a mixed bag. The racing itself is engaging and fun but the choices the developers have made with this game for presentation and functionality leave much to be desired. If it receives good post-launch support it may correct a lot of those issues but at launch it’s a bit disappointing and I do not recommend buying it.\n- Do I really have to write this review? I am just one in thousands of people who wrote a positive reveiw for Garry's Mod. Chances are, this review will never convince someone to buy Garry's Mod. It'll just be lost in the 100,000 positive reviews out there. Well, here I go anyway.\n\n\"Where do I start?\" This is the question asked by anyone playing Gmod for their first time. It's also my question that I ask about this review I am writing. Hmm...\n\n_The gameplay...the gameplay...hmm... Well, there's singleplayer sandbox. You can do...uh, whatever you want really. Just addon a few addons, and you can be entertained for hours. Battle NPCs, make cool scenes for cool screenshots, explore maps, be a superhero (spiderman addon!), and much, much, much, much- you get my point, right? Almost all content is user-generated. Make your own content! Multiplayer. In Multiplayer Gmod you can roleplay. I'm talking normal RP (DarkRP), Military RP, Star Wars RP, etc, etc. In multiplayer Gmod, you can battle, prophunt (yay), hide 'n seek, and much, much, more.\n\n_Graphics? I'll rate the graphics...drumroll please... 7/10. This game is and older game. Came out in 2006. I guess the graphics are good for 2006, and people enjoy the game and don't complain much about the graphics, but I'm not gonna lie, they are outdated and look old. It's not 2006 anymore.\n\n_Hear the bullets flying. The zombies growling. The people chatting. The boxes jumping... The sound in this game is great! Every sound is loud and clear, and there are a varitey of sounds.\n\n_Play this game. Play it again. Play it some more. Play some now, and play some later. Play it over and over. Play it as long as you want.\n\n_My Personal opinion. Get this game. Now. Get Gmod on sale or not. I'm not gonna stop playing it for a while and I'm already at 50+ hours of playtime. I love this game! WAIT! Before you go and buy this, then you wonder why there are all the missing maps and errors in most games, get Counter Strike: Source, so ALL the textures are supported. You need it to play MOST multiplayer games.\n\n\nGameplay: 9/10\nGraphics: 7/10\nStory: N/A\nSound: 8/10\nReplayability: 10/10\n\nOverall 8.5\n\nEven though, this is one positive review on Garry's Mod, out of the thousands of positive reviews that have been submitted Garry's Mod, I hope this one convinces you to buy... Gmod\n\n-Star_Hawk_\n- Joined the Discord Server to get a sense of the toxic, immature, insulting community. If the Discord server is not moderated, which is the first impression for new players, then you know in what state the game is.\n- It looked old when it was released. Now it's downright ugly. The gunplay is clunky. The physics are terrible. The bugs are ever present.\n\nThe RPG mechanics are top notch. The choices you make matter.\n\nOne of the greatest games ever made.\n- EDIT: I nominated this game for game of the year (2023)\n\nLong ago I had heard about this game and how detailed and intricate it could be, and how you could spend hours upon hours building the massive empire of dwarves only for it to all come crashing down in some spectacular but unforeseen way.  Then I got into Rimworld briefly and thought it was ok, but it tended toward chaos a bit too much for my liking.  THEN I heard this game was coming to steam and I eagerly awaited it.\n\nIt's not necessarily that I was too good to play a game with mostly ascii/character graphics (I used to play them a lot back in the 1980s).  I was more intimidated by the depth of the game and not knowing if there was a wiki for it (there is) or how I'd find help if I needed it (I'm sure there's a ton of communities JUST for this game).  I expected that when it came to Steam, it'd be beefed up and worth the wait.\n\nWell it finally arrived and I think I'm STILL a bit intimidated by the sheer amount of options you have... mostly because it's not just me that I have to worry about, but a whole community of dwarves.  In the case of something like minecraft, I could dig a whole intricate tunnel and if stuff starts to go bad, I just high-tail it out of there and recover until I can go back and finish it.  In Dwarf Fortress though, if stuff starts to go bad, you can't just leave.  You are encouraged to deal with the adversity and push onward in the name of greatness... or something.\n\nIn a way it's like role playing, except you don't have to roll character sheets and you don't really control any of the characters directly.  You make decisions about where to mine, what trees to chop down, what to build, what to trade, what to plant, and for every thing there is a season (turn turn turn).  You're forced to deal with death, birth, attacks, sickness, madness, and a ton of other things that I have no idea are coming.  \n\nI keep thinking \"I could do better\" and I start a new game, but then I start to realize that no matter what I do, I'm never gonna have a perfect game, or a game where everything goes exactly according to plan.  I am eventually going to have to buckle down and stick to one game save to see it through.\n\nIf you're like me and starting something new holds a lot more interest than continuing an existing project (ADHD?) you may have difficulty with this game.  At the same time you may become so engrossed in it that you lose track of time and suddenly it's 6am and you wonder why you stayed up all night digging holes.  I'm starting to feel a bit of the madness myself.  (it's almost 4:30am as I write this)\n\nIn any case, it's probably not for everyone, but I'd say if you're unsure, find the non-steam version and try that, and if you can grok what's going on and it interests you, definitely buy this and support the developers... OR buy this and try to stay under the 2 hour refund  limit while you learn the basics (Good luck with that, it'll be 6 hours before you know what happened).  I believe this game is worth the money though (full price).  If you were going to wait for a sale you'd be waiting a long time anyway.  \n\nTL;DR If this looks interesting to you, don't wait! Buy now.  If you aren't sure, do a bit of research and come back and buy it.\n- Phat beatsies,\nSelf-deprecating humour that gives me self affirmation,\nPanders to my need for nostalgic nods,\nPlays smoothly, and so doesn't leave me stuck for hours helping me to feel like I have higher than average intelligence,\nMesses about with you based on the assumption of previous adventure game experience, which leads to making me go \"heh\" outloud more than three times.\n\nMildly amusing, could use more super space dust.\nPlayed on the \"hard\" difficulty option but activated other options out of curiosity, would recommend it for the extra shenanigans.\n\nIf I had to give it a score 8/10,\nWould pay for the soundtrack, that ear crack is cash money.\n\nA hell of a lot of work was put into this game & I suggest you press \" J \" on as many screens as you can handle to get some insight on the thought process behind this game, the effort and imagination that went into it.\n\nThe missing 2 points:\nfew bugs to work out, ain't no big but in a game where you are going to be thinking \"it's not progressing because I haven't mashed the appropriate non-sensical things together\" it needs to not bug out.\n\nSoundtrack not yet out - nah not actually taking points away from that, it'll be out soon as I understand it, but I need that fix Mr. Shellburger.\n- Instead of spending 30€+ on a game you'll never play, buy this. For 2€ you'll get more than your money's worth.\n- This was a impulse buy for me just have seeing the new \"Fury Road\", but its a great game so far was kinda shocked it ran smooth right out the gate seems like today you gotta wait a week or month before a game can run proper though. Anyways beatufiful lighting, models / textures look good, vehicle combat / driving is fun, and vehicle customization is cool too. The on foot combat feels a little too straight foward though, the gore animations are kinda boring though, like feels like its a Xbox/360 game in that way, and collecting scrap can get a little repetitive. My final thought yea this game is worth getting but if you haven't played id's \"RAGE\", I'd reccomend getting that first, it's a extremely simmilar although kinda diffrent scenario game that will quench your Mad Max thirst.\n- *LOOK INTO SAFETY/SECURITY RISKS BEFORE BUYING THIS GAME*\n\n     Playing this game online can be risky as hackers are able find your IP address, mess with your in-game / weapons / health / money, find out your personal information, install rats on your PC & even get into your computer. Although this isn't super common it's still a legitimate thing that people need to know about & should look into before spending their money on this game. It doesn't happen as much to random players but Streamers have to play this game in offline mode whenever they stream themselves playing otherwise the hackers will mess with whatever they're doing by trying to get them banned. \nPlease google \"Black ops 3 PC security risks 2022\". It really is a shame that Treyarch isn't coming back to fix this very serious problem in their game, but let's be real Activision  more than likely isn't letting them. \n\nTL;DR: Be cautious of potential security issues, but I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes Call of Duty Zombies / zombies in general or who wants to get into the Call of Duty Zombies franchise.\n\nNow for my review:\n     Best call of duty game ever for Zombies. Definitely can be a challenge to find multiplayer matches nowadays but zombie matches aren't hard to find as long as you're playing the \"popular\" maps. The \"less popular\" maps are more difficult to find a match on but it's still possible, especially if you search for a match at the right time of day. This goes for multiplayer as well, if you search for a match during specific times you will be more likely to find matches (I'm not entirely sure when these times are so I wont even leave my guess here). This is likely because of people in different time-zones getting up / getting off work or school and getting on the game.\n     This game is the best thing to ever happen to the Zombies series in terms of gameplay, storyline, progression & more. There are endless tasks, items & surprises in each map that keep you coming back for more and having a different experience each time! It truly is a wonderful & fun game that has offered me more re-play ability than any other game I've ever experienced, especially with custom zombies/mod tools. With community made maps there's literally endless maps/levels to play on, & because of mod tools we not only have the remakes that come with Zombies Chronicles but we also have the visually stunning remakes of Mob of the Dead, Call of the Dead & Town, with Buried as well as Die Rise on the way for 2023/2024! I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes Call of Duty Zombies / zombies in general or who wants to get into the Call of Duty Zombies franchise.\n- theres 2 options with this game, either you play the original without mods wich is still a very good game\nor you have the untitled goose, matt from wii sports, sans undertale, and barack obama fight on top of a mcdonalds\n\n10/10 game\n- Big improvement over the first game. \n\nCombat is much more enjoyable and the boss fights actually have some interesting patterns and design. I had some issues with taking damage when being too close to the boss which was frustrating but not too huge of an issue. Boss patterns felt fair and it felt like I really learned the fight in and out by the time I beat them.\n\nPersonally I found the overworld a bit less visually interesting than the first; though travelling back and forth between two different worlds was a nice touch. The overworld also has lot of mazes, much more than I remember in the first game. That being said, I spent much less time not knowing how to progress in the game which is nice.\n\nAudio-Visual presentation is excellent as to be expected. Though I also felt the narrative to be more interesting this time around. I was able to follow the narrative pretty well and the plot even has some pretty good twists. Overall another improvement over the first game.\n\nIn general I found this a lot less frustrating to play than the first game; allowing for the game's good points to work better. Given this I have a much easier time recommending this than the first game, which was always a very cautious recommendation from me. It should be noted that this game has many references to the prequel so it should be played before this; even if doing so is a bit rough. If the third game improves on this I would have very little issue recommending the whole trilogy.\n\n\n- If you played the OG this is basically the same but with a few added side stories you can unlock as you complete different routes in the game. The extra dlc maybe would take you a bit over an hour to complete all of them if you speed through it, but does not have any optional dialogue so it's more of just some lore and extra character interactions. Still pretty solid dlc if you are a fan and want a little bit of extra stuff :)\n- It's a pretty game, but there's no option for manual saves, and autosaves only happen once in a great while instead of immediately after solving each puzzle or progressing through conversations. I also felt like the walking was extremely clunky with the mouse and keyboard, and I'd prefer click-to-walk.\n- 1. Mea Culpa > Ruego Al Alba\n2. combat feels much better\n3. oops no instakill traps\n4. [strike]bleeding crown prayer is too strong[/strike] wtf, just got the time stop prayer\n- This does what I wish AAA RPGs with narratives would do; choices actually feel like they make an impact and the gameplay changes that reflect this are dynamic in nature and provide meaningful differences in the conversations.\n\nIt doesn't feel this way on a macro scale, the meaning is more in the individual encounters with some exceptions. To word it a little differently, I felt like my choices had very little impact on the story as a whole and I could easily (a little too easily) steer the final outcome at any time but, within individual interrogations, what I chose to do had a major affect on the immediate narrative.\n\nThat being said, it is a wonderful game to play for four to six hours on a Sunday and at $15 USD it is cheap and entertaining enough to only need a single playthrough to feel like you've gotten your money's worth. Although I haven't started my second playthrough, I'm already thinking about when I want to sit down and have another go.\n- I have played OSU!, Muse Dash and stepmania plenty and I gotta say that this does not feel like a rhythm game at all. The premise of matching the shape of the map to music sounds interesting but some of the songs I feel like are not mapped out correctly. Or in general this game relies less on music cues and more on visual cues? It felt like maps are only 50% related to the song and you have to ignore what you hear because the map randomly demands patterns that have no matching audio equivalent and everything becomes pure visual memorization.\n- A masterpiece of a game that had it's potential destroyed by EA's stupidity to release it between a new COD and BF game :( :( this game is worth the full price just for the single player campaign alone, the movement and shooting mechanics in this game is top notch and many other games have tried to mimic it. I've played through the single player 4 times now (twice on ps4, once on xbox and once on pc) and every single time the game has been a blast, trust me play it :) I really hope respawn/ea make titanfall 3\n- Do yourself a favor.  Go in as blind as possible.  Don't look at any guides.  The system of getting pages of the manual that you can't fully understand is a stroke of genius.\n\nAlso I haven't found a waterfall that *doesn't* have a secret behind it.\n\n**EDIT: Finished the game**\n\nI'll admit for many of the later \"post-game puzzles\" I looked at a guide for.  The in game language is very difficult to decipher blindly, and if you're not familiar with English you probably shouldn't even bother.  \n\nThe surprising thing about this game is you can pretty much do any puzzle at any given time once you get one or two specific items, but because of how the manual is handled, you'll never know how until you see the pages (or experiment a lot)\n\nI think the most amount of tries I've spent on a boss fight was 7-8, but nothing is stopping you from exploring more and finding stat boosts.\n- We need a 60fps patch ASAP. Having 30fps content on PC in [current year] is not acceptable.\n\nOther than that the game is pretty solid! It looks great, it plays great, the story was good imo, the characters are interesting and the amount of solo content is decent.\n\nHowever, the gear system is not as elaborate as in Mk11 and the microtransations are NOT a welcome sight. Denuvo also has to go. If Harada agreed that the addition of Denuvo in Tekken 7 was a mistake, so should NetherRealm.\nI also don't like that 2 characters that are going to be in the Kombat Pass are already in the game (Ermac and Quan Chi). Just give us these characters and come up with other ones for the KP. This is super greedy and lazy.\nIt's even worse than Sektor and Cyrax in MK11, at least you didn't let us play them, period. this time you decide to not make them playable (even thought they work for the AI) AND sell them at a later date? That's awful.\n\nThe game is good but needs improvement and shouldn't ship with performance issues, 30fps content, microtransactions, Denuvo and greedy DLC tactics. I would put a \"meh\" review if I could because of the negatives but for that reason I have to say \"no\".\n- I have a serious love/hate relationship with Sea of Thieves. It is both one of the best games I have ever played and one of the most frustrating games I have ever played, all wrapped into one. The gameplay of Sea of Thieves is INCREDIBLE. The sailing is the best in any game I have ever played. The feeling of exploration and discovery as you blast through treasure hunts and puzzles and mysteries is unlike any feeling you can get from any other game. The cooking mechanic, the healing from food, the not-terrible fishing mechanic... all subsystems that prop up the rest of the gameplay are unique and interesting in their own right. The land-based combat is relatively uninspired, yet still satisfying when part of the greater picture that the game presents. Some of my favorite memories in gaming, full stop, come from completing long nights on the high seas or doing long-form content available in the game. The game is gorgeous, some of the best ocean/water graphics in any game. The rest of the game is equally beautiful while perfectly conveying the environment of the map you are in. I swear to Gaben that I can freaking smell the wet sand or sulfurous lava on some of these islands. The music and sound design are some of the best in the industry. Outright, the game is incredible. \n\nBUT... Sea of Thieves sweaties ruin the game for me. There is absolutely nothing worse than having a night full of fun absolutely destroyed by some player who's enjoyment of the game is derived from eliminating anyone else's fun. I understand that PvP is part of the \"pirate life\", but it is by far the worst part of the game by far. I would be willing to pay money, hell a freaking monthly subscription, for the opportunity to play SoT as a strictly PvE game with just my friends and the rest of the server populated by bots. I actively avoid playing the game now because of how many of my last play sessions started with me spawning at an outpost and subsequently being sunk less than 15 feet off the dock by some sweaty that hasn't seen sunlight since the Obama administration. I know that this is an incredibly unpopular opinion in the greater SoT-sphere, but part of the enjoyment of games is letting players enjoy them how they wish, and I really freaking wish that I could enjoy the aspects of SoT that are fun to me without being the plaything of those pirates who live only to ruin the fun of others.\n\n【グループB】\n- [h1]An old classic that's fresher than lots of today's titles.[/h1]\n\n[i]Day of the Tentacle[/i] first launched in 1993. I remember, because I was a teenager then and couldn't play it as my PC didn't meet the minimum requirements! This was actually the sequel to an earlier game, [i]Maniac Mansion[/i], which was released in 1987. I played [i]Maniac Mansion[/i] a few years after it came out, but did not complete it as the game's movement and controls were just too dated and clunky for me (even back then) to be bothered with. \n\nPlaying [i]Maniac Mansion[/i] is not at all necessary in order to enjoy [i]Day of the Tentacle[/i], though those who have will definitely find greater connection to the game's characters, especially the Edison family.\n\n23 years later, [i]Day of the Tentacle Remastered[/i] is essentially the same as it was before, but with sleeker graphics and a more modernised interface. While the story hasn't changed, it surprisingly (or not) hasn't aged one bit either - tentacle mutates and seeks to conquer the world, and only you (and your friends) can stop him! Though straightforward, the game's charm is in its various amusing time travel locations and the weird and wonderful characters you meet along the way. This is a prime example of where [i]\"it's all about the journey, not the destination.\"[/i]\n\n\n[h1]Yays![/h1]\n\n+ Vibrant, colourful, hi-res cartoon-style graphics.\n+ Well-designed rooms, locations and scenery.\n+ Fully voiced, with good voice acting for the most part. (The guy who plays Dr Fred is awesome.)\n+ Interesting, memorable characters.\n+ Fun, amusing story.\n+ Wacky humour.\n+ Clear goals.\n+ Cool easter eggs. (Under \"achievements\".)\n+ Contains a free game ([i]Maniac Mansion[/i])!\n+ Puzzles are mostly enjoyable and require some creative thinking.\n+ Many gameplay hours.\n+ Trading cards.\n\n[h1]Nays.[/h1]\n\n- [url=steamcommunity.com/app/388210/discussions/0/392184522713202518/]Audio starts stuttering[/url] after a while, due to memory problems.\n- Achievements remain hidden, even after the game is completed, so you can't see what you're missing.\n- Some puzzles have illogical or nonsensical solutions.\n- Bugs: e.g. When looking at one of the items, Laverne's voice sounds when Bernard speaks.\n- No mouse command to fast-forward dialogue; instead, you have to press \".\" which is really inconvenient, especially when the whole point of a point-n-click game is to [i]not[/i] have to use your keyboard!\n- Some counter-intuitive puzzle set-ups: E.g. For the videotape puzzle, a button which looks like the \"STOP\" button, is actually the \"RECORD\" button. Anyone who's ever used a VCR or tape recorder would know that the square symbol denotes \"STOP\", while the round button denotes \"RECORD\". \n- Hoagie's periodic belches sound absolutely disgusting!\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nThis was a hugely enjoyable experience from start to finish. Though the nostalgia factor played a part in my case, even if you've never heard of the [i]Maniac Mansion[/i] series, as long as you count yourself a point-n-click adventure game fan, this is a must-play because it just gets so many things right. Add to that the timeless plot and wacky characters, and you have yourself a game that will play just as fresh & new decades down the road.\n\n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [td][u]Disclaimer:[/u] [i]Game played for free, with many thanks to my dear friend [url=steamcommunity.com/id/kflorence]KFlo[/url]. :)[/i][/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n- [b]My playtime:[/b] 14.5h (based on Steam, 100% achievement)\n[b]Grindy Achievement(s):[/b] Yes (1+ achievement).\n[b]Optional Achievement(s):[/b] Yes (33 achievements).\n[b]Difficult Achievement(s):[/b] No.\n\n[h1]Intro[/h1]\nYou wake up in a place you don't recognize. Greeted by a traffic light, you tried to remember what was happening. It turns out that you have a unique ability: reading an object's memory.

People who have problems with flashing lights should avoid this game since the game isn't as good as it is with some options turned off.[/i]\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1]In-Depth Review[/h1]\n\n[h3]Visuals[/h3]\nThe developer spends a lot of effort crafting beautiful, quality cutscenes. Some scenes show the beauty of the night sky while others show what the main character is feeling from close range. Food images look so carefully made that I couldn't believe that it was a pixelated image at first. Every scene does a good job in supporting the story, combined with the relaxing music that is running in the background.\n\nBlurry effects are applied on the screen, whether it's just to make a certain area stand out or create a cool-looking effect for the cutscenes. The game relies on a lot of transitions in its cutscenes, some can leave you shocked with the inverted images and flashes of red colors at intense moments. People that have problems with these can soften the red color in the option with the downside of making the scene to be less effective. Moreover, since the option affects all red colors in the game, some scenes will look weird with the faded color.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441881358 \n\n[h3]Story[/h3]\nThe story is a relaxing one, set in a place where people are helpful and empathetic to your actions. Every character gives a positive vibe through their attitude and kindness, supporting you whenever you are down or helping you to enjoy the moment. Reading the interaction between characters warm my heart, especially when accompanied by the relaxing music that is playing in the background.\n\nThe storytelling is wonderfully done with the combination of visuals and music to let you drown in the story. Sometimes, an intense moment kicks in, changing the scenery into one full of effects and transitions. The fast-paced music also helps to set the mood with its upbeat tone, increasing the intensity. The ending is told in a similar manner, although instead of an intense moment, it crafts a touching scene instead that is fit for an ending. Some people will find a small part of the ending not to make any sense, although luckily, it won't affect the overall experience.\n\n[h3]The Game[/h3]\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nThe game is focused on reading memories of an object to progress. Your hidden ability to read an object's memory by touching it will help you to solve various tasks, ranging from looking a lost object to finding a hidden area. There are some limitations though - some objects have no memories that you can read while other objects can't be interacted with until they are discovered. Fortunately, they are quite easy to discover as long as you spam the space button and/or pay attention to the dialogues.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441881785 \n\n[b]Puzzles and Minigames[/b]\nThe rest of the gameplay is focused on the usual adventure games where you have to pick up items and use them to pass through the area. Most problems that you will have to solve has the same theme as the building you are in. It's nice to see how puzzles are related to the corresponding area while still being unique at the same time.\n\nMost puzzles and minigames are easy to solve except for a select few. I found the last one to be the trickiest because not only does it cover a huge area, but it also requires you to use the mechanic from a previous area, something which never happened in other puzzles. It's still easy to solve as long as you are attentive enough, but if you happen to get stuck, the game offers subtle hints in the form of memories that you can read.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441883206 \n\n[b]Length and Replayability[/b]\nI finished the game in 9.7h after experiencing all the bad endings. Although the game only offers one manual save slot, it has an extra checkpoint slot that you can load before the story branches off. A hidden secret can also be found after you finished the game, which might take a long time to find due to its randomness. I found it to be a waste of time though, especially since there isn't much that you can learn from the secret. You'll also be left with more questions than answers, giving more reason not to look for them unless if you are an achievement hunter or the curious type.\n\n[b]Problems[/b]\nDespite the game requires you to restart the game several times, you can't skip the cutscenes. Some parts of the game will lead you to a bad ending and the unskippable cutscenes can take a significant amount of time if you don't know how to bypass it. Moreover, checkpoints tend to be placed minutes before the story branches off, wasting more of your time. Lastly, the game isn't very clear whenever it autosaves your game. I had to save manually whenever I took a break from the game because of this.\n\n[h1]Specs[/h1]\nIntel Core i5-9300H 2.40GHz, 8GB RAM, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nThe game has a lot of elements that complement each other. The nice-looking visuals, the calm and relaxing music that can heat up in intense moments, the superb effect - everything blends well to make the story stands out. The detailed cutscenes are done well to capture the emotion that can't be portrayed with a simple portrait and character animation, while portraits are expressive enough to handle simple expressions. The game is designed with quality in mind and although it can be slow sometimes, the relaxing music helps you to savor the moment.\n\n[quote]This game was reviewed with a key provided by the developer for free through [url=https://discord.gg/xc22zZP]Reviewers' Paradise[/url], a group that connects both developers and reviewers in one place[/quote]\n\n[quote]Visit SaveOrQuit.com for detailed game reviews, posted daily![/quote]\n- No additional account, no unnecessary launcher, no denuvo, no epic exclusivity, no microtransactions, just a video game as it always should be..\n- I bought the game and the mechanics are fun! The battle system is super impactful and just FEELS fun. It really gives you a sense of satisfaction. And it has interesting elements that really every game should have... but the UI sucks, the classes are genderlocked, and there are so many systems going on at once it's annoying. Like something as simple as a constant notification in the middle of the screen of some other person or random guild you know nothing about doing quests or getting skill points. It's a fun game, but has WAAAY too many minor (except genderlocked classes. Genderlock is never a minor thing) problems that just add up making it annoying to play\n- Before you play this, make sure you play these games in order. That is:\n- To the moon\n- Finding Paradise\n- Imposter factory.\n\nAs for this game, it is another gorgeous story that takes you on a journey into the realm of memories. I encourage you to play these games blindly and to read nothing about the story because that's what I did, and I was surely surprised and mindblown. As for the ending of this game, I am still processing it to this day!\n\nI can't wait to play the next game by Freebird Games.\n- Smooth beats, sick moves.\n\nOlliOlli was the best endless runner/rock hard skateboard move combo game I'd played in months. Well, the best just got better!\n\nWhy's it better? Polish, nollies, the aforementioned beats and some added smoothing.\n\nRad.\n- As i previously stated, i was going to play through metro fully and i have done so, so here is my update to this review. \nThis game is not the best selling triple A game in the world and it may have some bugs (like a table that wasnt solid or the objects in that room lol) however it is a decent game. the story is decent and the characters voices are way off but they sorta make up for it with their personalities. \n\nExploration in this game is by far one of the most interesting in my opinion and the way your character acts in the enviroment makes it more interesting aswell, for example wiping your visor when it gets dirty (wasnt that helpful for me in my play through but it was a nice touch) and your visor taking damage in combat adds to the immersive feel of this wasteland/paradise almost. Scavenging weapons and parts and combining them to make better equipment is quite intriguing and quick to do if you can find the parts. \n\nat the end of the day my final review of this is its a good game i would play it again even if it is a bit clunky sometimes (atleast it was for me lmao)\n\n\n\n\n\nOh and hopefully my punctuation is good enough so no one passes out this time lmao\n- Simply fantastic. Probably the best TRUE RPG I've ever played. Your choices matter, dialogue options matter, the order in which you do things matter, even such small things such as the items you hold in your hand matter. Every build is viable, go heavy in Physical stats and you'll have difficulty solving things Logically, but maybe you can brute force your way through something. Go heavy in Logic and you'll be weak in a one-to-one fight, but maybe you'll be so fast to figure things out that it'll never come to that. You'll see things that the dim-witted brute with high Physical didn't. Failure is encouraged, there are many routes in the game you cannot open without failing something else first.\n\nA true combat system does not exist. At all. Physical altercations are decided through dice rolls based on how you've built your character. And virtually all of them are optional. I like this decision a lot. I've always found it immersion-breaking in RPGs when you're just running around the countryside, killing every bandit or animal that comes your way. This one keeps fights realistic with REAL consequences depending how things go.\n\nBarring having to restart my game once due to a bug (quicksave often, autosaves are few), the game had no major technical issues. There was a single point in the game where a vital skill check required a specific skill to be built, and I'm not sure if there were any alternate routes. I couldn't find any, just had to savescum the check. Aside from that, you have options as to how to approach everything. I'm not sure if that was an oversight or if I just missed something.\n\nCan't go into the story much without spoilers (and you DON'T want it spoiled, it's great.) But it's very well-written and even hilarious at some points. But don't be fooled, it's not a comedy game. It tackles very serious topics such as Fascism, Communism, Mental Illness, Addiction, and many other things.\n\nOverall an amazing RPG experience that I cannot recommend enough. Will definitely play through this several times to see how things go with different builds. Highly suggest you purchase this if you have any interest.\n- You play as a girl dashing through enemies by pressing 2 buttons. That's literally it. Each stage is the length of a song and as you play more you'll unlock more songs. \n\n\nI highly recommend this game if you're a 5 year old who can be easily entertained.\n- It's hard to recommend Spelunky 2. Not because it is a bad game, but because it can be frustrating. As with most roguelikes, dying means going back to the beginning. In Spelunky however, nothing carries over to future runs. All you get to bring in to your next run is your own experience and knowledge; And when half the things in the game kill you instantly or stunlock you to death, having a great run end in a quick death can be damaging to one's will.\n\nThankfully, your own experiences count a great deal towards your progress. Most hazards and enemies in Spelunky 2 have a very simple and predictable behaviour. But keeping track of everything on the screen is still a challenge. Enemies and traps will also work together (or against each other) and still bring your demise somehow. Either by bumping your helplessly stunned body into other enemies and traps, or enemies having their own flaming corpse launched towards you and your flammable jetpack. It's actually quite funny sometimes. A good deal of entertainment can be had recording your own amazingly nonsensical deaths.\n\nSpelunky 2 improves upon Spelunky HD's gameplay by adding split paths, which allow for more variety and decision-making in your runs while staying true to the feeling and style of previous entries. It also adds a back layer to each level, allowing for more secrets to be kept. After successfully completing your first run, you can try to discover these secrets and find hidden bosses and areas and even different endings!\n\nAnyway, you might enjoy the game if you're a masochist or something.\n- I played the demo and instantly became enamored. The mix of Slay the Spire-style deck-building with elements of the ship combat from FTL: Faster Than Light is an absolutely fascinating mix, and the \"single-axis\" movement system adds a whole extra layer that I've never seen in anything except the Mega Man: Battle Network series.\n\nI bought the full game within the first hour of being available. After having played for nearly 4 hours at the time of writing, my opinion hasn't changed in the slightest. I already love what's available and so far I feel like I've barely scratched the surface.\n\nI can't wait to see what awaits in the future for this awesome title.\n\nEDIT: As a small addition, I will say: I beat my very first run, which is set to the lowest difficulty (Normal). I jumped up to Hard to try to unlock a new ship, and I haven't been able to beat a run since then. It's probably just that I'm bad, all things considered, but be aware that the changes made with difficulty increases are probably more impactful than they may seem.\n\nAlso I wanna say to the devs: thank you for launching the game with mod support and working on making it easier! But also please look into getting Steam Workshop support if you can!\n- Pros:\n> Decent selection of interior desing elements\n> Uncommon but interesting gameplay idea if you're into interior design and building\n> Fair price for amount of activities you get in base game\n> Gameplay leght\n> Regural updates\n\nCons:\n> You can't change location of windows in the house - some are placed in awkward places thus creating decent rooms becomes difficult\n> Game optimisation is questionable for such graphics  -  with RX vega 56 I barely get 60 fps \n> No replayability on same save file - once you sell property you cannot do it again\n> Once property is sold there's only some screenshots but no actual way to look around again\n> No steam workshop or mods\n\nIdeas for possible future updates:\n> Add floor plan design feature - building and demolishing walls 10 times is frustrating\n> Add ability to build custom houses and change locations of windows\n> Add ability to enter sold properties\n> Increase game performance\n\nDLCs:\n> HGTV DLC adds moderate amount of additional jobs\n> Garden DLC adds alot of activities outside the house but is a bit buggy. In my opinion some features should be in base game\n- Katana ZERO? More like, Katana ZERO CONCLUSION.\n\nI had too high expectation on this game, I thought it was going to be Hotline Miami but better.\nIn the end I still prefer Hotline Miami, specifically Hotline Miami 2.\n\nOne thing I dislike is the lack of combo scoring system. \nIt's a good way to make the players act fast and execute their actions flawlessly, instead the game only has a timer bar that never runs out as a way to motivate the player to go fast.\n\nI am aware how \"pointless\" game scores are.\nBut seeing a number going up feels good.\n\nWhat happens when you kill an enemy in Hotline Miami?\n - You get to see a number pops out, and the score goes up indicating that you are doing good!\n - Satisfying bloody hit sound.\n - Throbbing light on the edge of the map.\n - Randomized dead sprite of the enemy, sometimes they get dismembered depending on the weapon.\n\nIn Katana ZERO you'd get :\n - A \"fwoob\" sound.\n - A same dying animation of the enemy getting knocked and bleed to death. Instead of getting decapitated or something.\n - Flashy slash effect.\n\nAt one point I wondered on why should I even bother killing the enemies when it didn't reward me with anything in the room with a minecart. \nWhen having the enemy being killed by the minecart or the player makes no difference.\n\n[spoiler]More like Katana ZERO REWARD. I think this is it, exactly why I am disappointed by it. Imagine playing soulsbornekiro or Hollow Knight without earning any kind of currency??? Killing the enemies would feel pointless.[/spoiler]\n\nIt's basically way more fun and rewarding to kill an enemy in Hotline Miami than Katana ZERO.\n\nThen there are other stuff like...\nUnfun stealth gameplay. \nRollspamming without consequence.\nBeing able to endlessly doing a mid air attack without having to touch the ground first.\n\nThere are also waaaay too many checkpoints in my opinion, it encouraged me to just brute force everything with roll spamming without having to worry about starting over.\nThe rooms could've been a bit bigger and longer. But also less room, quality over quantity.\n\nAnd finally, the story.\nI was intrigued by it but it just ended abruptly with a \"To be continued\".\nIt's like they only wrote 50% of it then slapped a \"To be continued\" and called it a day.\nThe game seems to rely heavily on \"mentioning stuff off screen that player will never get to see\" to tease the player.\nI already knew that the game is going to be short, but I didn't expect it to be this disappointing. \n\nIt's not a bad game, I just had the wrong expectation.\n\nI might change it to positive if I was satisfied by the DLC.\nOr maybe after beating the hard mode, I heard it's more fun.\n- This game is far away in another galaxy from being anything but a 3/10 in my book. \nGame consists of a tack on level system with a few skills, corny jokes that make you cringe, copy paste worlds with sliding on ice, mud, or leaves depending on the world your on with vines to climb certain walls again....depending on the world your on, no dismemberment except on animals and main characters. Further all planets feel the same and after quite a few hours in the game I struggle to continue playing because of the cut and dry gameplay to where you will fight a couple animals, do some very linear parkour, then do a puzzle that will most likely include a sphere that you need to put into said location to unlock a door as such. graphics are eh..and I have to say the battlefront 2 campaign had more thought than this garbage. save your money and don't buy this\n- So um, I don't usually write reviews like this or much at all really. I mostly make unfunny jokes and call it a review or something super generic. I guess I'll just write whats on my mind.\n\nI really liked this game.\nI felt like I was a kid again playing Super Mario 64.\nSometimes I get tired of shooting guns. Or slashing fantasy monsters with some shiny sword. Or saving the magic land from evil. Or using hyper combos I never remember. Or collecting resources to build a quirky town. Or time managing some distant farm. Or driving some tricked out vehicles. Or investing in status points to make super strong characters. Or following a long and convoluted plot with crazy lore.\n\nSometimes I just wanna run and jump around while I pick up some cool looking stuff.\nI, uh, had a lot fun playing this game. \nThanks.\n- This game is great and is worth the cost, I have not tried it in VR yet but I imagine it's great....I have a slight urge to join the US military all of a sudden...\n- i would recomend it because the physics are great, the game has 8 or 9 level packs (i dont know if there will be a 9th because there are 7 at the time of this review) the units are diverse, there are a lot of secret units to find and i dont know for the final boss because the most expensive unit artimis isnt a good final boss like the dark pesant in the alphas but i hope that the games final boss unit is actually hard to kill and requires more than 7 archers because that wasnt hard or anything hopefully they will make the most expensive unit actually overpowered and unballanced because that would be a great final boss, the sandbox mode is great i like the custom campains , the custom units arent out yet so i cant say anything about that over all this game is worth the money and if its near a sale time like a few days away from a sale then get it on sale if not then just get it you wont regret it and if it lage turn off all the graphics settings\n- I have played OSU!, Muse Dash and stepmania plenty and I gotta say that this does not feel like a rhythm game at all. The premise of matching the shape of the map to music sounds interesting but some of the songs I feel like are not mapped out correctly. Or in general this game relies less on music cues and more on visual cues? It felt like maps are only 50% related to the song and you have to ignore what you hear because the map randomly demands patterns that have no matching audio equivalent and everything becomes pure visual memorization.\n- Oh, that The Resident Evil (The RE)… One of the best stories in the gaming industry! The Capcom is well done that decided to remake games. Many players criticize The RE3, but I understand them, the game is quite short, there are no horror elements in the game. But the game has become easier, for example, a knife does not wear out. The players did not forget to criticize the Nemesis too, saying that there is no element of surprise and persecution, and there’s no sense of the constant presence of someone, who can mutilate you. The Nemesis means in English as “a good script”. However, the game creators tried to convey the atmosphere of The RE and the horror that the doomed city is filled with. Well-chosen actors, excellent voice acting, correctly conveyed the atmosphere of the city. I would add more moving elements on the destroyed streets of the city, like people or zombies\nTotal score: 8.5/10\n- With almost 300 hours of Destiny 2 (D2) back on Battle.net (the Blizzard launcher), let me give this perspective/advice for new players, specifically with regards for the F2P offering that is Destiny 2: New Light, with a few more holistic thoughts sprinkled throughout:\n\nThis overall game is very good. It doesn't always live up to its promise (the first mission of every campaign is always the most polished thing aside from the raids/dungeons), but when it does, it [b]really[/b] shines.\n\nThe gunplay is unrivaled. The visual/audio feedback is great, the handling feels really good, and enemies really pop when you take them out. Expect nothing less from the studio that brought us grunt birthday parties.\n\nThe game is better in a fireteam. Now that the base game is F2P [though with considerably less content than it used to be/I would like], this should be easier than ever for most activities. That said, a huge majority of my playtime was done solo. It can get tricky at times (\"Darkness Zones\" in certain missions prevent respawning but allow for revives, so solo players have a distinct disadvantage there). \n\nWith that said, dungeons (currently 'The Shattered Throne', 'Pit of Heresy', 'Prophecy' which is free to all players, 'Grasp of Avarice', 'Duality', and 'Spire of the Watcher') and raids (\"Last Wish\" from Forsaken, \"Garden of Salvation\" from Shadowkeep, \"The Deep Stone Crypt\" from Beyond Light, 'Vow of the Disciple' from Witch Queen, as well as 'Vault of Glass' and 'King's Fall' from D1 - both of which are both free to all players) are best experienced with a team, so don't shy away from LFG group-finder options like the Discord, official app, or any number of other sites (just make sure to accurately describe your experience, level, and gear. 'Tis only polite). \n\nOf the matchmade multiplayer offerings, I enjoy Gambit (PvPvE, reminds me of the Black Ops Zombies 4z4 mode done right), jump into the occasional Strike (PvE, matchmade fireteams running campaign-like missions), and have no interest in Crucible (PvP, it's fine I guess, but I've never liked PvP that's dependent in large part on personal progression - especially in the competitive modes like Trials of Osiris and Iron Banner)\n\nDon't be afraid to ignore content - this is absolutely the kind of game where you can set your own goals. Want a specific exotic gun? Look up where it drops and focus on grinding that content. Want a specific roll on a random roll gun? Find the best possible farming (or crafting) method and go to town. Chase down some of the exotic questions that the game clutters up your quest page with, or just goof around doing things that you find fun while absolutely ignoring all signposts.\n\nSome stuff just won't be explained in game. It's not as bad as Warframe (much less need for a wiki) but some things are still obscured. Feel free to look up Xur (exotic weapon vendor who visits on weekends) and other hidden exotics tied to specific activities, lost sectors, patrol locations, or quest chains.\n\nFor anything that you can't easily find online - reach out and find a sherpa. The community for this game tends to be pretty great, and enough of us have spent enough time leaning specific parts of it (e.g. raids) or just mechanics in general (\"What are random rolls? Which do I keep?\") that we'd be happy to jump onto discord (there are a bunch for PC, just check out the subreddit sidebar linked below) and answer any and all questions you may have. \n\nThe fact that a representative chunk of this game is free makes this the perfect time to dip your toes in without emptying out your wallet. Any other questions about this game as a product (\"Should I pay for DLC? Is Eververse worth it?\") should absolutely be researched elsewhere.\n\nIf you're looking for a place to start with the F2P content, finish the intro missions in the Cosmodrome. New and returning players are semi-regularly upgraded to a new light level floor, but means that you can miss out on the \"learning the ropes\" parts of the game that come with working your way through the New Light quest chain or unlocking different subclasses. [As of Beyond Light, all of the campaign content through Forsaken are not currently accessible. Release order was Red War (launch campaign) > Forsaken > Shadowkeep > Beyond Light > Witch Queen, followed by the upcoming expansions Lightfall > Final Shape.]\n\nEyes up, guardian.\n\nFootnotes for people yelling at me in the comments:\n-All of this is my opinion. Feel free to hold your own and disagree with mine.\n-I generally enjoy grinding, looter shooters, FPS's, and weird sci-fi space magic. Halo, Borderlands, Warframe, and CoD Zombies are some of my most-played and favorite games.\n-As far as I can tell, anything that is not strictly subjective in the above is factually correct [as of Season of Plunder, with updates noted throughout. This game changes quite a bit over time, so make sure to do your own research before spending money on it]. If I've missed something, feel free to point it out in the comments and I'll do my best to update this periodically. \n-This review previously made mention of both content vaulting and weapon sunsetting. These practices have both been discontinued as of Season of Plunder. However, it is not clear at this if or when power capped or vaulted may return/be uncapped, if ever.\n\n-----------------\nTL:DR: It's good. Not perfect, but really good. And since it's free, you can get a really good sense of if this game is for you without paying for any of it. You can play almost any activity solo pretty easily except for a handful of endgame activities. If you're overwhelmed at first, just play through the Cosmodrome missions while you get your feet under you, or ask a veteran player for help.\n-----------------\n\nSites to use (List was compiled at Shadowkeep launch, but most of it should still be relevant/useful)\n\n    \nBeginner's Guide (Current as of Beyond Light) - https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/49007\n\nThe DTG Subreddit - /r/DestinyTheGame on Reddit - https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/\n\nDestiny Item Manager (mange your inventory from your browser even while in-game, essential to avoid unneeded trips back to the tower) - app.destinyitemmanager.com\n\nDestiny 2 Checklist (Lists out everything to do as well as when it resets in-game) - www.d2checklist.com/\n\nLight gg (Database of in-game items, useful for looking up random rolls) - https://www.light.gg/\n\nBraytech org (Lots of overlapping features, but I really like their maps) - braytech.org/\n\nDatto (Destiny Youtuber / 24:02 Raider who posts lots of useful/educational content, including exotic guides) - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkmAjbIecTIjTQctolYeuDw\n\nIf you've played D2 on another system, check out the CrossSave page (https://www.bungie.net/7/en/crosssave) on the Bungie net official site respectively to get all of your content and progression moved over to Steam.\n\nStory Recap up through Shadowkeep (Spoilers Destiny 1 / D1, and D2, obviously) (My name is Byf on YouTube: The Complete Story of Destiny!

Not a bad game by any means, has the same charm as the original S.K., but why pay for it here if you can get it free with the original (now called Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove).\n\n- The best game ever made by Valve. Great story, beautiful dialogues with funny jokes, interesting puzzles, perfect atmosphere and a lot of fun in co-op with friends. You made a great work, Valve, and thank You for this absolute masterpiece.\n10/10.\n- If you want to cut your teeth on the Final Boss of box-pushing puzzle games, then have I got the game for you.\n\nRight out of the gate SSR offers a somewhat uneven mix of real head-scratchers and what I can only describe as pity puzzles, but quickly reveals itself to be the sort of puzzler that mandates particularly extensive sessions of staring at the seemingly inconsequential number of tiles onscreen and poking experimentally at them until something starts to click. This demands a little more patience than I ordinarily have, but I was starting to appreciate the design as I acclimatized to it.\n\nThen I arrived at The Great Tower level (in only the second subsection of the overworld), which all at once foists about 4 times more pieces on you than you've dealt with previously, while simultaneously introducing a Z-axis and the concept of using pieces as platforms mid-puzzle.\n\nSSR does have a well-executed and forgiving Undo function with basically unlimited storage which is a great thing to have up until the time spent rewinding would outweigh the time spent to simply restart the puzzle and do over; the only way it could be made practical on a level that large would be if you had a full-on timeline scrubber like in the rerelease of Duke Nukem 3D.\n\nThere's patience, there's logic, and then there's [b]this.[/b] I play puzzle games to try and [i]relieve[/i] stress, not the other way round. It's a solid design, and I'd probably recommend it to the REALLY die-hard logicians and puzzle fanatics. To the sort like me who enjoy puzzles but prefer there to be some sort of ceiling to their complexity, Gaben help you if you're going to try and soldier through this thing. I would even call Infinifactory a lot more accessible than this is.\n- Holy crap.\n\nPowerful.\n\nThis game explores some serious life issues: Abuse. The pain of childhood, and of parenthood. Manhood and womanhood. Strength. Loss.\n\nThis game had me near crying at several points. The story is freaking powerful. It's also remarkably well written, and downright hilarious at times. \n\nAnd the gameplay? \n\nIt's fun enough that I want to play through it again right after beating it. This turn-based RPG is sometimes brutally difficult, in part because it slaps many old-school conventions in the face (e.g., sleeping can be dangerous). Battles are challenging. Tactical thinking is essential since many enemies are VERY dangerous and you're frequently outnumbered. I really applaud the AI as it keeps you on your toes. \n\nThe game doesn't hold your hand. There is no map, compass, or any attempt to make navigation easier. You just have to remember your way around, though there are plenty of memorable environments. \n\nCharacters will force you to make decisions with lasting consequences. There are dozens of hard choices to make along the journey, which brings me to another topic the game explores: decision. Will you save your friends, or your stuff? I got very attached to the buddies I picked up, only to have them devoured by a mutant, or bail on me when I least expected it. You just never know what you'll face, nor what to choose. Thinking back to many of those times, I don't know what I should have done. All the options sucked. \n\nBut I can't help asking myself, \"Did I make the right choice?\" \n\nHighly recommended.\n- [h1]I enjoyed the game. Negative reviews can be more helpful though. One negative review can't hurt.[/h1]\n\nI'll keep the pros short:\n - Stress reliever\n - You can kill people in interesting ways\n - Mods can enhance this experience further\n\nCons:\n\n - The performance is pretty shit, so you will probably have to play with lower simulation settings, which aren't that good. Duh.\n\n - The base game is bland. Game is driven entirely by the workshop and your ability to create your own contraptions. Not a problem for me, maybe a problem for someone else.\n\n - The game can get boring pretty quickly because the loop is repetitive: spawn human, kill, repeat. This is coming from someone with over 400 hours played.\n\n - Not really game related, but if you don't like sticking around in communities that are often toxic, childish, annoying and the members are often kids or younger teens [spoiler](I would name a few examples but I feel like angering more than 1 fandom is a death sentence)[/spoiler], then avoid the community and stay away as far as possible and just grab your mods and run. Avoid the workshop comment sections, or just a lot of stuff in the workshop, the community tab, etc. It's just full of self-entitled kids who think they're hot shit.\n\n- Not sure how true this is nowadays, but some things on the workshop are just like farm spam, meaning the trending page was often filled with spam.\n\nRead the comments for anything I possibly missed to add but someone else mentioned.\n\nIn short:\nBuy the game if you like violence and looking like a crazy person that people wanna avoid from fear. It's pretty cool.\nDon't buy it if you aren't interested in that.\n\n[spoiler]The only reason I enabled comments is to possibly show how correct the community point is.[/spoiler]\n- Playing this game instantly brought back memories of me playing TMNT, Battletoads, Double Dragon, and Streets of Rage, with my little brother on the NES and Sega Genesis in the early 90s. Luckily this game doesn’t feature TMNT’s ridiculous water level or Battletoads' sadistic peed bike level. The graphics are perfect, the controls are great, the soundtrack is awesome (especially the Wu-Tang stage, and the Shredder stage), and the levels and overworld map are fun to navigate. I’ve played through the story mode with all 7 characters and have played through the arcade mode multiple times solo and many times in multiplayer and I’ve enjoyed every bit of it. This game is so much fun.\n\nThere are a few things I wish existed though. I wish there were more playable characters. I wish that you did not lose your 7 character’s progress in story mode when you start a new game. I wish you could see the difficulty level of the online arcade game you are joining. I wish there were cumulative stats you could see for arcade and story mode that showed the number of times you completed a stage, how many enemies you knocked out, objects you’ve destroyed, stage times, combo streaks, times taunted, etc. I wish you could create your own turtle and assigned moves, specials, jumps, taunts, and colors.\n- Getting 100% was... very fun in this cute metroid-vania where you basically act as your own level designer.\n\napproximate amount of time to 100%: 20-30 Hours\nEstimated achievement difficulty: 5/10\nMinimum number of playthroughs needed: One (Most likely 2 if you go in blind)\nMultiplayer achievements: No.\nMissable achievements: Yes. Sequence Break, \nPoint of no return: No. After the game's ending you can return and explore.\nGrinding Achievements:  No.\nDLC-Only achievements: No.\nTime-gated achievements: No.\nSpeed-run achievements: Yes. 4 hour Speed run (and another 4 hour Speedrun but with 100% Secrets/gold etc...)\nRNG-achievements: No.\nIs there a good guide available: I recommend Demajen's Guide on steam with the super usefull map.\nDoes difficulty affect achievements: Yes, Medium recommended. (There's also a 0 death achievement)\nFirst achievement unlock: Defeat the first boss in the tutorial temple.\n\n* I can't remember how this game ended up in my account (might have been some promotional giveaway...) but I'm so glad it did.\n\nThis game has some of the best Quality of life I've seen. It's extremely enjoyable and the 100% journey is challenging but not too problematic. Wholeheartedly recommend this one.\n- I read the negative reviews and backlash against DoubleFine, but I thought that I would be OK even if the game had some bugs and wasn't quite finished, so I picked it up anyway. That was a mistake.\n\nThe game is not just unfinished, its in an Alpha state. Which is sad, because I definetly would enjoy the game if it was done. As it is, the game is entertaining for a couple hours, then quickly grows tiresome and frustrating. The bugs are not crippling, but taken as a whole they represent a game that is very unbalanced and grates on you over time. \n\nIf DF-9 ever hits the $5 pile, pick it up. otherwise pass.\n- Do I really have to write this review? I am just one in thousands of people who wrote a positive reveiw for Garry's Mod. Chances are, this review will never convince someone to buy Garry's Mod. It'll just be lost in the 100,000 positive reviews out there. Well, here I go anyway.\n\n\"Where do I start?\" This is the question asked by anyone playing Gmod for their first time. It's also my question that I ask about this review I am writing. Hmm...\n\n_The gameplay...the gameplay...hmm... Well, there's singleplayer sandbox. You can do...uh, whatever you want really. Just addon a few addons, and you can be entertained for hours. Battle NPCs, make cool scenes for cool screenshots, explore maps, be a superhero (spiderman addon!), and much, much, much, much- you get my point, right? Almost all content is user-generated. Make your own content! Multiplayer. In Multiplayer Gmod you can roleplay. I'm talking normal RP (DarkRP), Military RP, Star Wars RP, etc, etc. In multiplayer Gmod, you can battle, prophunt (yay), hide 'n seek, and much, much, more.\n\n_Graphics? I'll rate the graphics...drumroll please... 7/10. This game is and older game. Came out in 2006. I guess the graphics are good for 2006, and people enjoy the game and don't complain much about the graphics, but I'm not gonna lie, they are outdated and look old. It's not 2006 anymore.\n\n_Hear the bullets flying. The zombies growling. The people chatting. The boxes jumping... The sound in this game is great! Every sound is loud and clear, and there are a varitey of sounds.\n\n_Play this game. Play it again. Play it some more. Play some now, and play some later. Play it over and over. Play it as long as you want.\n\n_My Personal opinion. Get this game. Now. Get Gmod on sale or not. I'm not gonna stop playing it for a while and I'm already at 50+ hours of playtime. I love this game! WAIT! Before you go and buy this, then you wonder why there are all the missing maps and errors in most games, get Counter Strike: Source, so ALL the textures are supported. You need it to play MOST multiplayer games.\n\n\nGameplay: 9/10\nGraphics: 7/10\nStory: N/A\nSound: 8/10\nReplayability: 10/10\n\nOverall 8.5\n\nEven though, this is one positive review on Garry's Mod, out of the thousands of positive reviews that have been submitted Garry's Mod, I hope this one convinces you to buy... Gmod\n\n-Star_Hawk_\n- I was excited to play this after playing Persona 5 and Persona 5 Royal (my introductions to the series) to death.  This game was raved about and I thought, if it's more of the same then this should be great...\n\nThe major problem I have with this game is that it's so painfully obvious that it's a game made 13 years ago.  It's not a bad game, the look and feel of the Persona series is there and the characters are interesting etc.  But at the same time whenever I played this game, I just wanted to go back and play P5R instead.  Everything is just better in P5R.  The dungeons for example, the difference is night and day.  P5R's dungeons have so much more life to them, and look so much better.  Most of the environments in this game look like dull coloured LEGO sets put together.  It looks like it was originally on a handheld console (despite the remaster).  The other major example is the voice acting.  My god, some of the voice acting in 4G is on par with some of the worst Square Enix efforts.  Audio balancing is terrible as well.  And then there's the subjective stuff.  I personally much prefer P5R's soundtrack over this one, aside from maybe a couple of songs that were cool.  The setting of Tokyo is much more interesting and dynamic than this hokey town in the middle of nowhere.  The characters themselves I found much more engaging in 5R.  This was particularly helped by the quality of voice acting.  I think \n\nI'm glad that people are able to experience this game again on a more available platform.  I think potentially if I had played this back when it was released, I would probably have a different opinion of this game.  If you like Persona games and can look beyond what's dated badly, then the core game is very much the same.  If you were a fan already, this is a quality refresh to the game.  However, if you're like me and experienced the future of this series before playing this, I dont recommend it.  P5R provides the same gameplay but adds so much more.  It's a shame we cannot get that game on Steam instead.\n- My god.. Capcom did it. They saved the franchise. I'm honestly shocked. \n\nWhen the first teaser dropped I thought for sure this would just be a P.T. copy which I was sort of okay with. Turns out I was wrong. This is a classic Resident Evil game. Like, RE1 classic. Complete with puzzle solving, INVENTORY MANAGEMENT, and tense stressful boss encounters. The game brings back the storage box system even! I can't stress enough how amazing this game is as a long time RE fan. If you're one too, do yourself a favor and pull the trigger on this one. Best game since RE4.... May even be better.\n- Overall, as a single player game Wargroove 2 is a tremendous improvement over the first game. The campaign is well designed and engaging, the writing is much improved and overall the gameplay is fun. The new roguelike conquest mode is a much more entertaining side thing than the godawful Arcade in 1, as well.\n\nAs a primary single player game, I hated Wargroove 1, and I can say that 2 has turned my opinion around - this game is fun, I finished the campaign and craved more, which is all you can really say! The only thing I really missed from 1 was the Puzzle mode, but maybe it'll show up in a future update? Who knows.\n\nThe major downsides is that the user interface is still the same terrible user interface that WG1 had without significant improvements, and the AI is still absolutely atrocious so playing even Vs maps against the AI is going to be pretty dull, but that hasn't changed from the first game. The soundtrack is not quite as catchy either.\n\nBut unlike WG1, I enjoyed my time with WG2 in spite of these shortcomings, and if you ever have a choice between the two, skip WG1 and just go straight into WG2.\n- If you played the OG this is basically the same but with a few added side stories you can unlock as you complete different routes in the game. The extra dlc maybe would take you a bit over an hour to complete all of them if you speed through it, but does not have any optional dialogue so it's more of just some lore and extra character interactions. Still pretty solid dlc if you are a fan and want a little bit of extra stuff :)\n- You had me at creating adventure log, well actually no, at the starting song perhaps. How many years have I been waiting for full fledge, non portable DQ since DQVIII in PS2 ?\n\nThis PC port is a great one, neat and very beautiful. I was playing at 4k/~30fps and since my GPU is not fast enough I switched to 1440p/~50-60fps instead. I wish more and more JRPGs to do PC concurrent launch like this one. A day later I switched back to 4k and change internal resolution to 80% then it was pretty much perfect.\n\n- You can choose default A/B button.\n- You can choose resolution and 30/60 FPS mode. There is a way to unlock 60+ FPS for gaming monitors, google it.\n- You can invert cameras both ways.\n- You can choose classic battle mode.\n- You can press L3 and enjoy the view.\n- Load time is non-existence with SSD.\n- Ultra Widescreen is NOT supported. Waiting for mods at the moment.\n- Keyboard and Mouse is fine but playing with controller is wayy better.\n- Fully customisable keys / controllers.\n- Story synopsys at game loading screen.\n- Silent Protagonist.\n- Full voice cutscenes.\n- Auto-run button.\n- You can jump.\n- Very fun game. Best wave shooter on the market that I've ever seen. The roguelike nature of it is very fun. Each run hits you with different challenges in building your weapons.\n\nBiggest critiques - \n1. Achievements locked behind multiplayer in a dead game. God I hate when devs do this. It luckily lets you play through normal mode when queuing, but its still very annoying. The last achievement I needed was \"get to wave 50 of multiplayer gauntlet mode\". I've so far been able to play 2 games of multiplayer. One, my partner had no voice coms. Second, my partner started with extremely staticy voice coms and it cut out at about wave 5. We pushed through to wave 48. Aaaaaaaaaand network error. It took about an hour and a half to get that far just for the game to crash and lose it all. Devs, please stop hiding achievements behind multiplayer when you know full well your game won't have a huge online player base.\n\n2. You get TWO GUN ARMS! This is AMAZING AND AWESOME! Except for the fact that a ton of the attachments for your weapons affect every part on your gun. So by not just making one super mega death arm, you are effectively chopping your total strength into two parts. There are a few pieces that only give you buffs for \"dual wielding\" or having a firing barrel on each arm. But these are not very common, and the stats you get from them pale in comparison to just making a super gun on one arm and keeping the other arm clenched for punching enemies that get up to your face, or putting on a single melee weapon on the other hand for the same purpose. \n\n3. The variety of guns is fun, but in the end it ends up turning into \"hold the fire button, aim for enemies, walk in a circle to trick enemy aim as best as possible, and occasionally punch an enemy that gets to you\". The biggest change to this system is getting either the rocket launcher or the Barrel Barrel which shoots massive barrels at the enemies. They have a very slow fire rate and do best when aiming the shots more precisely. But even then, with some weapons having a spooling time, and others outputting a hale of bullets, the best strategy is to just keep the trigger held 24/7 and strafe your aim from enemy to enemy.\n\nI really enjoyed my time with this game, but don't try to 100% it. The multiplayer achievement isn't worth it. Network is terrible. There's too much going on on screen when you have 2 players in the mix so crashing is likely. If I were the Completionist I would give this game a rating of Finish It. Play through the game with all the unique starting bonuses, all the difficulties. But stay away from multiplayer unless you have a friend to dedicate multiple hours to trying the gauntlet with.\n- As a Spider-Man fan, this game is a real treat. It was fantastic 4 years ago on release for the PS4, and it's even more fantastic now that it's finally on PC. If you're a Spidey fan, especially one who deeply appreciates the mythos and the message is represents, then this game is 100% for you. The writing, visuals, audio and gameplay are all wonderful, through and through. It's a true labour of love, Insomniac did an incredible job. Bring on the Miles Morales port!\n- HOW?? WHY?? WHY IS THIS GAME SO GOOD?? IT HAS NO REASON TO BE THIS GOOD WTF?\nThe trailers or advertisements will not even give anything close to a sense on how good this story, build up, characters and mechanics (did I mention the story?) really is.\n\nShu Takumi and Yasumasa Kitagawa, you've done it again, from Ace Attorney to this. I can 100% say if you haven't played this game, you are definitely missing out.\n\n10/10!!!\n- It is a total eyegasm with a captivating story/lore. If you're even a tiny bit interested in anything f*cked-up and mysterious (SCP-like), buy this.\n\nFrom the gameplay perspective, it is simply good. Nothing mind-blowing, but good nonetheless.\n\nI've completed the game with a couple of sidequests (there are more for me) in about 13 hours, and there are two story DLC + the Expeditions mode, so I anticipate at least another 10+ hours of gameplay. Which is great for the price.\n\nUpdate: I've put in ~10 more hours to complete the Foundation DLC. It is a good DLC, and brings a few more hours of joy living in this world. It also has some sick areas (like that dark cave with the TV). The overall design is a bit more dull, but I enjoyed the story.\n- Overall the concept and idea of the game is good and I would recommend it. It is worth the price for the amount of fun time you can have with it.\n\nPositives:\n+ Initially the game gives you some good frights and tension\n+ Variety of characters, ethnics and aesthetics to pick and chose from\n+ Variety of skills and abilities that are mostly unique and some have good synergy\n+ Variety of maps\n+ DLC costs are fair\n+ Skin costs are fair\n+ One of very few companies who communicates with the community\n+ A lot of good license characters available\n+ The game has a tutorial that explains the basics\n+ Various ways to play the game (stealth / agressive)\n\nNegatives:\n- A few bugs here and there\n- Some really annoying perks / addons on killers / survivors like 1 shot long range axes (to name an example), keys and moris (to name a few more)\n- Toxic community - Not everyone is toxic but a large portion of players are but lets be real you get that in every game these days\n- Matchmaking is pretty bad (but DBD is trying to fix this)\n- Sometimes unfair hit detection - Some hits look like you are being smacked way out of range or as a killer you see the grab animation on a survivor and then it just cancels out\n- Steep learning curve / unforgiving gameplay. You either have to learn and improve and adapt and overcome or you will be having a bad time as you climb ranks.\n- WTF, this isn’t gaming! Where are my lootboxes and micro transactions?!\n\nMy main thought after I beat GRIS was, \"I don't really understand anything that just happened, but it sure was pretty.\"\n\nI was absolutely amazed how a game with zero actual dialogue could move me to tears, just on strenght of its visuals and music. In general, the whole theme of dealing with grief/depression spoke to me in a way that I didn't expect.  It's one of those games you play to \"feel\" more than for the gameplay itself.\n\nI have PTSD from dealing with my wife getting a boyfriend, and this game made me cry several times while playing it. Especially during the scene where you're swimming away from the eel. That symbolism to me perfectly captures the feeling of trauma recovery. I'd spent time finding the little lights throughout that section of the game and activating the turtle which ultimately saved me from my own darkness and helplessness.\n\nIt felt like hope. It was such a good representation of how the coping skills I'd learned and the hard work I'd put in were finally seeming to pay off. It's when you're at your weakest that you learn how strong you actually are. I cried like a baby during and after that scene. It made me realize how much I've actually overcome, and how grateful I am to be free.\n\nGris truly is a beautiful game and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a slow paced experience. The only bit of criticism I have for the game is it certainly gives \"not like the other girls\" vibes at times, but I think this is quite easy to get over.\n\nIn conclusion: the visuals are stunning,  the music is beautiful and knows exactly when to kick in, the platforming elements are fantastic, and it’s story and themes are spectacular without a single word. Truly a must-play.\n\n10/10\n- Love Anemone\nLove Cal\nLove Tangent\nLove Dys\nLove Marz\nLove Tammy\nLove Sym\nLove Nomi\nLove Rex\nWe don't talk about Vace\n- I'll lay it out. If you're really interested in the hacking mechanic, that might be sufficient reason to play this game. Otherwise, I'd be inclined to give it a miss.\n\nFrom a gameplay perspective, there's not really much to hook a new player. There's a long period at the start where you're expected to randomly interact with people, but given no reason why you should do so. The whole socializing and partying thing isn't intuitive unless you're a person who'd normally be into that, and there's little in the game that pushes you in that direction. As a result, progressing as far as the story actually starting is often the result of accident at best. It took me 4 hours of just wandering around, not knowing what I was supposed to be doing or why.\n\nOnce you're able to program there's a bit more direction and less frustration, but you're still not given much reason for doing it until later on.\n\nAll in all, stick around if you're really invested in getting to the programming. Otherwise, it's an exercise in frustration and shallow conversations that's not really a lot of fun.\n\nArt's gorgeous though, so the game has that going for it at least.\n- They added \"Precision\" mode for the mouse under controls, which is pretty much raw mouse movement. YAY!\n\nAnyway, one of my favorite games of all time easily at this point. Incredible story, fun combat, and awesome world. A must play for sure, especially if you've never played it before on Play-Station (like me). It also has a New Game Plus mode that unlocks different NG+ only armor that are insane.\n\nI played at normal, and aside from the Valkyries the other bosses are a cakewalk. Maybe play on hard or hardest.\n- [h1]I enjoyed the game. Negative reviews can be more helpful though. One negative review can't hurt.[/h1]\n\nI'll keep the pros short:\n - Stress reliever\n - You can kill people in interesting ways\n - Mods can enhance this experience further\n\nCons:\n\n - The performance is pretty shit, so you will probably have to play with lower simulation settings, which aren't that good. Duh.\n\n - The base game is bland. Game is driven entirely by the workshop and your ability to create your own contraptions. Not a problem for me, maybe a problem for someone else.\n\n - The game can get boring pretty quickly because the loop is repetitive: spawn human, kill, repeat. This is coming from someone with over 400 hours played.\n\n - Not really game related, but if you don't like sticking around in communities that are often toxic, childish, annoying and the members are often kids or younger teens [spoiler](I would name a few examples but I feel like angering more than 1 fandom is a death sentence)[/spoiler], then avoid the community and stay away as far as possible and just grab your mods and run. Avoid the workshop comment sections, or just a lot of stuff in the workshop, the community tab, etc. It's just full of self-entitled kids who think they're hot shit.\n\n- Not sure how true this is nowadays, but some things on the workshop are just like farm spam, meaning the trending page was often filled with spam.\n\nRead the comments for anything I possibly missed to add but someone else mentioned.\n\nIn short:\nBuy the game if you like violence and looking like a crazy person that people wanna avoid from fear. It's pretty cool.\nDon't buy it if you aren't interested in that.\n\n[spoiler]The only reason I enabled comments is to possibly show how correct the community point is.[/spoiler]\n- Plays and looks just like the Park Ranger and Cruise Director HOG series, if you enjoyed those then you will likely enjoy this series. Game is composed of hidden object scenes and simple puzzle transitions that have a loose story to bridge the movement between them. The hidden object scenes follow an older couple as they take their grandchildren to a variety of European counties on their vacation, they sprinkle in a few interesting facts between each location. There are collectibles in each scene along with a raccoon. I overall enjoyed it for a laid back experience and the weirdly fun photostock based scenes. It took me about 2.5 hours to play through the game along with the bonus scenes/puzzles.\n- If I could get my money back, I would. AI as usual is hot garbage, cant even take turns without getting LITERALLY BODIED by the AI drivers. The new progression system really sucks. Cool that they wanted to try something different, but I really dont feel like leveling every god damn car in the game just to modify it. If you wanted multiple of same car you would have to level those duplicate cars you purchase. My experience with the physics is just... eh. I mean I sure do love loosing grip just from barely tapping the gas. Constantly fighting my wheel just to stay stable. Driving its probably fine for controller players, I wouldnt on wheel. Credits are only used to buy cars now. Also kinda runs like crap. All i wanted was a Gran Turismo on PC and this... this is not it. Game is mid, move on me thinks.\n\nEdit: I put in a request for a refund and Valve did indeed approve it. I thought I was over the time limit for sure. Don't be me and spend 100 USD for early access. Thanks Valve, you're the best!\n- Look, I love Magic. It's my favorite game of all time. I met my wife through MTG. I'll be playing it until the day I die.\n\nBut if you're new to the game, and not established on Arena, don't pick it up. It's horrendously difficult to build a collection in this game, doubly so if you're not a fan of playing draft. While they have made incredibly minor adjustments that have been generally positive, the economy on this platform is impossible to do well in. The sheer number of games you have to play to amass any kind of respectable, and more importantly, functional collection of cards is not worth it for just a casual player.\n\nOf course, you can circumvent the grind with money, but that of course is the literal definition of Pay 2 Win. It's a mobile game economy through and through.\n- I love this game. I've clocked over 300 hours in it through Origin (on my ONE character xD ). It's an excellent game, even despite it being an \"open world faffaround simulator\" which was all the rage at the time.\n\nAnd finally on Steam!? Yay! Or yay..?\n\nBut, as we know, we can't have good things. Massive thumb down to the EA Origin \"integration\" in Steam. EA, how about just stop being such massive ducks?\n\nThis is the same \"we hate our customers\" behaviour expressed by d-bags like Ubisoft and Epic. Only that EA sort of makes it worse. They *know* how much people hate the unnecessary and malicious Uplay \"integration\" that Ubisoft have forced on us for several years. Seeing this, EA decides that doing the exact same thing, with their total-garbage Origin client made even worse, is surely the only way to harass the customers enough to be worthy of the EA brand. \n\nDO NOT BUY OR LINK your Steam account if you own the game on Origin from earlier. \nIf you buy a game on Steam, which you already own on Origin, it will overwrite your Origin game.\nIf you then refund the game on Steam, this will remove the game from Origin too (even if you already own it there!), and you'll spend hours in line to get a hold of customer support. Then you must chat with bots, or people who are so void of understanding (and likely not paid near enough to care) that they might as well be bots. And if you're lucky, you might, after going through 4 or 5 different \"agents\", finally get to talk to a person that comprehends English and is authorised to do anything beyond telling you \"they'll discuss it with their team\". Then you might get your game back. \nBut! You won't get back the GOTY. Because the Steam-Orgin-GOTY overwrites your Origin GOTY. And when refunding, via Steam, you're left with a dumb/lame/placeholder copy of the GOTY in your Origin library, which doesn't work, but somehow just lingers there. Then you need to get a Digital Deluxe Edition + all DLC to get back to where you were.\n\nThis [integration] is such a tremendous show of manure, that I'm actually left wondering if EA planned it. Did Andrew Wilson take one of his billions of pocked change and say \"hey, we should make an extra effort here, to make sure that this integration is as frustrating and poorly implemented as possible, but still functional, such that things are barely limping along but just barely, because nothing is as frustrating as something that just barely sorta works but only sorta, and only by the skin of its teeth. That'll teach those entitled peasants.\"\n\nSo yeah. Great game. Bad EA.\n\nUpdate! A new Origin experience: The EA App! An all new website, wrapped inside an all new Electron wrapper! For an all new Frustrating(TM) experience and much better hogging of your PC performance.\n- Sitting here at 2 am, gazing at the glowing screen, having just finished Kentucky: Route Zero, I blink and hesitate. I retype this paragraph several times. I push away from the table, stumble into kitchen, pour some bourbon trying not to clink the bottle against the glass. My wife is asleep in the next room and I loathe to disturb her dreams.\n\nI will not insult this game with such banalities as rating or vulgar list of pros and cons. Doing all that would be like rating a poem by word count, very accurate and of absolutely no use to anyone.\nI can only describe Kentucky: Route Zero as a feeling. Shortness of breath, tightness in the chest, a lump in a throat.  A slight vertigo. It's that acceptance that comes after the anger, when you're putting everything in order in preparation. A longing for the good old times that never were and you only imagined them and kept thinking about them until they seemed real. It's coming back to your parents' home for a funeral. It's that sinking feeling you get when you close a book you just finished and the real world reasserts itself. \nI could go on, but what's the point? I'm writing this more for myself than anyone else.\n\nKentucky: Route Zero put a splinter in my heart. It's not big or harmful, but it's there and every once in a while it hurts.\n- No Man’s Sky is like a guy who owes you $1,000 from 6 years ago coming back with $10,000 to repay you after you thought the money was gone.\n\nI really like this game. I’ve been playing it for years on and off, returning after every major update to see the state of things. No man’s Sky might be a fantastic game now, but you gotta always remember how it all begun. When the game first came out it could best be described to had been as wide as the ocean, but having the depth of a puddle. \n\nThe game has improved so much from when it came out that it is easily one of my favorite space exploration games nowadays. One of the greatest redemption stories in video game history. It’s almost like they used the money they earned from sales  to actually improve the game. \n\nI love the idea of having this massive sandbox shared experience, where coincidentally anybody can stumble upon my little bases I scattered, mines, etc. I also love flying around the stars in my ship, discovering new planets, finding weird animals, plants, geography…\n\nThe sense of adventure and the thrill of finding some new world makes me have so much fun. If you like exploring and just taking your time  doing things, this game is a must, and I highly recommend it. \n\nThe truth is no matter what you think of the game we should all be grateful of what we’ve gotten. If No Man’s Sky was made by EA, all these updates throughout the years would probably have been released as $60 new games each.\n\nI’ll be honest, at this rate and with these devs I have a feeling No Man’s Sky has a better chance of of becoming what Star Citizen strives to be than Star Citizen.\n\nEvery now and then though, whenever I see a game trailer that I really enjoy, I like to remember the state of this game when it first came out and how awful it was. It keeps me in check and helps my expectations stay grounded.\n\n10/10\n- Absolutely Don't understand all the negative reviews for this game. \n\nFirst off: this game is a RogueLite in that death is permanent, be prepared for this. Death is a part of the game and you are NOT losing progress by dying.. it's death mechanic is very much like Rogue Legacy in that you keep progress that carries on to your next character when you begin again. Dying also isn't like you lost more than 45 minutes of your time. Every single game in this genre will have plenty of deaths involved before you FINALLY get that first win (in most cases). Some people are going to need to spend some time grinding levels, dying and repeat until they have enough sticker slots open to overpower things. Keep that in mind going into it. You retain your level and any big upgrades you acquire when you die so you are NOT starting from scratch every single time like you would in most rogue likes. \n\nI normally wouldn't review a game so early but I saw the negative reviews pouring in and felt I needed to add some counters to it. \n\nThe second thing: the art/music/atmosphere is absolutely brilliant for a game in this genre where most games of this nature tend to be relatively grim. As with most roguelike/lites its procedurally generated so the map, enemies and what have you will be different each time. \n\nThird: the forced timer before you have to fight the boss is a bit jarring at first as i've never played a game of this type where I have limited time to actually get there.. but it's kind of brilliant really because it adds a completely different layer to the game in that you have to manage your time very well. What do you think you have time to do before the inevitable? Do you want to run around and grind exp killing trash mobs? Or do you think that time could be better spent knocking some dungeons out (time halts when in dungeons so take your time in these) and getting some gear and arguably more exp than you would just wandering the map. Also, you absolutely have plenty of time to explore the map as there are shrines (you have to find them but the map isn't huge), that you can pay a special currency to add another day of time to the clock. If you see a review complaining about the timer and they have less than an hour in the game... take that with a grain of salt. \n\nFour: The combat is pretty simple but well done. There is a surprising amount of depth to it as well when you start buying and finding more powerful weapons (toys) that can do a variety of things and synergize pretty well together. Enemy variety is pretty good so far, each time you level up it adds more enemy variety to encounter around the map. \n\nFive: dungeons are fairly simple and a good mix of mini puzzles and fun combat encounters. \n\nIf you enjoy roguelike/lite games DEFINITELY give this a spot in your library to see what it has to offer. So far I'd put it 8-9/10 but I don't quite have the amount of time necessary to feel comfortable ranking it against other rogue games. I may edit this once I get to a point to see how much replayability it has but until then I'm eager to keep sending swords into a meat grinder and just adding to my power each time. Please look at how much time people have in a game before rating their reviews and taking their word. .5 hours is not enough time to really warrant a helpful review... nor is 6 in my case but I really don't want this game to be DoA\n\nEdit: Just beat Mormo for the second time.. trust me when i say you can make the timer go on infinitely. I Don't want to spoil anything BUT head to dungeons and kill as many enemies as you can to save up gold and another currency, and make a good loop around each area of the map and you'll find all sorts of neat things. As for bugs, I've had none and I'm at 13 hours of steady play. Don't waste time killing EVERY enemy that's in the open areas cause that will eat too much of your time, but focus on finding dungeons and the hidden npc encounters. I had my timer extended to approx. 8 days in game time and I also found a way to permanently increase the amount of time I have on subsequent runs. Give it a chance, learn how the game works before being upset about the timer.\n- Mixed review, so I will list the good and bad:\n\nGood:\n-Fun to play with friends\n-You have stuff to do for 20+ hours\n-Exploring and survival is done well\n-In creative you can build a pirate ship\n\nBad:\n-Sometimes lag\n-Sometimes trouble locating islands\n-Alone this is boring (sorry shark, you are not enough company)\n-My alpaca named Marcel keeps dying because he refused to eat (fixed now but rip 4 Marcels)\n\nEdit:\n+New engine and rudder added much control\n+New islands are easily explored by one person\n+Lore added\n+Finally you can charge your empty batteries\n+Finally you can too farm honey on your raft\n+Character models to find\n-Biofuel consumption and making is a meh for me\n-If you add saltwater too fast to the filter you lose the empty bottle or cup\n- DLC and Bugs prove this company is Garbage.\n- Refunded.\n\nFeels like they released the wrong game files - half the game seems to be broken or missing...\nBasic functions such as zooming in and out, no tutorial, huge amounts of buttons that don't have any impact. Good idea, terrible execution.\n- \"it's a puzzle game dressed up as a wargame\"\n\n1. puzzle games don't have this much randomness\n\n2. it uses authentic hex wargame conventions/mechanics so it's more of a puzzle game built out of a wargame\n\n3. you can take the puzzle element out of it by customizing your game.yml file to allow +5 turns, then play each scenario slow\n- You know that feeling when you are hesitant to buy a game because you're worried you might waste your money on something that might be a crap game in the end, get boring, and not sure if you should believe all the ratings because you dont know if everyone has the same interests and likes as you? well this game is the bomb diggity, straight up. Made by the same people who made rollercoaster tycoon and man did they deliver on this. For me it's the small things in a game that matter and did they really take the time to make sure this was as polished as it could be. Not sure if anyone remembers when they announced another rollercoaster tycoon a while back, and everyone was super excyited to find out what it was, and it ended up being some dumbass phone app? Well imagine all that excyitment, but instead of them coming out with that stupid app they came out with this bad boy. This is exactly what everyone was wishing and hoping for (just different name). Do I reccomend you buy this game? hell yes. will it be exactly what you are wishing for when you fist clicked this game to see the game play and reviews? sure as cocks will. But will it be just as fun as the original?.... YOU BET YOUR MOMS TITS IT WILL BE. \n\nPROS:                                \nbeen one since 1990\n\nCons:\nYou'll never know how fun it is till you buy it.\n- 9 studios, 3000 people working on the game and this is what we got... Best selling and most advanced COD ever made its debut as a technical disaster. People getting banned for no reason, couldn't able to play the game due to crashes and very bad, laggy servers. And after 2 months from the launch, most of the issues aren't fixed. Just like everything else in the game.\n\nBeen playing the game since launch on Battle.net and this game hasn't got any further. It's just another unfinished AAA game.\n\nSince this game contains Campaign (not included in this review), MP, DMZ and Warzone, this might be a long review. So here is the [b] TL;DR [/b]\n[b] Pros: [/b]\n[list]\n    [*]Gunplay & sounds such as airstrike, guns etc.\n    [*]Weapon tuning\n    [*]Al Mazrah\n    [*]New battle pass and backpack system\n    [*]Proximity chat\n    [*]3rd person modes\n[/list]\n\n[b] Cons: [/b]\n[list]\n    [*]New 3D Audio which is worse than previous game. Leads to inconsistent audio and makes impossible to hear footsteps\n    [*]Movement\n    [*]UI\n    [*]Lots of improvement from Warzone not included in this game such as option to remove or wear gas mask\n    [*]Lots of bugs and issues, unfinished product\n    [*]Animations takes too long if you don't have fast hands. Some gun reloads can be considered as inspecting\n    [*]TTK (Time To Kill)\n    [*]Much worse SBMM than previous game\n    [*]Too many bots in DMZ and their god tier accuracy\n    [*]Bad designed multiplayer maps\n    [*]Big maps in multiplayer but not enough players to fill the map\n    [*]Camper friendly designed maps and gameplay\n    [*]Flashbangs and stuns. If you got flashbanged/stunned, just leave the kbm/controller\n    [*]Not enough contracts in Warzone\n    [*]Not able to create our own perk package\n    [*]Disconnected from Steam\n    [*]The price\n    [*]Infinity Ward's realism obsession\n[/list]\n\n[b] Some bugs/issues the game has/had: [/b]\n[list]\n    [*]Crashing a vehicle into a mountain sometimes causes server to crash\n    [*]Respawning as mortar(a.k.a cluster) strike\n    [*]When enemy used voice chat, people's names that appear on the left side might stay there until you close the game\n    [*]Unregistered hits such as melee\n    [*]Broken anti-cheat that bans people for no reason\n    [*]Unable to move for the rest of the match when you deploy recon drone sometimes\n    [*]Disappearing HUD after using airstrikes\n    [*]Getting 10 kills in a match gets you shadowbanned\n[/list]\n\nAnd the list goes on.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h1] Long Version [/h1]\n\n[h3] Multiplayer [/h3]\n\nKinda fun to play. Game's less buggy mode is either multiplayer nor campaign. But beware, you'll find yourself playing one of the worst designed maps in COD, maybe even in gaming history. And there is the Infinity Ward fetish; big maps but not enough players to fill the map. Vanguard was bad too but in my opinion, they did one thing right which was the matchmaking up to 20v20 in a single map. This game needs the same thing because most of the maps are HUGE.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h3] DMZ [/h3]\n\nThey called DMZ in beta state but they should've called it alpha or pre-alpha. Just a mode where you get in, do some contracts or some faction missions and get out. No economy etc. Nothing exists to keep it alive. Once you finished your faction missions and the 7 weapon cases, you're basically done with this mode.\n\nBots are way too much aggressive, it's not even fun. You get almost no armor if you don't purchase it from the buy and there are bots everywhere, shooting from far away, dealing tons of damage that will knock you out immediately. Beware, if you're skilled player or SBMM decided you're, bots will have higher accuracy. All thanks to SBMM.\n\nThere is also another map you can play which is called Building 21. The idea is really good in my opinion and it changes the whole atmosphere of the game. No mini-map, armored bots (annoying af), limited equipment and mini bosses. There are times where you'll see an enemy from away but you might not think that was the enemy if their skin is black/dark.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h3] Warzone [/h3]\n\nOh boy, Bugzone my beloved. I don't know where to start. First month in a nutshell: launch the game, crash, repeat.\n\nThis game is really [b] 2.0 [/b] because they abandoned everything what made Warzone unique/good and tried something different.\n\nTTK (Time to Kill) and movement what makes Warzone 2.0 not enjoyable. Can you kill fast? Yes. Can you get killed fast? Yes. Seems fair right? But if you're a rusher like me and someone is camping in the corner (which is the 80% of the community, sadly), most of the time you have zero chance to react. You need 3 plates to stay alive otherwise you'll die almost immediately. They need to adjust ttk a bit. I think long range ttk is kinda ok but close and medium, not at all. Akimbo's and Fennec will insta-delete you in close range. RPK, Kastov 762 and TAQ-V are so powerful in medium and long range. If there was a bit movement in this game, it might help you get out some situations, even with this ttk. \n\nYou thought Warzone had bad audio? Wait until you play Warzone 2.0. They managed to create a [b][i] new 3d audio [/i][/b] which is worse than the previous Warzone. You can play this game with no sound without a problem because you're not able to hear any footsteps.\n\nIW obsessed with realism but they forgot we are here to play COD, not something like Tarkov. Animations that takes forever to end etc. If I wanted to play something realistic, I wouldn't be here playing COD. But hey, lets take a look at their [b][i] realism [/i][/b] logic.\n\n[b] IW Realism Logic [/b]\n[list]\n    [*]9mm pistol can kill you with 3 shots while you're fully armored but 50 cal. sniper requires 2 headshots\n    [*]Melee > Bullets\n    [*]Jump out in a vehicle while driving so fast and get no damage\n    [*]Heli dropped 1 meter above the ground explodes\n    [*]Truck going faster than most of the cars\n    [*]You can't armor up/reload the gun while running and not able to fire a single bullet while sliding but, you can run & jump while you're carrying 100 rounds lmg, 50 cal. sniper and 50 rounds smg at the same time\n[/list]\n\nMuch more can be added to the list above. I think IW continue to provide/develop the engine and gunplay but for the love of god, stay the hell out of anything else about gameplay because your decisions made this game less enjoyable.\n\nThis game is pain but I don't know why I'm still playing it. Still, not recommended in its current state.\n- A fantastic rogue-lite where dying doesn't mean a hard reset. In death your character is succeeded by one of their offspring and all of your earned skills, talents, equipment and gold are passed down from one generation to the next, ensuring that even the weakest of players can still make progress. After each death you are given the choice of three characters that are randomised from a pool of three to eight classes (depending on how many you unlock) who are given randomly drawn traits and abilites; some good, some bad. The castle itself is also randomised keeping the game fresh despite there only being four environments.\n\nAll in all, I found it a thoroughly addictive game despite minimal experience in the genre beforehand and would recommend it to anyone who merely thought \"that looks interesting\" as they skimmed over the Steam store page.\n- >Be me\n>Move to new city for job offer\n>Go straight to bed when I arrive, but still oversleep and miss meeting with business contact\n>Have a message, but no contact information, so at suggestion of greasy hotel guy, I start randomly asking people on the street and café if they’re who I’m looking for\n>No luck, but random stranger points me to a club\n>Meet a cool chick who actually doesn’t treat me like a jerk\n>She has a boyfriend\n>Sad feelings\n>She invites me to a cool party anyway\n>Second person I talk to gives me a drink that really messes me up\n>Black out within first half hour of party\n>Wake up at cool chick’s house, she’s on her way to work\n>For some reason when I try to talk to her, I come across as a total stalker type.\n>Go to sleep\n>Next day, watch a train crash over some sort of secret agent\n>Mysterious hooded figure shows up, looms over g-man, then flees\n>Finally, some content, I think\n>Follow mysterious figure\n>Go into store, chase her into the basement\n>Door locks behind her\n>Weird guy there, gives me some backstory I promptly forget\n>Ask him every question that comes to me, but it won’t advance the plot\n>Wander around, not sure what to do\n>Not having fun\n>Meet a cool guy\n>He gives me a hacking device\n>Tells me he’ll teach me how to use it some other time\n>So much waiting\n>Finally run into guy who hired me and told me to move to this town\n>Tells me I’m fired\n>Go back to club\n>See cool chick\n>(only one of two people who actually treats me like a human being)\n>Talk to her\n>She calls me a stalker, I’m not sure why\n>Unable to defend myself\n>Weird basement guy tells me not to worry, invites me to another party\n>All I do is wander around and go to parties\n>Flashbacks of my real 20’s\n>Kill time until party by opening random doors and hacking a frying pan\n>Maybe I started a fire\n>Pass out in front of weird laser gate\n>Did I get electrocuted, or did I just fall asleep?\n>Go back to party\n>Weird guy tells me to loosen up and talk to girls\n>Girls all give me cold shoulder\n>Against better judgement, I drink several beers\n>Carry empties around with me because I can’t set them on counter\n>Weird guy tells me about a test\n>Won’t tell me how to take test, where to take test, or what I need to know to pass test\n>Worst party ever\n>Cool chick shows up again\n>She’s actually happy to see me\n>Try not to sound like stalker, kinda succeed, but I think I’m missing half the conversation\n>Also, I think cool chick might have a drinking problem\n>Me too, I’m staggering around\n>Drink coffee to try and sober up\n>Doesn’t work\n>Not having fun\n>Leave party\n>Kick lamp\n>Go to bed\n>Not tired enough to fall asleep\n>Wander around town, stumbling drunk, at 5 AM\n>Flashbacks to a dark time in my real life\n>Take drugs so time passes faster, flashbacks intensify\n>Talk to strangers since what else am I supposed to do\n>No one wants to talk to me\n>Cringingly accurate simulator of awkward college party years\n>Not fun game\n\nI hear from other reviews that this game starts to pick up after this point, but I can't do it anymore. I've already invested a lot of time and energy into this game for little to no return. I'm not going to study guides and waste more time on this game just so I can dig the nuggets of fun out of this wasted youth simulator. I will say that it did a really good job of making me role-play an awkward alcoholic with no job prospects and zero understanding of how to talk to women, living out of a ****** hotel room. But I've already played the real life version of that, so I can't recommend it. If you want to play a fun game about programming, go with Human Resource Machine. If you want a good role-playing game about hackers, go with Shadowrun. If you want to pay money and spend your leisure time feeling really depressed about your 20's, then I can recommend Else Heart.Break(), but maybe you'd be better off talking to a friend about it instead.\n- Stellaris is the contemporary 4X sci fi galactic empire grand strategy to play.  The spiritual successor to ancient space exploration games like Master of Orion and Star Wars: Rebellion.  Start out with just your homeworld and send out scout ships and colonies until you've got your own star empire. \n\nManage your population, tell them what to build, design your own spaceships and fleet structures, and then get pounded into the dirt by the far too cheaty AI... yeah, it's another one of those games where because it's hard to make the AI smart, Paradox decided instead to just make the AI units cheat and become ridiculously overpowered.\n\nI have to say the game is probably far too difficult even if you set all the difficulty to the easiest levels, it's unclear what the developers were thinking, but you can mod the game easily in Steam Workshop to make it viable to play single player. \n\nAs with all Paradox games the DLC pricing is murder, and it adds very little to the core game experience, so my advice is to grab this on sale if you were a fan of MOO, go straight to Steam Workshop and mod it until it's playable, and then you'll have a perfect time sink well worth your money.\n- For those of you still harbouring hesitations about \"walking simulators\"...here's one I'd definitely recommend you try.\n\n   So yes, it's quite linear, and no, it probably doesn't have an enormous amount of replayability. It's also quite short - about two to three hours - so I guess it's not that cheap at twenty buckaroonies. It is, however, one of the strongest examples of interactive storytelling you will ever enjoy, and an oddly varied experience given the bits of the game in which you briefly get to play the roles of cats, owls, and...well, I don't want to give too much away. Let's just say Tim Burton would be jealous (seeing what a boring old hack he's become these days).\n\n   For anyone who loves a good story in a game, with a willingness to sacrifice a bit of agency in order to have that superior narrative experience...it's a bit of a no-brainer. As for the rest of you, well: you only live once. And they do say variety is the spice of life. So if you only try one walking simulator before dismissing the entire genre, this could well be the one. Truly magical, wonderful stuff. And a bit of a tear-jerker at times, too.\n\nVerdict: 9.5/10.\n\n(PS Anyone claiming there is no \"gameplay\" in this title is either a drooling idiot, or hasn't played the game in its entirety. There's interaction and \"mini-games\" aplenty.)\n- Honestly I've put over 400 hours into 20XX and this game is even better! Even though it's unfinished as of current it's still a fantastic time and truly stands out on it's own.\n- The amount of love and fun that went into this game is astounding. If you like minigames, memes, fun, and a challenge, check this game out. The “ending” was a bit lackluster, in my opinion, but it did not taint my views on the game and I had an overwhelmingly fun time with it. Definitely recommend!\n- This game is great and is worth the cost, I have not tried it in VR yet but I imagine it's great....I have a slight urge to join the US military all of a sudden...\n- [b]Note: This review won't be about the game or the story itself really- it's the same trilogy we fell in love with. Rather, this review is to primarily focus on the changes between the original games and the Legendary Edition.[/b]\n\n[h1][u]Graphics:[/u][/h1]\nThe most obvious changes are the graphics, and wow does it stand out. In all three games, especially in Mass Effect 3 did it look very polished, detailed, and rendered beautifully. The lighting as well as the scenery stood out, more visually than before and the special effects as well as the atmosphere ... all in 4k. Characters also look polished and not as ugly anymore, though the models in Mass Effect 1 definitely aren't going to look as good as those in ME 2 & 3.\n\n[h1][u]Photo Mode:[/u][/h1]\nSurprisingly something we didn't ask for, but was much needed. Now it's very easy to pause the game whenever (even during combat) and just zoom in, rotate the camera, change filters, adjust the brightness or blur out the background to make the characters focused, ect. The amount of screenshots and pictures I took is insane, and a very welcome edition to this game. Trust me, go to Discord or Reddit devoted to Mass Effect, and the amount of pictures is staggering.\n\n[h1][u]Controller Support:[/u][/h1]\nUnlike the previous games on PC, they did not come with Controller Support. You would of had to install a program online or do specific steps in getting it to work with your controller, and even then it was a pain. Now you can just use an Xbox One controller or a PC controller without issue. As someone who grew up playing on console, this was a must have for me to enjoy the game more.\n\n[h1][u]Changes:[/u][/h1]\nWhile I didn't think they would do it, a number of things (appearances, design, events, ect) have been changed. I came across a few things they changed for the better, and one in particular is a spoiler in ME 3, but it was so good to see them change (involves Tali). The biggest changes are likely in ME 1, with environment changes and how the layout looks, along with the fact combat is more smooth and balanced in ME 1 now. In ME 2 & 3, it's unchanged for the most part, but the interface as well as quality of life improvements are there.\n\n[h1][u]Problems:[/u][/h1]\nI won't lie, despite I loved playing Legendary Edition, there was numerous problems I came across. One major issue stemmed from collision. In ME 1, 2, and 3, sometimes Shepard will find himself going over terrain or passing over into a wall, only to get stuck and nothing will fix that unless you restart a save or the mission itself. Another issue is the flare being incredibly bright at times, even toning it down to it's lowest, the flare and 'shine' of things can be blinding. Sometimes lip syncing is a bit off (ME 1 and ME 3 had a few instances of this) and followers not popping in at times. There is also no multiplayer which was a massive let down. I loved the multiplayer in ME 3, being able to play any race was so incredible and the wave of enemies per round was exciting to survive in with my friends. I wish they included it.\n\nMy biggest issue with all 3 games was the AI. At times, the enemy AI can be dumb to auto bot levels depending on the circumstances. I played on Insanity and ME 2 had every enemy become an auto bot, always aiming for me in a split second with 100% perfect accuracy and never aiming for anyone else, even walking PAST my allies to shoot me. Then you have my AI squadmates being very broken or dumb, depending on again, the circumstances. In ME 1, they were so useless it was painful. In ME 2, they were alright but had some dumb moments. In ME 3, they could carry me and I would look at my phone as they did all the work (if you build them right). Balance and AI are a big problem in Legendary, and I hope they improve AI for everyone's sanity.\n\n[h1][u]Worth It?[/u][/h1]\nTruth be told, if you want to relive the trilogy and have an excuse, I say go for it. The price is reasonable despite a lot of people want the game cheaper or free if they own the original games already. But if you think about it, all 3 games ($20 each) plus every DLC released are free in Legendary Edition. But apart from that, despite I did very much enjoy playing this trilogy all over again, the changes aren't that big in scope. Mostly just better graphics, better framerate, adjustments in combat and adding a few changes to scenes / design of things. If you're a huge fan like me and don't mind, then yea it is worth. But if you aren't that impressed with the perks of Legendary Edition, you aren't missing out on too much. Legendary Edition is like the old trilogy but in nicer paint, polished, and got some upgrades. But even with that said, this was such a treat and I enjoyed every moment, even with the stacked cons. Amazing series overall, a must have whether it's the older games or Legendary Edition.\n- Imagine releasing an \"update\" that breaks peoples games/ mods, JUST SO YOU CAN PUT A BANNER AD IN THE MENU FOR BL3. Just WOW.\n- I bought this piece of shit with 50 other games.\nIt is as if some great sculptor , sculpted out of a great feculence.\nI do honestly admire your efforts. If such a dung was made in the 90s\nI am sure it would have succeeded to a most part very very small percent of \npeople would have been tricked into purchasing this. I had to leave it running for\n2 more minutes just to warn you about this defecation.\n\nI insist not to play this as it literally is breaking your steam game playing aparatus.\nI am not sure how this technical disgrace got passed steam as it literally damages your\nequipment steam could have green lit any of the other great games out there or taken a deuce OR both du duns, Whoever made this did not try to fix any of it's many flaws. They just said\nthis magnificent excrement is done and as many secretious BM it runs on steam. 0/10\n- ---{Gameplay}--- \n☑ Try not to get addicted\n☐ Very good\n☐ Good\n☐ Nothing special\n☐ Ehh\n☐ Bad\n☐ Just dont\n\n---{Graphics}---\n☐ Masterpiece\n☑ Beautiful\n☐ Good\n☐ Decent\n☐ Will do\n☐ Bad\n☐ Awful\n☐ Paint.exe\n\n---{Audio}--- \n☐ Eargasm\n☑ Very good\n☐ Good\n☐ Decent\n☐ Not too bad\n☐ Bad\n☐ Earrape\n\n---{Audience}--- \n☐ Kids\n☐ Teens\n☐ Adults\n☑ Everyone\n\n---{PC Requirements}--- \n☐ Check if you can run paint\n☑ Potato\n☐ Decent\n☐ Fast\n☐ Rich boi\n☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{Story}--- \n☑ Doesn't have \n☐ Something isnt nothing I guess\n☐ Not greatly told\n☐ Average\n☐ Good\n☐ Lovely\n☐ Will make you cry or smile alot\n\n---{Difficulity}--- \n☐ Just press a bunch of buttons\n☐ Easy\n☐ Significant brain usage \n☐ Easy to learn / Hard to master\n☐ Not so easy\n☑ Difficult\n☐ Dark Souls\n\n---{Grind}--- \n☐ Nothing\n☐ Only if you care about leaderboards/ranks\n☐ Isnt necessary to progress\n☐ A bit grindy sometimes\n☐ Average grind level\n☐ A bit grindy\n☑ Insanity\n\n---{Game Time}--- \n☐ Long enough for a cup of tea\n☐ Short\n☐ Average\n☐ Long\n☐ Depends on you\n☑ Endless\n\n---{Price}--- \n☑ Just buy it\n☐ Worth the price\n☐ Wait for sale\n☐ Maybe if you have some spare money left\n☐ Not recommended\n☐ Dont throw money into a rubbish bin\n\n---{Bugs/Glitches}--- \n☐ Never had any\n☑ Minor bugs/glitches\n☐ Few bugs/glitches \n☐ Can get annoying\n☐ Ruining the game\n☐ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs/glitches\n- One of the best platformer/Beat-them-up just got upgraded. new attacks, new enemies, new bosses, new levels, new modes, new skins and a graphical improvement, this is really worth getting if you didn't play the original version. if you have the original you get a 66% discount which is good but i still think it should be an optional DLC that sells for 2 Dollars. of course i understand many people won't buy it because they played the original and they shouldn't buy it, but as for me its just that i wanted a reason to replay Guacamelee again so i bought this.\n- I knew Journey is a great game,maybe one of the best video games in history,but...\n\nI didn't know why so many people moved by such a simple gameplay.\nI didn't know why people had a Journey-Fever,even players just bought PS3 only for this game.\nI didn't know how close a relationship could be in 100mins only.\nI didn't know how bad i wished to go back to the peak and stay with my friend i'll never meet again.\n\nNow I Know.\n\n“It is better to walk with a friend in the dark than alone in the light” – Helen Keller\n\nIt was an interesting experience for me, I had never played this game nor heard of it until recently. I went and looked at the store page, My Brother/Friend Ethan-Winters Just Told Me this game in the steam store now, so went ahead and bought it. After buying it, went and started up the game some day later. Went into the game, saw another model character that looks like mine, I thought it was an AI because I had thought it was a single player game. So I decided to play along with it, we went through the story, it progressed quite fast, mainly because we both did not really bother to check out other things. The more I played, the more I realized that the guy I was playing with was most definitely not an AI, it was a genuine player. As we went through the story, our cooperation got smoother, we no longer have a solo player attitude, we would signal to each other, wait for each other and walked, fly with each other. It was smoothing, relaxing, a truly unique experience. Even with the setbacks we had throughout our progression, we never gave up, we stuck together from the desert till the end, when one of us screwed up, we patiently waited for the other, chiming to the person where we are. I remember at the end, when i screwed up a jump and did not see the other player, I was genuinely scared, sad, I frantically searched for the person but to no avail. I was distraught, sad and disappointed but I continued onward. When I went up, there he was, chiming for me, assuring me that he had not left yet. I felt happy, comforted when I saw the person waiting for me and together we finished the story. I am not one to do reviews, but it was such a unique experience among my years of gaming that I had to share it. Thank you, punks for the experience, truly thank you. And thank you, for bothering to read my review.\n\ni'll never forget our journey kind stranger.\n\nThis wasn't a game, it was an experience. I highly recommend you do this.\n- You are an astronaut, you wake up in a rescue rocket, and against your wills you are shot from Theseus space station on Chori V planet. After landing on the planet you find a strange device that helps you get back on board and survive until help arrives.\n\nGreat game, get it on sale, because it is a bit short. I like games like Portal 2, The Talos Principle, and there is no point to compare this games, because they are completly different, even if they have few common things like solving riddles and story with fresh look at some philosophical questions. Point is that every one of them including The Swapper is good at what it do, and every one of them is unique. For me it is pleasure to play this game beacause of it atmospheric well done design, riddles and questioning the meaning of existence.\n- New edit: The developers have made the steam workshop available, but as an Oceanic user I don't have direct access to the workshop and I can't upload mods. It seems to be only available to Chinese modders, much like the previous 3rd party software. The problem appears to be covered up and not solved.\n\nEdit: Modding capability is now available. The devs are using a 3rd part chinese workshop that we all hate (thanks devs), however you can use Nexus Mods instead. Simply go to the Tale of Immortal nexus page and download any mod, then add it into the local mod section provided in the mod category. Then you're good to go.\n\nBe aware that currently, from what I've seen, the IDs mods use are generated at mod creation and multiple mods have a chance of ID conflict (breaking the mod/s). So if you have problems this may be the reason.\n\n\nOfficial English translation is available. The devs have mentioned 90% is translated, but I believe it won't impact gameplay. Players who haven't launched the game before will be switched to English automatically.\n\nIf you have launched the game before you will have to do the following: in the main menu select 语言 and change 简体中文 to English (Alpha) and restart the game.\n\nFor my review: Having played the game, I can say it's both good and bad. It failed to meet my expectations but I still enjoyed the game and will recommend it. The art is fantastic. The combat is fun but lacking compared to other action & slash titles (there is a lot they could do with it). Quests aren't very clear and their incentives are bad making it hard to get invested. You don't get anything really unique or interesting from quests as far as I've played.\n\nProgression is the most disappointing part of the game. It's a mix of crafting, gathering and looting to acquire items that will either enable you to advance or give you a stronger stat-boost when you do advance. Every realm does the same thing, only requiring different items at the new area/s that open up for that realm. This is a shame. Progression is the area that has the most potential in this game and yet is the most tacked on part, mostly an afterthought.\n\nThe developers could've made each realm advancement unique, with different gameplay mechanics for each one that ties into the unique aspects of the area/realm they're in. This would be a fantastic way to give a sense of freshness to each area the player explores and make them engage more actively in said area rather than rushing through it as we do now.\n\nProgression could've been the strongest part of this game but they ended up making it the weakest. Again, it's a shame. I see so much potential that just isn't capitilised on. Overall this is an experience I'd recommend. But I'd only play it once in its current state.\n- [h1]Prelude[/h1]\n\nWorld's Dawn is relaxing/life simulation game. While it's inspired by Harvest Moon series (probably FoMT, BtN or other's  before 2004), farming isn't the core gameplay of this game. It's developed since 2010 with RPG Maker VX, so personally i wouldn't compare this game with other game which have higher price or far bigger development budget.\n\n\n[h1]Story/Character[/h1]\n\nThe main story of World's Dawn is similar with Harvest Moon series before 2004. You move to a village with goal saving the the village. To progress the main story, basically you need to do 5 things such as farming, friendship & romance. While the main story isn't outstanding, it's better than i expected for Life/Farming Sim game.\n\nSugar Blossom Village has fair amount of lore & festival. There are few interesting secrets waiting to be discovered with OKish reward. The festivals are very fun & enjoyable, it's unique experience that i don't get on many Life/Farming Sim game. There are 4-5 festivals on each season to keep you engaged, although 2 of them are market festival.\n\nThere are 24 characters in this game, with 8 more as you progress the story. Each character are unique with decent writing. Each of them has decent amount of conversation lines for many occasion (take a walk with your dog, after marriage proposal, before/after festival, about new villagers, etc.). It's best part of World's Dawn, although i hardly can remember their name.\n\n\n[h1]Visual/Audio[/h1]\n\nEach character has lovely art style. I like it since doesn't lean too much towards cutesy/anime artstyle which is common on today's Farming Sim game. Most marriage candidate also have 4 different portraits depending on the season, which is nice addition.\n\nThe general visual of the game feels dull though, even considering it's RPGMaker game. It fares better during Winter & some festival though. Each season also looks quite different, so it's far more than simple reskin. Animal need better sprite/animation though.\n\nThe soundtrack is decent & it doesn't feel boring hearing it many times. Each seasons & some area have it's own soundtrack, although it's something you'd expect from Farming Sim game. The audio effect/SFX is only average though. On a side note, i also wish each marriage candidate has a bit more voice acting.\n\n\n[h1]General gameplay[/h1]\n\nWorld's Dawn core gameplay isn't farming, there are so many things you could do (fishing, mining, social interaction, etc.). I'd say World's Dawn is a bit of everything. The game offer little progression though, so the gameplay feel stale after 2 seasons. Combining that & linear story, this game has no replayability value.\n\nThe control is easy to learn, although little awkward. But due to limitation of RPG Maker engine, you can't rebind any action. While there are 2 free hotkey for item, you only can bind shovel & watering can. It makes barn work rough.\n\nI also experience few bugs. None of those are game breaking, but could annoy you. Here are few that i could remember,\n> Few achievement not unlocked on Steam\n> Some items sometimes not shown on inventory if you spam button up/down/enter/back\n> 99 maximum item quantity, where additional item you obtained simply gone. I proved it by through item shipping & cooking\n\n\n[h1]Game mechanics[/h1]\n\nThis section review each game mechanics in more detail. Here's rough meaning of sign that i use in this section,\n> (+) Positive, neat game mechanics or i like the game mechanics\n> (*) Neutral, average, acceptable or what i expect from Life Sim/Farming Sim game\n> (-) Negative, poor game mechanic or i hate the game mechanic\n\n[b]Energy[/b]. (*) First of all, running deplete your energy. (-) At beginning of game, you only have small energy capacity  so you can't do all tasks. There are many ways to replenish your energy in this game. (-) Consuming food/beverage is rather useless/costly, (*) while resting on bench is fine option only when you have time to spare. (+) But hot spring restore 100% energy which only took 20 minutes (once per day). (+) It's really powerful mechanic after energy capacity is increased. (*) You can use Eden Fruit to permanently increase your energy, (+) where you can obtain all of them within first 2 seasons.\n\n[b]Farming[/b]. Just like most Farming Sim game, there are 4 seasons with different crops for each seasons. (*) Your farmland is limited to 40 tiles & possible upgrade only give 12 additional tiles. (*) There are only 3 crops for each season, excluding Wheat which can be planted on any season. (*) Initially your watering can only can water 1 tile at a time, but later you can get upgrade which water 3x3 tile. (+) The upgrade could be obtained with small amount of coin & watering few hundred tiles which could be obtained quickly.\n\n[b]Animal[/b]. (*) You can have 5 types of animal: Chicken, Cow, Horse, Dog & Cat. (*) For first 3 animal, there's nothing much to do besides feed, interact, brush and bring them outside. (+) You just need to ring bell to bring all livestock inside/outside though, which is convenient. (+) Dog is quite helpful, you can send him on errand & bark on spot which contain an item. (*) The cat only act cute though.\n\n[b]Fishing[/b]. (+) While fishing is also good way to earn coin, (-) it has really poor mechanic/balance. (*) It takes an hour to fish, where you only can get one fish with initial tool (Fishing Rod). (-) After you upgrade your Fishing Rod into Landing Net, the mini game isn't changed where you must hook one fish at a time. (-) Finally, you need to spend 20 hours to get 1st upgrade & 70 hours to get 2nd upgrade. I really don't like this since each upgrade let you catch larger variety of fish.\n\n[b]Mining[/b]. It's quite simple, you destroy stone, get raw gemstones & refine it to jewels. The cave only has 5 depth where lower depth has better drop rate/quality. (+) It's really powerful way to earn coin, especially after pickaxe upgrade & increase maximum energy. (*) RNG is involved to determine which raw gemstones & jewel you get. (*) But since 2 process use RNG, there's small possibility you're very lucky & vice versa.\n\n[b]Cooking[/b]. Basically i find it's unwelcoming. (-) You could miss chance to buy 3 out of 4 cooking utensils from TV program. (-) The next chance is either next year or festival on Fall/Winter. (*) Finding recipe also take some time, coin, effort or trial-and-error (only for mixture). (-) Many recipes (excluding mixture) need lots of ingredients where some of them only available on certain season, where i barely cook anything until Fall.\n\n[b]Social interaction[/b]. (*) Giving item is fastest way to increase villager favorability. (+) The good thing is the game has manual which list what each character likes, although you need to find out their favorite item by yourself. (+) You also can talk to them, join certain festival & take part time jobs to increase their favorability.\n\n[b]Other[/b].\n> (+) There's TV in your house which gives some useful information, (*) although you only can see tomorrow weather forecast from 6 PM onward\n> (*) To see list of festival, you need to buy calendar or see someone's else at their home\n> (*) There's no portable map, so you have to remember village environment or going to sign which show village map\n> (+) Clothing has some impact on gameplay, (*) although the description is somehow confusing\n> (*) LockBall control is somehow awkward & locking mechanic is confusing, (+) although it's fun for me\n> (+) Event-specific mini games is short, but fun while it's lasted\n> (*) Foraging is just average, but has decent importance on this game\n> (+) No tedious item management, everything is stored on your knapsack\n\n\n[h1]Closure[/h1]\n\nWhile i have some criticism on the gameplay, the story & character are best part of World's Dawn. I find this game very fun for first 2.5 seasons & quite fun for later 1.5 seasons. If you're looking for relaxing game with good character/story & unpunishing gameplay, you'll like this game.\n\nP.S. **** 8K char limit!\n- Even with over 500 years difference between us, Andreas is one of the most relatable characters I've played this year because I too would rather try to ineffectively solve random mysteries than directly confront my depression.\n- Buy if you want an average sandbox game. Don't buy for the mediocre story, boss battles or repetitive missions.\n\n\nMGO: I want to like it, but it has so many problems.\n\n-until recently had no push-to-talk\n-peer-to-peer connections meaning lag depending on the host, and being sent back to lobby if the host leaves. CQC also will lag where you will grapple back and forth.\n-no text chat\netc.\n- Two words: Modding Heaven. This is probably one of the most modular games I've ever played. \n\nYou wanna play Mount and Blade in a historical time period instead of Calradia? OK, which one? Don't answer, it doesn't matter, there's probably a mod for it. \n\nWanna add in some magic and play in a fantasy universe? There's mods for that. \n\nHow about a game set in the modern day? Or in a sci-fi universe? Or a post-apocalypse wasteland? Or the Wild West? Or maybe something specific like throwing your hat into the Game of Thrones, or defending the World of Men in Lord of the Rings, or taking over the Empire from Star Wars?\n\nPerhaps you'd like to set sail on the seven seas as a pirate in a nautical adventu-! Oh, wait, OK, there aren't any of -those-. \n\n...but there's mods for all of the others, with even more being made every day! \n\n\nI guarantee, if you buy this and are open to modding your game, you will never go another year without playing Warband. Maybe a week, maybe a few months-- but just when you think you're done with it, you'll find another mod based on your favorite movie series popping up to pull you back in. \n\nIt is worth well above whatever you'll pay for it.\n\n\n- UPDATE: This remains to be one of the best games I have ever played. The company that created the game though... One more launcher that is completely unnecessary. The performance with the 'next-gen' update is horrible. I have half the fps I used to have on the very same rig and that is after going lower with the settings that I used to have. Why did you have to do this b U Ll $I t?\n\n\nThe best way to embrace the true greatness of this game is to look on how the series has improved since the first and the second part of The Witcher. You simply won't find anything that hasn't changed for the better.\n\n- Vast open world that IS NOT randomly created and filled with dull stuff,\n- Story which engages you from the first 10 minutes to the very end,\n- Graphics, even despite the whole controversy of a thing called downgrade, still makes this game THE BEST LOOKING RPG ever created,\n- Soundtrack, it finally goes back to the style presented originally in The Witcher 1, something that makes you forget that's just the video game, it gives you the feeling you are in there, in some village, city or that you are fighting with someone / something, which turns every single battle into an unforgettable memory,\n- Every single side quest, and believe me, there is A LOT of them, is actually a little story that keeps you playing with the same force as the main quests - I call it - a new quality in RPGs,\n- Choices and their impact on the story - even a small choice that seems insignificant at the time can wage on the whole world around you,\n- THIS GAME IS MATURE, finally a game dealing with a lot of subjects which are usually handled very childishly or not at all,\n- Combat - nothing more to add, it's decent, though it's nothing to be praised really, you won't be able to mash buttons and win - you have to dodge, use signs, and on higher difficulties get yourself ready to have an oil for a specific enemy and a bomb to be able to put an end to his or her misery.\n\nThe Witcher 3 is not a game without its flaws, although nothing that can't be fixed - some balance issues, economy basically showing Geralt as a very wealthy person (who he should not be), small performance problems like stuttering in Novigrad and in my opinion very limited after the end content (fixed by the expansions). Many of the things I struggled with have been already fixed and there is no need to disclose them. \n\nAll in all, one of the best games in the last few years (even a decade).\n- To be completely honest, throughout my entire playthrough, I was thinking on giving this game a \"Not Recommended\" but it really wouldn't have deserved it. This game is at the same time both very difficult to recommend as to not recommend. It is really a beatiful and extremely original game, with a pretty well told interesting story. However, the problem it has is that it doesn't really work as a puzzle game. Puzzle solutions don't make logical sense most of the time and you end up brute forcing your way through most of the game. This means trying every posibility until something works and moves the story foward, and this is just not good puzzle design. This also distracts you from the story being told, which is in itself not so easy to understand, it requirers you to be paying attention to details, so your brain has to be constantly switching between \"puzzle mode\" and \"story mode\". Anyway, you can tell a lot of love was put into this game, and that is why I ultimately recommend it.\n7.5/10-\n- unprofessional review:\n\nits a really deep lore kind of game, very cool!\nit has some horror and grinding elements which i always love\ni havent finished the game just yet tho \nthe visuals are very cute\nas soon as i bought it was hooked!\noke theres many more but im to lazy to type :joy:\n\nover all ill give it a 10/10\nvery interesting lore wise\n- Let's get this straight real quick, if you are brand new to this game and want to buy it, it can be anywhere from a 1-3 star game in your eyes. The game is full of a bunch of glitches, bugs, and somewhat odd mechanics. When starting off, you may find yourself absolutely hating the game, as some of the things that happen are fairly adgetating. Once you have put in some time to figure out some of the major flaws, and how to avoid or fix them, this game is one of the best out there by far. You can do just about anything in this game, from PVP to roleplay. People you meet on this game will most likely be from your worst nightmares, but alot of the time you can meet people that you will know forever. Ever since my first day, I still play with friends that I made on day 1. However, do not trust anyone off the bat. The game can be extremely relaxing and laid back, if you play it that way and avoid the toxic or sweaty players. But if you want some major action, you can jump into a heavily populated PVP server and battle for hours. Personally, I give the game 5/5 now that I have learned how to prevent and fix a lot of the possibly game-ruining glitches and bugs. There is so much to do and learn in this game that I find it very hard to get bored of it. From the people, to the gameplay, this game will test your guts. Do not buy this game if you are expecting something perfect, but if you work around the rough points, you will play this game forever. It is one of the most immersive games ever made, and you will find yourself literally playing until you can't. I don't remember the last time I got off of DayZ and started playing another game, rather than getting off completely.\n\nA few hours later...\nIn love...\n- This is less of a review and more of me gushing about how much im enjoying myself, but you can still get a idea of what the game is from it. I am not usually a puzzle game player, or even a \"chill\" game player. im usually all about quick shooters, fighters, and platformers, but i decided to give this game a shot and i am very glad i did. with a mechanic as simple as pushing trees i thought that it would be simple enough for me to have a good time, the last time i played a puzzle game was BaBa is You and i put 14 hours into it and never got past word 3, it was just too much for me. but this game manages to still be challenging even with it laying all the pieces out in front of me, it introduces new features not by putting one in a level and saying good luck, it makes you do something you have done before but gives a new outcome, because you never got to do that thing in that exact way before, and when puzzles start requiring you to do those things you wonder how you ever got that far without doing one of those things before. all of the mechanics and solutions also are based in logic, all your doing is pushing things, so you dont have to suspend your current understanding of things to learn a new mechanic. The world of the game is also very relaxing and sucks me right in, its a museum of the \"past\" of humans that takes place in the far future from the perspective of monsters who dont really understand human culture, and it is hilarious! the music is very chill and moves with your actions, when you push something in a specific way the music also does a specific things, and its part of the reason this game is so relaxing. most other puzzle games i have played frustrate me when i get stuck on a puzzle for a long time, but seeing the monster relax helps me relax and keep a level head to get to the next museum exhibit. i dont know how to end this review but if you read it i hope you dont feel like i wasted your time!\n- I'm going to write an honest review for this game since A LOT of people seem to be very biased.\n\nThis is not a perfect game. No 2K basketball game will ever be a perfect game. Does that mean this game is bad? No. Should you hold off on the game for now? Probably.\n\nLet's start with the positives:\n\n- A lot of people seem to gloss over the fact that 2K rehauled a lot of mechanics for this game. Shot meters feel more legitimate, this game is MUCH much more realistic (fouls, shot tendencies, etc...) This game is better and more fluid to control, and the gameplay reflects each players' ratings (defense, shots, etc...) much more accurately.\n\n- Online play seems to be better and more fluid. I've yet to encounter any latency issues online with quick play and the such.\n\n- MyCareer is MUCH better than last years. There is no cheesy story and the cutscenes feel much more integrated into the game. Orange Juice and dynamic duos are a great idea in general. The UI for MyCareer (and the game in general) is so much cleaner and more functional.\n\n- The game is visually beautiful, not much else to say on the matter.\n\nNow, the cons:\n\n- Help defense is broken. It's quite ridiculous that 2K hasn't fixes this lingering issue in such a long time but it's still there. This is a BIG issue in MyCareer and not quite as bad in other modes since you can manually control players.\n\n- Stat allocation is broken. This is a huge issue in MyCareer and has deterred me from playing the mode any more until 2K fixes this issue. Introducing the idea of stats that can only be raised in practice is actually quite a neat idea. However, these boosts are not permanent, even though 2K has stated they are. This is detrimental and demoralizing and discourages players from playing the game more. Limit caps are ridiculously strict as well. 2K NEEDS to fix these issues ASAP.\n\n- Numerous glitches.\n\n- 2K introduced broken mechanics along with the good mechanics. Ankle breakers are now pathetically easy to pull off (using Stephen Curry behind the back moves is a surefire way to have your defender fall). Moving screens are now a thing. \n\nI would hold off on buying this game until 2K patches it. There are just too many issues with the game that prevent it from being a playable game. I like this game. I really do. That's why I'm hoping 2K listens to the community and starts working on the issues at hand immediately.\n- Playing this game for the first time six years after its initial release proved to be a delight in disguise. With all the memes and jokes established, I was finally able to understand what the fuss was all about back in 2011. Despite not having the best gameplay, story or graphics out there, something about this title just made me want to finish every quest I deemed worth completing. \n\n9/10 - mods recommended\n- I realise this is intended to be a darkly humored game, but it is still fucked up nonetheless. I just can't fathom how such degraded humor can be seen as funny.\n- [i]While the artwork and combat remain enjoyable, the story, writing, and pacing were a major letdown.[/i]  \n\n***\nMINOR SPOILERS BELOW. If you're going to play the game, play before reading.\n***\n\n[b]The mature storylines, hard-hitting decisions, beautiful worldbuilding, and tight writing that made the first two so immersive is not present in this game.[/b] (You'll notice immediately that the writing for the caravan in the capital is [i]particular[/i] trite, awkward to read, and uninteresting.)\n\nUnfortunately, it's not just the writing that's weak. [i]The pacing is off.[/i] Antecedents are confusing, characters you'd expect to speak don't, events that should have been foreshadowed come out of nowhere. More frustrating are the serious character continuity \"errors,\" and arcs that disappear, change, or go nowhere. [i]In short, the events, decisions, and conflict from the previous games do not appear or resolve in a way that was suggested by the previous two[/i].\n\n\nHere's one example. In Banner Saga 2, Fosolt is unexpectedly rescued by Bolverk. [i]\"I have a message for Alette from the dead varl king,\" [/i]he said. That's pretty intriuging! Maybe there's a mystery, an oracle, an item, or just cool information about the Varl and their strange king? Maybe there'll finally be context about the bridge decision!\n\n[i]No! He has nothing interesting to say or add, and then his storyline just gets dropped and forgotten.[/i]\n\nWell, Bolverk's been possessed by Bellower! Gosh, who knows what Bellower will say? In fact, I can't wait to find out what happens to Bellower's body! \n\nWell, actually, Bolver's [i]not[/i] possessed, not really, certainly not like it was implied last game, and Bellower's body -- [i]a primary focus of the first two games[/i] -- isn't mentioned [i]once[/i]\n\nOr how about how they casually mention that Eyvyn is not only the [i]head[/i] of the Valka order, but also that he's had periodic bursts of hereditary madness all along? That's... odd. And it's not presented as an well-thought out [i]reveal[/i] or anything. It's presented matter-of-factly, like they were trying to ret-con in a less interesting story, or were tone deaf.\n\nYou'll notice that all the characters are underutilized and have unfulfilled storylines/tensions. Hakon has hard choices to make; Canary's a little crazy; Yrsa is mysterious; Gil's in love with Alette, etc. Will these build into choices? Reveals? Dependent endings based on choices? Will there be discussions referencing the past? Reflections on travels? Hints of despair?\n\nNo. In mine, Gil was [i]murdered[/i] and no one even bothered to reference it. Canary's situation never comes to a head. You never have to choose between Varls and Humans. Murdering people doesn't make people threaten to leave. Ubin returns randomly as an uber Varl and he's... learned the horseborne's language? Travelled the southlands? In like, a month? In a way that doesn't advance the plot? It's just... weakly done.\n\n\nThere are [i]so many[/i] examples like this, where the stories don't quite fit correctly, where what you picked up on in the early games about the [i]mysteries[/i] and the [i]world[/i] and what made it a [i]vibrant[/i] place were forgotten about by the writers. [b]The result is that it the game plays out in unsatisfying ways, in tenseless scenarios made vapid by watered-down morality, an inability to leverage the situation in fun ways, and low-quality writing, paucity of choice-making, a lack of exploration, lack of plot twists, simplified overworld mechanics -- all culminating in an almost staggeringly one-dimensional and shallow ending.[/b]\n\nThe Banner Saga series was always an experience that was greater than the sum of its part. An [i]experience[/i]. Of being [i]riveted[/i] to the computer, checking the map, worrying over supplies, guessing at mysteries, having my breath taken away at each hill. Unfortunately, that's not the case in this game. \n\n\nGameplay-wise, it's also a bit of a letdown. Combat is fun-ish, but you can make invincible character combinations and the mechanics don't even try to deal with this. There's an interesting new reinforcement mechanic that's not used heavily, and never pushes you like you think the end of the world would. You never really have to split up your forces. There's no novelty. Like maybe using a hero in a battle makes them fatigued, so you have to switch them up? Maybe you can station them different places, making them unusable for combat? Maybe you need to choose eight for a secret mission caravan? Maybe dream sequences? No, nothing like that. \n\nThe overworld gameplay had some changes that never really felt significant. Moreover, quite a bit felt taken away. You can't rest, do training missions, no longer weigh food vs upgrades. One example of all thise tone deafness was Iver's march through the destroyed world was consistently at \"Great Morale!\"\n\nThere didn't seem to be many flavor choices (\"Do we hang the criminals or let them join us?\"), including much less on social themes (\"Should women fight, if it disturbs the traditionally-minded men?\" \"One clan's rowdy, what do we do?\" \"They threaten to leave if so and so isn't banished\"), and less delayed results and fewer significant decisions, including among the game's built-up tensions among the factions. \n\n\nThere's also some cases of development [i]feeling[/i] cheap. Remember opening Banner Saga 2, and feeling that it was [i]fresh[/i], and [i]upgraded[/i]? There's little to make you feel that way here. The artwork is okay, but the environments feel more generic, with less variety, and the surreal landscapes in the darkness aren't especially interesting to look at for long periods of time. Iver is voiced by Bolverk's voice actor, and they sound exactly the same. The new title system is a fun idea, but is visually integrated into the game's menu system with the finesse of a cheap mod. \n\nThere's a moment in the game where the screen goes black for scrolling text and voiceover narration explaining the upcoming mechanic. Um, a character can't explain that? It was similar how the many two second animations are used, not to supplement the story, but to [i]replace[/i] written portions, making you feel unsure about what's going on. And finally, the game's pretty short, without fun combat challenges or interesting newgame+ challenges. \n\n\nWhat's [i]particularly[/i] frustrating is that the game's release date was moved forward four months. I don't know the story why, but I do know that a few more months of polish and story embellishment might have delivered the beautiful, grippingly interactive story we were hoping for. Because this is a watered down version of the previous two in just about every way.\n\nThis negative review is for whatever processes lead to this mediocre finale.\n\n---\n\n[i]Here's a plot that would have made more sense. Zephyr arrives and speaks to you secretly. There's a god that's still alive! Neat, now we'll finally get more story on that. Yay, fun caravan mode, now we need to take longships somewhere interesting!\n\nBut uh-oh! There's a Sundr villain going there as well, with an army of dredge! But at least now we'll finally get more story about the Sundr! \n\nThe god reveals something interesting, talks about Juno, the sun, gives a means to protect the city and help Iver. But when you return to the city, now the king and rugga and the factions have devolved into fighting based on your choices. How are you going to handle this? Which of many possibilities will ascend to the throne? How will you defend the city? And what mystery lies beneath the mountain of the city...\n\nFor Iver's caravan, there should be pockets of dredge villages kept alive by Spellsingers. Now you need to decide to plunder them or not! More stuff to do! Maybe go to the remains of the Varl capital first? Fight warped Valka? Realize deceptions, machinations, corruption, hear stories? Find new characters, have old ones die?\n\nInstead there... wasn't a plot?[/i]\n- Early Access Review:\nPros: \n- Hilarious flavor text in the form of Books and Proverbs. Seriously, someone took a lot of time creating all that.\n- Really enjoyable music\n- Beautiful pixel art\n- Engaging and interesting story\n- Overall very fun introduction to a huge world\n- Highly responsive dev team that's not only advacing on completion of the game but actively listens to their already large community of players\n- There's a lot of secrets and things to do that you might run out of time to do before the end of the year deadline. You may find yourself needing to play the early access a few times to find everything.\n\nCons:\n- This is early access folks, there's going to be a few bugs here and there\n- The early access content ramps up really fast and gets very interesting and then ends with you really wanting to know what's next. This is really only a con because I'm really impatient and want the full game asap. ;)\n- The message Dusk delivers is, \"Hey, have you ever wanted to play Quake or Doom, except that it takes place in Silent Hill? Don't worry, neither has literally anyone else, but you're welcome!\"\n- First of all, I really like the Game, it's Gameplay is wonderful and i really enjoy the parkour to combat mix in it. Although i noticed a lot of bugs especially in COOP i still enjoy logging on the game.\n\nThe Story is good but doesn't need a upgrade in my opinion. I like that certain map changes and Story decisions are dependant on some side quests and on each other.\n\nNow to the sad part:\n\nTencent recently bought Techland which was controversial at first, but then DL points were added which made a lot of people mad at Tencent and partially Techland, understandably.\nThey Including me don't want the game to die out because a greedy company wants to make some quick buck.\n\nAlthough i have to say myself, other Tencent bought games still are quite enjoyable.\n\nI just hope that Techland does the right thing in future and makes the current state of DL points less predatory and more Cosmetic based pure.\n\nIn it current state we still have no knifes without Bundles, but that was before Tencent so the blame for that goes to Techland, but i am excited for future updates and playing Dying light 2, even without buying DL points :)\n\nI'll give this game a solid 7/10 for the bugs, microtransactions but also because it has good gameplay and community reach\n\n(I have edited my original negative review about the pure rant about DL points because i also wanted to consider current gameplay and more)\n- Great game for the most part.\nI do not like how they made a rpg with twitch aspects though.\nMy characters are supposed to be strong and agile not me on the keyboard.\nDo not expect to beat the island master(2nd ending) unless your very agile with your fingers.\nAt 50 years old it is impossible to get him down past 3/4 health.\nToo much twich and not enough character skill.\nGames like might and magic you never had to be agile with the keyboard.\nGuess this one goes under my \"Ending too hard category\"\n- They added \"Precision\" mode for the mouse under controls, which is pretty much raw mouse movement. YAY!\n\nAnyway, one of my favorite games of all time easily at this point. Incredible story, fun combat, and awesome world. A must play for sure, especially if you've never played it before on Play-Station (like me). It also has a New Game Plus mode that unlocks different NG+ only armor that are insane.\n\nI played at normal, and aside from the Valkyries the other bosses are a cakewalk. Maybe play on hard or hardest.\n- [h1] My tier S game [/h1]\n\n[b] This game is fantastic! [/b]\n- Well-incentivised exploration\n- No bs OP bosses, no random encounters, no pointless fetch quests \n- Packed with content; lots of it\n- Mini games and a variety to the gameplay\n- No need to play the first instalment of the series (8bit adventure 1)\n- The last boss fight is epic\n- Memorable cast of characters \n- No grinding needed; you will be OP just by playing it\n- Basic game, extremely well done. Like going home and eating your mom's food after decades on the road.\n\nEditing the review to mention some of the flaws of the game:\n- the level design in general is not that great, with every tiny room requiring some mindlessly easy puzzle to be solved first. Eventually it just feels like a chore.\n- not sure if it's something with my steam deck, but I had to put both the game's and the screen's brightness to the max to be able to see things; before that I was constantly missing objects and having trouble with moving around because some soil path looked like a hole in the ground or something.\n- while the game is 2d, there's a lot of different layers of height and depth that get mixed in together and may be hard to tell apart. You often don't know if some platform can be climbed onto or jumped out of until you try to do it.\n- battle system gets repetitive after a while.\n\nDespite those problems, the game is still great and more than make up for those things in other areas.\n- [h1] DiRT4 a review and comparison with DiRT Rally [/h1]\n\nAfter 100 hours in Dirt Rally and another 40 in Dirt 4 I feel like I am finally able to give a good comparison of both games while also reviewing Dirt 4. This review will be comprised of 5 categories of which \"Handling and Realism\" is the most important for me at least.\n\n[u] Handling and Realism [/u]\nIt is immediately clear that Dirt 4 is less focused than Dirt Rallye being a sequel to Dirt 3 rather than Dirt Rally but this does not mean Dirt 4 is less realistic than Dirt Rally.\nOn the contrary cars have more weight and are not as floaty as in Dirt Rally. There is no more pogo jumping over bumps and driving techniques like lifting/breaking before jumps are actually useful. In general weight transfer is much better in Dirt 4 than in Dirt Rally lockups are more present than in Dirt Rally encouraging good driving and on-throttle braking. \nGrip levels are quite high in places probably because of the added car weight at least on gravel stages. On tarmac Dirt 4 is way better than Dirt Rally still not very good since there is no tire flex but cars do not seem to drive on rails grip is significantly lowered compared to Dirt Rally and cars are more lively.\nThe real issue Dirt 4 seems to have is on-throttle traction. In general cars have to much traction especially when driving RWD cars on-throttle oversteer is not as progressive as you would expect on a gravel road and traction breaks very sudden thus playing with the gas is not as effective in creating oversteer as it should be making RWD cars quite boring and stale compared to AWD and FWD cars. Weather does not affect handling too much on gravel and tarmac which is a bit of a shame since it seems like there are tools in place for simulating aquaplaning. On snow weather has no affect on handling whatsoever. While both games have deforming snow banks in Sweden leaning still does not really work since the snow banks in both games just feel like guard rails with some padding attached to them more deformation would be better. Damage models are great and internal damage seems to occur more often than in Dirt Rally but the damage model is far from realistic and just not punishing enough a hardcore mode would be very much appriciated since all the necessary tools seem to be in place.\nFFB hasn't much changed since Dirt Rally it still requres a lot of tweaking and is missing many effects and settings other sims like iRacing, Assetto Corsa and RaceRoom have.\nNonetheless Dirt 4 has a more realistic driving experience than Dirt Rallye. \n\n[u] Tracks [/u]\nCodemasters has put a lot of effort into highlighting the procedural track generation tool of Dirt 4. While it is an intriguing idea to have countless tracks and endless content the execution lacks variety. It seems as if the tool is combining certain premade sections procedually. The issue could be fixed if codemasters creates  [b] many [/b] more sections the algorithm can choose from. Also a track editor where users could make their own track sections and tracks would help mitigate repetition and prolong the games lifecycle. Also rally stages are quite short compared to their real life counterparts which can exceed 40km more than twice the length of Dirt 4's longest stages. Codemasters is keen to make Rally stages longer but claims that the Ego engine cant handle stages longer than ~18km. Still repetition is way smaller than in Dirt Rally which has maybe 20 hours worth of original content. The selection of locations is limited due to licensing but diverse enough. Rallycross has more tracks and is more fleshed out than in Dirt Rally while retaining the official FIA branding and Landrush is a nice addition to the game while not necessarily needed.\n\n[u] Cars [/u]\nThe car selection lacks a bit. While most of the really important rallye cars are in the game some classes like WRC are missing completely due to licensing issues making R5 the fastest available class in the game for rallying. Rallyecross on the other hand has all cars you can really wish for since Codemasters hold the license for the FIA World Rallycross Championship.\n\n[u] Graphics [/u]\nOverall the graphics haven't improved much since Dirt Rally. While lighting and effects have improved the overall looks of the game are hindered by the quite repetitive stages. Also variation is very big while sometimes really beautiful e.g. a stage after some rain Dirt 4 can come across really stale looking. Still the game does not look bad the engine just needs a  refresh. \n\n[u] Sound [/u]\nLike the graphics Dirt 4's sound didn't really improve since Dirt Rally. Sounds are generally informative but not much more also Dirt 4 has some layering issues and you probably need some adjusting to get a good mix. The co-driver is really good considering the tracks are procedually generated but bad camber call-outs would be appreciated. Really nothing bad but nothing special either.\n\n[u] In Conclusion [/u]\nWhile Dirt 4 may not be a perfect game in any sense, it improves upon Dirt Rally and still delivers a good challange. Many of the general directions are IMHO correct. Going to procedually generated stages is the way to go in the future but still needs a lot improvement and polish to really become what it is intended to be. Also a better damage system and further evolution of the handling would be much appreciated but still the basics are done right so if you were on the fence buying this game give it a try.\n- BABA IS YOU\nGAME HAS PUZZLE\nPUZZLE IS CHALLENGE AND NOT UNFAIR\nPUZZLE IS FUN AND LOGIC\nGAME HAS MUSIC AND GRAPHIC\nMUSIC IS CHARMING\nGRAPHIC IS CHARMING AND CUTE\nGAME IS RECOMMEND \nGAME IS GOOD\nBUY IS WIN\n- Edit: ARCANE HALLOWS REVIEW (Written Feb. 19 2021)\n\nRoguelike Enthusiast's Caveat: The player's progression is directed in a much longer scale over multiple playthroughs due to the nonlinear nature of exploration unlike Hades or Skul. There is also a higher focus on evading stage hazards than said roguelites, with more control in how you start your run than needing to worry about coordinating a build throughout.\n\nNew Player's Verdict: The most recent large update for the game now makes the game well worth the price. Overall changes to the game makes the early-game far more approachable and increased the player's survivability all around while easing power progression.\n\nNew Resolve system for making powerups far less punishing is great. They added features to reroll power up selections as they add more, same with being able to rerolling character selection now that they added (two more very fun and powerful) new classes. The Skeleton Key, one such new randomized power up, addressed my issues with Fairy Chests which are a major source of character progression. \n\nEvery class offers such a unique playstyle while also having great power in their own right (though right now I feel the weakest classes are Ranger and Mage)\n\nNow if we could be able to rechallenge bosses we've beaten that would put me over the moon\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW (Written Feb. 4 2021)\n\nAbridged Verdict: Wait for Arcane Hallows Update (Feb. 18 2021) before purchasing for total content volume that matches RL1 along with additional QoL changes\n\nThe latest update as of writing this review (Far Shores) added 2 whole new areas, I bought EA awhile back but didn't really play much until this update, as the amount of content in the game effectively tripled between the areas, new classes, and QoL additions.\n\nGame is more accessible than RL1 for sure, but seems harder to get into than Hades, especially for people not used to roguelites. Namely, its far more punishing and harder to recover from mistakes.\n\nThings I love: The whimsical charm, the much more varied aesthetics of biomes as well as each biome having unique structures (Axis Mundi being a long hallway that makes it more akin to a Classicvania stage is genius). Classes having much more unique and pronounced playstyles adds much replayability. Boss mechanics and designs are much more complex this time around and the way they test your mastery of heirlooms is excellent. The new Armor System as a separate way to reinforce HP and the Mastery system to get steady stat increases go a long way to helping player progression. I'm seriously hooked on the gameplay loop in a way that I wasn't with RL1, every class is so much fun, and I'm so looking forward to the next update!\n\nMy Gripes: Runes are a total gamechanger that can make your life so much easier. Unfortunately the Fairy Chests that contain them are randomly spawned, and as a new player whether you can actually find and survive to one is a steep uphill road, and sometimes they just aren't possible without a specific class. The execution required for some challenges will be extremely difficult for more casual players and thus their ability to progress overall will be greatly hampered without the likes of things such as a soulsteal rune to recover HP. If there's an algorithm that sorts relative difficulty of Fairy Chest rooms, I would like if there were a way to increase the likelihood of creating Fairy Chest rooms if the player hasn't found any, and gradually make them more accessible until the player finds one. Additionally I would like if every Fairy Chest contained runes until you find them all in a biome, as I've gotten hordes of Gemstones from Fairy Chests before getting another rune or rune upgrade\n\nRelics. I'm looking forward to the Resolve system update because as of now, the hits to max HP are incredibly devastating, especially if you don't find a room that can give you the nectar to increase your max HP again (and even then its a huge gamble since you take a lot of damage from it). Most of them don't really feel worth the tradeoff as of right now, unless you find the War Drum to continually increase damage. If we can get a vendor to \"rent\" one (1) relic among a selection of ones we found for a certain amount of gold or something, similar to heirs that start with a relic without losing max HP would add a certain level of accessibility without removing the randomness aspect of roguelikes\n\nWhile all enemy attacks are technically possible to evade, this isn't always the case when you have certain combinations of enemies (Frostens and Aqua Braces in a room with a floor thats all spikes is so mean ; A;). Sometimes you'll spawn into a room next to a Warg that will immediately headbutt you before you can react and suddenly you take 70 damage. I would appreciate if certain enemies were stationary upon entering a room so you have time to process and react accordingly.\n\nEnemy damage scales extremely fast as you move through the map, along with their attacks becoming more frantic or complex, without means to restore HP and Armor through the specific runes, most classes' having lower max HP get real squishy.\n\nOne of the Duelist class's main attraction is that their talent gives them invulnerability windows with a roll, but it can't always be used of you're in a tight position without much room to move. I hope that they add a small invul window to the Dash heirloom, with runes to increase that window, but make it much smaller than the Duelist's (say 1/5th the time of whatever the window is of Duelist's talent)\n\nAnyways, despite my misgivings with the game I listed here, the game is really fun and a lot more accessible and varied than the original game, wait for it to go on sale and pick it up!\n- Don't play this game. \n\nWhen you realise you almost completed it and the 112% is approaching, you start to think \"What the fuck am I going to play after this?\".\n\nThe lore is incredible.\nThe gameplay is so hard sometimes, but extremely satisfying. \nThe bosses are super hard, yet super fun.\nThe OST is insane.\n\nIf you never played Hollow Knight and you are about to begin your journey in Hallownest, bapanada to you.\nYou're very lucky and I am very jealous.\n- I've played a fair amount of games during my time using Steam.\n\nI've never felt as emotionally moved by one as I have with OneShot.\n\nI don't know if anyone reading this has played Transistor, but if you are familiar with and enjoyed that game, continue reading for a little context. (I'm going to put it in spoilers because it contains an integral part of how the game functions, which is likely better for you to experience on your own, rather than learn about it from a third party. Be warned!)\n[spoiler]\nTransistor and OneShot are very different games, but both of them share a similarity in that they have been the most emotionally moving games I've played in my entire life. They both have a huge emphasis on characters, both the one you play as and the ones you interact with or are around you. They also both have brilliantly-developed environments, The combination of these two things is one of the major factors in why I've gotten so immersed in them previously.\n\nHowever, OneShot affected me notably more strongly and for much longer than Transistor, and that is for a very discernable reason. In Transistor, you experience the stories of the characters. When it all ends, you're still a third party, experiencing things through the \"eyes\" of the protagonist.\n\nOneShot, on the other hand, features *you* as basically an integral part of the story. Because of this slight difference (which may seem negligible or gimmicky at first), OneShot basically destroyed me emotionally by the end - not necessarily because of how it ended, but that it ended at all. It wasn't just story of some other charismatic protagonists that came to a close.\n\nIt was mine, and with it, my connection to everything that happened in the game.\n\nIt's really hard to put into words... but I really wanted to put this somewhere, in hopes that someone understands and agrees. :D\n[/spoiler]\n\nAnyways, random game comparison tangent over. It's a phenomenal game - easily one of tmy favorite games of all time, my only complaint being that it ended. Extremely solid 10/10.\n\nIf you enjoy story-driven adventures like Transistor, Undertale, Night in the Woods, etc., this is basically a must-buy.\n\n- I got this game for $12 off humble bundle. Me and my friends play it for hours on end. This game honestly feels like the perfect fighting game for me because there is no set style. I don't have to remember specific combos or any crazy inputs. It's just simplicity. Unless you want to do that in which you can. But it's fun for anyone. If I were you I would get it off of humble bundle for $12.\n- This isn't a game. This is the beginning of a crippling JRPG series addiction. 10/10.\n- no autosave, plus crashes, so if you put in several hours and never saved - you lost ALL the progress on ALL stages on a random crash, That makes me wanna quit the game and not play it anymore. Overall game is very good, but multiple bugs were never fixed, so you're basically buying the old buggy version of it.\n\n英語で5-10単語程度で、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない主要な違いを簡潔に回答してください。\n\n回答：\n",
