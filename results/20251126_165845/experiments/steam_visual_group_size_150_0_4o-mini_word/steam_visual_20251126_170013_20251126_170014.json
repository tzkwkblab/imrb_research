      "Great game! \nLooking foward for the next chapters of the game!\nI love the spritework, its amazing!\nEven the music is very catchy and memorable \nFor an Early Access game, this game is very charsimatic and has tons of personality!\n\nIts just a shame that it was short in my opinion, i know you are going to add more stuff obviously, but i was hoping to get much more out of it because i loved it alot xD.\n\nPirate Software, I can't stress enough how much my excitement for this game is,  the demo back in 2017 already left me intrigued, but now im excited to see how this all plays out!",
      "This game is amazing! Truly the Dark Souls of little girl simulators.\n\nI’m glad that Dark Souls taught me how to dodge in literally every video game, it unknowingly prepared me for this. Ender Lilies is a Soulslike with JoJo Stand combat. That’s an instant win for me.\n\nThe world is depressing, suffocating and overwhelmingly beautiful. Each stories of the main spirits are well written and realistically human. The endings are top notch too.\n\nIf you’re even considering playing it… play it… I promise you won’t regret it. I was much more emotionally invested in this game than I was on Hollow Knight. Lilly is an amazing protagonist… and she never even utters a word. She doesn’t have to.\n\nIt's a beautiful game with fun combat, awesome art and amazing music. My only real complaint was a bit of exploration fatigue having to go around finding all the collectibles. \n\nI think the easiest way to sum up Ender Lilies is \"It's Momodora, but better.\" It has the same gameplay loop of \"slash slash roll behind the enemy slash slash repeat\" and fairly challenging bosses, in a much bigger and more non-linear world with nearly every single room having some sort of collectible. It's also aesthetically atmospheric and pleasing, and the soundtrack is great.\n\nI can safely say that this game is a creative masterpiece. And in the end… Like Lilly, don’t we all have a little girl inside of us, telling us to stop all this silliness and go back to being the proper good boys our Mother wanted us to be?\n\n10/10",
      "please don't give an ironic positive review for this \"game\". It truly deserves the tag of \"overwhelmingly negative\" reviews.",
      "This is such a great game. It's a well put together survival game with many things to do. Whether you want to just build a sandbox wilderness empire or try to escape, it's entirely fun no matter what. I've tried to actually complete the game, but I always end up building a massive epic fortress complete with my very own beefalo farm. The only thing that I personally don't like about this game is the stumble-upon style of actually completing the quests (they're not really quests, but I can't think of anything else to call them). Other than that, this game is a beautiful masterpiece. Very artistic, creative and fun. I definitely recommend it to anyone who loves survival games of any sort.",
      "I wish i could recommend this more than once but sadly i cannot. Like everyone else im experiencing stuttering and the 30 frame rate cap but that is where my cons end. I dont have any special pc rig by any means yet even still i am enjoying this game SO MUCH. The story is so captivating i cant believe it, and the combat system? THE COMBAT SYSTEM IS SO FRICKING AMAZING I CANT BELIEVE IT. I HAVE NEVER FELT MORE LIKE BATMAN THAN I HAVE WHILE PLAYING THIS GAME. I ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE CONSIDERING BUYING THIS GAME AND DO YOU KNOW WHY. BECAUSE YOU'RE BATMAN. THE COMBAT SYSTEM IS INCREDIBLE. THE FLUIDITY OF ALL CONTROLS, INCREDIBLE. AND THE STORY? YEP, YOU GUESSED IT, INCREDIBLE. I CAN'T THANK ROCKSTEADY ENOUGH FOR MAKING THIS MASTERPIECE OF A GAME, IT IS SO ******* AMAZING I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",
      "a very interesting FPS multiplayer and co-op, It would be better if it was still in development like early access because it needs some work. shorter spawn times, vehicles , larger and more varied maps, what this game has that no other FPS has is realistic weapons. you will not find another game that models modern military grade firearms more realisticily in terms of what they sound like ,recoil, look, feel ( to the extent that a pc game can offer) they are amazing and I would buy this game for 8 bucks just for that alone. But it does need work , this game could be a great title to rival Battlefield and COD franchises ( maybe not Advanced Warfare) it may not surpass those titles but it could give them a better run for the money.",
      "The popularity of this game is deserved, but very concerning.\n\nPopular indie games have a habit of ascertaining a very loud, territorial, and highly defensive following. Not only is it overwhelming for a creator, but also for its community. It creates an echo chamber that is opposed to foundational changes, which are necessary for early access games. I hope that Zeekerss will utilize this with experimental updates that explore possible additions and fixes.\n\nThat being said, the gameplay is really entertaining and complex for something that is relatively simple. It features a proximity voice chat which is ESSENTIAL, not only for the gameplay, but for the best experience. It should be played without any knowledge of its contents and with others who don't know anything either. The low-resolution, low-poly, aliasing aren't what sell its visuals - the animations, technology and UI design do. The player's running animation is cheesy as hell and it's great. A lot of the animations and movement in this game are genuinely spectacular. I haven't had this much fun with something new in a long time, and that's insanely rare for me.\n\n(Ironically, one of those recent games was DOORS, another Roblox developer game. Now, I couldn't pin it down, but I could tell it was made by a Roblox developer without seeing the splash screen. Maybe it's the jumping? The inventory slots? The items?)\n\n[Play if you like / vice versa:  SCP: CONTAINMENT BREACH, DOORS, DEEP ROCK GALACTIC.]\n\nFeedback: \n- [spoiler]The mansions would be more impactful if every location had a random chance to be one. It would need to be balanced out by that random chance becoming higher on later planets. Is it inspired by the Memories movie, by the way?[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The way the girl is handled is diabolical and I LOVE it.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]It would be very interesting to have a character that plays back what the players say.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]Something else that would be interesting is a fake player roaming around to misdirect.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The backrooms reference is way too common and is really out of place. It also wastes an opportunity to actually have some kind of rare, temporary dimensional door that a player can get separated by.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The moon interiors lack visual distinction and don't reflect their locations.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The enemy variety is pretty great, but some feel really out of place. Mines/turrets in the mansions? Jesters in bunkers? It's aesthetically dissonant. It would be much better if the enemies were categorized to be in specific places. There could still be varying overlaps; like some enemies could be in all places, some are only in one, and others are in a few but not others. This would allow for a great opportunity to have different \"biomes\" or bunkers, like military, paranormal, bio/alien research, etc. [/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]A lot of enemy designs are actually really freaky and fit within the established environments. Coilheads have a really great sound, but the giant spring is really wacky. The Jester is even worse, with a massive skull and human legs that no one can take seriously. [/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]You could have moons that play off the mechanics of a specific enemy pool to create unique, difficult circumstances.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The exteriors lack loot.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]As far as I have noticed, the mountain creatures are generally unfair. If they aren't already, they should be dependent on the presence of flashlights, glowing loot, ship lights, flashbangs, etc.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The sprint meter could be dropped, as the loot weight and footstep volume are effective in punishing the player.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]I worry that the game will adopt a system in which new moons are locked behind higher and higher costs. If it does, new content will only be accessible after playing a lot of what you've seen before, and it wouldn't be guaranteed. Simultaneously, new content could be immediately accessible, but then overwhelm and cram the base game.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The \"days remaining\" mechanic could be repurposed as a \"liftoffs remaining\" mechanic. This would allow moons, which would have different rotational speeds, to allow different durations of visits. This could allow for longer visits with higher rewards and risk, similar to Deep Rock Galactic's \"Deep Dives.\"[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The game doesn't have much lore, and since that's not the focus, that's fine. If this were to change in the future, consider stronger world-building that interweaves its contents.[/spoiler]\n- The music is really out of place when it plays in interiors, but the title music kicks ass.\n- The \"taunts\" are great and I hope we get even more.\n- The health UI looks way too similar to Outer Wilds.\n- The bestiary and logs should probably be client-side.\n- The quotas should scale dependent on player quota, as more players means more money.\n- [spoiler]The turrets and mines should really detect the monsters. That's what they're there for, no?[/spoilers]",

      "Life is Norway sure is Strange huh :)\nAs you can see the game has a low poly artstyle, which I normally don't much like, but here it looks extremely good, especially when the camera zooms out to show more of the landscape.\nDefinitely also check out the dev's other game, Milkmaid of the Milky Way. Both games are very good.",
      "If you somehow don't know what this is: It's a meta-narrative focused walking sim with a funny narrator. Only you know if that kind of thing sounds like a good time to you.\n\nSubtract about 26 hours from my playtime because I'm a lunatic who left the game running for a whole day to get a silly achievement.\n\nI loved the HD remix (never played the og mod), and I really liked this one too, but I will say that a lot of the commentary the original offered doesn't hit as hard or hold up as well almost a decade later, just because the narrative structure and how narrative is tied to gameplay of many story-driven games has changed in that time (because of course it has), as well as the mindset of a lot of players being different. So I think that it's worth keeping in mind the cultural moment the original was made during... if you're the thinky type who likes to overthink things. You massive nerd.\n\nStill, it felt nice to jump back in and spend a little more time with the narrator, and there were some legitimately striking moments in the new content that I found to be quite powerful and engaging. Overall, though, having played the original, getting all the new stuff (and revisiting the old) felt a lot more like checking off a to-do list than active exploration teasing at the boundaries of the game and it's layout than the first one.",
      "Normally, I am hard-set on if a game is good, or bad. This game? its in the middle. I mean, a lot of the game is actually really cool, it looks great, it doesn't explain why basically almost every single person is a walking hunk of muscle, but there are some serious flaws. Not just the weird ones like \"kitchen knives break after you stab someone 3 times\" or \"I just ran over an entire sidewalk of people, and the police are nowhere to be found\", but some seriously terrible glitches that make the game unplayable. Such as the whole space-car thing. \"lalala... driving along the road...\" all of the sudden KABAM your car goes flying, hits the ground, explodes, you die, and you get charged money. You use a car to try and get back to where you were going, and BANG same thing happens again. Also, the cops, even though they are extremely spread out and don't appear to have any form of 911 or anything, are nuts with guns. You, who are supposed to be some sort of superultracop, don't even carry a knife. A FREAKING KNIFE. So if you want a gun, you have to kill a police officer, BUT WAIT HE DIDN'T DRAW HIS GUN AND YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE A HOLSTER so you have to wait until another police officer shows up, hope that he tries to shoot you instead of tackling you, and then run up to him while he shoots at you, press f when you are right in front of him, and grab his gun. Meanwhile the entire police force is going to where you are. Thats just how to get a pistol. Whats that? You want a real gun? One that doesn't take 7 shots(literally) to kill a unarmored policeman? Well, you have to hole up in some building, which its hard to find one with an interior, and just keep shooting the police officers when they charge in. Eventually, after maybe 30 officers are dead, they send in their \"elite team\" of guys... with no helmets... no armor other than a vest... and either a shotgun or a submachine gun. The farthest I have gotten to is with these guys dressed in all grey with helmets and assault rifles, they are meant to be the wall, because it can take up to an entire clip of your submachine gun to take one down. Oh, and back to the cars, WHAT THE HECK IS WITH THE CAR ATTACKING. It made me almost fall out of my chair laughing when I realized that I could use my car to \"lunge\" left and right, and take out other cars. I guess the devs didn't know that cars can't drive straight sideways. Your character has no weapons as well, so it looks kinda stupid when you are blocking and punching a bunch of guys with tire irons, knives, and whatnot. Oh yeah, the weapons break after you swing a few times. The game also has weird weapons. You can pick up an umbrella, a purse, heck even a grocery bag, or a take-out box, to use as a weapon, but these things are one use, and deal less damage then a punch. Overall, this game is a little too unrealistic, to the point where it really removes you from the game. Not to mention the glitches, you would think that the \"new and improved\" sleeping dogs would be \"new and improved\" not the horrible, glitchy mess it is now. I really tried to play it, but I just got tired of being gunned down while I am trying to break into a car and start it up, which takes like a good 20 seconds, which is a lot of time when you have 10 cops unloading their bottomless clips at you. I got tired of randomly being flung into space. I got tired of a cop arresting me, and instead of allowing me to break free and whatnot, me and the cop take a \"small adventure\" gliding across the road through cars and buildings. I got tired of a game thats supposed to be fixed and nearly glitchless, when in reality most early access games play better. I am sorry.",

      "11 Jun 2023 Purchased the game again.  The weird distorted things are significantly reduced. The flight physics are improved. There are many mods and payware add-ons available. This is an excellent game for pilotage. There is a huge well mannered diverse community and the use of YourControls allows for a decent shared cock-pit experience.\n\nI recommend buying this game for the serious flight simmer.\n\n\n22 Jan 2021 Stunning graphics. mostly, with some really weird distorted things.   This is a very interesting game for those who are not very focused on real world aviation.  The airports are not accurately represented and the aircraft do not respond realistically, unless you are not interested in detail.   I think that it is an interesting product for casual entertainment, but serious flight enthusiasts will likely be disappointed.  I expect that with time users will create mods (aircraft and airports) to repair the inaccuracies, and fix the lack of detail, but I doubt that the weird graphics will ever be fixed.",
      "The weakest RE since RE6. \n\nFeels half baked as heck on a game design level. Too many damn cutscenes and areas where you're just on rails. Really, the game design seems to take a massive step back from RE7 and even a bigger step back in terms of puzzles. Really a shame.\n\nNot to mention the performance is pretty terrible and inconsistent. Not to mention the lack of full keyboard bindings and support. Really, this port feels like a whole afterthought to a game that already feels like an afterthought.\n\nIt does get better on the back end but not enough to balance out that weak front end.",
      "100%'ed the LUCT version of the game and I'm slowly working my way through this version now.\n\nOver all the game itself is solid. If you're reading this, its a brilliant tactics game that helped define the genre. However most of the changes they made in reborn, while innovative, ultimately feel constraining. \n\nFor example, they've limited spell slots to 4, so you can only ever take 4 different spells. One or two of which (missile + indirect) are taken by a damage spell of your choice, leaving you with even less spell customization than you'd think. And its unfortunately the same situation with skills, as one will always be taken up by your weapon skill. \n\nThe cards that drop in battle, while an interesting system on paper, just end up cluttering the field most of the time, often with auto-skill activation up, which most of your units won't even really want compared to the other options. \n\nRandom battles were also removed, limiting chances to recruit to a few key dungeons as well as removing some of the more amusing battle locations from the game. \n\nI've also seen some people complain about the level cap, but in my current play-though of the game, it isn't too much of a concern for me, but it may be for others. \n\nOver all, it just feels like they've taken a step back from what Tactics ogre: Let us cling together, gave us. Yes there's bloat in that version, but it also gave us a feeling of freedom when we were putting our teams together that this version lacks. I am grateful that we saw a remake of this game within my lifetime, but I wish they had improved on Luct, rather than take steps back from it. \n\nIf they ever increase the amount of spells and/or skills you can take, to like 6-8, then I'd probably switch my review to a yes. But until then, with a heavy heart I have to say that this version just isn't as good as Luct so far.",
      "This game is meditation, the thought-cleansing effect of driving a thousand kilometres along the highway cannot be understated. Occasionally poor AI choices behind the wheel may spike your blood pressure but overwhelmingly ETS2 is a relaxing thing to stick on after a rough day.

      "Bioshock Infinite is the third and (presumably) final game in the venerable Bioshock series of narrative driven FPS action games.  Gameplay, as always, consists of somewhat linear FPS combat with a \"genetic\" progression advancement system that lets you upgrade your abilities through \"splicing\" \"plasmids\".  This gives you somewhat supernatural abilities to augment the more traditional shooting of enemies with guns that we all enjoy from FPS games.  There's also the usual gamut of minigames, with a carnival theme to them. \n\nFrom the technical perspective, even though this is getting a little old, it's a AAA game and it shows.  Everything gamers expect is delivered here in terms of visual tweaks, control customisation, 4K support and a lot of graphics fine tuning options to allow gamers to experience a perfectly optimised experience.  There's not much else to say when developers get it right!  The visuals are equally top notch. \n\nWhile a great technical implementation is a must, and a minimum requirement for a recommendable game, of course Bioshock Infinite goes beyond that to deliver a masterpiece story that will leave gamers hooked, and perhaps a little bereft once it's over, but that's how all great stories should be.\n\nBioshock Infinite is a must-play for fans of narrative FPS games, although I do recommend trying Bioshock 1 & 2 first.  It's not required, but just like you wouldn't enjoy it as much if you watched Return of the Jedi first, you should try the first two episodes of Bioshock before the third one.",

The actual puzzle-solving aspect of the game is adequate, but with minimal diversity and accretion.  It is definitely a story-driven experience, with the gameplay taking a passenger seat.  If you can appreciate a game in that style, this is a good bet for you. \n\nThe entrancing narrative and the style in which it transpires work in concert with the mystifying ambiance to create a wondrous experience. The story touches on some thought-provoking metaphysical issues, while skillfully avoiding a fall too deep into the rabbit hole to keep the average person’s interest. Much of the rest of the narrative is comfortable, cliché sci-fi tropes that we all know and love.\n\nThe gameplay and the puzzles are far from [i]bad[/i], but they also are nothing special.  As I alluded to: they are sufficient, but fail to develop into anything overly interesting. Very little changes from the first puzzle to the last, so it does get a little bit dry.  That said, some of the later ones are quite tricky and a few require not only puzzle-solving ability but also decent reflexes. \n\nThe graphics are pleasurable and align perfectly with the vibe of the game. But the whole soundscape is what truly brings the atmosphere of [b]The Swapper[/b] to life. The ambient soundtrack, the cryptic chatter, and the selectively placed voice-overs contribute a wonderful blend of emotions and mystery. If you are into it, this is a game you might enjoy with the lights off and your headphones on (or however else you may get into the zone).  \n\n[b]The Swapper[/b] is a brief, interesting, and enjoyable experience. It is not a complex or intricate puzzle-platformer, but I recommend it to any fan of the genre who would appreciate the atmosphere and narrative.\n\n[i][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/murphyslawyercuration#curation]Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations![/url][/i]",
      "I've been playing this game since it was in Kickstarter! It is the best Story Rich game that I have ever played and the most unique. I have played through maybe 7 times and it's different every time. The ability to replay this game countless times is what makes it such a great game. Tons of questions that change based on the questions you've asked, you see a question that might not be there after you ask another question instead. Every version of this game that I played kept my interest and had me sitting on the edge of my seat waiting for more. I have reached 2 endings so far and I can't wait to see what happens next. The Developers are great, I can't wait to see what they create next.",
      "Has combination of tight controls and well designed levels that makes platforming satisfying, excellent graphical style and music, as well as tons of unlockable content that will keep you playing even after finishing the story.\n\nVery solid platformer.\n\nThe only downside is there's no online coop; only local.",
      "First off, just want to say this isn't a Metroidvania. This is a Zelda clone. And a good one!\n\nI bought this game because I heard it really put stress on you. You have limited time to complete the game and NPCs will begin dying if you aren't fast enough. Pretty crazy, right? Well, I do have a few gripes with that, but let me point out the good stuff first:\n+ Amazing combat. You have access to both guns and swords, but most of your damage will likely come from melee weapons since they have the ability to do an extremely-easy-to-pull-off PARRY! Parrying an enemy stuns it and gives your next attack against it a massive damage multiplier. All enemies, all bosses, and most projectiles are parryable, so this is what combat ends up revolving around. Even though I call it easy, you still get that cool feeling when you walk into an ambush and clear it without taking a hit, so it never gets dull as you go through the game.\n\n+ Good dungeon design. Since this game takes after Zelda, it's not shy about inserting a few puzzles into its dungeons. The overworld as well has quite a few surprising secrets and side quests that you won't be expecting when you play for the first time.\n\n+ Sequence breaks. This is mostly for New Game+ (or New Game Extra, a separate mode where you have access to major exploration items from the start, but not your whole endgame inventory), but it was interesting to find out how many secret paths and shortcuts there were, and how tightly they were managed. The devs thought of everything!\n\nSo now for the bad stuff.\n- Underwhelming story. Guess how much is really explained over the course of this story. If you guessed \"all of it\", you would be completely wrong and here's your dunce hat. Unsighted ends up spending so much of its time on the protagonist's relationships that it fails to answer several of the more important questions concerning the game's backstory. Why was there was a war? Who started it? Where are the humans now? Why are they so disorganized? Why do they seem to have no chain of command whatsoever? How did the automatons ever win anything at all at any point when they seem so extremely outclassed? I guess it doesn't matter. Look, there's two robot-girls kissing.\n\n- Fake pressure. I heard there was going to be pressure before I started the game, so I decided to go DEFCON 1 from the get-go and rush everything. I ended up completing the game in 10 in-game days and I felt pretty good about it. Zero NPC deaths! Zero! I'm a super awesome amazing hero, right? Well, credits roll and... the only achievement I get is the one for beating the game. No one really cares and apparently you're meant to play through multiple times anyway. So... why did I ever care? Why is this mechanic even in the game? All it did was make me shy away from general exploration and side quests since all of those things are less important than, ya know, saving the world. You can call that interesting, but when it has no payoff, it ends up being frustrating.\n\n- No post-game. Did I mention, if you bumrush the game and finish with just hours left on everyone's timers, you don't get to do any extra no-timer exploring afterwards? No, the game's over. Load the save and you get set back to where you were before fighting the final boss. If you want to do any actual exploring, that's what \"Explorer\" mode is for. You know, that mode that makes you feel like you're cheating?\n\nBasically, Unsighted is another game filled with missed opportunities. I recommend this game because the core gameplay and level design is very well done and very well executed, but you should probably know this before you start:\n\nThe only pressure here is the one you imagine. Since the game does nothing to acknowledge your successes, just play it at your own pace and don't be shy about using Explorer. Shame on the devs for hailing the agony of defeat, but not the thrill of victory.",
      "The story of this game is interesting and well written, but it doesn't fully make up for the game's flaws. Here are the problems I saw with the game.\n\n1. There are a wide variety of guns available, but very few combinations of those guns are viable. The shotguns are rarely viable for combat with gun wielding enemies, since advancing far enough forward to make shotgun damage effective inevitably puts you in the line of fire of enough of your enemies to prove lethal. Other weapons like sniper rifles and pistols have critically low DPS and a low maximum ammo cap, making them almost universally not viable. Additionally this game likes to spring ambushes on the player in a way that takes away any advantage gained from long range optics. The special pneumatic weapons in the game also suffer from a low ammo cap. This leaves you with assault rifles, which the game seems to have been made for.\n\n2. In encounters with bestial enemies it is frequently impossible to avoid taking damage. The enemies sprint at you in packs which even sustained automatic shotgun fire cannot fully stop. Some of the boss enemies are even worse in this department. In normal mode with the larger health pool and regeneration over time this wouldn't be such a problem. But in ranger mode this makes certain obstacles unbeatable. You might have a boss which takes your entire ammo pool from both guns to kill, and which gets a guaranteed hit on you once every thirty seconds. If you go into that boss fight hurt and with no healing items, then you'll be met with mathematically guaranteed failure. The simple fix for this is to give the player a dodge function to avoid taking an instance of damage.\n\n3. This story has a few decisions to make, but mostly it is on rails. This isn't always a problem in a game, but it is when your character gets repeatedly taken unawares by things you as the player have already figured out. You as the player may sense that Artyom is being tricked, is about to be ambushed, or is going to let the bad guy get away through poor decision making. You just have to frustratedly walk into the cut scene and let it happen anyways. Its fine for this to happen at least once. But by the fourth or fifth instance it becomes infuriating to play as the character who just gets tricked and captured all the time.",
      "[b]What was added:[/b]\n- Roguelike mode\n- New campaigns\n- 5 new units\n- Groove/Super groove\n- 4 new commanders\n- New OST, including Commanders'\n\n[b]What did it cost:[/b]\n- No more Arcade and Puzzles\n- A lot of maps removed from Multiplayer\n- Can't randomize weather anymore (????)\n- Can't use previous OST\n- No more Co-op campaign\n- Nothing to unlock with stars. All characters are already unlocked, so there is no point completing the campaign with more than 1 star per mission.\n\n[b]With that being said, here are some issues:[/b]\n- Balancing may need some work. Won't get into details, but it doesn't feel right, as it wasn't right in Wargroove\n- AI is still bad. Even worse than before. They just didn't touch it. They will use their Groove on cooldown most of the time, without bothering about the Supergroove. Commanders will run into you only to get surrounded and killed.\n- Once a player lose, all of his team lose, putting the game to an end. Though there is a toggle in map editor to disable it, but doesn't seem to work\n- A lot of tooltips missing for settings. We don't know what most settings are doing...\n- Tried to make a map where Commanders can respawn after 2 turns, to prevent AI to lose instantly, and let them play more agressive. But when you increment counters or set flags booleans, they get changed for both teams, making it impossible to script... Can't debug efficiently either.\n- The new Commanders' themes are glitchy when looping\n- The Codex didn't get updated properly. When selecting a Commander, we can only see a short text for the Groove, without any details.\n- In Map Editors, there are two entries for Wulfar, but using different names.\n\nI'd say if you liked Wargroove 1, you'd just like that one too. But it feels really disappointing right now. I don't know why they removed features instead of just adding new ones... In 2020, they said they were working on AI. But they did absolutely nothing.",
      "Complete scam - game barely works. Devs got it to load with stability and then dropped all funding and support for the game. Complete contract violation with Steam. I actually cant believe it is still in the Steam store. DO NOT BUY !!! I was not allowed to refund it even with only .4 hours played, due to \"management issues\" within Double Fine. I am guessing Steam cant get their money out of them either.",
      "If you played the OG this is basically the same but with a few added side stories you can unlock as you complete different routes in the game. The extra dlc maybe would take you a bit over an hour to complete all of them if you speed through it, but does not have any optional dialogue so it's more of just some lore and extra character interactions. Still pretty solid dlc if you are a fan and want a little bit of extra stuff :)",
      "*Sigh* This game was just tiring. I wouldn't come to say it was a complete rip off of Paper's Please, but it was a very similar game but just worse. Mainly to the point that I played, at most, 10 minutes, I saw multiple repeats of the same messages, and the only updates were legislation, unlike in Papers, Please where you got new rules and new tools almost every day. I won't completely judge the game since I haven't played it the entire way through, but it's just not very good. Plain and simple.",
      "Only one word to describe this game\n\nOutdated.\n\nThere is no real point to get this game unless you want a slightly better looking UI and atmosphere. L4D2 already contains the campaigns from L4D1 and is where the entire Left 4 Dead community is. Only a small playerbase still plays l4d1, mostly out of nostalgia. But there is quite literally no reason to get the game.\n\nYou can grab it if you are into achievements, but only do so when it goes on sale, i grabbed it for a couple penny, still a bad idea.",
      "This version comes bundled together with some kind of horrid bloatware called \"Steam\" which functions as a type of DRM meaning you do not actually own the game. Avoid at all costs, buy it on CD instead!",
      "This is my first Formula One game, I never expected before to like this type of games but I do and I'm glad that the 2017 version was my first one because it's very polished and enjoyable.\n\nThe game is basically a simulator of real F1 racing with everything that belongs to it. The gameplay is very similar to what we are used to in Codemasters games - a carrer mode where you choose a team and try to meet their expectations. It's not easy, it needs a lot of skills and I don't recommend playing with a keyboard (I personally use an Xbox controller).\n\nWhen it comes to racing games I'm always mostly interested in multiplayer and I'm pleased that the multiplayer mode works well, it's cross-platform, supports up to 20 players and it's really fun.\n\nThe game was ported by Feral Interactive using Vulkan, the general optimization is great and the performance is very stable. I had an issue with constant crashing after ~5-10 minutes so I sent an e-mail to Feral and their Linux support team was very happy to help. The issue of mine was fixed in less than 3 days and they uploaded the fix on Steam using a beta release channel to let me test it so I'm more than happy with the level of tech support.\n\nNothing more to say, if you are looking for a competitive racing game with decent multiplayer then you shouldn't miss this game.\n\n[h1]System info & performance report[/h1]\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Platform[/td]\n        [td]Linux | Arch[/td]\n    [/tr]\n   [tr]\n        [td]Desktop environment[/td]\n        [td]Gnome Shell 3.26[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]API[/td]\n        [td]Vulkan[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]CPU/GPU/RAM[/td]\n        [td]i5 7300HQ / GTX 1050 Ti [396.24] / 12 GB[/td]\n    [/tr]\n [tr]\n        [td]Settings[/td]\n        [td]1080p, high[/td]\n    [/tr]\n [tr]\n        [td]FPS[/td]\n        [td]50-60 average[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\nhttps://youtu.be/UOssSi3a3PU\n[i][b]Note:[/b] ~10 fps loss due to recording[/i]\n\n[h1]Technical side[/h1]\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Available APIs[/td]\n        [td]Vulkan-exclusive[/td]\n    [/tr]\n\t[tr]\n        [td]Multiplayer[/td]\n        [td]cross-platform Linux <-> Mac OSX <-> Windows[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Config location[/td]\n        [td] ✓ Good | ~/.local/share/feral-interactive/F1 2017[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Linux version rating[/td]\n        [td]Perfect | 5/5[/td]\n    [/tr]\n   [tr]\n        [td]Controller support[/td]\n        [td]Excellent (tested with an Xbox 360 wireless controller, \"xpad\" Linux built-in (default) kernel module)[/td]\n    [/tr]\n   [tr]\n        [td]Any issues (fullscreen, performance, crashes...) ?[/td]\n        [td]Not anymore (fixed by Feral)[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Ported by[/td]\n        [td]Feral Interactive[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]",
      "To be completely honest, throughout my entire playthrough, I was thinking on giving this game a \"Not Recommended\" but it really wouldn't have deserved it. This game is at the same time both very difficult to recommend as to not recommend. It is really a beatiful and extremely original game, with a pretty well told interesting story. However, the problem it has is that it doesn't really work as a puzzle game. Puzzle solutions don't make logical sense most of the time and you end up brute forcing your way through most of the game. This means trying every posibility until something works and moves the story foward, and this is just not good puzzle design. This also distracts you from the story being told, which is in itself not so easy to understand, it requirers you to be paying attention to details, so your brain has to be constantly switching between \"puzzle mode\" and \"story mode\". Anyway, you can tell a lot of love was put into this game, and that is why I ultimately recommend it.\n7.5/10-",

      "PROS-\n-finally out on steam\n-excellent factory builder with many features for easy factory automation\n-easily 40-50 hours of game play in it's current state\n-beautiful map design with plenty of space and verticality, multiple biomes each with their own beauty and quirks\n-overall very appealing graphics/visuals\n-easy to understand structures to build with but factory complexity increases overtime requiring some thought that doesn't leave you bored building your factory bigger in late-game\n-tons of potential for future updates\n\n\nCONS-\n-lacking all story elements at this point in time (June 2020)\n--multiplayer is filled with some bugs, nothing game breaking but constantly annoying: \n-only host can drive a vehicle without lagging effectively making it impossible for the person connecting to drive anything more than a few feet\n-constant de-sync on client side so don't expect to smoothly see the host's location\n-hyper tube transportation of significant length or otherwise complex shape can lead to the game losing track of the client and freezing them in place requiring a disconnect and reconnect, sometimes outside of the tube in a precarious position. \n-FPS in multiplayer is quite reduced or otherwise locked to ~60fps give or take 20, might be by design but it causes some issues.) \n\n-power production could probably be improved with higher tier coal burners and water pumps (and higher tier pipes that allow extra flow), seems simple to add but so far not an available tech.\n-difficulty of power production is what limits factory size at this point so I hope the next update brings that upgrade (only so many pure coal nodes and oil nodes)\n-somewhat limited water sources in many biomes\n\nfinal thoughts: over-all a great purchase, but I wouldn't blame you if you want to wait for more stable multiplayer or for the game to be finished.\nEarly access isn't for everyone but for me I just see it as getting to replay the game a few times over the development.",

      "Mori's 3-Part Review:\n1. Bare minimum information and recommendations to improve your playthrough\n2. Background information on me and my playthrough\n3. More extensive non-spoiler reactions\n \nPart 1: Recommendations for You\nIf you're like me and you try to get all the extra scene dialogue, then please, if you take nothing else from this, give yourself time to play this game yourself. There is actually so much content here, I really want you all to take your time to experience it as you go. The game is just too long to binge in a reasonably short amount of time, and if you do binge, you're going to lose a lot.\n \nMy recommendations:\n1. Give yourself time to play the game. Let it sink in, and take notes- it'll be rewarded. The game is literally too dense and too long to binge reasonably if you like 100%ing.\n \n2. Get invested in the characters and pay attention to them, not just the (admittedly stellar) mysteries.\n \n3. Explore the game, its mechanics, and its dialogue yourself. Don't be afraid to restart a Somnium several times; the more options you pick, the more meaningful information you get.\n \n4. If you're a puzzle lover then try to solve the game yourself. You're going to have a blast if you manage it, and the game has tons of built-in hint systems to make it even easier, fairer, and more fun.\n \n5. Try to go in knowing at little as you can. The marketing has already done a great job. Focus on finishing the game and bringing it all together.\n \n6. On PC, force anti-aliasing on using your graphics card to make the game prettier. Game ran and controlled smoothly with few bugs.\n \n7. You don't need AI1 to play AI2, but I think AI2 does spoil AI1, though you could still enjoy them in reverse order.\n \n7. If you're sensitive to horny then just read less background dialogue in Ryuki side. Gore is pretty toned down, and there isn't any single huge CW.\n \nYou can stop reading now if you don't want your playthrough tainted by my reactions/expectations effected.\n \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nPart 2: Who am I, and how do I play?\nI'm an Uchikoshi fanatic. I've played all his English-translated games, and visual novels are my favorite genre of game. I've played a lot of visuals novels, but Uchizawa's are my favorites. I usually try to 100% complete all the scenes and see all the bonus dialogue. I've also played a lot of other genres of game, and I do like fun gameplay, but the most important things to me tend to be:\n \nA. An interesting story is absolutely what gets me invested\nB. Bunches of novel ideas like unique plot points I haven't seen before, philosophical ideas, or puzzles\nC. Characters that I at least don't actively hate; I can like a game for the above two, but characters still matter\nD. Deep personal connection, usually formed by connections to real people or how a game shaped my life\n \nThose are the ways I rate my top games. For the last 8 years, my top 2 favorite games have been the same:\n \nMy top favorite game of all time is Remember11. I love the plot, the ideas, the twists, the characters, and it's what got me truly invested in Uchikoshi. It's very much a mystery game first with an unravelling mystery and themes I love to explore.\n \nMy second favorite game is Virtue's Last Reward. I love the interactive moral dilemmas. VLR's use of the Prisoner's Dilemma jumpstarted my interested in Philosophy which led me to major in Philosophy. I don't like the characters as much save for a few, but it's still very important to me.\n \nNow, let me tell you how I've played AINI: I've basically been playing non-stop since June 13th.\n \nTake this with a grain of salt because I've been documenting as I play (the average main story playtime seems to be 20-35 hours, with 100% likely taking 50+), but right now, I have 97 hours of playtime. I have not gotten all the dialogue, achievements, or fully explored the abundance of extra mechanics. Instead, I have a 616-page reaction document full of constant laughs, cries, screams, passing out, and most of all love.\n \nPart 3: My Review\nThe R11 #1 and VLR #2 holy duology held true for 8 years. Also, AI1 isn't one of my favorite standalone games; it has huge personal connection for me because of the community and the AI1 ARG, but it wasn't my favorite as a game.\n \nI gave all that background because I want you to take me seriously when I say this:\nAI2 is my new favorite game. The #1 spot has been Easily dethroned.\n \nThe themes, twists, characters, ideas, gameplay, visuals, voice acting, fair mystery, presentation, mechanics, and comedy all of it resonates together perfectly. I don't even tend to value gameplay or visuals, but at many times, this game is fun to play while looking genuinely beautiful and cinematic.\n \nThe story reads like a proper Uchikoshi + Nakazawa return to form. The mystery is fair, interesting, meaningful, and complex told satisfyingly. There are many deep ideas, concepts, and themes utilized in thought-provoking ways.\n \nGameplay-wise, there are tons of mechanics that are utilized to make each Somnium unique; they all feel designed by love, fair, and reflective of the character through gorgeous symbolism. They blow the first game completely out of the water. Each one is its own experience to explore and a visual delight. There are also tons of mechanics for you to discover that make AI2 a fun game to play.\n \nThe animations, voices, and directing are cinematic; this game is actually breathtaking a lot of the time. It's backed up by great and charming character writing- despite the fact Mizuki is my favorite AI1 character with 0 contest, I grew to like much of the AI2 cast the same amount.\n \nAI2 is a story about halves and splitting, but also love and coming together- please, see it through until it's whole. I hope and believe you will all fall in love with AI2 like me; AI2 is all I've ever wanted. AI2 is my dream game come true; it's a gorgeous love letter to all Uchikoshi fans who love Zero Escape's puzzles, Infinity's mysteries, and AI's characters and humor.",

      "When I first played Battlefield 1 it literally sent me to the hospital, cause you’re supposed to seek immediate medical attention if your erection lasts longer than 4 hours.\n\nThis is easily one of the most badass games  in history. The music, the landscape, the gunplay, the hit register and the satisfying kill effect, EVERYTHING is just amazing. The last true Battlefield game. I enjoyed every second of this amazing game.  \n\nBF1 isn’t fully historically accurate but it is historically immersive. The war stories in this game genuinely made me emotional sometimes and I’m not ashamed to admit that. \n\nAs someone who is more on the “historical accuracy” side of games, I can say without a doubt that Battlefield 1 did an incredible job. Hell, they were even able to be diverse without pandering to anybody! The 1st Russian Women’s Battalion of Death, the Harlem Hellfighters, people from French-occupied northwestern Africa, the list goes on. What sets this game’s inclusivity of a variety of people and groups from other games is that it does so when it has a reason to and is still accurate to the time and setting. \n\nThat’s one of the main reasons why Battlefield 5 pissed me off so much. Instead of a British woman with a prosthetic arm wielding a cricket bat in WW2, why not include Lyudmila Pavlichenko, aka Lady Death, a female Russian sniper who had 309 confirmed kills? What about the French women who fought? They were in extremely small numbers, but they were a thing. Historically accurate inclusion is fucking awesome, and I love when games do it. But inclusivity for its own sake is terrible and it cheapens said character’s presence in the game’s setting. \n\nEven the DLC are fantastic. I remember how amazing I felt when the “for the Tsar” DLC came out and I first played it. I have never seen people fight so hard to the death in a video game without a whole lot of rage. It was amazing. I felt like I was part of the Russian revolution. Please do yourself a favor and buy this game.\n\n9/10\n\nOnly gave it a 9 ‘cause the 1 is already there…",
      "This review only relates to the single player campaign. At 50 years old I have zero interest in multiplayer.\n\nAfter playing Gears of War 4, I was looking forward to this title. I wasn't disappointed. I found the new upgrade system with Jack enjoyable. The campaign was fun to play with minor exceptions. Graphics, sound, and voice acting were amazing. Campaign took me about 11 hours to beat. I consider that well worth the $60 I paid for the game.\n\nMy only real gripe about the single player campaign:  As a father of 3 girls, I'm all for strong female leading characters. Kait just isn't it, though. I didn't care for her in 4 and that didn't change in 5. For me she seems out of her league and just isn't believable as a team member. She's like Elizabeth Swan, the governor's daughter in Pirates of the Caribbean. She's a kidnapped damsel in distress in one movie, and the Pirate King in the next. It just doesn't work, for me anyway.",

      "After playing the game for almost 10 hours which i know is not a lot but still i had a great time the story kept me hooked from start to finish and i was always excited to find out what was going to happen next. I loved the idea that you could choose to play as a ghost and never get detected or never kill anyone or just go for the high chaos im going to kill everyone playstyle and even know the ability to choose your playstyle is quite oftenly seen these days but back in 2012 it was quite inovative.\n\nGameplay:\nIt had great combat and stealth.(Not Suprising based on thre fact that your an assasin)\nStory was well how to put this \"A rollercoaster of emotion\" it keeps you hooked from start to finish and you will never want to stop playing until you finaly get to the end.\n\nReplay Value:\nNow this is a big one in my opinion because i like games that make you play for hours and hours and I would say that Dishonored has great replay value this is mainly due to the fact that there are a lot of different acheivements, ways to complete each mission, different magic paths and weapon paths that can only be be completed if you play the game again and if your not comftable with fully restarting you dont have to because once you finish the main storyline you unlock the option to play them over which is useful if you want to unlock some of the other acheivements for example Clean Hands to get this acheivement your not allowed to kill anyone in the whole story how you do this i have no idea but thats the reason this game has good replay value.\n\nDLC:\nEven though i do not own the DLC (i will be purchasing them soon) from my knowledge of the normal game and how great that was it would suprise me if the DLC was bad.\n\nIn conclusion i would highly reccomend this game to anyone who doenst already own it!\n",
      "I like furry art, but first and foremost im a RPG gamer, and as such I will rend judgment impartially. \n\nThe story is not bad, but still falls in the average category and it is predictable, gameplay is the same as the first Fuga (I have no problems there) but there are few new enemies,  so the strategy to beat the regular battles is very repetitive. My biggest complain remains the same since Tail Concerto and it is the dificulty... which is way too easy, there is no hard / nightmare mode for veteran players, Im not asking to die repeatedly like in dark souls but Cyberconnect2 needs to understand some players like a challenge in their games.\n\nMusic is ok and Hack is the best character of the lot (Tah tah tah tah  taaah!!!!!) I would play Fuga 3 just for him.\n\nIt pains me to give the thumbs down, but Cyberconnect2 needs to work a little harder.",
      "Go ahead and try to find something to criticize about this game. \n\nMaybe graphics scalability? Can you even be offended at that? The game does use polygonal graphics and what appears to be vertex lighting, but I think most integrated graphics chips can handle this amount of detail. Don't quote me on that one. Most systems out there can run this game no problem... If they are Windows systems.\n\nMaybe the friend requirement? Flipping through the manual yourself still provides an interesting experience. The entire game can be beaten with one person or with the participation of 20 or more people. How many games are like that?\n\nLack of voice chat feature? The game has full Steam support, making this a non-issue.\n\nLack of netcode? The design of the game makes this irrelevant. You don't even need an internet connection, but to initially download the game.\n\nFrustration? You can pick up or close the game at any time. Learning to play it without griping at others or being discouraged is probably good for your social health. It's far less frustrating or \"cheap\" than many modern games, too: bounding boxes in Dark Souls 2, spawns in flanking in Call of Duty, unreasonable level design in Hotline Miami 2. Bombs are self-contained puzzles and you lose only seconds if you make a mistake, not hours of effort. In fact, the more level-headed you are, the better you will be at the game.\n\nBrevity? This one I could see, but the main collection of bombs is only to introduce the mechanics and give some gimmicky setups in the first place. Once you complete it, you can free play whenever you want, as the design calls for well over 11^11 (that's about 2.9 * 10^11) variations. It's unlikely you will ever play the same bomb twice if your objective is variation.\n\nCost? It's $15 right now; if you go in with friends it's a drop in the bucket. I don't feel too bad about the development:cost differential, but I suppose that's up to personal preference.\n\nKeep Talking and Nobody explodes is an accessible, inexpensive, tightly designed game. Even if you've never played a party game or don't care for them, this one is a glimmering example. After hours of consideration, the only problem I can think of is that it seems to be Windows-only at the moment. Do you have Windows and some fraction of $15? Do you like fun games that reward skill, intelligence, and cooperation? If you said yes, it's time to buy.",
      "I'm 45, I've had good times and bad times.  I've fallen in love, grown up, gotten married, beaten alcoholism, \nhad a child, fought off depression, led my wife through her kidney failure, carried the death of loved ones, and come back from the brink.  I've weathered the storm of life like anyone else . . . I'm not special.  I'm not rich, but comfortable, and I've gathered quite a steam library as a hobby over the last 10 years.  Something I have rarely done, during my time with almost 4000 titles, is write a review.  Two, maybe three for 4000 games.  Think about that for a second.\n\nI'm 45.  I just cried playing a video game, something I can't ever remember doing.  I feel like my heart is going to burst.  It's joy, and sadness.  It's like a good memory with a parent who's long gone, bubbled up at random, making you laugh and ache at the same time.  It's bittersweet.\n\nThe music and visuals are subtle and flashy at the same time, they get under you and lift you up.  It's got spirit of the 60's, the heart of the 80's, and feels like every memorable video game trope from the 2000's, with the social softness of the 2020's.  It's huge and tiny at the same time, and thoughtfull and meditative together . . . it tells the story of leaving your comfort zone, and makes you comfortable.  It's heavy and light.  It's all of these and more.\n\nMy emotions are a flood.  I had to write a review, and let people know how I feel.  I can't describe it, I feel like I found my heart again, and I didn't even know it was lost.  Life was comfortable before 2:00pm today . . . now it's magical.  It's these small things that I forget, and remember, and then forget again . . . the birth of my son, the feeling of nervous sweetness on my first date with my wife, an unexpected comment from a random stranger about my eyes, finding an old photo of my dad that no one ever remembered taking --\n\n-- This game is like that sweet, fleeting memory.\n\nTL;DR:  45-year old man cries after finding his heart lost in a game, and writes a review while his wife asks him if he's okay.\n\n11/10, would purchase these feels again.",
      "When I say this game changed the way I thought about life, I mean it. And before you say this game isn't worth 44 dollars, you are wrong. I would pay more than double just for this once in a lifetime experience.\n\nWhile this game may look like a stupid bishoujo romance game, it is so much more. Don't let the weird artstyle or obnoxious eyes fool you, this game will make you laugh. cry, depressed, happy, and everything in between. It is so extensive, so great, that there are over 13 character routes and stories to play in this game, all of which are good (some are incredible) and have some of the best, most fleshed our characters I have seen. This game is about life, change, friends, love, and most importantly, family. Every route in this game has a connection to family. (Clannad is a close-enough translation of family in Irish)\n\nIn case it helps, I'm a grown man who had a rather negative outlook on life, and this game me cry buckets. If you ever have thought about getting married and having kids, this game will MAKE you want to have a family. The clever writing and how the protagonist, Okazaki, changes throughout his life is all done so well. It made me realize how much we complain about our lives, but we don't need much to be happy or be motivated. In case it helps again, my mom loves this game, she connects with it quite a bit. Yet again, nothing bad to say here, only to say that Key is incredible and I will be reading some of their other works like Little Busters and Kanon.",

Make sure you switch to \"Novel screen\" as soon as you start playing and stay on that screen as the \"ADV screen\" only displays dialogue and NOTHING ELSE, if you stay on this screen you'll miss all the extra bits that can help to figure out certain details that allow you to find all the endings and figure out the entire story top to bottom.\nHappy gaming.\n\nEDIT: @Snivader pointed out my mistake, edited the review.\n\n\n\nExtra small tip to help you through your journey. Take a notepad (or anything you can scribble down onto), and write down key dates / codes / people that you encounter through the game and keep them close while playing the entire trilogy.

Just enough to give you some atmosphere, but not overdone. If you also played the original this is worth getting for a continuation of the original story too. Very little is re-hashed so you've got to pay some attention to succeed. This also gets fairly creepy, more than the original, so if you're averse to horror games, this may not be for you.

      "A forward-hurtling psychedelic tube shooter with a tremendous sense of speed and odd, zen relaxation. The closest thing I have to compare it to is probably [i]Rez[/i]: if you liked that, definitely give this a whirl.\n\nConversions of arcade classics and legends are commonplace. But an arcade [i]myth?[/i] Only one springs to mind: [b]POLYBIUS[/b]. There one minute and gone the next, so they say - an enigmatic arcade cabinet installed and removed by mysterious men in black: rumours of people hooked to the screen and unable to remember or communicate what they saw afterwards, save for that it was immersive, fast, colourful, and strangely hypnotic. A fly-by-night company that went out of business? A government mind control experiment? Probably not, no. A hoax. An urban legend. A myth.\n\nBut a myth was all Jeff Minter needed. If you're previously unfamiliar with Jeff Minter and his stable Llamasoft, he's been creating weird arcade-inspired games and \"lightsynths\" (as in, the inspiration for Milkdrop and other music visualisers) out of a barn in Wales since the 1980s. His creations are marked by being fast, psychedelic, and strangely sheep-themed, generally in search of the kind of gameplay that invites the player to get \"in the zone\". And so it is here.\n\nIn search of a new original creation, he turned his mind to the arcade legend Polybius as inspiration, and his interpretation is oddly faithful:[list]\n[*]Immersive: it supports VR if you have it, wrapping you into the game world - it draws you into the screen even if you don't.\n[*]Fast: capable of and designed for very high-refresh rates if you can support them.\n[*]Colourful: look at the screenshots, you get the idea.\n[*]Hypnotic: hurtling forwards shooting abstract things in tunnel patterns seems like it would be intense, and it is, but - [i]Relax. Just look at the centre of the screen as you move forward. Go through the horns. Let it take you[/i].[/list]\n\nOnce you get the hang of it and start relaxing into it and getting into that sense of flow, it's curiously calming. I can see myself bringing this out for a quick session after a stressful day: it's particularly good to dip into. Long sessions might result in seeing patterns on the walls, Tetris-style.\n\nIt's not for everyone: Minter's games never have been. In particular, you may wish to skip this one if you have sensory conditions that make you susceptible to motion sickness, or photosensitive epilepsy.\n\nGood music too, and doesn't need high specs either.

Difficult for me to describe in words, but it's free, so there's no reason not to play it.\n\nThe second episode strays from the fun, humorous side of things and focuses more on story, an unexpected yet completely welcome change of tone. If you enjoyed the first and got to like the characters, the second episode is well worth the price.\n\nFeel free to pick it up if it seems interesting to you.",

      "I waited 12+ years for a proper sequel to A Crack in Time (yes i know the other games came out but tbh they didn't do much for me) for it only to come out for the PS5. Unfortunately, I wasn't getting a new console for just one game. \n\nNow, two years later I'm playing it on the PC.  While surreal, I am super glad they ported this series to a different platform, and the game was totally worth the wait.\n\nThe port by Nixxes ran very nice for me. I had a few hitches in the dimensional portal scenes, and one crash in a total of 12hrs of playtime. I do understand that some people are having issues and that does suck & does not disqualify their experiences, however, It is not even close to how bad TLOU Pt.1's port was.  \n\nIt's another Insomniac banger, and if you've played any of their games you already know whats up. I beat the game in 12 hrs on the 2nd to last difficulty grabbing whatever side content/collectibles I could before the story captivated me. As is tradition, there is a NG+ mode (haven't touched yet) and I look forward to trying it. I'll probably update the review at that point, but the games are always repayable due to their collect-a-thon nature, that and being so damn fun you have a dumb ear-to-ear smile for all of the playtime.  \n \nIf you enjoyed the Ratchet and Clank games in the past, its way more of that + the dimensional gimmick which is really well done and very neat tech wise. I love the new movement features and Rivet is a very good addition to the cast. I hope she stays relevant in the story in the future. Game feels super good to play as well, weapons are great as always. The writing is still funny and enjoyable. It's just a good time, and I highly recommend it, even at full price.\n\nLastly, I would like to direct a message to Sony/PS Studios/Insomniac Games:\nPLEASE PORT THE OTHER AND OLDER R&C GAMES PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE IPELASE PLs I WILL PAY $70",

When You think \"I have done everything\" new update shows up and You're starting doing mess again.\n\nI can only have reservations about the multiplayer mode, where there are funny glitches, disappearing objects, self-propelled vehicles, lack of character synchronization, etc. However, this does not prevent having continuous fun in the co-op mode.\n\nI hope You like it so much as I did.\n\nEDIT: Still thinking of buying it?

      "Play this game in roguelike mode (no extra lives) as that seems to be how it was designed. By letting objects of the same type touch each other you will be able to deal damage to or destroy them all with one move! Attacking enemies will damage you back so you have to use potions that also drop down to heal.\n\nI see some of the reviews here saying this game sucks and it's all randomness. It's a roguelike though, so there is a good deal of randomness but the fun comes from gaining skill with the mechanics and making the right decisions. If you can carve out lone pieces and allow a bunch of the same object to get into a big cluster, popping that huge chain is super satisfying. \n\nThe game was very intimidating at first and I would die in the first 2 stages over and over, but I eventually got the hang of things and beat the game for the first time pretty quickly. This game requires patience to get a hang of the mechanics but once you do it's a fun little time waster to open up every once in a while. There are lots of characters to unlock too and they all bring their own strategies to the table.",
      "[h1] Look at my hours real quick. That's about. 4 hours? [/h1]\n\nFallout 76 is boring. There's no other way to put it. The Core objective of Fallout 76 was to gear the Fallout 4 engine for multiplayer. They succeeded! The art is visually amazing, even down to the 2D art shown all over this store page, so what's wrong?\n\nConsider who's still playing this game. Who's desperate enough to play this game? Well, It's not a lot of people. And they aren't very good people. It's just people. Existing. I had 0 conversations during my 4 hours. \n\nLets talk playing. The game is boring. Since I just mentioned the objective, lets talk about the NPC's ETC. [b] I got this game for free, I cannot emphasize how little this game means to me. It's terrible. [/b] The NPC's & story were not part of core development therefore the game suffers. You get stuck doing some quests you don't care about and play a game you'd rather not play. The NPC's are essential as expected so, you cannot kill them either. \n\nMicrotransactions Via Atomic Shop & Premium plague the game [i] but lets talk about more! [/i] There's free events like a crate dropping & player trading outposts. Wanna know what's wrong here? The game boils down to, find a player trading outpost and buy sh*t, or just dropping crates? well the crates are full of nothing. the games gear-towards premium really gives you nothing in terms of loot so you're playing what is a hollow, unfinished, boring, game. Even in 2021! \n\nCreatures & enemies are cool however there's a big issue of the game not being cool. You may say its worth it to play just to engage the wild-life but even they feel soul-less and void of life. I don't know how you make a game so devoid of soul really. I've met mannequins with more personality than anything I met in Fallout 76. \n\nThe world isn't interesting, it's a barren void forestry area. Sometimes you get a tiny bit of quest, however aside from this game being a complete and utter lore-destroyer for those interested, what it does leave is not good enough to compensate for all of the cons. Honestly, if this was a mod for 4, I'd feel better. But even when getting this for free, I feel scammed.\n\n[b] I'll end this by repeating my hours. 4. At no point was I excited. Enthralled. Interested. I sat for 4 hours, wanting to tear my hair out and scream, because I was so bored. I had tests in school, more interesting than this. The entire 4 hours I spent playing, I wish I had played anything else, & I got this for free! I genuinely wish you the best of help if you end up buying this game. It's horrific. [/b]",

      "I came across Dreamscaper after playing 200 hours of Hades. I was looking for similar games that could recapture some of the magic of discovery and progression that made Hades such a delightful experience.\n\nDreamscaper is not Hades. There probably isn't any game that can measure up to the experience of playing Hades, and there probably won't be for a long while. But a lot of the same elements are there, and I did really enjoy Dreamscaper for what it was.\n\nThe \"story\" in Dreamscaper is more of a personal journey. There aren't really \"events occurring\" so much as a character working through her issues. The supporting characters are fairly interesting, though not quite on par with the literally larger-than-life dynamic personalities of Hades. But to be fair, the characters in Dreamscaper are ordinary folks, not mythological deities.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the game is \"nostalgic.\" It's an exploration of the protagonist's childhood memories, so that makes sense. There is a very different energy here than Hades' cheeky and horny angst. It's more sad and calm.\n\nIn terms of the feel of playing the game, Dreamscaper has a lot of similarities to Hades. There is a varied arsenal of different weapons and abilities, progression through randomized levels with boss fights, a wide selection of permanent character upgrades to purchase using resources gathered during runs, a relationship system to grow closer with the characters, etc. Unlike Hades, every aspect of your loadout can change throughout a run: you can swap out weapons and abilities as you encounter new and better ones along the way. It's both more flexible than Hades and less; you're not locked in to one weapon for the entire run, and there are many more weapons and abilities (and combinations thereof); but with more randomness comes less control, so it's a lot harder to craft and hone a particular build in Dreamscaper than in Hades. A lot of the \"builds\" are elemental damage modifiers, in which all you're trying to do is find a bunch of gear that (say) deals Lightning damage or increases your Lightning damage dealt. The upgrades are largely \"number get bigger,\" and while it can be satisfying to get a bunch of cool multipliers, it does feel less \"combo\"y or \"breakable\" than Hades (though there are certainly some very powerful and broken-feeling builds you can end up with).\n\nThe gameplay is challenging, like Hades, though perhaps slightly less. Like Hades, a lot of your ability to clear rooms and defeat bosses effectively comes from learning their attack patterns and timings. I do wish there were more variety to the enemies, as many of them are just \"the guy from the last level but he is stronger and has more abilities now\" (though that criticism applies to Hades as well). The boss fights are by and large much easier once you learn their patterns, though there are still a few that can be tough for certain builds. The \"hard version\" of bosses are definitely a force to be reckoned with, though.\n\nThe art and music are attractive and inviting. It's much more The Sims than Guilty Gear, but in a way that fits the atmosphere nicely. It's stylized in a very different way than Hades, but it works in its own way.\n\nThe developers are also very community-oriented and are responsive to community input through their Discord. The Hades developers probably are too, but I have no direct experience interacting with them.\n\nSo in conclusion, if you liked Hades because of its horny angst, badass metal riffs, mythological themes, and bloody humor, you may not have much interest in Dreamscaper. But if you liked Hades because of its randomized runs, variety of weapons and builds, feeling of progression, challenging boss fights, and dynamic cast of characters with complicated relationships, then you should absolutely pick up Dreamscaper. And if you didn't like Hades, then you probably stopped reading this review after the first paragraph.",

      "Not For Broadcast is in the simplest of terms, a multi-tasking simulator.\n\nYou sit in a news control room and you have to keep track of multiple things: censoring curse words, switching between cameras, playing ads at the right time, ensuring your broadcast frequency isn't disrupted, as well as keeping an eye out for a bunch of other strange things that appear later in the game.\n\nThis isn't the easiest of games as it requires a good deal of attentiveness. The description isn't joking when they call this \"high-pressure\". You have to rely heavily on both audio and visual cues to make sure your broadcast doesn't get screwed up. As this is the news (and live), there is no rewind or undo button. If you mess up and want to get a good performance grade, you'll need to redo the entire news segment. \nIf you're a perfectionist like me, a 10 min segment can end up turning into an hour of trying to perfect that news segment. As such, I do hope an option to quick save, or at the very least, save and quit, can later be put into the game. It felt rather taxing having to keep an eye on so many things for so long. But as with any game, excellence isn't an art, it's a habit. You'll find yourself turning into a multitasking expert eventually.\n\nThankfully, the actors in the game do a great job of making the experience an entertaining one. There is a good amount of humour written into each broadcast, although I must admit I wasn't quite able to pay attention to all the dialogue, as I was too busy trying to switch to the right cameras whilst ensuring my electricity didn't get cut out. Luckily, the game does have an archive which allows you to playback the broadcasts. Without that, I'd probably be missing out on 70% of what was going on.\n\nThere is also a text narrative, choices matter portion in between news segments. As of now, it feels a little out of place and incomplete, but then again, this is an Early Access review.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that at the time of writing this review, there isn't really any \"propaganda\" aspect to the game yet.\n\nPerformance-wise, the game runs pretty smoothly. I did encounter occasional crashes if I looked left or right and back and forth too quickly, but other than that, the game is pretty much bug-free. Also, this game has my RTX 2070 Super running at rather high temps for some reason. Rather surprising for a game that doesn't appear to have particularly high-end graphics.\n\nAnyway, I'll be looking forward to see what comes next for this game. Definitely worth the buy despite being Early Access.",

It is good, it is fun and runs great on the Steam Deck, which is especially important to me, as I tend to travel a lot as part of my job.\n\nThat being said, however, is core of the issue: The Always-On-DRM actually prevents me from playing this game on the go. Having this sort of DRM is, in my opinion, only predatory and inexcusable in any way. I get that the online-components of the game will not work when I am on the move, but I am mainly interested in the single player experience, from which I am also locked out. I am even locked out of the main menu without a stable internet collection, which is just ridiculous.",
      "First of all, I really like the Game, it's Gameplay is wonderful and i really enjoy the parkour to combat mix in it. Although i noticed a lot of bugs especially in COOP i still enjoy logging on the game.\n\nThe Story is good but doesn't need a upgrade in my opinion. I like that certain map changes and Story decisions are dependant on some side quests and on each other.\n\nNow to the sad part:\n\nTencent recently bought Techland which was controversial at first, but then DL points were added which made a lot of people mad at Tencent and partially Techland, understandably.\nThey Including me don't want the game to die out because a greedy company wants to make some quick buck.\n\nAlthough i have to say myself, other Tencent bought games still are quite enjoyable.\n\nI just hope that Techland does the right thing in future and makes the current state of DL points less predatory and more Cosmetic based pure.\n\nIn it current state we still have no knifes without Bundles, but that was before Tencent so the blame for that goes to Techland, but i am excited for future updates and playing Dying light 2, even without buying DL points :)\n\nI'll give this game a solid 7/10 for the bugs, microtransactions but also because it has good gameplay and community reach\n\n(I have edited my original negative review about the pure rant about DL points because i also wanted to consider current gameplay and more)",
      "Hi dev, if you were wondering whether anyone would actually use your HDR feature, I am. thanks",
      "I played this game because I had a very strained relationship with my mother somewhere along my teenage years and in the end it came to be that we never saw each other anymore, nor had anymore contact as well. I decided to give this game a try because I wanted to feel what was like to have that bubbly bond between a mother and son again, back when I was younger. \n\nWell, it gave those feelings back to me, and it gave it like a sucker punch to the guts. \n\nI still listen to the OST from time to time and it still reminds me of times of childhood back before when everything became so terrifying.\n\nGive your mother a hug or a call at least if you can before you can never anymore.",
      "Alpha, Beta, Finished Product... I hear lots of Blah blah blahs complaining about this game not being out of Alpha after years and years, but it isn't like we've been paying a monthly fee for it.  I paid one time to support this game and I've got years of play out of a product that I enjoy.  There aren't too many games that scratch an itch like this game for me... Open World, completely editable/buildable environment and zombies!  One of my biggest issues with a game that I like is that after I buy it, they release a few DLCs and then move on to their next product.  Alpha, Beta, Finished or Not... the developers have given me years of standing by their product and many updates with new content and mechanics.  For that alone, I love their game!\n\nGraphics: 3 outta 5 graphics, she looks a little dated but they keep updating it... It looks better than it originally did.  There's growth\nReplayability: 5 outta 5\nGameplay:3 outta 5... sometimes she's a little clunky\n\nI definitely still believe that this game is worth buying and that they devs and their product is worth supporting.  Hopefully this is helpful to someone.",
      "Oh boy. This is a beautiful game. There's unlockable items, a hidden boss, lots of enemies, and characters that change your play styles. Numerous ways to make the game accessible for you!\n\nBut is the game fun? I'd say no, the game was just ok. I wasn't really solving puzzles so much dealing with a RNG generator. Ironically the bosses felt slower and more boring than the levels, they are a battle of patience, wait until the potions fall - hit them 3 or 4 times - repeat.\n\nWould I revisit this game after some patches or dlc? No, probably not. Unfortunately I think this game has some base design problems and not content or quality problems.",
      "No matter what the reviews say, this game is pretty excellent.\nGameplay wise its pretty good, the match 3 systems are fun and almost exciting to play at times.\nTheres no sex, which isn't a bad thing as if thats what you're looking for just search for it online lol\nThe stories are good and the designs are pretty, sure it's short but it fits the pricepoint.\n\nThe developers have announced that they've gone bankrupt which is a shame but what can you do.\n\nOverall 8/10",

      "Stephen's Sausage Roll is a game that the developer doesn't want normal people to buy, it seems. The description is literally, \"A simple 3d puzzle game.\", there is one video that shows you nothing about the game, and it's priced at $32 CND.\n\nFortunately, I'm here to tell you to get off your ass and to buy this wonderful game. The graphics are alright, the music is OK, but the puzzles are sublime.\n\nIn each level, the goal is the same: cook all the sausages and exit the level by standing on the exit level sign in the right orientation. You cook sausages by pushing them over a grill. Like in sokoban games, you can't pull the sausage (yet...), only push it. Another huge wrinkle is that sides of the sausage can only touch the grill once. If you touch a cooked side of a sausage to the grill, it will be burned and you fail the level. This little wrinkle will make you pull your hair out in some levels as you try and figure out how the hell you are going to maneuver the sausages around so they get cooked properly. A neat thing about the game is that if you fail, you can still continue playing the level, which might help you figure out how to play it.\n\nYou'll have a section (part of an island) that has a number of puzzles for you to solve in any order, so if you get stuck, you can try another one (until you get to the last puzzle of the section). Once you complete a section, a new section will open up with more puzzles.\n\nYour little guy has tank controls, which you will find extremely useful, as turning to the left or right near a sausage will push it in different directions. A nice detail is that the all of the puzzles make up the island section. When you activate a puzzle, the rest of the island drops away into the sea, leaving you on a tiny puzzle island.\n\nEach section introduces new mechanics into the game. First you'll just be pushing the sausages, but then you'll be stacking them, skewering them (you would think this would make things easier, but no! You can't turn when you have a skewered sausage!), walking on them...\n\nI would say that these levels are on the level of Snakebird, though I found many of them easier than Snakebird's puzzles (maybe I'm better at sokoban games than I know?). These are the kind of puzzles that you walk away from frustrated, but come back to a few hours later with the solution. This is the game where there are so many ah-ha! moments that make you feel smart. You have no idea what to do at first, but eventually you get better and better. You might not see solutions at first, but you begin to see where you need to go to solve the puzzle, and then work backwards from there. It's wonderful!\n\nIf you're having trouble, there's a community guide that has all the solutions, which is super helpful (though not as much when I was playing because it wasn't complete!).\n\nIt might be expensive, but I took 36 hours to solve all the puzzles and it was worth every penny.",
      "Early review right now after a quick hour of play.\n\nLater Alligator (and I swear I'm not biased towards this game at all) is a gorgeously 2d-animated, primarily point-and-click, cartoony romp through Alligator New York City. Everyone's alligators. The gameplay itself is simplistic; unlike normal point-and-click games of this style that you might have come to expect, there's no picking up items, there's no real big decision making. It crosses over more with Professor Layton-style gameplay, wandering around the city and picking up little collectibles by clicking on various pieces of the environment.\n\nScattered in between these are a plentiful trove of minigames in all sorts of styles. As far as I can tell, they begin to increase in complexity the further you go through (for reference, the first minigame is pretty much not fail-able; you're asked to track a Queen in 3 Card Monte, however the hapless alligator running the game barely moves the cards and flails on the two that *aren't* the queen.)\n\nHowever, it seems that the gameplay and the minigames are meant more as a vehicle for the whimsical comedy of the writing and the eclectic cast of characters present throughout the city. Each character is quirky and fun in their own way, with their own little story. And that's the real draw of this game. \n\nSo this game so far doesn't particularly lend itself to anyone looking to challenge themselves. But if you just want some good feelings, a laugh, and a spot of relaxation, Later Alligator delivers in spades.",

      "In my personal opinion,Total War Warhammer 3 is better than its predecessor in every way.\n\nFactions:\nThey did an excellent job t fine tuning the older factions to the point where every faction now feels fully fleshed out and playable. The starting units are fun and the starting areas are usually in a better position. Sure, some factions start off in a really awkward ass places with really strong armies surrounding them, but overall, everything feels much more thought out.\n\nThe new factions they added to this game are fun altho for someone who might be just getting into the game, id recommend going with someone like Grand Cathay and move on from there.\n\nMap:\nThe world map is huge and i love it. The battle fields you fight in are detailed and look absolutely stunning. Fights look like movies sometimes so grab some popcorn and watch your armies die since you were munching on popcorn and not moving your units.\n\nRTS:\nthe RTS side of this game is what got the biggest improvement in my opinion. Everything is so much more clear and the battles just look insanely good. The game feels a bit more fast phase which i don't mind at all since WH2 felt like a battle of attrition sometimes and missile infantry seemed really bad.\n\nOverall i can safely say this i my favorite game currently. The multiplayer is super fun but judging by the reviews some of you leave on this game, its safe to say you have no friends to play with. \n\nDLC might cost bit more than it used to but people will complain about anything if its not free.",
      "I have always wanted to play Resdient Evil 4, and I wanted to play this game so badly.  I am giving a negative review simply because the games FPS on the PC are bad, that could be because of Windows 10 because I heared rumors that the game does not run well on it and such, so that could be the problem.   Another problem I faced is the lip sync is dealyed when it's on the cutscenes so that makes everything slow and such.  The gameplay from what I seen however is pretty great and I think Resdient Evil 4 is a great game, but this port is not, get it for the GC, Will, PS2, or any of the consloes that has this game.",
      "Okay so first and foremost the reason why I'm giving this a thumbs up is simple. The game does what it set out to do perfectly. Because of that I have no complaints about it's style.\n\nHOWEVER.\n\nI personally do not like the game. It is my own personal hangup. But I can understand why other people will enjoy it.\n\nThe game is fast paced, level by level FPS with challenges. Almost every single one of them is timed if not all of them are timed. It's similar to Doom or Killing Floor. Only there are no cusomizations implemented at time of play. \n\nThe game is challenging and offers you many different faucets on those challenges. It has different gun types for different enemies, different strategies and all of them complicated and challenging. But that's the point right?\n\nRegardless, the game was pretty fun and if you're looking for a level by level challenge system set to a similar style of Doom then you might just enjoy this game.\n\nIf this wasn't enough for you then please check out the video on my YouTube Channel for a more precise in depth explanation (link below).\n\nThanks for reading and I hope I helped some of you out there to spend your money wisely.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXiok7bhPdY",
      "I knew Journey is a great game,maybe one of the best video games in history,but...\n\nI didn't know why so many people moved by such a simple gameplay.\nI didn't know why people had a Journey-Fever,even players just bought PS3 only for this game.\nI didn't know how close a relationship could be in 100mins only.\nI didn't know how bad i wished to go back to the peak and stay with my friend i'll never meet again.\n\nNow I Know.\n\n“It is better to walk with a friend in the dark than alone in the light” – Helen Keller\n\nIt was an interesting experience for me, I had never played this game nor heard of it until recently. I went and looked at the store page, My Brother/Friend Ethan-Winters Just Told Me this game in the steam store now, so went ahead and bought it. After buying it, went and started up the game some day later. Went into the game, saw another model character that looks like mine, I thought it was an AI because I had thought it was a single player game. So I decided to play along with it, we went through the story, it progressed quite fast, mainly because we both did not really bother to check out other things. The more I played, the more I realized that the guy I was playing with was most definitely not an AI, it was a genuine player. As we went through the story, our cooperation got smoother, we no longer have a solo player attitude, we would signal to each other, wait for each other and walked, fly with each other. It was smoothing, relaxing, a truly unique experience. Even with the setbacks we had throughout our progression, we never gave up, we stuck together from the desert till the end, when one of us screwed up, we patiently waited for the other, chiming to the person where we are. I remember at the end, when i screwed up a jump and did not see the other player, I was genuinely scared, sad, I frantically searched for the person but to no avail. I was distraught, sad and disappointed but I continued onward. When I went up, there he was, chiming for me, assuring me that he had not left yet. I felt happy, comforted when I saw the person waiting for me and together we finished the story. I am not one to do reviews, but it was such a unique experience among my years of gaming that I had to share it. Thank you, punks for the experience, truly thank you. And thank you, for bothering to read my review.\n\ni'll never forget our journey kind stranger.\n\nThis wasn't a game, it was an experience. I highly recommend you do this.",
      "[h1]One of the few multiplayer games that reminds me that people can be amazing[/h1]\n\nI've been playing games for a long time, I've seen some sh*t. I've seen people crumble, I've lost friends, I've watched people eat each other even when they are winning. When people are supposed to be working together and yet they would rather treat their ally like trash because they refuse to take the blame for their own wrongdoing.\n\nSquad is a game in which I have seen true potential. A group of 40 individuals work together to plan, execute, and accomplish masterful plans to outsmart their enemy. I've seen teams rally from the depths of defeat and flip unwinable games into incredible victories. Heros emerging from the storm of mortars landing upon their bunker, to squad leaders risking their own lives to save those of their squad.\n\nSquad is not a game for the light hearted. To enjoy squad to the fulllest, you must communicate, work together, and form a bond with the soldiers at your side. You are a team, you are a unit, and you will never win alone. Be it a medic patching the wounds of your comrades, a logistics driver supplying your team with the supplies they need at the front line, or a squad leader putting the responsibility of 8 individuals on your shoulders, each person is a vital component of the team.\n\nFor this reason, Squad has now become my most played game on steam. The depth, the people, the comraderie, it's an amazing experience that no other game captures. I encourage you all to try it out on a free weekend as I originally did, I have been playing it ever since.\n\nI'll see you on the front line.",
      "This game vs. HOI3:\n---------------------\n\nAdvantages:\n\n1.) The production system is more interesting and engaging, and far more balanced than the old IC system of HOI3. \n2.) The unit creation system is far more in depth and interesting, featuring many different brigade types and support companies, allowing you to change your divisions however you would like. \n3.) This game is far more stable than HOI3.\n4.) This game is updated regularly and has bugfixes regularly too, with content being added free along with every DLC. \n5.) The modding community of HOI4 is far larger with excellent mods such as Kaiserreich, Millenium Dawn, Red World, and Endseig.\n6.) HOI4 muliplayer is actually playable without making you want to shoot yourself.\n7.) China is no longer something Japan can take within 2 months.\n8.) An actual peace conference system and ideologies that actually impact the game.\n9.) Far easier to get into than HOI3.\n10.) Less railroading and the AI wont spaz if you do something ahistorical.\n11.) Planes are no longer as cancer as they used to be.\n12.) Far less micromanagement if you choose not to want to micro.\n13.) A better tutorial (still not a great one though.)\n\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n1.) The research system is bare bones in comparison to HOI3.\n2.) The War in the Pacific is basically nonexistant and naval warfare is awful (to be improved with next patch, being released eventually:tm:)\n3.) People dont really join the war in HOI4 unless theyre directly attacked, making continents like South America completely useless due to the fact that none of the countries there ever do anything but still build up their military, contributing lag.\n4.) Due to the game's engine, it can only use a single one of your processing cores, meaning regardless of your computer quality the game will run kinda slowly.\n5.) Speaking of slowly, the game is poorly optimized and frame loss is extremely common, especially 1942 onwards, when majors can have upwards of 300+ divisions. \n6.) The AI is often braindead, doing hilariously incompetent things such as charging endlessly into your lines, removing all its troops from your front, leaving major areas completely undefended, and completely ignoring the aerial aspect of the war.\n7.) Specific AI are even more braindead than the rest, specifically island nations, or nations that otherwise need to use navies and airforces more. Yes, the Japanese, American, and British AI are some of the worst in the game. In a WW2 game. \n8.) Your allies are completely useless and often you will find yourself doing all the fighting yourself, or even being hindered by your own allies. Playing as Germany the Italians likely wont place a single division in North Africa. In D-Day, you will either be the only one contributing anything or your allies will contribute so much that the supply is ruined and your troops all die of attrition. As the USSR you will recieve 0 lend lease, and as China you will get absolutely no support from the west. \n9.) HOI3 is a lot cheaper than HOI4\n\n\nOther things which I feel are worth mentioning but arent really advantages or disadvantages:\n\n1.) HOI4 contains a lot more alt-history options, which while not for everyone, are fun to try out. \n2.) The focus-tree system is something completely different from anything in HOI3.\n3.) The game has a less in-depth OOB(Order of Battle), which while to some people is nice because theyre bad with OOB, others dislike. Specifically this game lacks corps. \n4.) The battle-planning system of HOI4, while easier to use than the one in HOI3, is still flawwed. In HOI3 it did absolutely nothing, but in this game it is a core part of playing. Unless you want to mircomanage every single division, like you did in HOI3, you will use this system. \n5.) While simpler, the game still possesses a learning curve.\n\n------------------------\n\nOverall: \n\nHOI4 is a far less grounded and historical experience than HOI3. Is this a good or bad thing? That depends on your perspective. HOI4 obviously has significant advantages over HOI3 in certain areas but many consider HOI3 to be an overall better game. Personally I recommend HOI3 if you want a more micro-intensive, historical experience, and HOI4 if you want to just sit back and relax for a couple hours murdering millions of people. \n\nPersonally I would suggest either game, but thats just me.",

      "Just finished it. Having trouble putting words together.\n\nI went on a road trip around the US last year, and on my way down the west coast was surprised by how many giant factories passed by, puffing smoke into the air. One even had Google reviews, where it became clear that the town residents who worked there posted good reviews, and everyone else wanted the factory gone.\n\nThose did not compare to the oil refineries in Louisiana, one of which I had to pull off of the highway to properly behold. Certainly I'd seen images of them, but in real life their scale is hard to believe. And they're so bright, both because of innumerable light bulbs and the infamous refinery flame spouts. Even going through the pictures I took while worried the refinery security was going to attack, the size of these things accurately portrayed in none of them. I'd already played the NORCO demo by this point, and had it in my mind throughout my time in the area. There was even an encounter with an old man working at a convenience store somewhere around 1-2am who asked me if I believed in God with a crazed look in his eye, something I would not know was reality foreshadowing this game until the past week.\n\nSo my impression here, forming as I type this, is as follows: \n\nThe surreal imagery and sublime writing in NORCO combine to seem more accurate to my brief experience in the places resembling the real life Norco than any photo or video I've seen.\n\nA lot more can be said about this game, but I'm currently trying to untie my thoughts. So maybe later. For now, just know that I'd thoroughly recommend this game.",

      "Before I continue writing my review on this game, I got to say that the PC port of Valkyria Chronicles is one of the best, if not, [u]the[/u] best port. The game was originally exclusive for the PlayStation 3 back in 2008. The game was well received, but garnered low sales that would put the sequels Valkyria Chronicles 2 and 3 on the PSP. I actually never heard of this game before until a few week prior to the PC release on November 2014. That said, I will have to give a standing ovation to Sega for putting an effort to make the PC port well optimized in 1080p (or more) at 60 FPS (or more). Sega has my attention and I will present this review.\n \nValkyria Chronicles focuses on Welkin Gunther, a son of a legendary general who fought in the First Europan War, leads a platoon of some adults and teenage volunteers to defend their country against the invading forces of the Imperial Alliance. The game presents a mix of tactical strategy and third-person action that is very unique in the strategy game genre. Does this game deserve your attention? \n\nThe story takes place in a “fictional” European continent where the Second Europan War was fought primarily between the Atlantic Federation (think of all of the European countries, in a geographical sense) versus the Imperial Alliance (Russia, in a geographic sense). Gallia is a “neutral” country where it contains a unique resource known as Ragnite. Thus, the Imperial Alliance invade Gallia to get Ragnite to fuel up their war resources. One of the greatest parts about the game is how well the developers use analogies from World War II into the game and its execution is well-received. The analogies ranged from weapon designs (like the Gallian Scout weapons that look like the Soviet SVT-40 to the Imperial weaponry comparison to the real-life MP40 and STG44, and plenty others). The analogy extends to vehicles and geopolitical conflicts. \n\nThe character developments in the game are highly impressive, particularly with the relationship between Welkin (protagonist) and Alicia Melchiott (deuteragonist). The themes in Valkyria Chronicles consist a good mix of “light” moments (like hope as an example) and “semi-grotesque” themes of war (such as discrimination/racism, personal ambition over soldiers’ lives, and others themes that will unravel later on). Some reviewers criticized the game as being not serious on the themes about war. Honestly, I don’t think that the game is supposed to be depressing and a good mix between “light” and “dark” is best suited for the game. The story starts really slow in the beginning and actually begin to progress as you reach a certain point in the story. The plot is pretty good in most area while few scenes are a bit “awkward” in terms of sudden shifts between a sad event to a “positive motivation”. \n\nThe gameplay in Valkyria Chronicles is turn-based, but it is very unique because once you click on a character to choose, you can actually control the character to move to any location in third-person you like as long you have enough Action Points (basically, the movement bar). Experience points and money are earned by Ranks (like A, B, C, and D) by completing an objective within a certain number of turns (Example: Getting a ‘A’ rank within 3 turns or less to get the maximum amount of exp and money). However, it is possible that you can actually kill all of the enemies on the map, complete the objective, and still get an ‘A’ rank in the majority of missions (except for a few of them). \n\nWith the exp and money, you train your soldiers based on classes Scout, Shocktrooper, Lancer (Anti-Tank/Explosives), Engineers, and Sniper rather than individuals. The money are used up to upgrade weapons, buy tank parts, and purchasing “reports” from a reporter in certain chapters in the story. The game would last you a good 30-50 hours if you play the game in a smart, tactical manner or have an “OCD” on getting an “A” rank on every single mission in the story or a mix of both (like I did). \n\nThe game does have some faults, particularly when it comes to classes. Reviewers argued that Scouts are too overpowered, but in my view, it is best to say that scouts are too reliable since they have the most movement bar and top-tier weapons like the ZM Kar 8 (the game's version of Soviet PTRS-41 that can obliterate any enemy, even medium and heavy tanks if you shoot it in the back). Engineers are useless in the game since you won’t repair your tank very often (depending on your play style) and Scouts are the better alternative. There are some bugs in the game that is related to the monitor refresh rate (if you play it on a 144 Hz monitor like I did) in certain missions in the story. PC controls are a bit awkward when you control the tank. There are a few moments in the story that has some poor “transitions” (an example would be that an upsetting moment happened in the story and all of a sudden, some of the major characters wanted a medal for their part on a major battle in the next cutscene as if that upsetting moment never happen or affected them). \n\nThe game is often compared to XCOM when it comes to gameplay. This may be true, but Valkyria Chronicles is very unique since you can actually control the character in third person instead of the computer doing it for you when you command the character to move from Point A to B, in bird’s eye view. The game engine is very aesthetic and presents the story very well. I’m glad the Sega released Valkyria Chronicles to the PC and I am very pleased to hear that a (possible) new Valkyria Chronicles game is being trademarked (and hopefully in development) thanks to the PC sales. The default price of $20 is a good deal, -50% off is a great deal, -75% is a perfect steal. Valkyria Chronicles is one of my top games for 2014 due to its unique strategy gameplay and superb PC port optimization. I am looking forward for the new game that is being trademarked (or possible PC ports or revamp for VC2 and 3). This game has my highest recommendation for any strategy gamer who want to find something original, unique, and beautiful.",
      "Ok to make it short.\n\n- Poor graphics (like 10 years old PC game)\nBUT nothing more to complain about.\n\n- great atmosphere, great story, very good fighting mechanics. Of course great price.\n\nIf you have nothing against japan style - just play the game. One of funniest games in some years for me.",
      "Delete the intro.\n\nHonest Edit:\n\n Actually pretty sweet game.  Lots of things I don't like in terms of menu navigation and difficulty curve, but conceptually one of the better games I've played in awhile.  I just wish the controls weren't so poor. Very tedious with doubletap movement to dodge/counter (keyboard)\n\nAlso not very optimized for steam link or the steam controller. In general the worst parts of this game are directly attributed to the fact that this is a port. One of the worst port jobs i've seen to be honest.  Definitely play with a good controller. \n\nThe game also does a poor job of introducing the \"extended\" story, I nearly missed what i would consider the best part of the game just because I stopped after the first round of credits. There is actually a ton more content afterwards. Very worth investing the time into watching everything play out.",
      "Steam keeps on bothering me to write a review for this game so here's one , i guess.\n\nYou might have heard this ' there's nothing like it on the market ' description of Hunt : Showdown and frankly i must admit that it is mostly spot on. This game is pretty unique and intriguing mix of PVE and PVP within setting which i frankly doubt i ever really saw used in a video game before. We are talking about end of 19th century Louisiana  mixed with paranormal horror activity.\n\nIf you would take a super brief look at Hunt's gameplay loop one could mistakenly assume that it is a battle royal game and while there are few similarities between the two, Hunt has a really original and unique gameplay loop i have never seen done before in a video game.\n\nCore idea here is that you enter a map , which is 1km x 1km square , either alone , in a duo or a trio of hunters and your main goal is to look for clues to locate a boss , kill him , banish him and extract with a bounty. Sounds simple enough , right? But that is there fun actually behinds. Besides having to contend with PVE part of the game , that is various kind of AI controlled zombies ( for the lack of better word ) , number of sound traps like injured animals ,crows ,caged chickens and dogs ( of whom all make loud noises then disturbed in turn giving out your location and even direction you are moving in ) , you are also not alone in a pursuit of that bounty. That is there PVP part of game kicks in .\n\nEven  though this is  PVPVE game , PVE is here only to slow down you rather than being a real threat. Real threat comes from other players who also have same goal as you. Real 'meat' of this game is PVP and while you can choose and avoid PVP all together , you will not have much fun while doing so. Bosses , again , are mostly there to funnel players into the same area to initiate PVP fights.\n\nPVP is rough and tough in Hunt. From what i understand earlier in it's life it was even more hardcore , but even at it's current state this game is not for faint hearted folks. Kill times are low , weapons are mostly single shots so each shot counts ( fitting the settings and time period ) and while on a surface this could look like a simple point and shoot situation there are dozens upon dozens of systems and things to consider in each firefight so you will need tens and in some cases hundreds of hours to really start to feel what are you doing. \n\n I wont lie to you , for first 20 or 30 hours i was pretty much cowering behind stuff in each firefights in essence being a glorified decoy for enemy players while my team mate hopefully was doing something less useless.  Hunt can be really stressful with steep learning curve, perma death ( losing your hunter with all his/her equipment you spent so much money on ) and never knowing who has your in their scopes while crossing open fields but it also can be so very rewarding when you survive a final server wide gunfight on your last bullet and out of healing items. Even 140 hours in some of the firefights leaves me with my heart pounding which is a rare occasion after playing video games and FPS game for more than 25 years now.\n\nThere are of course bunch of technical issues, questionable decisions from the dev team and other negatives associated with any competitive online game so be aware of that before you decide to enter Bayou .",
      "I have played enough of this game to say that I really, really love it.\n\nI have played every Assassin's Creed game, even the ones on the DS and the mediocre PSP game. This is by far the best Assassin's Creed.\n\nFirst of all, the naval combat is intuitive and really fluid and satisfying. The combat is the same \"Press B to counter\", but the addition of guns and darts do make things more interesting.\n\nWhile most of the time you are at sea \"pirating\", the sections on land are also really good. While the tailing and eavesdropping sessions are frustrating at times and boring at others, the free running is more fluid than ever, with realistic animations and few obstacles that can stop you.\n\nThe story is interesting and does encourage you to play all the main missions. However, there is a huge variety of side missions that can be played as soon as you get your ship to sail the enormous maps, where many ships sail and where whales swim.\n\nI have not played a lot of the multiplayer because I don't find it that interesting and varied.\n\nOverall, this is the best AC game so far: improved gameplay, lenghty and fun, it only makes me more pumped for Assassin's Creed Unity.\n\nSCORE: 90/100",

      "I had avoided this due to the bad reviews down to its apparent abandonment on the PC platform by the developers.

So glad I did as, in my opinion this is the best MK game I have ever played. \n\nIts absurdly beautiful with superb animations.\nThe arenas looks fantastic and the characters feel and react as if they are really within the scene rather than floating around on top, this is added to by some great arena interactions.\n\nThere is loads of content and characters, although I would love to see the NPC characters such as Rain included. \n\nThe story is actually really interesting certainly the most gripping I have encountered in this genre.\n\nBut the fluidity, God! the fluidity of the fighting! its soooo good.

      "In 2013, after 10 years of waiting, the Sim City community of modders, fans, and aficionados rushed out to purchase the fifth installment of Sim City. Ten years is a long time to wait for a game, but people had a lot of faith in Maxis when they announced the title. Long story short, it was a massive dissapointment. Maxis and EA crippled Sim City 5 with DRM, Always On APM, tiny maps, forced origin installation, lacking mod support, no steam support, and a forced multiplayer aspect.  I decided to not purchase the title, so it may have been a decent game, but 2 years later a team of 12 people created a game that does everything maxis insisted was utterly and totaly impossible.  \n\nEverything the mod community did that kept Sim City 4 on the shelves in Wallmarts across America for an entire decade was ignored. Maxis (and to a lesser extent EA) ignored the fans, and gave the people who had kept them in business for twenty years a crippled subpar game.  And for that Maxis is now out of business. They will never make another game, and it is no one's fault but theirs.\n\nNow pretend none of that happened. It's 2013 again, and here it is people: Sim City 5. \n\nThe game balance is a bit on the easy side for veterans of the genre, but the potential map size is ENOURMOUS and customizing your city could fill up years of gameplay time.  The game runs so smoothly with so much going on, it really shows how lazy Maxis was with their approach.  The glass in buildings reflects the sun and the buildings near it, there are dynamic shadows, zoning is back, and it is not 'dumbed down'.  A single tile in this game is twice the size of the alloted map in Sim City, and you can purchase dozens of additional tiles to expand.  The map editor is awesome, the community is thriving, there are mods to do anything you want, and this is the city building game we've all been waiting for.  I can not possibly reccomend this more.",
      "Playing this game for the first time six years after its initial release proved to be a delight in disguise. With all the memes and jokes established, I was finally able to understand what the fuss was all about back in 2011.

      "[h1]Strategy at its finest[/h1]\n\nInto the Breach is Subset Game’s latest title, following on from their massive hit, FTL. I put off trying Into the Breach for a long while, but I finally got it when it dropped down to $10 on HB a couple of months ago and I’m so glad I did. This game isn’t for everyone, it’s kind of rogue-like mech chess, but if it clicks for you then it’ll be one of the best strategy games you’ll ever play.\n\n[h1]Positives:[/h1]\n[list][*]First up, the game looks fantastic. The pixel art here is great, from the backgrounds to the mechs and even the pilot portraits. The animations here area also really good. There’s nothing too complicated here but it’s all well executed. On the topic of appearances, I also really like the way the maps are laid out, the 8x8 grids on a plain background work really well here and it reminds me of simple boardgames. I think it works well for the game.\n\n[*]As with any good strategy game, it’s easy to pick up, but hard to master. You have a squad of three mechs (there are a few different mech groups to unlock with gold coins (?) and you can also create custom groups from the mechs you’ve unlocked). Each group has a unique element, but they all follow the basic structure of one close-range mech, one long-range mech and one support mech. Each mech has a different ability/weapon and they’re all well varied. The mech teams are really well designed here so that no one mech is super powerful and they all work really well as a unit. \n\n[*]The combat is excellent. It’s really simple but it works so well. You’ll quickly learn the different roles your mechs have and figure out the best strategies to use them. There are two ways to kill most enemies. Getting rid of all of their HP or pushing them into water/lava (with the exception of boss enemies or flying enemies). However, a lot of the time you probably won’t even be trying to kill your enemies in a given turn. You can always see what the enemies will do on their next turn and so you always want to be playing to react to/prevent their next move. Typically, enemies target civilian buildings or buildings related to your objective, so it’s usually better to focus on moving them away from these buildings rather than focusing on killing them. If you’re really smart/lucky you can also push enemies so that they attack each other, as friendly fire is a major part of this game. It’s really satisfying when you line it up right so the enemies are killing each other rather than attacking you or the buildings you defend. You can even block them from spawning by moving something on top of them!\n\n[*]Unlocks in this game are handled better than in FTL in my opinion. There are six actions that you can complete with each mech squad to earn those gold coins I mentioned in order to unlock new mech squads. The first three are the three possible victories: two, three and four island (more on that in a second) and then the other three achievements are unique to each mech squad. They’re centred around the unique aspect of each squad, tasking you to get a bit creative with the way that you’re playing. I know some players didn’t like the way that unlocks worked but I think it’s a really good way to handle it and encourages you to try new strategies. \n\n[*]The game has five islands, with one of those being the final boss fight. Each island is basically a different biome with different enemies and environmental hazards. They aren’t necessarily easier or harder than each other to start with, but the difficulty does increase as you move from island to island. There is some crossover with the enemies you’ll see, but they at the very least have a different appearance and most of them behave differently. There are also enemies unique to each island. \n\n[*]On each island, you’ll need to complete several missions before facing off against the island’s mini-boss. The missions all have different objectives for you to complete, though the win condition is always just to survive all of the turns (typically 5 turns). The different objectives vary but there are usual two, with some easier missions only having one and harder missions having three. Completing these objectives gets you certain rewards. You can either get stars, which are used upon completing an island to purchase new pilots, abilities or weapons. There is grid power which restores or increases the grid power you start with (grid power is lost when buildings are destroyed, losing all grid power results in a loss). Lastly, some of the missions award power cores (usually you only see this as the third reward for a hard mission) which allow you to upgrade your mech’s weapons or abilities (super handy). The mission variety is fairly good.\n\n[*]There are a range of different pilots in the game. You always start with one ‘special’ pilot and two regular pilots but more can be found in cryo-pods or bought at the end-of-island store. All pilots earn xp at the end of missions and when they level up they get some kind of upgrade, like more mech health or an extra movement per turn. The ‘special’ pilots all have some kind of special ability, such as being able to attack twice if you don’t move or the ability for the piloted mech to fly. Some of these require a power core, but they’re definitely worth it.  [/list]\n\n[h1]Negatives: [/h1]\n[list][*]Honestly, I’m clutching at straws here for negatives. One thing I would mention is that I don’t think this game will have as much replay value as FTL does for most people (completionists have an awful lot to do here) which shouldn’t put you off from getting it, but is something to base your expectations on. I also felt like Chris Avellone was a bit wasted on this game, his writing is fantastic but there just isn’t much of it. [/list]\n\n[h1]Verdict: [/h1]\n\nInto the Breach is as close to a perfect strategy game as I’ve ever played and it’s an excellent follow-up to FTL. This game is easy to pick up, hard to master and it looks beautiful the whole time you’re playing this weird mech chess. I can’t recommend this enough and at $15 it’s an absolute steal. This was easily one of my favourite releases of 2018 and anyone who likes strategy absolutely needs this in their library. \n\nIf you found this review helpful, please check out my other reviews over at [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33633486/]Kemo's Corner.[/url]",
      "Really didn't plan on reviewing, but noticed a lot of people asking if this is worth $15 on sale. Short version - definitely yes. Now onto specifics...\n\nOffline modes are very much improved. Expansion teams for MyGM/MyLeague, with expansion draft of course, and customization options for those are really cool, for example if you're looking to create a legitimate historic team court and things, you can actually get pretty close using just in-game editor. Only bad part is that you can only create 2 custom jerseys (home and away) per team. MyCareer is a vast improvement over last year, specifically due to absence of the Spike Lee story. There's a new \"story\" so to speak, it irks some people, but it's not too bad and you still have control over the entire season. One downside is due to new player archetypes, you're effectively reduced to a role player even when you reach your maximum. Personally I can still hit triple-double average on Hall of Fame difficulty with my primary player, but the new stat caps severely limit the player potential. Ironically, you can't at all play some of the iconic player archetypes such as true all-around, 3 and D, or Dunker/Defensive Specialist.\n\nOnline modes on PC are... disgusting. First off there's a smaller player base, so you're bound to run into some queue times, or a completely dead queue very late in the night. Also, the game is susceptible to cheats, for example, only couple of months ago they blocked one particular cheat from MyTeam auction house, which was blatantly obvious and apparent and had very bad impact on economy. I won't go into details here as I don't want to be seen as advertising cheating, but I think it's very obvious they are weak on the ban hammer side, and the game itself is weak on protection. Also there is the unavoidable server lag for online modes, couple of sources close to the company explained that all servers are in Virginia, US, even the EU or Asian servers.\n\nGameplay is improved over the last year, primary addition being various types of Pick and Roll defenses, you can literally see different teams using different defenses and things like that. However I feel it's important to note that stock difficulty settings are sorely lacking in realism/simulation aspect. They are all very much arcade. However, there are lot of simulation slider settings listed at OperationSports for example, and once you tweak them, the game really shines. Of course, there are still couple of bad animations that can't be completely avoided, but custom sliders help out a lot in this regard. I should note that by default MyCareer doesn't allow custom slider settings, but there's a mod tool that can be used to accomplish this.\n\nGraphics of course you can easily see in any random gameplay video - they are obviously improved over last year(s). One part that sort of falls into this category that is dramatically worse are the replays. About 50% of the time, the replay will use the silly rim camera, and you won't be able to see the play at all.\n\nIn summary, as you can probably tell from the hours I played, I find this to be a great game, not like we really have a choice on PC when it comes to basketball. After thoroughly playing most of the game modes (except Play Now Online & All Star Team-Up), I'd easily recommend this to any basketball fan. However, keep in mind that online modes can be very frustrating, and if that's your primary reason for purchasing, it might be wise to wait and see how 2k18 turns out in that regard.",

      "Edit: ARCANE HALLOWS REVIEW (Written Feb. 19 2021)\n\nRoguelike Enthusiast's Caveat: The player's progression is directed in a much longer scale over multiple playthroughs due to the nonlinear nature of exploration unlike Hades or Skul. There is also a higher focus on evading stage hazards than said roguelites, with more control in how you start your run than needing to worry about coordinating a build throughout.\n\nNew Player's Verdict: The most recent large update for the game now makes the game well worth the price. Overall changes to the game makes the early-game far more approachable and increased the player's survivability all around while easing power progression.\n\nNew Resolve system for making powerups far less punishing is great. They added features to reroll power up selections as they add more, same with being able to rerolling character selection now that they added (two more very fun and powerful) new classes. The Skeleton Key, one such new randomized power up, addressed my issues with Fairy Chests which are a major source of character progression. \n\nEvery class offers such a unique playstyle while also having great power in their own right (though right now I feel the weakest classes are Ranger and Mage)\n\nNow if we could be able to rechallenge bosses we've beaten that would put me over the moon\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW (Written Feb. 4 2021)\n\nAbridged Verdict: Wait for Arcane Hallows Update (Feb. 18 2021) before purchasing for total content volume that matches RL1 along with additional QoL changes\n\nThe latest update as of writing this review (Far Shores) added 2 whole new areas, I bought EA awhile back but didn't really play much until this update, as the amount of content in the game effectively tripled between the areas, new classes, and QoL additions.\n\nGame is more accessible than RL1 for sure, but seems harder to get into than Hades, especially for people not used to roguelites. Namely, its far more punishing and harder to recover from mistakes.\n\nThings I love: The whimsical charm, the much more varied aesthetics of biomes as well as each biome having unique structures (Axis Mundi being a long hallway that makes it more akin to a Classicvania stage is genius). Classes having much more unique and pronounced playstyles adds much replayability. Boss mechanics and designs are much more complex this time around and the way they test your mastery of heirlooms is excellent. The new Armor System as a separate way to reinforce HP and the Mastery system to get steady stat increases go a long way to helping player progression. I'm seriously hooked on the gameplay loop in a way that I wasn't with RL1, every class is so much fun, and I'm so looking forward to the next update!\n\nMy Gripes: Runes are a total gamechanger that can make your life so much easier. Unfortunately the Fairy Chests that contain them are randomly spawned, and as a new player whether you can actually find and survive to one is a steep uphill road, and sometimes they just aren't possible without a specific class. The execution required for some challenges will be extremely difficult for more casual players and thus their ability to progress overall will be greatly hampered without the likes of things such as a soulsteal rune to recover HP. If there's an algorithm that sorts relative difficulty of Fairy Chest rooms, I would like if there were a way to increase the likelihood of creating Fairy Chest rooms if the player hasn't found any, and gradually make them more accessible until the player finds one. Additionally I would like if every Fairy Chest contained runes until you find them all in a biome, as I've gotten hordes of Gemstones from Fairy Chests before getting another rune or rune upgrade\n\nRelics. I'm looking forward to the Resolve system update because as of now, the hits to max HP are incredibly devastating, especially if you don't find a room that can give you the nectar to increase your max HP again (and even then its a huge gamble since you take a lot of damage from it). Most of them don't really feel worth the tradeoff as of right now, unless you find the War Drum to continually increase damage. If we can get a vendor to \"rent\" one (1) relic among a selection of ones we found for a certain amount of gold or something, similar to heirs that start with a relic without losing max HP would add a certain level of accessibility without removing the randomness aspect of roguelikes\n\nWhile all enemy attacks are technically possible to evade, this isn't always the case when you have certain combinations of enemies (Frostens and Aqua Braces in a room with a floor thats all spikes is so mean ; A;). Sometimes you'll spawn into a room next to a Warg that will immediately headbutt you before you can react and suddenly you take 70 damage. I would appreciate if certain enemies were stationary upon entering a room so you have time to process and react accordingly.\n\nEnemy damage scales extremely fast as you move through the map, along with their attacks becoming more frantic or complex, without means to restore HP and Armor through the specific runes, most classes' having lower max HP get real squishy.\n\nOne of the Duelist class's main attraction is that their talent gives them invulnerability windows with a roll, but it can't always be used of you're in a tight position without much room to move. I hope that they add a small invul window to the Dash heirloom, with runes to increase that window, but make it much smaller than the Duelist's (say 1/5th the time of whatever the window is of Duelist's talent)\n\nAnyways, despite my misgivings with the game I listed here, the game is really fun and a lot more accessible and varied than the original game, wait for it to go on sale and pick it up!",
      "IMHO this game is highly over-hyped, glad I only spend a few € and bought it at sale.\n\n- Basic concept of dungeon crawling with horror is copied from D&D Ravenloft or Call of Cuthullu. So nothing new here. \n- Story is simple and stereotypical: Old man evokes some unnamed horror in a cursed mansion that curses the land...  \n- Graphics are nicely painted ... but still painted, so outdated concept. It's a indy game, ok ... and maybe some gamers still love playing games on their 386er personal computers from 1990 ...\n- The gameplay itself is IMHO stale, because it's always the same: go into a dungeon. Fight. Grind. Survive.\n- Stress could be an interesting factor, but not in the way it is implemented. In its current form is nothing but a second health bar, which is either difficult or expensive to heal. It makes the game not more complex or more interesting but only more frustrating. Stress could be interesting, if it had different stages with different effects. But in its current form and the difficulty of the game itself it is simply idiotic to take stressed heroes into battle. \n- Random number generator is bad. Really bad. Maybe intentional bad? Who knows...?\n\nThe game itself is grind, more grind, and … grind. Combined with the lame story and the frustration it is a game for masochists and people that want to become one.",
      "It's a puzzle game about placing toppings onto donuts and delivering them to different areas on the boar. Great vibe and the first few hours are fun, but it gets incredibly repetitive even with the frequent introduction of new mechanics, especially so if you don't click with said mechanics particularly well. If it's on sale, give it a go - you very well might like it much more than I did.",

      "TLDR:\n\n+ good AI\n+ beautiful graphics\n+ large armies\n+ not as twitchy as StarCraft\n+ good skirmish customization\n+ viable defenses\n+ good but not exceptional SP campaign\n+ good amount of maps\n\n- beefy hardware needed\n- difficult to distinguish units\n- UI / usability not quite where SC is (yet!)\n\nYou might like it if you:\n+ like Supreme Commander\n+ prefer a slower approach to RTSes\n+ like comp stomping alone or with friends\n+ like thousands of units on the screen at the same time.\n\nYou better skip it if you:\n- like StarCraft\n- don't like the SciFi setting\n- buy the game for its narrative / SP campaign\n- have a potato for a PC to run this on.\n\nIt has been said before, but Ashes is quite the spiritual successor to Supreme Commander. The focus is more on the strategic side, rather than the hectic button mashing that is found in StarCraft-like games. Armies move quite slowly, defenses are viable and unit abilities are \"centralised\" in \"orbital\" abilities. Although the game offers a campaign mode and various scenarios, the main focus is on skirmish maps. These skimishes offer a vast amount of options to adjust the rules to your liking (like no air units, defensive bonuses etc.). You can win games by eliminating the enemies HQ or by accumulating victory points by holding special locations. I could swear the AI was adapting its army composition to counter my armies and defenses. \nThe developer is known for supporting their games for a very long time and when you take a look at their design documents, you find that there is still stuff planned in the future:\n- more tech tiers,\n- naval units,\n- overall usability improvements \nand more.\n\nOn the negative side, I find the different units and buildings quite difficult to distinguish. While most of it is due to the fact, that its grounded in science fiction (its not like in Company of Heroes, where a thing that looks like an MG nest is indeed an MG nest and behaves as you think it would), its not clear what a building does just by looking at it. But as times goes by you get used to it.\nAlthough you can queue up multiple buildings and units (even on repeatable queues), or order reinforcements directly from the selected army, the overall usability could still be improved. Its not obvious that building blueprints and waypoints can be moved for excample and the different levels of icons shown when zooming out could be better adjusted.\nIts all rather nit picky though. I am sure that Stardock will keep improving the game!",
      "Game concept is good, but execution is bad. Add to that the attitude of the dev team, and I recommend you don't encourage this kind of community censorship.\n\nDon't buy this. Devs close topics because their fanboys get flamey when you bring up any kind of criticism. Like how the servers with anti-cheat and server saving (which doesn't save player status/location) functions enabled kick all players from the server every 30-60 minutes. I wouldn't mind reconnecting if my location and hunger/thirst got saved during this \"server save\". But apparently trying to open a discussion on the topic is considered flaming and they close down your topic. Horribly handled.\n",
      "[h1]An old classic that's fresher than lots of today's titles.[/h1]\n\n[i]Day of the Tentacle[/i] first launched in 1993. I remember, because I was a teenager then and couldn't play it as my PC didn't meet the minimum requirements! This was actually the sequel to an earlier game, [i]Maniac Mansion[/i], which was released in 1987. I played [i]Maniac Mansion[/i] a few years after it came out, but did not complete it as the game's movement and controls were just too dated and clunky for me (even back then) to be bothered with. \n\nPlaying [i]Maniac Mansion[/i] is not at all necessary in order to enjoy [i]Day of the Tentacle[/i], though those who have will definitely find greater connection to the game's characters, especially the Edison family.\n\n23 years later, [i]Day of the Tentacle Remastered[/i] is essentially the same as it was before, but with sleeker graphics and a more modernised interface. While the story hasn't changed, it surprisingly (or not) hasn't aged one bit either - tentacle mutates and seeks to conquer the world, and only you (and your friends) can stop him! Though straightforward, the game's charm is in its various amusing time travel locations and the weird and wonderful characters you meet along the way. This is a prime example of where [i]\"it's all about the journey, not the destination.\"[/i]\n\n\n[h1]Yays![/h1]\n\n+ Vibrant, colourful, hi-res cartoon-style graphics.\n+ Well-designed rooms, locations and scenery.\n+ Fully voiced, with good voice acting for the most part. (The guy who plays Dr Fred is awesome.)\n+ Interesting, memorable characters.\n+ Fun, amusing story.\n+ Wacky humour.\n+ Clear goals.\n+ Cool easter eggs. (Under \"achievements\".)\n+ Contains a free game ([i]Maniac Mansion[/i])!\n+ Puzzles are mostly enjoyable and require some creative thinking.\n+ Many gameplay hours.\n+ Trading cards.\n\n[h1]Nays.[/h1]\n\n- [url=steamcommunity.com/app/388210/discussions/0/392184522713202518/]Audio starts stuttering[/url] after a while, due to memory problems.\n- Achievements remain hidden, even after the game is completed, so you can't see what you're missing.\n- Some puzzles have illogical or nonsensical solutions.\n- Bugs: e.g. When looking at one of the items, Laverne's voice sounds when Bernard speaks.\n- No mouse command to fast-forward dialogue; instead, you have to press \".\" which is really inconvenient, especially when the whole point of a point-n-click game is to [i]not[/i] have to use your keyboard!\n- Some counter-intuitive puzzle set-ups: E.g. For the videotape puzzle, a button which looks like the \"STOP\" button, is actually the \"RECORD\" button. Anyone who's ever used a VCR or tape recorder would know that the square symbol denotes \"STOP\", while the round button denotes \"RECORD\". \n- Hoagie's periodic belches sound absolutely disgusting!\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nThis was a hugely enjoyable experience from start to finish. Though the nostalgia factor played a part in my case, even if you've never heard of the [i]Maniac Mansion[/i] series, as long as you count yourself a point-n-click adventure game fan, this is a must-play because it just gets so many things right. Add to that the timeless plot and wacky characters, and you have yourself a game that will play just as fresh & new decades down the road.\n\n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [td][u]Disclaimer:[/u] [i]Game played for free, with many thanks to my dear friend [url=steamcommunity.com/id/kflorence]KFlo[/url]. :)[/i][/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]",
      "I technically got this game for free, as it was bought for me from a friend. And honestly, I didn't really like it. She got it for me, as a means to help with some of my mental health issues I suppose? But it just was very big miss for me, and kinda made me feel worse. A bit anxiety inducing for me, just given the circumstances, talking about life and death. Just not my personal cup of tea.",
      "Did you lost faith in parkur adventure, horror and stealth genres? Did you lost hope to see realistic, immersive and HARCORE AAA game without press x to win killstreaks and cluttering UI? Outlast will restore your faith in everything mentioned and game industy! It also will prove you that indie team of 10 men can do AAA-Indie titles without greedy publishers that killing their creative freedom and forcing them to make a Call of Duty and Gears of War accessible for wider re-tar-ded audience. No no no, this game is not accessible to wide audience, it will scare shit out of most players not only because its good horror, but also because it realistic and hardcore stealth just like Thief was and its damn hard for braindead Call of Duty Xbox 360 generation, thats why its damn pleasant for old school gamers such as me who loved realism and challenge in older games before its almost gone from modern games.\nIf you love hard chellenge, innovative, realistc and purely immersive games such as Alone in Dark 2008, and if you hate YOBA call of duty style FPS games, you will love this one! If you love true surival horrors where survival is very hard because you cant even fight back, and if you love Amnesia you will love this game as well, and if you love old Splinter Cell up to Chaos Theory and loved Thief and remember that scarry part in catacomb,  you will love this game too!\nI love this game, its not perfect however, but its almos what i dreamed about for many years. Oh yeah, did i tell you that its one of rare games with full body awareness and every action in game totally animated?\n\nWhat you waiting for ? BUY THIS GAME ALREADY! I cost twice cheaper than most of recent Mediocre AAA games like Tomb Raider 2013, Bioshock Infinite, Resident Evil 6, Splinter Cell Blacklist, Call of Duty BO2, Metro Las Light, Far Cry, Assassin's Creed 3 and so on, but it brings more fun and joy than all of them together. Before this game 2013 year was a year of dissapointment (if you count only AAA type of games), but Outlast  game changed it for me! 10 men can do job better than over 100 men in big companies, and glory of  this game puts all big companies to shame! \n\nAnd a bonus: no precut DLC, no season passes, no achivements and stupid unlocks that turns game intro retarded grind, and most importan -  this game is MOD-FRIENDLY and allows to tweak AI and Difficulty a lot, nothing locked, and critical patches was released just next day after bugs was reported! Trully oldschool PC-specific way of doing business with respect to customers!",
      "The game itself is great, but Square Enix really dropped the ball by removing the true PC version and leaving us with this Switch port as the only option. It's a huge visual downgrade, but it has more content. Luckily though, a small handful of incredible modders have taken the time to painstakingly transfer the old, high-quality PC assets over to this version which is what saved it for me. Without the mods, I would not have kept playing.\n\nIf you're on the fence, I'd say catch it on sale, then head over to a modding site (Nexus is what I used) and start installing the mods that restore this game to its full PC potential. It's probably the easiest-to-mod game I've ever dealt with too btw. You don't have to be super savvy to get things the way you want them and you don't need any additional software. Just grab the .pak files, slap them into the game's pak folder, enjoy. It really is that simple. (You may want to edit some .ini files to tweak things to your liking, but that's as complex as it gets. If you can open Notepad, you can do this.)\n\nAs for the core gameplay, it's an incredibly solid JRPG with a likable cast and well thought out story. There's plenty of content to enjoy here and it has a good end game. The music is absolutely phenomenal as well. Visually, it's very vibrant and the aesthetic is charming. I think it's a fantastic game overall and is very enjoyable as is, but playing it in 1440p/144Hz with high resolution character and texture assets with better lighting/animation mods and subtle character/NPC/monster upgrades totally elevated it to the next level.\n\np.s. If you do install mods, I HIGHLY recommend grabbing the one that removes the black borders around characters! That gives the game a clean and refreshing new feel that greatly improves it in my opinion!",
      "Holy crap.\n\nPowerful.\n\nThis game explores some serious life issues: Abuse. The pain of childhood, and of parenthood. Manhood and womanhood. Strength. Loss.\n\nThis game had me near crying at several points. The story is freaking powerful. It's also remarkably well written, and downright hilarious at times. \n\nAnd the gameplay? \n\nIt's fun enough that I want to play through it again right after beating it. This turn-based RPG is sometimes brutally difficult, in part because it slaps many old-school conventions in the face (e.g., sleeping can be dangerous). Battles are challenging. Tactical thinking is essential since many enemies are VERY dangerous and you're frequently outnumbered. I really applaud the AI as it keeps you on your toes. \n\nThe game doesn't hold your hand. There is no map, compass, or any attempt to make navigation easier. You just have to remember your way around, though there are plenty of memorable environments. \n\nCharacters will force you to make decisions with lasting consequences. There are dozens of hard choices to make along the journey, which brings me to another topic the game explores: decision. Will you save your friends, or your stuff? I got very attached to the buddies I picked up, only to have them devoured by a mutant, or bail on me when I least expected it. You just never know what you'll face, nor what to choose. Thinking back to many of those times, I don't know what I should have done. All the options sucked. \n\nBut I can't help asking myself, \"Did I make the right choice?\" \n\nHighly recommended.",

      "UPDATE: This remains to be one of the best games I have ever played. The company that created the game though... One more launcher that is completely unnecessary. The performance with the 'next-gen' update is horrible. I have half the fps I used to have on the very same rig and that is after going lower with the settings that I used to have. Why did you have to do this b U Ll $I t?\n\n\nThe best way to embrace the true greatness of this game is to look on how the series has improved since the first and the second part of The Witcher. You simply won't find anything that hasn't changed for the better.\n\n- Vast open world that IS NOT randomly created and filled with dull stuff,\n- Story which engages you from the first 10 minutes to the very end,\n- Graphics, even despite the whole controversy of a thing called downgrade, still makes this game THE BEST LOOKING RPG ever created,\n- Soundtrack, it finally goes back to the style presented originally in The Witcher 1, something that makes you forget that's just the video game, it gives you the feeling you are in there, in some village, city or that you are fighting with someone / something, which turns every single battle into an unforgettable memory,\n- Every single side quest, and believe me, there is A LOT of them, is actually a little story that keeps you playing with the same force as the main quests - I call it - a new quality in RPGs,\n- Choices and their impact on the story - even a small choice that seems insignificant at the time can wage on the whole world around you,\n- THIS GAME IS MATURE, finally a game dealing with a lot of subjects which are usually handled very childishly or not at all,\n- Combat - nothing more to add, it's decent, though it's nothing to be praised really, you won't be able to mash buttons and win - you have to dodge, use signs, and on higher difficulties get yourself ready to have an oil for a specific enemy and a bomb to be able to put an end to his or her misery.\n\nThe Witcher 3 is not a game without its flaws, although nothing that can't be fixed - some balance issues, economy basically showing Geralt as a very wealthy person (who he should not be), small performance problems like stuttering in Novigrad and in my opinion very limited after the end content (fixed by the expansions). Many of the things I struggled with have been already fixed and there is no need to disclose them. \n\nAll in all, one of the best games in the last few years (even a decade).",

      "Wylde Flowers is a magical farming simulation. The spoken dialogue is wonderful and touches on difficult subjects, such as grief, estrangement from family members, and gender identity. The characters are diverse, have complex personalities and are really funny.\n\nThis game could be considered as Stardew Valley's even gayer little sibling. On a more serious note, it can be friendlier than Stardew Valley for first time or younger gamers, because of its simplicity, tightly told storyline (it is not an \"endless game\" as Stardew can be) and guided playthrough.\n\nIn my opinion, the game could be improved on a few fronts: character customization is one of them, and the fact that Tara, the main character, wears the same dress-leather jacket-chelsea boots millenial outfit during all seasons (including to bed, while sleeping over the covers) icks me profoundly. \n\nFinally, the pace of the game is a bit confusing to me, in the sense that it can be difficult to balance the storytelling aspect of the game with the more concrete tasks.\n\nAltogether, Wylde Flowers is a beautifully conceived game, filled with positivity, magic, a good soundtrack, and charming visuals.\n\n\n",
      "New edit: The developers have made the steam workshop available, but as an Oceanic user I don't have direct access to the workshop and I can't upload mods. It seems to be only available to Chinese modders, much like the previous 3rd party software. The problem appears to be covered up and not solved.\n\nEdit: Modding capability is now available. The devs are using a 3rd part chinese workshop that we all hate (thanks devs), however you can use Nexus Mods instead. Simply go to the Tale of Immortal nexus page and download any mod, then add it into the local mod section provided in the mod category. Then you're good to go.\n\nBe aware that currently, from what I've seen, the IDs mods use are generated at mod creation and multiple mods have a chance of ID conflict (breaking the mod/s). So if you have problems this may be the reason.\n\n\nOfficial English translation is available. The devs have mentioned 90% is translated, but I believe it won't impact gameplay. Players who haven't launched the game before will be switched to English automatically.\n\nIf you have launched the game before you will have to do the following: in the main menu select 语言 and change 简体中文 to English (Alpha) and restart the game.\n\nFor my review: Having played the game, I can say it's both good and bad. It failed to meet my expectations but I still enjoyed the game and will recommend it. The art is fantastic. The combat is fun but lacking compared to other action & slash titles (there is a lot they could do with it). Quests aren't very clear and their incentives are bad making it hard to get invested. You don't get anything really unique or interesting from quests as far as I've played.\n\nProgression is the most disappointing part of the game. It's a mix of crafting, gathering and looting to acquire items that will either enable you to advance or give you a stronger stat-boost when you do advance. Every realm does the same thing, only requiring different items at the new area/s that open up for that realm. This is a shame. Progression is the area that has the most potential in this game and yet is the most tacked on part, mostly an afterthought.\n\nThe developers could've made each realm advancement unique, with different gameplay mechanics for each one that ties into the unique aspects of the area/realm they're in. This would be a fantastic way to give a sense of freshness to each area the player explores and make them engage more actively in said area rather than rushing through it as we do now.\n\nProgression could've been the strongest part of this game but they ended up making it the weakest. Again, it's a shame. I see so much potential that just isn't capitilised on. Overall this is an experience I'd recommend. But I'd only play it once in its current state.",

      "I'm glad to say Mr. Grapefrukt and his collaborators have done it again, combining pool, golf, and roguelite-esque gameplay with charming visuals and music to create an absurdly fun little time sink, much like Holedown, which I've played and replayed to completion on every platform it exists on.\n\nI tried to stay unspoiled on the details of the game mechanics before going into it so I could experience everything totally fresh, and I've been delighted by mixing and matching challenge cards and the different ball types that impact how you play.\n\nThe whole thing is charming, and aside from being an obvious extension of Holedown's best design sensibilities, it feels like a fair bit of its ethos took cues from Triband's fresh, novel, and light-hearted takes on sports like golf, baseball, and racing. I really enjoyed What the Golf, and eagerly look forward to the next time Triband makes a game that's on a platform I own, so that inspiration is extremely welcome in Subpar Golf, haha.\n\nIt's hard to put a number on all of the work that goes into a video game over time, but I can say confidently that $10 is more than fair for a really fun game that's been in the works for...

      "Ok so let me start off by saying that I absolutely loved the first game in this series. I loved the subtle changes when you compared character interaction throughout the game as you progressed playing non-lethally/lethally. Now I never buy games at launch, I always wait for sales. When I got Dishonored 1 for $2 I was blown away and mad at myself for waiting for such a sale. I would've happily spent more on that game, it was worth it. Now all that said, here we are at Dishonored 2:\n\nPros\n- Mechanics have been vastly improved upon and the gameplay is just so much more fluid. As much as I loved the previous game I can't deny it was somewhat clunky.\n- Customization is so much better! The upgrades are plentiful and the bonecharm crafting system is awesome once you realize what you are doing. It really expands on how many options you really have at your disposal.\n\nCons\n- The difficulty still just isn't there for me. I LOVED that there was a custom difficulty mode, but even making things harder than the 'very hard' difficulty I still completed the game using no powers and never getting detected with relative ease(I did save A LOT obviously). The only things that really present a challenge are the clockwork soldiers, and as the plot of the game makes evident, you really don't encounter those enough to really present a big challenge.\n- The story is weak, plain and simple. It was like you were on a storyboard that used the same format as the previous game. The story, especially the universe and how you were immersed into it, was a big part of the why I loved the first game.\n- How low vs high chaos is handled. It isn't like there are no changes, in fact I was surprised a few times in my 2nd playthrough which I was doing as a hardcore murderer of every man, woman, and child(if there was any) that crossed my path. It just never really changed the dynamic enough like Dishonored 1 did. The way the final mission in the first game played out when comparing no killing playthroughs with bloody ones was VASTLY different right from the start of the mission.\n\nAll in all it wasn't a bad game. I still definitely enjoyed it for being a niche genre game. Just maybe I would have liked the game to stand out more like the first did.",

      "[h1]SDHQ STEAM DECK PERFORMANCE REVIEW:[/h1]\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th] Follow our [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42495043/]curator[/url] page for more Steam Deck reviews and our [url=https://twitter.com/SteamDeckHQ]Twitter[/url] for immediate updates on all SDHQ content including reviews, news, and more!\n[/th][/tr][/table]\n\n\n[i]This review is based ONLY on performance of the game on the STEAM DECK.[/i]\n\n\n[h1]The Game Itself:[/h1]\n\n\nChained Echoes is a 16-bit era inspired JRPG which sees you travel across the varied, war-stricken continent of Valandis to bring an end to the war between the 3 kingdoms. With a world filled with charming characters, vicious foes, and bakers that use wood as an ingredient, you will fight in turn-based combat utilizing a complex equipment and skill system to fend for yourself. Chained Echoes also features a customizable airship, tons of items to loot and craft, a 30-40 hour playtime, no random encounters, and a fantastic soundtrack inspired by the PSX era. Will you be able to bring peace to Valandis?\n\nHonestly, I absolutely love this game. The 16-bit style graphics, the attention to small little details, the woven in humor, and the combat mechanics all shine bright here. The combat doesn't feel sluggish and I actually felt a desire to talk to the NPCs sprinkled across the world, which is not a normal feeling for me. I also liked that, if I started a conversation with a NPC, I could still walk away. I wasn't forced to hear everything that they needed to say. Overall, as a game, I can't recommend this one enough!\n\n\n[h1]Steam Deck Performance:[/h1]\n\n\nYeah it runs near perfectly here. Without any changes, you can keep 60 FPS with 6.5 - 7 hours of battery on a full charge. It may not come as a surprise based on the game's graphical quality, but it is still wonderful.\n\nI did encounter a couple stutters here and there, which stalled the game for a solid 1 second, but that was it. This tended to happen on the first attack in combat or entering into a new place, but it wasn't consistent or enough to stop me from enjoying the game.\n\nChained Echoes brings back a lot of memories when playing it. Not because it is something I played before, but because it reminds me of the good times I had with older JRPGs. Chrono Trigger is a big one that I loved from the SNES era and this game gave me those same feelings I had playing back in the day. On top of that, the game performs beautifully on the Deck without any setting changes. I am happy to say it gets our Best on Deck rating! If you enjoy the SNES JRPG era, this is an easy must-buy.\n\n\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th] [url=https://steamdeckhq.com/]SDHQ[/url] is a website made for curating Steam Deck news, guides, and providing optimization/builds for games on the Deck.\n[/th][/tr][/table]",
      "Note this is not \"Steampunk Civ\" so don't think of it that way. Its effectively a story/scenario driven city builder. The game looks beautiful and works well with the world building that goes on with the game. \n\nYour games will be short but its still fairly challenging depending on the scenario you choose\n\nDefinitely recommended",
      "I realise this is intended to be a darkly humored game, but it is still fucked up nonetheless. I just can't fathom how such degraded humor can be seen as funny.",
      "After sailing around for an hour or so, killing some huge crabs and collecting some reports from new islands I had discovered, I was running low on fuel and supplies. The game reminded me of this with a prompt titled \"Desperate Measures,\" so I was left with little choices on the matter.\n\n I tried to use my last two boxes of supplies in a vain attempt to desperately scrape together some fuel so I could reach the port of Fallen London -- I failed. Now I was faced with the problem of starvation, on top of the whole fuel fiasco. \n\n  Fear was setting in, as was hunger, fuel was low, as was hope, so I decided to beseech the gods of the Unter-Zee for help, and help they did. I was, for lack of a better word, teleported to some kind of temple dedicated to the gods, and that was where things went from bad to worse. \n  \n   This temple couldn't be further away from Fallen London, and therefore aid, than I could have gotten on my own. So I decided to beseech the gods again, this time my pleading went unanswered, a cruel cold-shoulder delivered to an ingrateful neophyte. The only purpose my inane begging to a higher power served was to unsettle my crew and drive us all to the brink of sanity.\n\nSo I abandoned ship and we all died, lol. 11/10.",

      "This game has (while this review is being written) 10076 reviews. 221 of these reviews are negative. I think this ratio of reviews is deserved and here's why:\n\n- It's a fun story, but not something outstandingly new or anything\n- No one ever can deny that it has an amazing soundtrack\n- The combat is a bit bland, but this is compensated by the fact that the game is pretty short\n- It's a short game, but definitely worth it\n\nOverall: it's just a fun short game to play on a day off. Also, I can't get this soundtrack out of my head! PLEASE SEND HELP!"

      "As a cybersecurity professional , I would classify this game as malware, or at the least adware.\nWhy? It opens up a number, at least 10 when I checked, of connections to various points on the internet which have no purpose in running the game. They are only there so the vendor can spam you with advertising, track you, or for other unspecified activities. \nAs such, I can NOT recommend this game. \n\nTo verify, I disconnected my computer from the internet. The game ran fine without the advertising and tracking. \nThen I connected back to the internet, and launched the game. The game opened at least 10 connections(!).\nThen, while still connected to the internet, I blocked the game's network-connecting executables in the firewall. In such a case, the game behaves differently, apparently it sees there is an active connection so it runs for a while, then when it cannot make it's for-bad-purposes network connections, it terminates and you can't play. \nThis is bad behavior that I would only expect from spyware and malware. I hope the vendor fixes it so the software runs in the manner they declare - it is supposed to not require network connectivity after the initial run as they describe in the System Requirements. \nSteam should be reigning in this behavior as well.",
      "Stephen's Sausage Roll is a game that the developer doesn't want normal people to buy, it seems. The description is literally, \"A simple 3d puzzle game.\", there is one video that shows you nothing about the game, and it's priced at $32 CND.\n\nFortunately, I'm here to tell you to get off your ass and to buy this wonderful game. The graphics are alright, the music is OK, but the puzzles are sublime.\n\nIn each level, the goal is the same: cook all the sausages and exit the level by standing on the exit level sign in the right orientation. You cook sausages by pushing them over a grill. Like in sokoban games, you can't pull the sausage (yet...), only push it. Another huge wrinkle is that sides of the sausage can only touch the grill once. If you touch a cooked side of a sausage to the grill, it will be burned and you fail the level. This little wrinkle will make you pull your hair out in some levels as you try and figure out how the hell you are going to maneuver the sausages around so they get cooked properly. A neat thing about the game is that if you fail, you can still continue playing the level, which might help you figure out how to play it.\n\nYou'll have a section (part of an island) that has a number of puzzles for you to solve in any order, so if you get stuck, you can try another one (until you get to the last puzzle of the section). Once you complete a section, a new section will open up with more puzzles.\n\nYour little guy has tank controls, which you will find extremely useful, as turning to the left or right near a sausage will push it in different directions. A nice detail is that the all of the puzzles make up the island section. When you activate a puzzle, the rest of the island drops away into the sea, leaving you on a tiny puzzle island.\n\nEach section introduces new mechanics into the game. First you'll just be pushing the sausages, but then you'll be stacking them, skewering them (you would think this would make things easier, but no! You can't turn when you have a skewered sausage!), walking on them...\n\nI would say that these levels are on the level of Snakebird, though I found many of them easier than Snakebird's puzzles (maybe I'm better at sokoban games than I know?). These are the kind of puzzles that you walk away from frustrated, but come back to a few hours later with the solution. This is the game where there are so many ah-ha! moments that make you feel smart. You have no idea what to do at first, but eventually you get better and better. You might not see solutions at first, but you begin to see where you need to go to solve the puzzle, and then work backwards from there. It's wonderful!\n\nIf you're having trouble, there's a community guide that has all the solutions, which is super helpful (though not as much when I was playing because it wasn't complete!).\n\nIt might be expensive, but I took 36 hours to solve all the puzzles and it was worth every penny.",
      "Before I start this review, I want to make something clear. This comes from a place not of hatred, but of love. Destiny is a game near and dear to my heart and it angers me to see the way Bungie has handled it. I know they can do better.\nI've played the Destiny series since year 1, Destiny 1. I've been through its highs, its lows, and everything inbetween this game I love. I've seen content droughts, content surges, content drops and flops. I've seen this game rise... and fall.\nIt's time I faced facts, I stop huffing Copium, and be truthful; despite being with this game for years, I genuinely can't recommend it to anybody. Not in the state the game is right now. This isn't just another user complaining about a there not being new content to play constantly without any droughts, but as a player genuinely concerned for the direction Bungie is taking the game, the way the past and recent DLC have been handled, how they've monetized this game, and how they've treated their veteran playerbase.\nI bought the $100 Special Edition back when this game first released. All that content I bought with my hard earned money. Within a year $100 worth of content turned free to play. $100 for me turned into $0 for the average player within one year. I received no compensation for buying the game so early except an Emblem. An emblem. Not a potential for a free season pass when the seasons first started, no refund for my money, nothing. Where is this content now? Gone. Not a piece of it is still in the game. My compensation for this content leaving? Nothing still.\nForsaken, the best DLC they've released for this game. The DLC that brought D2 from being a shitshow to being a great, relevant game with a good story tacked on it? Wiped from this game's code.\nThe game may be \"Free to play\" but you'll sink hundreds of dollars for DLC, seasonal passes, and now separate dungeon passes worth as much as your average season pass. It's too much money to ask for people that Bungie can and will wipe from the game's code in a few months time.\nYes, the content they do bring is fun, but drip-feeding us the same content for months without any relevant changes is just not a fun game to play. What is there to do anyways? We have:\nRaids, high quality but the same ones every time\nStrikes, fun but repetitive after years of getting so little new ones\nDungeons, similar problems to the above, fun but repetitive from lack of variety\nSeasonal content, not worth doing anything but the current season unless you're trying to follow up with the game story\nCrucible with a shitty tryhard meta and hardly any new maps\nGambit, a gamemode they've basically given up on with maps they've removed from the pool\nSeasonal events, fun but the same damn thing every season\nNone of these feel fresh after years and years of doing the same ones and watching old favorites get sunset from the game.\nAnd it's not like Bungie can't look back at D1 for inspiration; Sparrow Racing League is something players have been clamoring for, it'd be something fresh that Bungie can use to entice players to stay in the game. Bungie has gone on record stating that \"by the time they've designed an SRL map for Destiny 2, they could have made several strikes maps\" which to me states that A: they aren't willing to put in the effort for player experience and B: aren't willing to make several strike maps worth of content at once.\nAnd getting new players into Destiny? The most painful experience I've tried to do. This game's onboarding experience is horrible, mismanaged, and held back by half the content being locked behind a paywall. From friends I've tried to get into the game, the new player experience is:\nOverwhelming\nConfusing\nNo sense of clear direction\nAll the cool stuff is locked behind paid dlc\nWhy was I put into this random mission when I booted up the game (seasonal mission you start with at every season)\nAny many more comments that made them not want to play the game.\n\nI know this review was basically a rant about how I feel this game is going with no clear rime or reason, jumping from topic to topic, but I just want to see this game thrive the way I know it can. Because Bungie has shown to be a competent company with quality products, but I'm just not seeing that right now.\nAnd i also want compensation for the $100 I watched vanish in the span of a year.",
      "Started strong, ended annoyingly.\n\nMoral of the story? People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.\n\nIt paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that \"routine\" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.\n\nI liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters. But it all fell apart and tries to teach a very vapid moral that someone in their early 20's who has never had a meaningful relationship would idealize.\n\nAt least it was short.\n",
      "oh good god how do i remove things from my library",
      "I really wanted to like it, but i can't, in good faith, recommend A Space for the Unbound to anyone. It's a crying shame, because i deeply respect the intention behind the project. I love the whimsical, yet somewhat grounded premise: anyone who likes Makoto Shinkai movies will feel right at home. The intrigue, even though the plot twists are fairly obvious, still creates an unsettling feeling of uncertainty and dread that clashes (in a good way) with cheerful, bright colors of youth. A Space for the Unbound is mainly a point-and-click quest, but the developers still tried to spice the gameplay up a little with mini-games and little one-off mechanics that successfully break up the monotony.\n\nAnd yet... For every memorable, emotional peak A Space for the Unbound presents an hour of pure, unadulterated filler. Almost every \"puzzle\" is a multi-step fetch quest that requires you to backtrack multiple times with no other reason than to pad the length of the gameplay sections. It also indulges in \"gotcha\" moments, where the game deliberately fools you into the wrong solution, while the right one, of course, requires you to back track somewhere. Yes, the hometown of our main heroes is not that big, but that's hardly an excuse. Even more so in numerous dream sequences, where you are often times forced to go back and forth between someone's mind and reality to collect key items. Spacedives represent a wonderful opportunity to do something different, but A Space for the Unbound rarely delivers on that front.\n\nMost people praise the game for the story, the characters and the fact that it was made in Indonesia -- an under-represented region when it comes to games. But neither of those three have any solid writing to stand on their own. Sure, Atma and Raya can be sweet, but developers never allow their relationship to truly blossom. There's almost no banter, she's not even a constant presence in the story. Raya is important to the world of A Space for the Unbound, but doesn't really feel important to the player. Yes, the game tries really hard to tug at your heartstrings, but more often than not does so in a terribly hamfisted manner. It's supposed to be so profound and melodramatic that, at a certain point, it becomes difficult to take the game seriously.\n\nOh, and speaking of representing the community, A Space for the Unbound doesn't do a good job. The town itself is cute and full of life, there's no argument about that, but all of its inhabintants are either nameless mannequins with a so-so pixel-art, or just item bots. You speak to them once or twice, they give you what you need to advance the plot, and that's it. The fact that the game forces you to run laps around the town on an endless search for items doesn't make it any more charming or cozy. While, on the other hand, the authors only briefly touch on real societal issues, so as not to spoil the whimsy. In short, it's a huge nothingburger of a letdown, despite the fact that the whole setting is clearly supposed to be warm and nostalgic.\n\nYes, you can excuse some of those flaws by the main plot twist, which i will not spoild. But while it does make certain things more clear in hindsight, again, it does not portray the story in a good light. A Space for the Unbound really wants to be a Makoto Shinkai movie by way of Night in the Woods, but falls tragically short wherever you look. However, despite my criticisms, i hope Mojiken will not stop making games. It is very clear that the devs have tremendous passion and some talent on display -- it just needs refinement.",
      "An excellent maximalist mashup of Slay The Spire with some Tower Defence and CCG Mechanics. Not as tight and elegantly designed as StS, but with a lot more variety in card design leads to a lot more varied and wild interactions and deck composition. Compulsive and mechanically satisfying, Monster Train embraces excess in a satisfying way, even if the whole package is wrapped up in a slightly odd aesthetic package of half remembered hearthstone knock offs. (The soundtrack, incidentally, slaps)",
      "[i]While the artwork and combat remain enjoyable, the story, writing, and pacing were a major letdown.[/i]  \n\n***\nMINOR SPOILERS BELOW. If you're going to play the game, play before reading.\n***\n\n[b]The mature storylines, hard-hitting decisions, beautiful worldbuilding, and tight writing that made the first two so immersive is not present in this game.[/b] (You'll notice immediately that the writing for the caravan in the capital is [i]particular[/i] trite, awkward to read, and uninteresting.)\n\nUnfortunately, it's not just the writing that's weak. [i]The pacing is off.[/i] Antecedents are confusing, characters you'd expect to speak don't, events that should have been foreshadowed come out of nowhere. More frustrating are the serious character continuity \"errors,\" and arcs that disappear, change, or go nowhere. [i]In short, the events, decisions, and conflict from the previous games do not appear or resolve in a way that was suggested by the previous two[/i].\n\n\nHere's one example. In Banner Saga 2, Fosolt is unexpectedly rescued by Bolverk. [i]\"I have a message for Alette from the dead varl king,\" [/i]he said. That's pretty intriuging! Maybe there's a mystery, an oracle, an item, or just cool information about the Varl and their strange king? Maybe there'll finally be context about the bridge decision!\n\n[i]No! He has nothing interesting to say or add, and then his storyline just gets dropped and forgotten.[/i]\n\nWell, Bolverk's been possessed by Bellower! Gosh, who knows what Bellower will say? In fact, I can't wait to find out what happens to Bellower's body! \n\nWell, actually, Bolver's [i]not[/i] possessed, not really, certainly not like it was implied last game, and Bellower's body -- [i]a primary focus of the first two games[/i] -- isn't mentioned [i]once[/i]\n\nOr how about how they casually mention that Eyvyn is not only the [i]head[/i] of the Valka order, but also that he's had periodic bursts of hereditary madness all along? That's... odd. And it's not presented as an well-thought out [i]reveal[/i] or anything. It's presented matter-of-factly, like they were trying to ret-con in a less interesting story, or were tone deaf.\n\nYou'll notice that all the characters are underutilized and have unfulfilled storylines/tensions. Hakon has hard choices to make; Canary's a little crazy; Yrsa is mysterious; Gil's in love with Alette, etc. Will these build into choices? Reveals? Dependent endings based on choices? Will there be discussions referencing the past? Reflections on travels? Hints of despair?\n\nNo. In mine, Gil was [i]murdered[/i] and no one even bothered to reference it. Canary's situation never comes to a head. You never have to choose between Varls and Humans. Murdering people doesn't make people threaten to leave. Ubin returns randomly as an uber Varl and he's... learned the horseborne's language? Travelled the southlands? In like, a month? In a way that doesn't advance the plot? It's just... weakly done.\n\n\nThere are [i]so many[/i] examples like this, where the stories don't quite fit correctly, where what you picked up on in the early games about the [i]mysteries[/i] and the [i]world[/i] and what made it a [i]vibrant[/i] place were forgotten about by the writers. [b]The result is that it the game plays out in unsatisfying ways, in tenseless scenarios made vapid by watered-down morality, an inability to leverage the situation in fun ways, and low-quality writing, paucity of choice-making, a lack of exploration, lack of plot twists, simplified overworld mechanics -- all culminating in an almost staggeringly one-dimensional and shallow ending.[/b]\n\nThe Banner Saga series was always an experience that was greater than the sum of its part. An [i]experience[/i]. Of being [i]riveted[/i] to the computer, checking the map, worrying over supplies, guessing at mysteries, having my breath taken away at each hill. Unfortunately, that's not the case in this game. \n\n\nGameplay-wise, it's also a bit of a letdown. Combat is fun-ish, but you can make invincible character combinations and the mechanics don't even try to deal with this. There's an interesting new reinforcement mechanic that's not used heavily, and never pushes you like you think the end of the world would. You never really have to split up your forces. There's no novelty. Like maybe using a hero in a battle makes them fatigued, so you have to switch them up? Maybe you can station them different places, making them unusable for combat? Maybe you need to choose eight for a secret mission caravan? Maybe dream sequences? No, nothing like that. \n\nThe overworld gameplay had some changes that never really felt significant. Moreover, quite a bit felt taken away. You can't rest, do training missions, no longer weigh food vs upgrades. One example of all thise tone deafness was Iver's march through the destroyed world was consistently at \"Great Morale!\"\n\nThere didn't seem to be many flavor choices (\"Do we hang the criminals or let them join us?\"), including much less on social themes (\"Should women fight, if it disturbs the traditionally-minded men?\" \"One clan's rowdy, what do we do?\" \"They threaten to leave if so and so isn't banished\"), and less delayed results and fewer significant decisions, including among the game's built-up tensions among the factions. \n\n\nThere's also some cases of development [i]feeling[/i] cheap. Remember opening Banner Saga 2, and feeling that it was [i]fresh[/i], and [i]upgraded[/i]? There's little to make you feel that way here. The artwork is okay, but the environments feel more generic, with less variety, and the surreal landscapes in the darkness aren't especially interesting to look at for long periods of time. Iver is voiced by Bolverk's voice actor, and they sound exactly the same. The new title system is a fun idea, but is visually integrated into the game's menu system with the finesse of a cheap mod. \n\nThere's a moment in the game where the screen goes black for scrolling text and voiceover narration explaining the upcoming mechanic. Um, a character can't explain that? It was similar how the many two second animations are used, not to supplement the story, but to [i]replace[/i] written portions, making you feel unsure about what's going on. And finally, the game's pretty short, without fun combat challenges or interesting newgame+ challenges. \n\n\nWhat's [i]particularly[/i] frustrating is that the game's release date was moved forward four months. I don't know the story why, but I do know that a few more months of polish and story embellishment might have delivered the beautiful, grippingly interactive story we were hoping for. Because this is a watered down version of the previous two in just about every way.\n\nThis negative review is for whatever processes lead to this mediocre finale.\n\n---\n\n[i]Here's a plot that would have made more sense. Zephyr arrives and speaks to you secretly. There's a god that's still alive! Neat, now we'll finally get more story on that. Yay, fun caravan mode, now we need to take longships somewhere interesting!\n\nBut uh-oh! There's a Sundr villain going there as well, with an army of dredge! But at least now we'll finally get more story about the Sundr! \n\nThe god reveals something interesting, talks about Juno, the sun, gives a means to protect the city and help Iver. But when you return to the city, now the king and rugga and the factions have devolved into fighting based on your choices. How are you going to handle this? Which of many possibilities will ascend to the throne? How will you defend the city? And what mystery lies beneath the mountain of the city...\n\nFor Iver's caravan, there should be pockets of dredge villages kept alive by Spellsingers. Now you need to decide to plunder them or not! More stuff to do! Maybe go to the remains of the Varl capital first? Fight warped Valka? Realize deceptions, machinations, corruption, hear stories? Find new characters, have old ones die?\n\nInstead there... wasn't a plot?[/i]",
      "I was hoping for a good game but I can't believe the positive reviews. Really annoying on a personal level. If you like your hand held and revel in 3rd person view then enjoy, but I think it's terrible. I was on the mountain jumping across a platform. \"Press ENTER\" to 'grab' it suggests. I press ENTER and what do you know? Nothing happens. Well, you die continually because what it tells you to do (zzzzz) doesn't work. Ah, maybe this is part of the 'difficulty'...hahahaha.\n\nNot a patch on any Far Cry or GTA even though these are full of directions. First Tomb Raider I've bought and definitely the last. What is it with games these days telling you what to do every step of the way: Do this...do that....go here....find item...take item...drop item...fire now.....pull lever...talk....rest....jump.... quit game and uninstall, ya that's the best option. As this game is created for a dumbed-down society or tailored for intellectually challenged meercats, some of us can see where the industry is heading. What happened to thinking for yourself???\n\nI don't need to progess far in this game because the first 10 minutes says enough. Do this, do that, blah blah blah...",

Still...can you find it in your heart to still love this place?\" (paraphrase)\n\nClannad . . .\n\nOH Clannad . . .\n\nI remember watching the anime in high school, and absolutely falling in love with it. Upon realizing the REAL story was told in a visual novel...I HAD to get my hands on it. I almost died of a joy-induced heart attack when a legitimate English version of the game was released on Steam.\n\nThis game bro. This f***** game. When I was a senior in high school back in the day, this game was my refuge. I was mostly friends with older kids back then, so by the time I was a senior I didn't really have anybody to chill with cuz all my friends already graduated. Its kinda hard for me to make new friends, then and now if I'm being honest. I related to Nagisa a lot for that reason. \n\nI mostly related to Tomoya and Sunohara tho. One of my best friends growing up really reminded me of Sunohara no cap lol. Type of dude who was the comic relief/brunt of everyone's s*** talking but w/ a mutual understanding its done in jest and love. And when things ever got serious we always had each others' backs, and even tho he's a goofball and kind of a meme, he's seriously loyal and a true ride or die.\n\nMany times when Tomoya was expressing himself in this game, I had to almost pinch my face and remind myself I'm not the one thinking these thoughts: I'm playing a VN lol. That's how much I seriously related to Tomoya. In so many aspects and ways that would make my review even longer than it is now if I were to attempt to explain why I relate to Tomoya so much. Yeah, sure that could just be shrewd character design from Maeda Jun's part, but it was almost uncanny how many of the things Tomoya went thru when he was younger/issues with his father/intimacy issues he develops later on in adulthood etc. almost perfectly mirrored what I was struggling with irl. It gave me something to relate to. It expressed emotions I was having trouble even admitting were present in my own self. Maybe that's the real reason I love Clannad so much, and maybe because of that I sit here biased with rose-colored nostalgia goggles. But even if I type this review with a tinge of rose-coloring obstructing my critical eyes, I can say with confidence that Clannad is more than a game. More than an anime. \n\nClannad is an experience. An experience I wish I could forget all about...just so I could experience it anew all over again. Whether you experience Clannad thru the anime, VN, movie, whatever...Clannad is an experience in a league of its own in my book. And the best way to have your Clannad experience is by playing this masterpiece of a Visual Novel. Hands down. \n\nHonestly, I'd ideally have all Clannad virgins go straight to the VN and play it to completion but that's just not a realistic request as this game takes the average player 80+ hours to complete just the main story apart from optional achievements haha. If you're a fan of the anime...why haven't you played the VN yet!? Lol. If you've never seen the anime or movie I'd STILL recommend playing this game. Just keep in mind to use a guide (just trust me on that. please) and be willing for it to be a bit boring at first. If you stick with it, believe me...it's not gonna stay boring for long.\n\nIf you liked the anime but hated the anime ending, PLAY THE VN. No spoilers, but trust me when I say the VN ending is the true conclusion of the Clannad experience. You'll find out what I mean if you stick with the VISUAL NOVEL to the end.\n\nI didn't go to my senior prom. I spent it playing this game. And I don't regret that decision one bit to this day. I experienced this game, standing in similar shoes as Tomoya at that time irl: rebellious kid about to graduate high school with no real goals or aspirations, struggling to find it hard to \"love this place\" or truly find something passionate to live for. I didn't want to go to college. There was nothing I wanted to do there. Most of the people in my grade back then thought I was quiet and lonely freshman-sophomore, then bad news junior-senior when I started acting out. I was just, lost. \n\nExperiencing Clannad helped me find what I was truly passionate about in life. Family. Friendship (as corny as that may sound). Being able to step up for what only YOU can protect when life is calling you to maturity.\n\nClannad helped me see that even though things can get dark... even though tragedies will happen regardless of our efforts to keep them from happening... even though things can never, and will never, ever stay the same in this life...and even if you lose your way eventually... and sadly reach such a lost and depressed state in life, that you mistakenly conclude for a short while you'd rather sever all your connections and ties with the world and everybody in it... in an effort to try to prevent experiencing even more pain... \n\nThat \"loving this place,\" loving this world, loving people, and forming deep, lifelong and lasting connections with this world and its people, NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS, is ALWAYS, ALWAYS, worth it in the end. Especially when it matters the most.\n\nNow I'm not gonna front: Clannad isn't for everybody. Some people just can't get into the moe art style. Some people may find it a bit too melodramatic at times. Some people may find some of the comedy or bits of the story weird, or just not their cup of tea. Some people may find it hard to relate to all of the characters, and for some people it won't have a Cindarella's slipper level of relatability like it did for me. For those people who are kinda feelin \"ehh idk if i'll really like this game\" I'd say it'd be smart to watch the anime first. But if you're feeling good about it and wanna experience Clannad the BEST way: cop this VN. Just wait for the good bits to slowly boil. Patience is a virtue :) And save yourself hours of rage by using a guide from the beginning until the after-story credits roll. With Clannad I'd say its almost always recommended to use a guide.\n\nAnd if you love the anime and haven't played the VN... you're weirdo number 1, 2, 3, 4 and even 5. Haha I'm playin but srsly get the VN already you owe it to yourself to experience the VN. Knowing what happens in the story and getting some events \"spoiled\" doesn't detract from the VN experience. That I promise you. As someone who watched the anime before playing the VN, who's now such an obvious fanboy of the Clannad VN as demonstrated by my wall of text of a review (lol), trust me: I'd bet money you'll love this game just as much as I do.  \n\nTo Maeda Jun, and all of the brilliant writers of this quintessential, modern classic of a story: thank you. Thank you for gifting all of us the experience that is Clannad. Because of your labours, you've helped a wayward knucklehead like me finally be able to declare this in spirit and in truth:\n\n\"I love this place.\"\n\nLong live Kazamatsuri!",
      "I have never cried so damn much at a game",
      "Earlier this week I did the impossible - I came out to a family member. One of my two sisters, in specific.\n\nI was nervous but relieved to know she accepted and supported me - and thought, you know, perhaps we should call and talk about some things. We had that call this Wednesday and I expressed a lot of my resentment towards my family - being stuck at home with some of my family, more specifically my [spoiler]mom[/spoiler], has completely wrecked my mental health. I'm still closeted from them and I live with each passing day, worried [spoiler]she'd[/spoiler] reject me - for being non-binary, for dating a trans person, for disappointing [spoiler]her[/spoiler].\n\nMy sister told me that [spoiler] my mom [/spoiler] only hears what [spoiler]she[/spoiler] wants to hear, that [spoiler]she[/spoiler] only thinks about what [spoiler]she[/spoiler] wants to see in [spoiler]her[/spoiler] kids despite often saying otherwise. From her experience, [spoiler]mom[/spoiler] seemed to be a very not open and is often a close-minded individual. \nComing into If Found..., I had only broke down early Thursday morning as my many months of frustrations and anxieties finally given the voice it needed.\n\nIf you've played the game it'd make sense if I told you that Kasio's experience with her parents in If Found... hurt reading for me - it genuinely hurt. Seeing her mom's first letter and annotating it with \"She's trying. But she has all these ideas of how I should be.\" and \"She didn't even consider she might need to apologize too.\" was something I sat at for a long time, probably longer than any other part of her journal that I was erasing through at a normal pace.\n\nMoments like that made me realize that this game is something I never knew I needed - a realization that hey, think about the move out you're doing in a month as rebuilding - as leaving the past behind. That there isn't anything wrong with that, and that you can really be yourself once we're out there, together. That family doesn't have to be bound by blood and it's really about the people who's there for you, even at your absolute worst. That I don't need to seek acceptance through others - but rather be more accepting of myself.\n\n[spoiler]\"I find I care less and less what other people think of me, and more for my own opinion. And these days I'm so much more comfortable in my own skin.\"[/spoiler]\n\nThere's people I can think of who need to read and see this.\n\nIf Found... left me with hope - and it's leaving me with a lot to think about. Thank you so much for this game, DREAMFEEL. I wish I could articulate this game better like other people have - but it's been a lot lately and I need to rest - if you're coming across this review/text you should without a doubt play it, especially if you've felt similarly trapped like both me and Kasio did.\n\nP.S. - If you find the eraser mechanic to be a little strenuous you can increase the size of the eraser in the options!",
      "Black Mesa is a fantastic remake of the Original Valve classic and one of the greatest of all time video games, Half-Life.  This sci-fi classic FPS has you take on what might seem like a hum-drum day in the life of an experimental physicist, but things go quite off rails when experimenting with a strange material sample from an even stranger dude in a suit. \n\nAfter a while (and shooting a lot of aliens and bashing their heads in with a crowbar) you'll save the world... but now Black Mesa lets you do this with dramatically updated graphics, 4K support and a plethora of visual tweaks so you can rest assured this will run great on any gaming rig. \n\nA must have for big fans of Half-Life or gamers who are new to the scene and never got to play the original.

      "I am a day one player who quit the game within a few days. After coming back after almost 2 years, I am shocked and surprised. The overall improvement is great, quests are not bothering you. Story and atmosphere is hooking you up and the overall experience is good. Leveling up is easy and also you are not struggling as in most MMOs.\n\nDespite the past of the game, I think it is worth trying.",
      "This game is basically awesome, under 3 conditions:\n\n1- You get rid of all on-screen icons (i.e. incoming attacks, ennemy spotting)\n2- Do not care about secondary missions only here to further lenghten the game's lifespan\n3- Play the game as you would if  YOU were in charge\n\nBasically, nevermind the Ubisoft micro transactions' system and other abhorrent company induced  greed-leaned system to get stuff faster and more easily by robbing you out of your hard-earned cash...you can finish the game without spending a single dime in the store, it's all pay to win...\nThe open-world aspect is very satisfying and rewarding, in terms of progression, don't fall for the micro transaction system\nCombat is easy even in the highest difficulty setting, but makes you think you are badass when you slash through waves of ennemies, whose AI is rather basic, with your arsenal of rockets, LMGs and explosives but it is satisfying as fuck!\n\nImagine strapping C4 to your plane, jump out of it, have it crashing down an ennemy outpost meanwhile you are parachuting down and throwing hand grenades their way, land on a roof and eliminate the remaining ennemies with fire ammo shotgun and a motherfucking M60 with armor-piercing bullets while throwing dynamites and there you have it...FarCry5 in a nutshell\n\nOh and don't forget about the flame-thrower lol, who doesn't love a flame-thrower scorching ennemies to their own demise eh?\n\nFarCry5 got it all, extreme freedom of how you wanna handle a situation (stealthily or all guns blazing) while being challenging enough in the highest difficulty setting!\nP.S. don't forget to turn off all the on-screen icons, really ruins it for hardcore FPS fans by making it extremely easy, please hear me out, you don't need these!",
      "The fact that you can't pause the game during cutscenes and conversations, is very frustrating. The cinematics are long (and sometimes exhausting). If your baby wakes up, If your phone rings, if someone's at the door, if you need to take a pan out of the oven... you can't pause the game! What's the deal with that? Put a pause feature! We have the technology!",
      "This game is more than just a driving simulator. It's a landscape experience.\n\nScreenshots won't reveal the full beauty of this game, cause they don't show how daytime and weather change while you drive, how the first sunbeams flash through trees and hills as you leave the night behind, how massive forests reveal as you climb mountain roads and cut through curvy canyons, or the mad contrast of Las Vegas' vibrant colors vs the lonely Route-66-style desert roads... these moments are gold, and define the atmosphere of a game that can be as relaxing or challenging as you want, based on the truck and cargo that you pick – but it will always be a beautiful trip.\n\nAlso, THIS is the game that TRULY deserves the Labor of Love award. In a year that has been most difficult for everyone, SCS managed to add more than ever: 2 map expansion DLCs, 3 completely new trucks brands (for FREE!), completely rework the lighting system (after complely overhauling the audio engine)... They just make the game better. Every year. For free.\n\nFor years now, SCS keep improving and remain honest, loyal and supportive to their customers and games. What more can you ask.\n\n(P.S. They just revealed plans for official co-op multiplayer.)",
      "If you are looking for a review for this game this aint it, but if you want a fire brownie recipe then you are at the right place\n\nIngredients:\n185g unsalted butter\n185g best dark chocolate\n85g plain flour\n40g cocoa powder\n50g white chocolate\n50g milk chocolate\n3 large eggs\n275g golden caster sugar\n\nMethod:\nSTEP 1\nCut 185g unsalted butter into small cubes and tip into a medium bowl. Break 185g dark chocolate into small pieces and drop into the bowl.\n\nSTEP 2\nFill a small saucepan about a quarter full with hot water, then sit the bowl on top so it rests on the rim of the pan, not touching the water. Put over a low heat until the butter and chocolate have melted, stirring occasionally to mix them.\n\nSTEP 3\nRemove the bowl from the pan. Alternatively, cover the bowl loosely with cling film and put in the microwave for 2 minutes on High. Leave the melted mixture to cool to room temperature.\n\nSTEP 4\nWhile you wait for the chocolate to cool, position a shelf in the middle of your oven and turn the oven on to 180C/160C fan/gas 4.\n\nSTEP 5\nUsing a shallow 20cm square tin, cut out a square of non-stick baking parchment to line the base. Tip 85g plain flour and 40g cocoa powder into a sieve held over a medium bowl. Tap and shake the sieve so they run through together and you get rid of any lumps.\n\nSTEP 6\nChop 50g white chocolate and 50g milk chocolate into chunks on a board.\n\nSTEP 7\nBreak 3 large eggs into a large bowl and tip in 275g golden caster sugar. With an electric mixer on maximum speed, whisk the eggs and sugar. They will look thick and creamy, like a milk shake. This can take 3-8 minutes, depending on how powerful your mixer is. You’ll know it’s ready when the mixture becomes really pale and about double its original volume. Another check is to turn off the mixer, lift out the beaters and wiggle them from side to side. If the mixture that runs off the beaters leaves a trail on the surface of the mixture in the bowl for a second or two, you’re there.\n\nSTEP 8\nPour the cooled chocolate mixture over the eggy mousse, then gently fold together with a rubber spatula. Plunge the spatula in at one side, take it underneath and bring it up the opposite side and in again at the middle. Continue going under and over in a figure of eight, moving the bowl round after each folding so you can get at it from all sides, until the two mixtures are one and the colour is a mottled dark brown. The idea is to marry them without knocking out the air, so be as gentle and slow as you like.\n\nSTEP 9\nHold the sieve over the bowl of eggy chocolate mixture and resift the cocoa and flour mixture, shaking the sieve from side to side, to cover the top evenly.\n\nSTEP 10\nGently fold in this powder using the same figure of eight action as before. The mixture will look dry and dusty at first, and a bit unpromising, but if you keep going very gently and patiently, it will end up looking gungy and fudgy. Stop just before you feel you should, as you don’t want to overdo this mixing.\n\nSTEP 11\nFinally, stir in the white and milk chocolate chunks until they’re dotted throughout.\n\nSTEP 12\nPour the mixture into the prepared tin, scraping every bit out of the bowl with the spatula. Gently ease the mixture into the corners of the tin and paddle the spatula from side to side across the top to level it.\n\nSTEP 13\nPut in the oven and set your timer for 25 mins. When the buzzer goes, open the oven, pull the shelf out a bit and gently shake the tin. If the brownie wobbles in the middle, it’s not quite done, so slide it back in and bake for another 5 minutes until the top has a shiny, papery crust and the sides are just beginning to come away from the tin. Take out of the oven.\n\nSTEP 14\nLeave the whole thing in the tin until completely cold, then, if you’re using the brownie tin, lift up the protruding rim slightly and slide the uncut brownie out on its base. If you’re using a normal tin, lift out the brownie with the foil. Cut into quarters, then cut each quarter into four squares and finally into triangles.\n\nSTEP 15\nThey’ll keep in an airtight container for a good two weeks and in the freezer for up to a month.\n\n:Mic drop:",
      "It has poor simulation of hand skeleton, so you can't use all fingers, benefits of Index Knuckles controller or VR gloves, etc. And, scenario doesn't allow you to do anything, actually, except one straightforward way. Some things are elaborated, but mostly it isn't worth time or money. But I'm rating it as professional developer for VR, sexual content itself is not matter nor interested for me. My advice for game developer is to add more hand tracking features and more scenarios - in this case it can be something better.",

      "[h1]An old classic that's fresher than lots of today's titles.[/h1]\n\n[i]Day of the Tentacle[/i] first launched in 1993. I remember, because I was a teenager then and couldn't play it as my PC didn't meet the minimum requirements! This was actually the sequel to an earlier game, [i]Maniac Mansion[/i], which was released in 1987. I played [i]Maniac Mansion[/i] a few years after it came out, but did not complete it as the game's movement and controls were just too dated and clunky for me (even back then) to be bothered with. \n\nPlaying [i]Maniac Mansion[/i] is not at all necessary in order to enjoy [i]Day of the Tentacle[/i], though those who have will definitely find greater connection to the game's characters, especially the Edison family.\n\n23 years later, [i]Day of the Tentacle Remastered[/i] is essentially the same as it was before, but with sleeker graphics and a more modernised interface. While the story hasn't changed, it surprisingly (or not) hasn't aged one bit either - tentacle mutates and seeks to conquer the world, and only you (and your friends) can stop him! Though straightforward, the game's charm is in its various amusing time travel locations and the weird and wonderful characters you meet along the way. This is a prime example of where [i]\"it's all about the journey, not the destination.\"[/i]\n\n\n[h1]Yays![/h1]\n\n+ Vibrant, colourful, hi-res cartoon-style graphics.\n+ Well-designed rooms, locations and scenery.\n+ Fully voiced, with good voice acting for the most part. (The guy who plays Dr Fred is awesome.)\n+ Interesting, memorable characters.\n+ Fun, amusing story.\n+ Wacky humour.\n+ Clear goals.\n+ Cool easter eggs. (Under \"achievements\".)\n+ Contains a free game ([i]Maniac Mansion[/i])!\n+ Puzzles are mostly enjoyable and require some creative thinking.\n+ Many gameplay hours.\n+ Trading cards.\n\n[h1]Nays.[/h1]\n\n- [url=steamcommunity.com/app/388210/discussions/0/392184522713202518/]Audio starts stuttering[/url] after a while, due to memory problems.\n- Achievements remain hidden, even after the game is completed, so you can't see what you're missing.\n- Some puzzles have illogical or nonsensical solutions.\n- Bugs: e.g. When looking at one of the items, Laverne's voice sounds when Bernard speaks.\n- No mouse command to fast-forward dialogue; instead, you have to press \".\" which is really inconvenient, especially when the whole point of a point-n-click game is to [i]not[/i] have to use your keyboard!\n- Some counter-intuitive puzzle set-ups: E.g. For the videotape puzzle, a button which looks like the \"STOP\" button, is actually the \"RECORD\" button. Anyone who's ever used a VCR or tape recorder would know that the square symbol denotes \"STOP\", while the round button denotes \"RECORD\". \n- Hoagie's periodic belches sound absolutely disgusting!\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nThis was a hugely enjoyable experience from start to finish. Though the nostalgia factor played a part in my case, even if you've never heard of the [i]Maniac Mansion[/i] series, as long as you count yourself a point-n-click adventure game fan, this is a must-play because it just gets so many things right. Add to that the timeless plot and wacky characters, and you have yourself a game that will play just as fresh & new decades down the road.\n\n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [td][u]Disclaimer:[/u] [i]Game played for free, with many thanks to my dear friend [url=steamcommunity.com/id/kflorence]KFlo[/url]. :)[/i][/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]",
      "Okay this is a weird situation. I personally don't like this game all that much, but I do still recommend it nonetheless. That's because despite me not being personally huge on it, I can't deny that it is a very well-crafted game that definitely will give people the experience they want if this is the type of game they're looking for. I, turns out, am not part of the crowd that is targeted for said experience. I just found the whole trial and error stealth RTS style of this game to just not be my cup of tea, but again I can't deny its very well-crafted. I also think the art style and voice acting and story are all very well done as well. So yeah, if you're fond of games of this type, then go for it. I'm sure you won't be disappointed. I, for one, don't think I'm entirely sold on it though.",
      "I am a 43 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he helped me. Loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.\nThank you <3",

      "A solid \"Get Va11HallA instead, unless this is on sale. Otherwise, maybe.\".\n\nCoffee Talk: Fantasy Coffee-brewing Action, is a day-by-day visual novel with slight coffee-brewing mechanics on the side. Its storyline is broken up into several days, of which customers visit your coffee shop and talk. The first few days are rather short: no longer than a few minutes, but as the story advances the days become more packed with story. The game as a whole is rather short, less than 3 hours to complete the main storyline. Overall, generally a well rounded game, but not $15. On the other hand, it compares rather poorly to Va11halla, a game with a nigh identical format, but has more characters, story, and charm. If you liked Va11halla, and really can't wait for N1RVAnnA, then get it on sale. Otherwise, just get Va11halla. But I'm still recommending it because steam doesn't allow maybes, and there's very little competition for this niche of VN.",
      "Simply fantastic. Probably the best TRUE RPG I've ever played. Your choices matter, dialogue options matter, the order in which you do things matter, even such small things such as the items you hold in your hand matter. Every build is viable, go heavy in Physical stats and you'll have difficulty solving things Logically, but maybe you can brute force your way through something. Go heavy in Logic and you'll be weak in a one-to-one fight, but maybe you'll be so fast to figure things out that it'll never come to that. You'll see things that the dim-witted brute with high Physical didn't. Failure is encouraged, there are many routes in the game you cannot open without failing something else first.\n\nA true combat system does not exist. At all. Physical altercations are decided through dice rolls based on how you've built your character. And virtually all of them are optional. I like this decision a lot. I've always found it immersion-breaking in RPGs when you're just running around the countryside, killing every bandit or animal that comes your way. This one keeps fights realistic with REAL consequences depending how things go.\n\nBarring having to restart my game once due to a bug (quicksave often, autosaves are few), the game had no major technical issues. There was a single point in the game where a vital skill check required a specific skill to be built, and I'm not sure if there were any alternate routes. I couldn't find any, just had to savescum the check. Aside from that, you have options as to how to approach everything. I'm not sure if that was an oversight or if I just missed something.\n\nCan't go into the story much without spoilers (and you DON'T want it spoiled, it's great.) But it's very well-written and even hilarious at some points. But don't be fooled, it's not a comedy game. It tackles very serious topics such as Fascism, Communism, Mental Illness, Addiction, and many other things.\n\nOverall an amazing RPG experience that I cannot recommend enough. Will definitely play through this several times to see how things go with different builds. Highly suggest you purchase this if you have any interest.",
      "I shall start by saying that if you are deciding to buy this game then don't let the negative reviews sway you. In general, Fallout 4 is an amazing game and can be incredibly fun.\n\nPros: \n-Very immersive and will drain so many hours, days, weeks and months from your life.\n-Far Harbour, Automotron and (first half of) NukaWorld DLC have really good stories, quests and environments.\n-Mostly fluid combat system. Everything depends on how you want to play the game.\n\nCons: \n-WIll drain so much of your life away (might've forgotten my gf's birthday ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ )\n-Main story was incredibly lackluster compared to previous Fallout games\n-Giving you the option to be literally any kind of character you want to be....except you're always tied to being a parent.\n-a few repitive quests. (although gives you opportunities to approach these quests, areas and enemies differently\n\nAll in all, If you're a Fallout fan because of previous stories then you might not feel fulfilled playing this game, however if you love character creations, lore and immersive environments with untold stories then I completely recommend this game to you.",

It is up to us to bring the troll to his senses and save Christmas for everyone.\n\nTLoS brings players to one world and six levels of great platforming that are reminiscent of Super Mario World (SNES) but simplified. There are only six levels total, one of which is a castle, before the final battle with the troll. The only difference is that we will be collecting chocolate cookies rather than the traditional yellow coins. We also lose part of our cloak when we are injured, so it's not uncommon for you to find yourself jumping through the levels wearing nothing but red boxer shorts. For instance, red blocks can give you a new coat, which means extra life, or Santa socks and hats, which give a power-up or simply chocolate cookies. The power-up allows you to throw stones as if you had collected the Fire Flower from Super Mario, and that's about it. TLoS also offers a 2-4 co-op player mode, in which players will be able to work together to complete this short and family-friendly adventure.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3009359595\n\nSimilar to Super Mario World, you walk to a level to choose them in the Overworld. Once we reach a certain level, we are allowed to walk, leap, and even sprint. Additionally, there are other indications on the screen that show you how many cookies you have already gathered and how much time is remaining to finish the level. We get an extra life when 100 cookies are collected. We can activate a checkpoint about halfway through the level to pick up exactly where the checkpoint was reached, instead of having to do the entire level all over again. The game also features side-scrolling and underwater levels. The only problem is that if you quit at level three, close the game and start again, you have to start from level one, so you have to play the game in one go. This means that there are no save points or \"save states\". Considering the length of the game, this is not a big deal, but it's still \"annoying\".\n\n[h3] My Specs [/h3]\n\n[code]CPU: i9 9900k\nGPU: RTX 2080 Ti\nRAM: DDR4 32 GB RAM\nOS: Win10\nResolution: 1440p @144hz\n[/code]\n\n[h3] Conclusion [/h3]\n\nWe are all hoping that Nintendo will release their IPs on Steam so that we can play with them one more time. We may all agree, based on experience, that this is probably never going to happen, but Indie developers are there to make it happen. To avoid the tedious teachings at school, you used to be able to play these types of games in class on the usual Flash Player websites, and now you can play them on Steam. Though it's not a masterpiece, it's extremely minimalistic, and it's unquestionably too short, the 20 minutes I spent playing it were nevertheless a lot of fun, especially because the platforming is accurate and not wonky at all. Just remember, it's very minimalistic and may be too minimalistic for some, but if that doesn't bother you, feel free to go ahead and try it out.\n\nIt would be my personal highlight if there were additional levels, more secret exits, more power-up alternatives, and more hours of overall playtime.\n\n[h2] Final Verdict: 8/10 A typical gas station snack that turns out to be a surprisingly good one.🎅 [/h2]",
      "[h1]Technology[/h1]\nThe game is (was?) awfully poorly optimized.\nI don't think this game looks good enough for the hardware it requires. Some old RTS games looked similar to this title but required much less to run (I am referencing how the technology is better but the \"PC to FPS\" ratio has gone downhills).\n\nI understand that calculating AI choices and the simulation take a lot of resources, but this is not a game with a few thousand AI players like e.g. EU4 is. This is a relatively small map with just some AI players. This game also does not look that much better than some other RTS/TBS titles and I had FPS issues even with the lowest settings.\n\nI first ran this title with R9 280, so a quite old GPU, but that GPU was fully capable of running many decently modern games. This is IMO unacceptable, the developer can't optimize the game, and releases poorly coded product. I tested different graphic settings and noticed nearly no differences in the framerate.\n\nI then upgraded my PC to the top AM4 CPU and a very new GPU card (6600XT, overclocked) and the game ran fine on the highest settings, but I would not call it super smooth. All the other games run perfectly.\nElden Ring, Baldurs Gate 3, Cyberpunk (absolutely 0 issues in Cyberpunk). I would say CA messed up their game and didn't care to optimize it.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThe game is rather decent, it's enjoyable and has a connection to the lore of Warhammer.\nYou can't say a bad word about the general RTS mechanics, the battles and whatever. Just a normal RTS...\n\nIt just isn't the greatest RTS/TBS. Compared to Heroes of Might and Magic 3, or titles like let's say Cossacks, Age of Empires, or maybe Supreme Commander... It is unique in the Total War way, but given the amount of games in the series, it's ... not unique really (I have seen everything this game offers in different titles over the years).\n\nJust a giant simulation with a surprising lack of mechanics for an RTS game (as in economic aspect, diplomacy, map tactics. I think Europa Universalis IV is a good example of a really advanced tactics model in an RTS/TBS game and Civ 6 would be a great example of map design/economics). I personally don't like the maps for real-time battles. These maps seem quite crude and the skirmishes are badly designed.\n\nIn order to inflict maximum casualties you would need to kill every single unit. It should be enough that you break the enemy and automatically win. It's also quite unbalanced. Depending on what you kill first the results can wildly vary (including the AI acting much differently every time and the proposed outcomes of auto-resolved battles are just unhinged).\n\n I probably would like this game more without the \"real-time\" battles, but I assume it's the \"Total War\" way. To me it's time intensive and just not interesting. I liked Warhammer 40k's battles much more. They felt more tactical. Placement of units in this game does matter, but I had more fun playing The Battle for Middle Earth 15 years ago than this. I think the units panic too quickly and the characters don't matter enough.\n\nIt's the closest to the HoMM in terms of map and characters, however it lacks many things that made HoMM great (like tailored character development with meaningful spells and ability to recruit units, find artifacts on the map etc). The cities feel kind of empty, the mechanics are rather poorly described/introduced and just weird for an RTS (for my liking). \n\nI am not sure why there is so little care about the main characters. It would be very cool to build them up, be able to find artifacts on the map (besides the Sword of Khaine, that's just one item) and do something else than just advance some skills in the skill tree. Even if you invest your time in them then they can be sieged and just die.\n\nI also don't like some mechanics, for example the corruption, or slaves (they are not much intuitive. I think they should create clearer GUI and work on the general set of game rules, rather than make every faction different but also following totally different rules. Are we supposed to compete in a campaign and how if we follow different rules?). \nSome game prompts are meant to \"help\" learning the game, but they not always load up and they also don't explain small logos (traits) of the units, it's pretty useless. You need to use web browser anyway. Why to bother?\nIn that aspect - I think the designers totally messed up the UI/UX.\n\n21st August 2023 update: I played Baldur's Gate 3 and imagine they paid enough of work to actually make icons explain the traits of characters or items, amazing is it not? Seems to be lack of care. Every single icon in BG3 is fully explained. I could learn the game's rules and effectively build my characters.\n\n[h1]Genre[/h1]\nThe game is pretty fine, it gives some fun when playing it. Feels like Warhammer I guess? I personally am more of the 40k fan, but a game in the old universe is making lots of sense and the character design with world design are high quality.\n\n[h1] Summary (what made me dump this game also) [/h1]\nThe character design is quite impressive and it seems that they cared about the \"vibe\", but the game is just a money grab. why are there 3 game titles instead of one? What is the main improvement in between all of these titles?\nEach one of them has dozens of DLCs. An average person surely won't spend 300$ just to play more factions.\n\nWhat angered me so much I stopped playing after the purchase:\nThe publisher releases a paid product that claims to have free DLCs - some of them are, but the most important one isn't, and without it the game has got only 50% functionality and feels like a demo.\nRTS game without skirmish mode or some kind of \"do whatever\" mode is a meme. This isn't a DnD campaign board (and ironically such a campaign would allow for much more than selection of 5 heroes on one map lol), but an RTS in a specific universe.\n\nEvery normal RTS game has got a skirmish/free play mode (The Battle for the Middle-earth, Command and Conquer, Supreme Commander, Cossacks, Starcraft. Like every single RTS EVER) and this is especially filthy when you proclaim to release FREE functionality for the title, but then the player gets informed that they must buy TWO titles (WH1 and WH2) to get functionalities in the one they wanted to expand. Such a money grab, and even then the game is still locked behind micro-transactions/DLCs. I wanted to play a game, not donate to the \"poor\" publisher in 10 different ways. If the publisher wants money then they can sell better games.\n\nAwfully lot of DLCs, that don't add many things into the game. The base game doesn't feel like a game, but a rather Free to Play game account, that has 80% of content locked. Choosing from like 4 factions, especially in a game which varies so wildly depending on the faction (the factions aren't meant to be following any common rules it seems).\n\nWhat I also dislike is the publisher urging you to create an account to claim some of the \"free\" DLCs - the purpose is to collect data, and force you into their own website I assume (to raise statistics and show it to the management?). Why bother releasing game on Steam if you can't offer free DLCs to Steam users? I don't want your stupid 3rd party website.\n\nI don't recommend this game. I like Warhammer, but CA is a terrible company. I updated this review and in the meantime there have been at least a few different internet dramas with them involved.\n\nI would personally rather pay 70$ to a company that cares and provides a fun product (e.g. Lorian), than a DLC-locked tech demo... that \"stock\" Warhammer sure is.",
      "Having currently 1340 hours of playtime and having reached the highest achievable rank (Grand Champion), I can't currently recommend others to follow what I've been doing.\n\nWhile I love the game for it's smooth gameplay and somewhat balanced roster of playable character, the company, Stunlock Studios, are simply not caring for this game the way it deserves. In the start of 2018 we got a roadmap of promised features. This roadmap has since been tossed aside, and the community mocked, as they left battlerite arena development for months to do a battleroyale gamemode, which then turned into a standalone game, which then flopped and as of now has around 1/10 of the active playerbase that Battlerite has.\n\nAs others have also said, the matchmaking is horrible, especially at higher ranks. This can probably be attributed to the low playercount. At the highest ranks, it would not be uncommon to have a queue of 10-15 minutes only to be matched against people at a significantly lower skill level, which then leaves everyone in the match unhappy. This is in Europe, which I believe is the region with the highest playercount.\n\nTo sum it up, I believe this was a game with great potential, which has been wasted by a company with 40 employees, somehow only doing updates like they were a company of 3 people.",

      "Plays and looks just like the Park Ranger and Cruise Director HOG series, if you enjoyed those then you will likely enjoy this series. Game is composed of hidden object scenes and simple puzzle transitions that have a loose story to bridge the movement between them. The hidden object scenes follow an older couple as they take their grandchildren to a variety of European counties on their vacation, they sprinkle in a few interesting facts between each location. There are collectibles in each scene along with a raccoon. I overall enjoyed it for a laid back experience and the weirdly fun photostock based scenes.

      "a very interesting FPS multiplayer and co-op, It would be better if it was still in development like early access because it needs some work. shorter spawn times, vehicles , larger and more varied maps, what this game has that no other FPS has is realistic weapons. you will not find another game that models modern military grade firearms more realisticily in terms of what they sound like ,recoil, look, feel ( to the extent that a pc game can offer) they are amazing and I would buy this game for 8 bucks just for that alone.

      "To be honest, I could've typed this review up years ago when I got this, but I never knew how to make a review. But I'm here now, and I'm doing this... Okay, here we go...\nThe Good(AKA:Everything):\n-Cars go crunch here so you don't have to crash IRL(Though I know that won't stop all of you...).\n-Great cars and maps with nice little details.\n-An INCREDIBLE modding community. There's and ENDLESS supply of content coming out all the time from hard-working individuals, all so we can take your masterpieces and turn them into heaps of scrap.\nThe Bad(AKA:What bad?):\n-This is on me... but it can get a little boring, as your mostly just crashing cars. There are so challenges to do in game, and there are so many things you COULD do... but I guess I don't have the imagination to do that. Like I said, this is bad on me. No fault of the game.\n-Game is really graphics heavy, so a higher-end PC is recommended. Nothing too fancy, but RAM and GPU are hardest hit... maybe processor too...(I'm not that smart with tech...) But this isn't truly bad, as you probably already have good spec if you're looking to play a physics-heavy game.\n-Load times... They used to be bad, but they've gotten considerably better in recent updates. But... the more mods you get, the more it'll have to load. A good PC should be able to handle it, but just keep this in mind.(I have 100's of mods, and it's not too bad...)\nAnd well, that's it. Sorry this it so long... One of my first reviews, after all. But this game deserves to looked at in detail. If you play it once, you'll come back to it here and there to have more fun.

When I ask for a refund through Steam they state even though the game no longer works, its past their refund window and they cannot refund. \n\nSo, filing a BBB report on Steam.

      "I really liked the concept of this game of navigating through orbits to collect crates and then successfully landing on the exit.  However, there just isn't enough content to justify it being sold as a complete product, especially at its current price of $6.99.  You see everything there is in the first couple of levels.  No new mechanics are added to the game as you progress.  The developer admits that the game is too simple and the fix was to add artificial difficulty to make the game longer.  For instance, rather than have intuitive controls using toggles, it requires the player to activate thrusters with one hand and turn them off with another.  The level design stops adding anything new and just adds more tedious narrow paths that must be navigated rather than an actual challenge or puzzles.  Finally, the DLC appears to be “pay to win” rather than getting any new content, it just gives the player access to aircraft that should be included already in the game.  By level 9 it is near impossible to progress any further with the default ship as it cannot accelerate fast enough to get through the small orbit and requires purchasing the DLC to advance the level.",
      "TLDR: Right now, since there are no \"NEUTRAL\" reviews on Steam, IN IT'S CURRENT STATE, its a no from me. If the bugs get ironed out, its a pretty good game. If it gets fixed, I'll likely change to a recommend.\n\nGot 2 copies as a Fig Backer to play with my brother. My single player experience (POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILERS):\n\nGOOD:\n--Love that the choices REALLY matter and there are a LOT of them in this game.\n--Many different ways to approach a situation and your reputation affects interactions. Your reputation MAY be good enough to talk yourself out of fights! Many opportunities for KISS ASS and HARD ASS and other Squad builds (Nerd stuff, Mechanics, etc.) to be useful throughout the game.\n--The fire modes have grown on me. Some weapons have their own perks which add a fire mode. Other fire modes are available via perks you can obtain in the perk tree. The Precision Strike you get once your strike meter is full is very powerful and can change a fight (can malfunction a robot with aimed shot or fire a huge burst to take out multiple hostiles).\n--You can build a new squad member at any time that will start at your current level. Messed up a squad member build? That's okay, just create a new one.\n--I like the PREPARE and AMBUSH abilities. PREPARE lets you save up to 2 AP for next turn. The AMBUSH ability allows your squad members to trade in some AP to fire on an enemy that enters their range during hostile turns.\n--I love the Animal Whisperer skill and animal companions. I like the variety of animals you can bring along with your squad.\n--Shift key to highlight stuff you can interact with. This takes away having to pixel hunt for obscured boxes and containers. When you get old and can't see as well you appreciate stuff like this.\n--I like that I only have to loot one body at the end of combat and I can easily cycle through and grab the loot from all the other lootable bodies in the area.\n--A high Luck attribute will occasionally result in more loot, and even free actions. Sometimes you'll get a free attack or a free movement from a lucky action.\n--I like the variety and usefulness of Utilities (+5% XP, +2 PER, +1 Weapon/Armor modding, etc.)\n--A lot of stuff that can be used for cover can also be shot and destroyed.\n--Humor can be a bit over-the-top, but I've chortled quite a few times.\n\nNOT SURE:\n--Can only charm a single animal per squad member with Animal Whisperer. You CAN get other special animal followers that don't count as the single. While disappointed, I can see why they limited it (more would be OP and they can start to get in the way during combat).\n--Enemies have a circular view area, which means even if you're trying to sneak past behind them, you can still be \"seen\" after a brief time.\n\nBAD/BUGS:\n--Cant team crouch. You have to manually go through all of your squad and crouch them 1 by 1, and it costs 2 AP to crouch in combat. You also cant move crouched as far as I know. You can't \"change stances\" (AKA crouch or stand up) while in cover, either. Save a game right before a fight with all your squad members crouched and ready to go? When combat locks up and you have to load the save, you have to re-crouch everybody.\n--Combat can lock up, causing you to have to reload a previous save (for me, twice per play session usually but sometimes twice for the same fight).\n--Attributes, Skills, Combat Buffs/Debuffs (and probably other stuff) need more tool tips.\n--Lost character progression.\n--Very laggy Dialogue Tree and later in the game the inventory gets laggy too.\n--Creating a Bookworm Squad Member with 1 STR creates a situation where your Squad Member is losing 3 CON (total hit points) every level up and will be erased like Marty McFly in B2TF.\n--Load screens are too long. 30+ seconds to load into different zones, over 1.5 minutes to load a game on SSD. From another review: \"while we wait, let us read the lore books we've collected.\"\n--Squad portraits don't stay in order.\n--When you have more than 6 Ranger recruits in the select character screen, the \"Companions\" section gets pushed off-screen, hiding their portraits, and making it very unintuitive to add them back into your squad (you have to use the keyboard). Need a scroll bar here.\n--Saves don't have specific names so can be easily overwritten. There is only 1 autosave by default, and later on the game autosaves right after a game changing decision, making you have to revert to a manual save (2 hours earlier for me) if you wanted to try different options. I recommend turning on timed saves as well as taking advantage of quicksaves (and of course saving often!)\n--FPS drops, sometimes so bad you have to reload.\n--Squad Members shooting through walls/floors/ceilings.\n--Radiation difficult to detect in some areas and no warning (other than your squad health draining) going from radiation level 2 to 3 for instance.\n--Combat messages briefly appear above your acting Squad Member's head and are easy to miss (like \"Out of Range\")\n--When getting shot at, the camera doesn't always auto focus on who is shooting you.\n--At least three bugged missions I can think of (but hey, one is an unlimited money glitch so more of a feature).\n--Character models and other things (switches) not loading properly leading to invisible characters you can interact with (or fight with, as it happens in combat sometimes too).\n--The game can become unresponsive when trying to move 2 Squad Members separately and interact with someone.\n--Explosive Barrels not actually exploding when shot (this seems to be related to being too far away from the barrel when sniping it, as if you get closer, they'll actually explode).\n--Cybernetic Implants are a good idea, but they take up your Utility Slot instead of giving you another slot dedicated to them so when you have the ability to finally use them, it feels more like a trade-off rather than an augmentation.\n--No Inventory filter for Utilities. Gotta scroll through your hundreds of items and the Utilities aren't even grouped together entirely in the inventory, they are scattered throughout.\n--When you open a door to a closed room, fog of war usually obscures what is in the room until you physically walk a squad member into the room.\n--Cannot have multiple types of the same animal in a Squad with multiple Animal Whisperers.\n--Don't try to loot two containers at once.\n--Some traps can't be disarmed.\n--Various graphic glitches like missing texture or dialogue bubbles that are blank or don't disappear.\n--Can't remove and reuse weapon mods.\n--Some equipped weapons will display inflated damage numbers (by 300% in some cases) until re-equipped. Not even sure how long it has been that way or if it was affecting my game.\n--If you misclick the filter categories in a vendor encounter on the World Map, it'll kick you out of the encounter to the radio and you can't get back to the random encounter at that time. I only mention this since I've done it so many times.\n--You can't pause the game which may or may not affect time sensitive quests. You can be detected and attacked in the menu (escape key) or in your inventory.\n--There is no way to have Special companions/followers that you get from Missions follow a different squad member. If you dump that Squad Member later, you lose the follower too (as far as I know).\n--Get radio signals with \"coordinates to follow\" yet I have no clue who from or what it opened up on the map (if anything).\n--Gaining access to certain parts of the Rangers HQ requires you to do something pretty awful.\n--I'm out of room....\n\nIt feels like I'm fighting against the game more than the Wasteland sometimes. I don't even want to try multiplayer until it gets fixed (and my brother doesn't either).\n\nIf you're a developer of this game, thank you for your time and effort! Polish it up and I'll be happy to change this to a recommend! Edited for clarity/additions and I cut a lot. Thank you for reading and thank you for the comments and awards! Have a great day and be kind to others.",
      "Honestly this game feels like it was made for me.\nQuoting iron pineapple:\"this guy (the dev) just gets it\". And he really does! The level design is great and the areas are cool and unique and a real joy to explore! A really slick zelda-like souls-like-ish game. \nBut that's not all.\nThe gimmick of this game, and the thing that really sets it apart and makes it go above the rest, is the manual. The whole gimmick is that the game is written, mostly, in an unknown runic language, forcing the player to figure out game mechanics, progression and puzzles on their own. You have only one thing to help you: as you progress you collect pages of a manual, in the style of those old console games, which gives you again pseudo-cryptic hints, because it's also mostly in the other language.\nThe way the manual and the knowledge based progression flow into the design of the game is nothing short of genius. It's hard to gosh about just how amazing it is, because that would be spoiling it, but it's completely genius. \nGame's a masterpiece for me, a strange mesh of Hollow Knight  meets  Outer Wilds-based knowledge progression. \nDefinitely a must-buy, don't even worry about it going on a sale, it's an easy indie GOTY for me",
      "OMG I LOVE THIS SO MUCH!\nFun to control, it runs fine on my potato Laptop\nIts colorful\nits fun\nits amazingly well animated\ni love the map, i love the bosses so far, i love everythign about this,\nlock on aiming with RB is awesome, special weapons, parries, and attacks you buy from the shop ^^ this is \nPURE GOLD",
      "I remembered when I was 8, back then I used to play this on my PS3. It was one of the first RPG games i've ever played aside from Pokemon on GameBoy / Nintendo DS. This game made me feel like I'm in an another world back then. I had dreams of my companion and Drippy. It was such a nostalgic moment when I opened this game, and I was abit sad because I wished that I could turn back time and finish this game when I was a kid. I wasn't able to finish it at that time due to my brother taking away the PS3 overseas. Because now, after getting older, there are so many responsibilities that I must hold on to. Playing games like this during childhood truly changes the vibe of experiencing it. Now I only got a glimpse of it when I opened it for an hour or so. Maybe one day I'll finish this game, once I'm free from reality.",
      "I've been waiting since the likes of Planescape Torment and Baldurs Gate 2 for a game to match their sheer perfection, many games came quite close, but Divinity Original Sin just manages to hit so many nails on the head its not funny. It looks great and still plays fine on my aging PC, it has a great storyline, it's two protagonists have some great interactions and dialogue. The voice acting is spot on and it has the most sublime OST.\n\nThe combat is turn-based but do not let this put you off, there are so many choices in combat with the interaction of spells with each other and the environment, that the game just begs you to experiment with different tactics.\n\nThis game just oozes pure class, it was a labour of love for Larian and it shows in every tiny detail of the game.\nIf you like RPG games (or even just pure quality games), you need to play this game, it is the benchmark I will use in comparing other games in future.\n\nWell done Larian.",
      "I played the demo and instantly became enamored. The mix of Slay the Spire-style deck-building with elements of the ship combat from FTL: Faster Than Light is an absolutely fascinating mix, and the \"single-axis\" movement system adds a whole extra layer that I've never seen in anything except the Mega Man: Battle Network series.\n\nI bought the full game within the first hour of being available. After having played for nearly 4 hours at the time of writing, my opinion hasn't changed in the slightest. I already love what's available and so far I feel like I've barely scratched the surface.\n\nI can't wait to see what awaits in the future for this awesome title.\n\nEDIT: As a small addition, I will say: I beat my very first run, which is set to the lowest difficulty (Normal). I jumped up to Hard to try to unlock a new ship, and I haven't been able to beat a run since then. It's probably just that I'm bad, all things considered, but be aware that the changes made with difficulty increases are probably more impactful than they may seem.\n\nAlso I wanna say to the devs: thank you for launching the game with mod support and working on making it easier! But also please look into getting Steam Workshop support if you can!",
      "This is half of a very good game. You might be impressed in the first 10 hours, but after that it becomes evident you are playing the skeleton of what could be a generational game. Here is some of the good and some of the bad.\n\nThe Good:\n-Graphics look great, even on lower settings\n-Decently varied battle maps\n-Sound design makes killing blows feel amazing\n-Decent variety of weapons\n\nThe Bad:\n-Extremely shallow \"campaign\"\n-Almost zero role playing elements. Every character behaves identically towards you. Even your own wife will try to introduce herself. Kill someone's father/brother/entire clan? They will never mention it and will behave towards you just like anyone else.\n-\"Realistic mode\" means all your enemies will be absolute tank meat sponges while you are made of glass.\n-After you get your first settlement the game becomes extremely tedious. You will play whack a mole with enemy armies who take almost no time to recuperate. Wipe out 3 enemy armies in a massive, \"war changing battle\"? Oops, looks like all of those armies are back to full strength in a matter of days.\n-Almost zero variation of playstyles. Sure you can be a trader or a rogue mercenary for the early game, but you will always end up cheesing the smithing economy mechanics to support the larger armies you need in the mid game\n\nThis is simply an unfinished game. The fact they have been selling it for $50 successfully for years is wild.\nWould have much rather paid $100 for a fully finished product.\n\nUnless they have a massive overhaul on the \"Official Release\" October 25th, I cannot recommend this game. Shame.",
      "First off, the graphics pictured here are NOT what the game looks like. Even in Ultra mode it doesn't come close to looking this \"good.\" \n\nSecond, this game is best played with a controller. Not that I mind this, but after years of mouse + keyboard play it was difficult to get used to switching over.\n\nThird, it says you can alter the dungeon and create new paths and doorways and etc. I received an item that supposedly allowed me to do this but I couldn't get it to work.\n\nFinally, for the price of this game, it should be something spectacular. It wasn't. I've purchased $10 games on Steam that are much better than this. Wait for a big sale if you're interested in this game.",

They will not sell us the public it's 18+ XP Room from it's Web Site.  \n\nNote to Publisher: Anything less than changing this to a Free Demo from all the above I've stated.

      "For the past 4 years I couldn't get myself to finish a single game without having to force myself to do it(and even then I failed). I couldn't enjoy SP games no matter how good the gameplay or the story was. I kept buying games hoping to find that one game that would do the trick. This was FF XV for me. Despite of all my friends advising me against buying it because it was just going to be another game that would sit around in my library, I decided to give it a try.\n\nIt actually felt like I went back in time to when I could play SP games for hours without getting bored after an hour or two.\n\nI admit I skipped most sidequests and I'll try going back to them sooner or later, although it may not be the best game out there in terms of content(you can finish the game on easy skipping most secondary quests in about 20-25 hours) or story development, playing through it felt like a new experience. In fact, even after finishing the game there's still plenty of things to do and in my opinion, even playing it through again just to spend more time with Noctis and his friends is worth it.\n\nThe story is not mindblowing, the combat system is really fun but far from flawless, most sidequests aren't well written but at its core, at least for me, FF XV has something to it that other games lack. I can't say it magically restored my old passion for gaming but it has given me a reason to at least try to get into it again.\n\nIf you haven't played it yet I sincerely envy you, I would love to experience it all over again from the start, it has been a memorable journey to say the least and I hope that you are willing to give it a try. ^^",
      "I bought this game in order to review it, seeing as there were no current reviews for it. \nI thought I'd help the game out by maybe giving it that tiny bit of publicity it needed to get off the ground.\nIn doing so I have failed. As this game isn't worth reviewing, there is nothing to review. Well, I should say there is stuff to review but I feel as though the dev's didn't even attempt to make this a game that anyone would enjoy. Well actually I'll let them off of the target of \"enjoy\", I'd go further to say it doesn't even feel like they tried to make a game that someone who had nothing to do and was bored out of their mind would say maybe I'll play this for a bit\nI jumped straight in, ignored the help in menu and started playing. It took me at least 4-5 mins before I even had the slightest concept of what was going on and what I had to achieve. Once I did get the hang of it I still thought \"I must be missing something, I'm not really doing anything\" so I ventured to the help menu to find that nope, thats it buddy.\nThe controls are lacking, the soundtrack and the sound effects (which happen to be a melody playing) do not blend at all, (they play completely out of time on top of the soundtrack).\nYou can buy it and prove me wrong, go ahead. This is just my opinion.",
      "buy it on sale. campaign was decent, however The Last Tiger mission was a standout. Multiplayer experience is ok overall, the hackers make it the worst bit. 6.5/10, if Dice fixes their servers and clears out the hackers then maybe it's worthy of an 8/10.",
      "Just go play it. It's only $20, and you have a 2hr refund limit. You'll love it way before then.\n\n...still here? Quick review. Awesome platformer, hits all the marks in flying colors. Let's compare w Mario Maker, the most similar game to this one:\n\n[edit: Updated to compare to SMM2 instead of 1]\nWhat Mario Maker 2 Does Better\n- Mario\n- Different themes/gameplay physics across multiple mario games\n- Much larger playerbase\n\nWhat Levelhead Does Better\n- Oh my god the search functionality\n    - Search by creator, difficulty, tags, what's popular, etc.\n    - TL;DR you can find the awesome, and avoid the crap\n- Level discovery\n    - Can actively advertise my levels\n    - Get rewarded for playing people's levels\n- $20\n- Dying doesn't take 12 years to respawn\n- Fun, short campaign to slowly unlock more creative tools after seeing how they are used\n- Local Co-op (or online with Parsec)\n- Leaderboards (if you care, I personally don't)\n\nI cannot stress enough how AMAZING it is to not have to suffer through crap levels. The search functionality is soooo good; as a casual player, it is the sole reason I stopped playing Mario Maker 1. Mario Maker 2 is better, but it still falls terribly short. I think the best part is that Levelhead gives people control over the visibility of their levels, as well as incentives to play other peoples, and that is something that SMM2 unfortunately lacks.",
      "I even set a calendar reminder so that I could get this on release. I wish I hadn't bothered. Going great guns until I got to the passage. Game over as I can't progress. Tried allsorts to drop the jammer but unable to do so. I guess it is a case of waiting for all the bugs to get resolved.",
      "Impulse Control is a lazy, badly made ripoff of Angry Birds, with slightly less features and options, poorer physics, worse quality assets, and overall worse gameplay.  But to differentiate, they slapped a Facebook style personality quiz on the front, much like putting a hat on Frankensteins Monster works well as a disguise, you know.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, the game doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.\n\nThere's no options to change the resolution for the game or customise the graphics settings.  There's no way for gamers to ensure this is running at the native resolution of their displays... there's no guarantee this game will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.  There's no way for gamers to try improve the low quality graphics.\n\nThese technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.\n\nThe game is completely free.  This is noble a gesture that shows dedication to both gamers, and the gaming industry.  Nothing speaks more to a developers belief in themselves and their product than making their game available for everyone without remuneration.  It's a shame in this case that the implementation is below the minimum standards a dedicated PC game should offer to enthusiasts.  The quality here is simply too low for me to recommend, even for free.  I really feel like this should have been a mobile app, like the Angry Birds game this is a blatant ripoff of, but then it would have to compete with Angry Birds.  It certainly doesn't belong on PC.  Sometimes the only way to win is not to play.",
      "I like this game because it is so relaxing. It has a great mix of monsters in it. You are not frighting monsters  all the time. I give this game a 5 star rating. I wish thee was a Dragon Quest Builder;s 3.",
      "(This is a spoilerfree Review)\nI recommend not to search any character or even the name of the game to avoid spoilers.\n\nBasic:\nDanganronpa Trigger Happy Havoc is a murder-mystery game with a focus on deep Story.\nThere are 3 main games and 1 spin-off game. This is the First one to start with.\nYou can expect about 40 to 50 hours in this game (depending on how fast you can read and think)\nI recommend reading all dialogue and not skipping any cutscenes.\nThe overall gameplay is simple and hard at the same time, but I bet everybody could play it.\n\nStory: (Spoilerfree/no spoiler)\nThe game is about a bunch of Students who were being dragged into a Killing Game.\nThe only way to escape is by killing another Student and getting away with it.\nYou'll learn more about it while playing, there are a bunch of unsolved questions in the beginning.\n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay is mostly divided into 2 different Parts: typical visual novel gameplay\n(freetime use and social interaction) and the Class Trials. In these class trials\nyou have to solve some Minigames but mostly try to discover the Murderer (or imposter if you played Among us).\nThe class trials are definitely the best Part of the game and you can be hyped about each of them.\nBefore each class trial you have to do some Investigation about the Murder and during that time you can\ntheorize who it was and how they've done it.\n\nCharacters:\nThe characters in this Game are as different as they can be. I bet you'll have different favourite ones.\nAll I can say is that you'll learn to love each and everyone on their own way.\n\nBuy Recommendation:\nDo I recommend everybody to buy this Game? No. If you are getting bored because you mostly \nonly play Shooters and MOBA's, I dont think you will enjoy this Game even if I did. But to everybody else\nwho enjoys mystery games like Ace Attorney or even mystery/detective shows I highly recommend buying this game\nand try it out. You'll enjoy it!\n\nAs I said try to avoid any spoilers. So dont look in the Steam Workshops etc.\nThank you for reading!",
      "This game is for sure not perfect, but worth buying for a specific type of gamer.\n\n[b]What is good in this game?[/b]\n- It has a pretty solid gun gameplay. The movement is quick and polished as well.\n- One level is on average 20 seconds. It's fun to improve your gameplay to get better times in the small levels. \n- It's really a blast getting a perfect run, killing enemies in bullet time or exploiting the enemies weakspots.\n- There is content for around 10-15 hours. Maybe more if you consider going for 100%.\n\n[b]Anyway there are also some flaws: [/b]\n- In Neon White or Ghostrunner the movement and pace through the levels often feels like a perfect choreographic \"dance\"\n- The levels and the areas in Warstride are verry tight. I often lost pace through \"stupid\" placed rocks or small doors.\n- There is not much to explore. The levels are verry linear. While in Neon White it was so much fun to explore shortcuts or other hidden possibilities to improve ur time there are no such mechanics in Warstride at all. I'd love to have some exploration at least in the \"long levels\".\n- It could get repetitive for some players as it's a core element to complete the levels on 5 different difficulties. \n\n[b]Conclusion: [/b]\nIf you like fast paced games like Ghostrunner, Neon White or Doom and you have no problem in repeating short levels several times and u don't except an extraordinary game u will have fun for several hours on a low price.\n",
      "Absolutely dated graphics that make visibility in this game a total exercise for your eyes, enemies and teammates blend into the background and scenery constantly, friendly markers everywhere obstructing your vision, insanely fast TTK with frustrating bleed mechanics...\n\nAnd the list goes on, it's beyond me how this game is being called a better one than Battlefield, are we even playing the same game at all? This game made me go back playing Battlefield 3. If you want to play a better game than 2042, play any of the others. BF3, BF4, BF1 or even 5, but please, stop shilling games like this and trying to justify it with the price and how many worked on it, this game is not even close to being better than a battlefield game at all",

      "$15 during the autumn sale was a great price for a ton of fun and a game with some truly breathtaking visuals and effects, one of the best looking games I have ever seen. It is a worthy addition to the JC franchise. Combat is more of the same from JC2, there's tons of explosions, a big open world, great sound and music, and solid mission progression without having to grind which is becoming a thing of the past now with microtransactions in games. The game's biggest flaws are that dirt bike handling is the worst vehicle handling I have ever seen in any video game, some wingsuit missions are beyond frustrating, and it is Square so it of course isn't optimized very well unless you have a powerful setup. That and the ending is one big lazy cop out sucky easy boss fight.\n\nI was luckily able to bypass optimization issues with a powerful setup and minor tweaks. So don't risk it unless this is on sale, your pc is powerful, and also provided you don't mind a few crashes in a couple missions. Just remember that Square is #1 in continually barfing out horrible pc ports and they will never learn so even with a beast pc you are still taking a chance.\n\n7/10 because of a ton of glitches I didn't mention that would take way too long to write down, and because of Square continually sucking balls on making optimized pc games. In which they cannot do.",
      "Please please please give this one a try, especially if you're a fan of existentialism, bittersweet stories, cyberpunk dystopias, gambling with your life every day, living life one step at a time, the small things that matter, cats and feeling like sh!t, but in a good way",
      "I waited 12+ years for a proper sequel to A Crack in Time (yes i know the other games came out but tbh they didn't do much for me) for it only to come out for the PS5. Unfortunately, I wasn't getting a new console for just one game. \n\nNow, two years later I'm playing it on the PC.  While surreal, I am super glad they ported this series to a different platform, and the game was totally worth the wait.\n\nThe port by Nixxes ran very nice for me. I had a few hitches in the dimensional portal scenes, and one crash in a total of 12hrs of playtime. I do understand that some people are having issues and that does suck & does not disqualify their experiences, however, It is not even close to how bad TLOU Pt.1's port was.  \n\nIt's another Insomniac banger, and if you've played any of their games you already know whats up. I beat the game in 12 hrs on the 2nd to last difficulty grabbing whatever side content/collectibles I could before the story captivated me. As is tradition, there is a NG+ mode (haven't touched yet) and I look forward to trying it. I'll probably update the review at that point, but the games are always repayable due to their collect-a-thon nature, that and being so damn fun you have a dumb ear-to-ear smile for all of the playtime.  \n \nIf you enjoyed the Ratchet and Clank games in the past, its way more of that + the dimensional gimmick which is really well done and very neat tech wise. I love the new movement features and Rivet is a very good addition to the cast. I hope she stays relevant in the story in the future. Game feels super good to play as well, weapons are great as always. The writing is still funny and enjoyable. It's just a good time, and I highly recommend it, even at full price.\n\nLastly, I would like to direct a message to Sony/PS Studios/Insomniac Games:\nPLEASE PORT THE OTHER AND OLDER R&C GAMES PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE IPELASE PLs I WILL PAY $70",
      "The fact that you can't pause the game during cutscenes and conversations, is very frustrating. The cinematics are long (and sometimes exhausting).

We have the technology!",
      "Absolutely amazing. PLEASE don't judge this game based on how it looks. You must try it yourself! I thought it would be terrible but a friend convinced me to try it, and I'm glad he did. I haven't had so much fun in a game in a long time.",
      "I have always wanted to play Resdient Evil 4, and I wanted to play this game so badly.  I am giving a negative review simply because the games FPS on the PC are bad, that could be because of Windows 10 because I heared rumors that the game does not run well on it and such, so that could be the problem.   Another problem I faced is the lip sync is dealyed when it's on the cutscenes so that makes everything slow and such.  The gameplay from what I seen however is pretty great and I think Resdient Evil 4 is a great game, but this port is not, get it for the GC, Will, PS2, or any of the consloes that has this game.",
      "A missed opportunity. But, if you liked the original, you'll like this one as well.\n\nGreat graphics and sound, just like its predecessor. Once again, bonus points for ultrawide support. No complaints about the presentation, but some of the characters definitely rub me the wrong way. YMMV in that department. \n\nI had read that the original writer passed away. I see this left the team with a difficult choice. To their credit, I could not tell the difference between the two. It emulates the same style and tone, and I imagine this is intentional to honor the spirit of the original author's intent. Unfortunately, I think the writing was the worst part of the original by far, and I see this as a missed opportunity to move on from that. \n\nAll of the supernatural elements in this story are but the thinnest of veils for what is ultimately a collection of modern day social media discourse. There is rampant virtue signaling, and every character speaks about the world around them as if they live inside Twitter. There are a scant few genuine moments, and I can appreciate the fact that the writer(s?) clearly feel a lot of angst about putting themselves out there and the creative process in general. There is a complete lack of subtlety in the writing regarding this, but I see it and I get it. \n\nIt feels a lot more disappointing than the first one, as we're familiar with much of the cast already, and there's not a lot of progress or poignancy in their respective narratives. I genuinely came away from this game feeling like I spent a few hours reading Twitter threads. It's nothing but surface level social commentary.\n\nGiven that the intent here was probably to honor the original writer, I'd still be in for a Coffee Talk 3 in the hopes that they show some growth and try something different. If that one also ends up being the same, I'd definitely call it quits. \n\nFWIW, this is certainly a worthy tribute for those who do not find fault with the original.",
      "This game is adrenaline, speed and acid to the absolute maximum and it delivers - you'll be doing exactly what you see in the trailers in absolutely no time and feeling like a badass!\n\nWe have all the menu, leaderboards and replay system as in Devil Daggers along with a new clips section for highlights from runs. \nThe new scoring system is a HUGE improvement. In DD you had to survive as long as possible leading to it becoming repetitive as you grinded, here the score is based on how fast you can kill stuff and there is an ending to the run meaning you might survive to the end and kill the boss - but someone else could beat your score by killing stuff faster in the first min and then dying. \nThis adds loads more risk to the game as you WANT to take those risks to kill stuff faster.\n\nOnly let down is the controls, the simple control scheme worked in Devil daggers as there wasn't much going on but it REALLY hurts now theres so many new mechanics causing both a lot of unintended actions like with RMB is your laser and you can scatter this off the ground or like you see in the trailers shoot the gems for your homing daggers trouble is RMB is also grab meaning if you look at a gem and start to power your laser you simple pick up the gem and no laser huge momentum loss. Likewise spacebar is jump, dash, slide, fake and air slam this not only leads to awkward \"thats not what i wanted\" moments but also cramps my hand since you are constantly spamming for dash which is 2 presses...\n\nIf the controls dont bother you or get some love this game is easily a 10/10.",

      "An excellent maximalist mashup of Slay The Spire with some Tower Defence and CCG Mechanics. Not as tight and elegantly designed as StS, but with a lot more variety in card design leads to a lot more varied and wild interactions and deck composition. Compulsive and mechanically satisfying, Monster Train embraces excess in a satisfying way, even if the whole package is wrapped up in a slightly odd aesthetic package of half remembered hearthstone knock offs.

      "An amazingly fun and short adventure from the creator of Rakuen. Mr. Saitou is a game based in the same universe as Rakuen, but follows the story a salaryman, Mr. Saitou. Mr. Saitou takes you on a journey that explores some serious undertones, but approaches the subjects with incredible sensitivity, respect and some very light and silly humor. There's tons of flavor text to be discovered, pop culture references to be recognized and if you've played Rakuen, familiar characters to meet. As you make your way through the story, there are lots of puzzles that are simplistic, but well thought out in a way that adds to the story.The game is made to be played in 1 sitting that may vary depending on how much you interact with the world. This game can also be played by many ages and is family friendly. You DO NOT have to play Rakuen first to enjoy this game or understand it, but it will definitely add a depth of sentimentality to the game, as there are some call backs. I would absolutely recommend this game to anyone and you may find yourself learning something about your own life during Mr. Saitou's journey.Have a long day!",
      "First of all, I really like the Game, it's Gameplay is wonderful and i really enjoy the parkour to combat mix in it. Although i noticed a lot of bugs especially in COOP i still enjoy logging on the game.\n\nThe Story is good but doesn't need a upgrade in my opinion. I like that certain map changes and Story decisions are dependant on some side quests and on each other.\n\nNow to the sad part:\n\nTencent recently bought Techland which was controversial at first, but then DL points were added which made a lot of people mad at Tencent and partially Techland, understandably.\nThey Including me don't want the game to die out because a greedy company wants to make some quick buck.\n\nAlthough i have to say myself, other Tencent bought games still are quite enjoyable.\n\nI just hope that Techland does the right thing in future and makes the current state of DL points less predatory and more Cosmetic based pure.\n\nIn it current state we still have no knifes without Bundles, but that was before Tencent so the blame for that goes to Techland, but i am excited for future updates and playing Dying light 2, even without buying DL points :)\n\nI'll give this game a solid 7/10 for the bugs, microtransactions but also because it has good gameplay and community reach\n\n(I have edited my original negative review about the pure rant about DL points because i also wanted to consider current gameplay and more)",
      "+Long (&quality) story mode\n\n-Sometimes utterly lost so I have to backtrack or look at playthroughs\n-No skill tree\n-Loading screens\n-Some game breaking bugs so I had to cheat to pass it (e.g. pistons in tunnel) \n-Repetitive: turn this wheel, kill this bunch of enemies to open the lock,...\n-Enemies become bullet sponges on higher difficulty modes\n-No Xen chapters, so quite a cliffhanger...\n\nIn short: it is a decent game because of the good story, but people that recommend it are probably just on a nostalgia trip.",
      "This game can be great at times but extremely frustrating most of the time. 80% change to hit, miss every time. I can't keep playing a game with so much crappy coding.",
      "An amazing game, you can go from doing great and having a full and maxed level crew, and end up fighting the wrong guy as they systematically destroy your ship systems leaving your weapons and shields off-line as your crew burns to death while suffocating.

      "I love this game. I've clocked over 300 hours in it through Origin (on my ONE character xD ). It's an excellent game, even despite it being an \"open world faffaround simulator\" which was all the rage at the time.\n\nAnd finally on Steam!? Yay! Or yay..?\n\nBut, as we know, we can't have good things. Massive thumb down to the EA Origin \"integration\" in Steam. EA, how about just stop being such massive ducks?\n\nThis is the same \"we hate our customers\" behaviour expressed by d-bags like Ubisoft and Epic. Only that EA sort of makes it worse. They *know* how much people hate the unnecessary and malicious Uplay \"integration\" that Ubisoft have forced on us for several years. Seeing this, EA decides that doing the exact same thing, with their total-garbage Origin client made even worse, is surely the only way to harass the customers enough to be worthy of the EA brand. \n\nDO NOT BUY OR LINK your Steam account if you own the game on Origin from earlier. \nIf you buy a game on Steam, which you already own on Origin, it will overwrite your Origin game.\nIf you then refund the game on Steam, this will remove the game from Origin too (even if you already own it there!), and you'll spend hours in line to get a hold of customer support. Then you must chat with bots, or people who are so void of understanding (and likely not paid near enough to care) that they might as well be bots. And if you're lucky, you might, after going through 4 or 5 different \"agents\", finally get to talk to a person that comprehends English and is authorised to do anything beyond telling you \"they'll discuss it with their team\". Then you might get your game back. \nBut! You won't get back the GOTY. Because the Steam-Orgin-GOTY overwrites your Origin GOTY. And when refunding, via Steam, you're left with a dumb/lame/placeholder copy of the GOTY in your Origin library, which doesn't work, but somehow just lingers there. Then you need to get a Digital Deluxe Edition + all DLC to get back to where you were.\n\nThis [integration] is such a tremendous show of manure, that I'm actually left wondering if EA planned it. Did Andrew Wilson take one of his billions of pocked change and say \"hey, we should make an extra effort here, to make sure that this integration is as frustrating and poorly implemented as possible, but still functional, such that things are barely limping along but just barely, because nothing is as frustrating as something that just barely sorta works but only sorta, and only by the skin of its teeth. That'll teach those entitled peasants.\"\n\nSo yeah. Great game. Bad EA.\n\nUpdate! A new Origin experience: The EA App! An all new website, wrapped inside an all new Electron wrapper! For an all new Frustrating(TM) experience and much better hogging of your PC performance.",
      "Lots of people parrot the \"tech demo\" or \"benchmark of the singularity\" lines without forming their own opinions.\n\nMe personally, as a fan of Supreme Commander, I enjoyed this game more then I thought I would. I only played the single player campaigns and haven't touched multiplayer. \n\nThe gameplay is exactly what it should be for this kind of game. When I first saw this game I didn't like how every unit was a hovering unit, but it makes sense with the class system the game has. Frigates are basically infantry, Cruisers are tanks, Dreadnauts are hero/high tier. The game borrows from Dawn of War with the territory control mechanic.",
      "you're looking for a game review you've come to the wrong place. But if youre looking for a fantastic ravioli recipe you've come to the right place.\n\nIngredients\n- To Make the Dough\n375 grams (3 cups) plain flour\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n2 eggs\n1/4 cup (50 ml / 3½ tablespoons) olive oil\n1/2 cup (120 ml / 8 tablespoons) water\nExtra flour for dusting \n\n\n- To Make Cheese Filling\n15 ounces (425 grams) container Ricotta cheese\n5 ounces (142 g/about 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons) \"3 Cheese Italian Blend\" (Parmesan, Romano & Asiago)\nNote: grate these cheeses yourself and create your own custom blend.\n1/2 cup cheddar cheese\n2 eggs, lightly beaten\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/2 teaspoon pepper\n\n\n- Extras\nYour favorite sauce for the ravioli (i.e. marinara/ marijuana)\nParmesan cheese\nBasil\nFried vegetables\nShrimp\nFish slices\nChicken pieces \nMake the Ravioli filling.\n\n- In a small mixing bowl, add the ricotta and mash with a fork.\n- Add in the 3-cheese blend, Cheddar cheese, eggs, salt, and pepper.\n- Mix all ingredients thoroughly until you have a smooth, paste-like consistency.\n- Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. \n\nMake the Ravioli dough.\n\n- Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.\n- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.\n- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.\n- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.\n- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.\n- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).\n- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. \n\nFill the Ravioli shells.\n\n- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.\n- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.\n- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.\n- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.\n- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. \n\nForm the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.\n\n- Roll the dough into two sheets\n- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.\n- Fill with the ravioli mixture.\n- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.\n- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.\n\nCook the Ravioli.\n\n- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.\n- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.\n- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest \n- Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed plates\n\nServe it up.\nTop with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!",
      "This game is like cocaine. \nI always tell myself just one more, then im done. I'll do homework. I'll sleep. I'll eat something. \nBut you know what? That last death was cheap, I'll do one more to make up for it. I just need 1000 gold for that upgrade, I'll just do one more to get it. Always just one more. \n\nThings I like:\n\n+Strong RPG Progression - Gold from your run can be spent on stats, equipment, abilities, etc. making multiple runs and longer runs more rewarding.\n\n+The game is witty and has flavor. -- there are various conditions your new characters can have such as being blind, gay or having a fear of chickens, amongst many, many others. Dying is in this sense, pretty fun. The writing has a lot of charm!\n\n+The controls are very tight -- this game has good controls. It's easy to do what you want, which is good because it's very tough and you will die a lot.\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n- The bosses in new game plus don't get harder -- As you progress into new game + or ++ or +++ and beyond, the bosses don't scale well, despite the general enemies leveling up to basically become bosses themselves. Not a huge deal, but it's the only negative I have.\n\nThen at some point you realize you've beaten the game, Thankfully there is a new game plus.\nMaybe just one more playthrough...",
      "My previous review reflected the terrible state of the game as it was on launch day. After years of improvements, the game has had its map design & cover placement tweaked, pretty-boy playermodels have been dirtied up, cringy voicelines were adjusted & a bunch of new content has been added. A lot of my complaints were addressed and I recognize the amount of work the team has done to bring the game back. It finally feels content complete and has reached an acceptable level of quality that should've been there when it came out.\n\nHowever, I am still disappointed to say it falls very short of its predecessors in terms of gameplay, map design and atmosphere. I see no reason to play this instead of BF3/BF4. \n\nPlay the map Grand Bazaar in Battlefield 3. Look at all of the particle effects, post processing and detail that map has. It has such a thick rainy atmosphere. Play it through to the end and you'll see how players tear up the map and make it look destroyed. In BF4's Paracel Storm, the foliage will sway & the waves will rise as the strong winds of a storm approaches the map. Watch as a sandstorm creeps up in Gulf of Oman and eventually engulfs it in a torrent of chaos. These landscapes have so much drama that the ones in 2042 lack. Sure, there are sandstorms and tornadoes, but they still look so sterile compared to the previous games this title stands upon.\n\nConceptually, 2042's world is supposed to be on its knees. The growing reality of extreme climate, natural disasters becoming commonplace and the world powers fighting over the last resources Earth has to offer depicts a dire situation to immerse ourselves in. This makes me imagine maps where earthquakes adjust the layout of flags throughout the round, or tsunamis roll in and what once was a playable area is now flooded. Giant tornado events that tear down skyscrapers. Sandstorms that turn the widest of maps into a close-quarters brawl. \n\nThe maps in the game have some aspects of this concept but nowhere to the amount that it should. The technology is there. The previous games have had a genuinely impressive level of immersion and atmosphere. 2042 did not have this on launch and it still doesn't. This could have been the wild natural disaster Battlefield game where we see SHTF.\n\nI don't care that we have 128 player matches or goofy butt specialists to play as. They missed the mark with 2042 and no update can fix that, conceptually, it never was able to realize its potential.",
      "Not For Broadcast is in the simplest of terms, a multi-tasking simulator.\n\nYou sit in a news control room and you have to keep track of multiple things: censoring curse words, switching between cameras, playing ads at the right time, ensuring your broadcast frequency isn't disrupted, as well as keeping an eye out for a bunch of other strange things that appear later in the game.\n\nThis isn't the easiest of games as it requires a good deal of attentiveness. The description isn't joking when they call this \"high-pressure\". You have to rely heavily on both audio and visual cues to make sure your broadcast doesn't get screwed up. As this is the news (and live), there is no rewind or undo button. If you mess up and want to get a good performance grade, you'll need to redo the entire news segment. \nIf you're a perfectionist like me, a 10 min segment can end up turning into an hour of trying to perfect that news segment. As such, I do hope an option to quick save, or at the very least, save and quit, can later be put into the game. It felt rather taxing having to keep an eye on so many things for so long. But as with any game, excellence isn't an art, it's a habit. You'll find yourself turning into a multitasking expert eventually.\n\nThankfully, the actors in the game do a great job of making the experience an entertaining one. There is a good amount of humour written into each broadcast, although I must admit I wasn't quite able to pay attention to all the dialogue, as I was too busy trying to switch to the right cameras whilst ensuring my electricity didn't get cut out. Luckily, the game does have an archive which allows you to playback the broadcasts. Without that, I'd probably be missing out on 70% of what was going on.\n\nThere is also a text narrative, choices matter portion in between news segments. As of now, it feels a little out of place and incomplete, but then again, this is an Early Access review.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that at the time of writing this review, there isn't really any \"propaganda\" aspect to the game yet.\n\nPerformance-wise, the game runs pretty smoothly. I did encounter occasional crashes if I looked left or right and back and forth too quickly, but other than that, the game is pretty much bug-free. Also, this game has my RTX 2070 Super running at rather high temps for some reason. Rather surprising for a game that doesn't appear to have particularly high-end graphics.\n\nAnyway, I'll be looking forward to see what comes next for this game. Definitely worth the buy despite being Early Access.",
      "buy it on sale. campaign was decent, however The Last Tiger mission was a standout. Multiplayer experience is ok overall, the hackers make it the worst bit. 6.5/10, if Dice fixes their servers and clears out the hackers then maybe it's worthy of an 8/10.",
      "I like to think of this game as what a Telltale game should have been.\nReal decisions that have real consequences. Allies who leave you due to the actions you take, betrayal due to dumb decisions. All of which only happen due to the choices you can make.\nBut instead of quicktime events, you play some games of Gwent.\nSome really difficult decisions as well, ones that i had to seriously stop and think about. A couple of stupidly easy ones as well, but i can forgive that.\nAlso some fantastic tongue in cheek references to other games/pop culture that i had some laugh out loud moments.\n\nYou also get to upgrade and customise your deck as you earn new cards along the way and they do that well. Save a <random character so as no spoiler> and convince him to journey with you? You know have access to his cool card (and trust me, there are some really cool cards). \nBut piss him off so he leaves, well his card is no longer available to you. I'm actually convinced ive missed a possible card or two due to some story decisions.\n\nIf there was one thing i think the game lacks, its risk.\nSome people have complained that its too easy, even on the hardest difficulty, which i think has some truth to it, but even that i dont think is the real problem.\nThe real problem is that if you lose a fight, it doesnt let you continue, you just retry till you win.\nSo if the game asks you, do you engage in a risky fight to save some of your trapped soldiers or do you leave them to their fate, you obviously would always choose the risky fight, as there is no punishment to losing the fight. You just keep retrying till you win.\nIt does take the weight away from a bunch of decisions and i also think it takes away that feeling if triumph you should get when you win the difficult fight and save the troops. You literally risked nothing.\nHowever, There are more than enough difficult decisions that have nothing to do with combat that you will still love this game.\nNot sure how they could fix this at this point, since the story is already fairly detailed with branching decisions.\nMaybe something to keep in mind for the next game. Give us fights that if we lose affect the story badly. Make it feel riskier for us to always choose the better path, so we are tempted to choose the easier one and therefore feel good when we succeed the  hard one, or feel the consequences when we fail the harder path.\n\nIs it worth the cost? I honestly think so, I haven't regret the money ive spent so far. Some people complaining its too short for what it costs (based on the 30 hour estimate, not them having actually played it), but for me its a really good quality 30 hours and i wish more games would take note.\nPeople complaining about 30 dollars for 30 hours are the reason Dragon Age Inquisition had 60 hours of useless grindy soul destroying fetch quests instead of being a streamlined, awesome game.",
      "Do yourself a favor.  Go in as blind as possible.  Don't look at any guides.  The system of getting pages of the manual that you can't fully understand is a stroke of genius.\n\nAlso I haven't found a waterfall that *doesn't* have a secret behind it.\n\n**EDIT: Finished the game**\n\nI'll admit for many of the later \"post-game puzzles\" I looked at a guide for.  The in game language is very difficult to decipher blindly, and if you're not familiar with English you probably shouldn't even bother.  \n\nThe surprising thing about this game is you can pretty much do any puzzle at any given time once you get one or two specific items, but because of how the manual is handled, you'll never know how until you see the pages (or experiment a lot)\n\nI think the most amount of tries I've spent on a boss fight was 7-8, but nothing is stopping you from exploring more and finding stat boosts.",

      "The arguably ugly graphics initially turned me off, as I'm sure it will for many of you, but in the end, they turned out to be unique, making an excellent game more memorable. I never had a gaming experience quite like this one, and it really felt as if I had to deduce and think things through. It made me feel more like a detective than most point-and-click mystery adventures. And don't get me wrong, I wouldn't include this game in that category, which I love.\n\nThe plot was amazing, and it was full of clever bits. The game got challenging in a good way without going overboard, and I think the vast majority of deductions was fair, except perhaps one in case 9, which I doubt I would have ever gotten without an in-game hint. The end was a bit anticlimactic after such a build-up, but overall it was a very satisfying journey. I'd definitely be interested in other games using the same concept. If you're unsure, like I was, I suggest trying out the demo where you can play 4 out of the 12 cases.",

      "[h1]Prelude[/h1]\n\nWorld's Dawn is relaxing/life simulation game. While it's inspired by Harvest Moon series (probably FoMT, BtN or other's  before 2004), farming isn't the core gameplay of this game. It's developed since 2010 with RPG Maker VX, so personally i wouldn't compare this game with other game which have higher price or far bigger development budget.\n\n\n[h1]Story/Character[/h1]\n\nThe main story of World's Dawn is similar with Harvest Moon series before 2004. You move to a village with goal saving the the village. To progress the main story, basically you need to do 5 things such as farming, friendship & romance. While the main story isn't outstanding, it's better than i expected for Life/Farming Sim game.\n\nSugar Blossom Village has fair amount of lore & festival. There are few interesting secrets waiting to be discovered with OKish reward. The festivals are very fun & enjoyable, it's unique experience that i don't get on many Life/Farming Sim game. There are 4-5 festivals on each season to keep you engaged, although 2 of them are market festival.\n\nThere are 24 characters in this game, with 8 more as you progress the story. Each character are unique with decent writing. Each of them has decent amount of conversation lines for many occasion (take a walk with your dog, after marriage proposal, before/after festival, about new villagers, etc.). It's best part of World's Dawn, although i hardly can remember their name.\n\n\n[h1]Visual/Audio[/h1]\n\nEach character has lovely art style. I like it since doesn't lean too much towards cutesy/anime artstyle which is common on today's Farming Sim game. Most marriage candidate also have 4 different portraits depending on the season, which is nice addition.\n\nThe general visual of the game feels dull though, even considering it's RPGMaker game. It fares better during Winter & some festival though. Each season also looks quite different, so it's far more than simple reskin. Animal need better sprite/animation though.\n\nThe soundtrack is decent & it doesn't feel boring hearing it many times. Each seasons & some area have it's own soundtrack, although it's something you'd expect from Farming Sim game. The audio effect/SFX is only average though. On a side note, i also wish each marriage candidate has a bit more voice acting.\n\n\n[h1]General gameplay[/h1]\n\nWorld's Dawn core gameplay isn't farming, there are so many things you could do (fishing, mining, social interaction, etc.). I'd say World's Dawn is a bit of everything. The game offer little progression though, so the gameplay feel stale after 2 seasons. Combining that & linear story, this game has no replayability value.\n\nThe control is easy to learn, although little awkward. But due to limitation of RPG Maker engine, you can't rebind any action. While there are 2 free hotkey for item, you only can bind shovel & watering can. It makes barn work rough.\n\nI also experience few bugs. None of those are game breaking, but could annoy you. Here are few that i could remember,\n> Few achievement not unlocked on Steam\n> Some items sometimes not shown on inventory if you spam button up/down/enter/back\n> 99 maximum item quantity, where additional item you obtained simply gone. I proved it by through item shipping & cooking\n\n\n[h1]Game mechanics[/h1]\n\nThis section review each game mechanics in more detail. Here's rough meaning of sign that i use in this section,\n> (+) Positive, neat game mechanics or i like the game mechanics\n> (*) Neutral, average, acceptable or what i expect from Life Sim/Farming Sim game\n> (-) Negative, poor game mechanic or i hate the game mechanic\n\n[b]Energy[/b]. (*) First of all, running deplete your energy. (-) At beginning of game, you only have small energy capacity  so you can't do all tasks. There are many ways to replenish your energy in this game. (-) Consuming food/beverage is rather useless/costly, (*) while resting on bench is fine option only when you have time to spare. (+) But hot spring restore 100% energy which only took 20 minutes (once per day). (+) It's really powerful mechanic after energy capacity is increased. (*) You can use Eden Fruit to permanently increase your energy, (+) where you can obtain all of them within first 2 seasons.\n\n[b]Farming[/b]. Just like most Farming Sim game, there are 4 seasons with different crops for each seasons. (*) Your farmland is limited to 40 tiles & possible upgrade only give 12 additional tiles. (*) There are only 3 crops for each season, excluding Wheat which can be planted on any season. (*) Initially your watering can only can water 1 tile at a time, but later you can get upgrade which water 3x3 tile. (+) The upgrade could be obtained with small amount of coin & watering few hundred tiles which could be obtained quickly.\n\n[b]Animal[/b]. (*) You can have 5 types of animal: Chicken, Cow, Horse, Dog & Cat. (*) For first 3 animal, there's nothing much to do besides feed, interact, brush and bring them outside. (+) You just need to ring bell to bring all livestock inside/outside though, which is convenient. (+) Dog is quite helpful, you can send him on errand & bark on spot which contain an item. (*) The cat only act cute though.\n\n[b]Fishing[/b]. (+) While fishing is also good way to earn coin, (-) it has really poor mechanic/balance. (*) It takes an hour to fish, where you only can get one fish with initial tool (Fishing Rod). (-) After you upgrade your Fishing Rod into Landing Net, the mini game isn't changed where you must hook one fish at a time. (-) Finally, you need to spend 20 hours to get 1st upgrade & 70 hours to get 2nd upgrade. I really don't like this since each upgrade let you catch larger variety of fish.\n\n[b]Mining[/b]. It's quite simple, you destroy stone, get raw gemstones & refine it to jewels. The cave only has 5 depth where lower depth has better drop rate/quality. (+) It's really powerful way to earn coin, especially after pickaxe upgrade & increase maximum energy. (*) RNG is involved to determine which raw gemstones & jewel you get. (*) But since 2 process use RNG, there's small possibility you're very lucky & vice versa.\n\n[b]Cooking[/b]. Basically i find it's unwelcoming. (-) You could miss chance to buy 3 out of 4 cooking utensils from TV program. (-) The next chance is either next year or festival on Fall/Winter. (*) Finding recipe also take some time, coin, effort or trial-and-error (only for mixture). (-) Many recipes (excluding mixture) need lots of ingredients where some of them only available on certain season, where i barely cook anything until Fall.\n\n[b]Social interaction[/b]. (*) Giving item is fastest way to increase villager favorability. (+) The good thing is the game has manual which list what each character likes, although you need to find out their favorite item by yourself. (+) You also can talk to them, join certain festival & take part time jobs to increase their favorability.\n\n[b]Other[/b].\n> (+) There's TV in your house which gives some useful information, (*) although you only can see tomorrow weather forecast from 6 PM onward\n> (*) To see list of festival, you need to buy calendar or see someone's else at their home\n> (*) There's no portable map, so you have to remember village environment or going to sign which show village map\n> (+) Clothing has some impact on gameplay, (*) although the description is somehow confusing\n> (*) LockBall control is somehow awkward & locking mechanic is confusing, (+) although it's fun for me\n> (+) Event-specific mini games is short, but fun while it's lasted\n> (*) Foraging is just average, but has decent importance on this game\n> (+) No tedious item management, everything is stored on your knapsack\n\n\n[h1]Closure[/h1]\n\nWhile i have some criticism on the gameplay, the story & character are best part of World's Dawn. I find this game very fun for first 2.5 seasons & quite fun for later 1.5 seasons. If you're looking for relaxing game with good character/story & unpunishing gameplay, you'll like this game.\n\nP.S. **** 8K char limit!",
      "Really overrated. Sure the graphics are fancy schmancy, but in the end it feels more like a dumbed-down Left 4 Dead.\n\nPurely from a gameplay perspective, the class specializations are excessively numerous with not that many differences between many of them (and notably, every class can use the same weapons anyway), and the solo mode sucks (no bots, are you kidding me?).\n\nOn other aspects of the game, there is that XP and (cosmetic) items grinding that seems to be the current trend/cash cow. And the fucking ridiculous buying of weapons and ammo within missions because, you know, killing monsters gives you money and in a world completely wrecked by zombies there are automated weapon stores at every corner - seems legit. Feels like that CSGO crap: it's not an FPS as much as a trading \"game\", where you buy stuff ingame and you buy or sell stuff on the Steam marketplace.",
      "I've played a fair amount of games during my time using Steam.\n\nI've never felt as emotionally moved by one as I have with OneShot.\n\nI don't know if anyone reading this has played Transistor, but if you are familiar with and enjoyed that game, continue reading for a little context. (I'm going to put it in spoilers because it contains an integral part of how the game functions, which is likely better for you to experience on your own, rather than learn about it from a third party. Be warned!)\n[spoiler]\nTransistor and OneShot are very different games, but both of them share a similarity in that they have been the most emotionally moving games I've played in my entire life. They both have a huge emphasis on characters, both the one you play as and the ones you interact with or are around you. They also both have brilliantly-developed environments, The combination of these two things is one of the major factors in why I've gotten so immersed in them previously.\n\nHowever, OneShot affected me notably more strongly and for much longer than Transistor, and that is for a very discernable reason. In Transistor, you experience the stories of the characters. When it all ends, you're still a third party, experiencing things through the \"eyes\" of the protagonist.\n\nOneShot, on the other hand, features *you* as basically an integral part of the story. Because of this slight difference (which may seem negligible or gimmicky at first), OneShot basically destroyed me emotionally by the end - not necessarily because of how it ended, but that it ended at all. It wasn't just story of some other charismatic protagonists that came to a close.\n\nIt was mine, and with it, my connection to everything that happened in the game.\n\nIt's really hard to put into words... but I really wanted to put this somewhere, in hopes that someone understands and agrees. :D\n[/spoiler]\n\nAnyways, random game comparison tangent over. It's a phenomenal game - easily one of tmy favorite games of all time, my only complaint being that it ended. Extremely solid 10/10.\n\nIf you enjoy story-driven adventures like Transistor, Undertale, Night in the Woods, etc., this is basically a must-buy.\n",
      "The British Forces give the Allies a bit of the German defensive capacities. It has the problem of adding too many buildings to a game that is, in its core, dynamic and based on movement and aggressiveness instead of turtling. The British units are diverse and interesting, bringing much to the table. \n\nThe DLC lacks a proper campaign for the Brits, unfortunately, even though Caen, Goodwood, Arnhem and Walcheren could have been done in some interesting missions. But, for a game focused on multiplayer, the Tommies are obligatory in everybody's library.",
      "Ever since an indie game showcase a while back, Sumire interested me. Hooked by its beautiful artstyle and interesting concept.\n\nToday I finally managed to play it. Game is not perfect, menu controls feel inconsistent and counter intuitive. The dialogue might mess up while fast traveling, and there's an area with some broken lighting.\n\nHowever, as a stroytelling medium Sumire excels. The game is short about ~3 hours long. The game has many beautiful moments and scary moments. I made some mistakes, and by the end i almost didnt want to go on, what if because of my mistakes i couldn't do what i wanted. But i pushed on, and by the end I was happy that i kept going.\n\nIn summery, Sumire is a short game that ask you to make the most of one day. By end i felt deeply touched by the game and highly recommend it.\n",
      "I hate to do this, because the devs clearly put a lot of love into it, but I just can't give it the thumbs up.\n\nThe controls are mostly on point (slide jumping is a little weird), but the generated levels are what kills it for me. I've come to realize that getting through the hand-crafted levels is a good portion of what makes Mega Man so fun. This procedural generation simply isn't up to snuff. You just go right, occasionally going up or down to go right again. There's no nuance or thought required to go right, because most enemies can be ignored, and there are no real obstacles. \n\nIf you've got that itch, just replay a Mega Man game (Classic/X/Zero). You'll go through proper, hand-crafted levels.",
      "Know your History: \n\nMany of you will already know this, but this game has ties much deeper than you think. It's no secret that Bethesda's Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim had extended it's life through an extensive modding community. For decades, literally, ENBs, shaders, textures, companions, and even story-lines added THOUSANDS of hours to an already sizable game. One story-line mod was called \"The Forgotten City\".  Over the next few years since it's release, the mod had acquired awards such as the 2016 Australian Writers' Guild Award, Zero Period Top 5 Quest Mods of 2015, and others. It was an astounding mod that threw the dragon born into a deeply profound, well written, and engaging story. It was a staple for my personal mod list for years. I've played the Skyrim version countless times, but as soon as I saw this release I immediately bought this and booted it up. \nObviously this is nothing like the mod, both visually or engine wise, but the spirit of the game is still there. It's more defined, expanded, and developed. It deserves every award and accolade it's received. When I walked into the opening scene and fell down the tunnel I couldn't help but shake my head and smile as a wave of nostalgia mixed with new expectations flooded my mind:\n\n\"My god, they've done it.\" \n\nHere's to you, Modern Storyteller, all the best and more to come!",
      "I had to purchase Scarlet Hollow after witnessing the excitement of Episode 4 through my friends. I immediately binged the first three episodes the following day and found myself and in rather different spot compared to their playthrough. The choices you make in SH are actually impactful - which is (unfortunately) quite refreshing for the genre! I've since run through several different routes to explore more of the story (and collect those achievements!). While you have the ability to skip through previously seen text, lines within replayed conversations are shaped by your selected traits, choices, and previously selected dialogue; you won't be skipping that many lines before seeing new content. Similarly, characters may be painted in an entirely different light based on choices you've made. The cast and writing truly nails the small town feel of SH (gossip and all). \n\nMake sure you eat the takeaway container in the fridge. Thank me later.",
      "Ok so... \n\nFar From Noise is a narrative game in which you play a woman stuck in its car, balancing on the edge of a cliff. \n\nIt's about life, death, nature, purpose, creativity, dreams, stars and badgers. \n\nThe thing about Far From Noise is that it'll ask you something very special, something that we all forget to do nowadays, something that I've forgotten. This game will ask you to take your time. Don't rush things. Sit down and relax as you'll be forced to follow the slow pace of the game, but you'll enjoy it, for sure.\n\nThis game is for you if you come home after a rough day at work. This game is for you if you're searching for a meaning, a purpose in your life. This game is for you if you just want to experiment something new.\n\nBecause Far From Noise is offering you something new. It gives a vibe that is between Firewatch and Life is Strange, but without all the forced action, stress, adrenaline those game wanted to give. Don't misunderstand me, I loved those 2 games, but Far From Noise chose a direction more... pure. It's just you and the nature that evolves around you.\n\nI've finished the game within 90 mins, but I heard they were several endings, so I might as well try to get some more (but the one I've got fully satisfied me, to be honest).\n\nBeing more pragmatic, the art and sound coincide perfectly. The visuals are gorgeous and the musics hit just right where it needs to. You'll be lifted by the compositions as you'll stare into the beautiful sunset, and the dark starry sky.\n\nYou may find it expensive, as the game costs 8$ for one hour and a half of experience, but hey, think about a cinema ticket. Far From Noise is cheaper and the experience you'll live in it is wayyyyy more unique than most of the movies you go see. \n\nI recommend it. Play it. It'll put your mind at ease.\n\n\n\nPS: the main character is one of the most well-written i've seen in video games.",
      "good sales pitch for a game. i guess that's the point of being a kickstarter-based video game. everything related to specifically your character and the character action related feels fantastic and looks great and i feel like it scratches an itch no other game really does, and the environments and your animations look great. and yet you're seeing this on a negative review.\n\n-the progression involved with exploring unreality until you stumble onto where you think you should go is miserable. it looks like a mega man x4 level had a bad trip, headache inducing and aimless. the process of finding a lot of secrets is either the trite \"you have a movement powerup, backtrack here and move up there\" sorta deal, or invisible wall shit that i've never been a fan of without decent tells (which admittedly the game sometimes does!)\n\n-combat almost entirely takes place in closed off arenas (not necessarily a bad thing, this game draws heavy inspiration from DMC which does similar) and with the same cast of like 10~ enemies. poise is a chore, even after trivializing the process with the time bomb and the grounded down charge attack, and particular enemies like the guy with the red sword and the caped man are incredibly annoying. there are 2 different instances of an enemy either doing a short version or annoyingly long version of an attack with 0 tell. A lot of the combat is trivial on hard, don't know about\n\n-bosses are a mixed bag. some of them you can loop poise breaks. some of them 2 or 3 tap you. the last one does the latter, makes you slog through a nintendo-ass hands and face boss before you are put up against bootleg senator armstrong with an unskippable cutscene and no checkpoint after the boring phase 1. huge waste of time.\n\n-too many levels just feel empty and lifeless. just a pleasant looking floral jog from arena to arena, felt like nothing and left no impression. \n\n-the movement feels like it has the potential to be insane. there's a million options that all can really push how much distance you can get, and there's a learning curve with how you sequence them all, and there's an entirely separate learning curve with pulse fly though that mechanic feels mostly untapped. \n\n-for a game with a speedrun timer and that kind of carpal tunnel inducing movement, it's really weird that there's not a \"reset to checkpoint\" button or any way to fast travel back to the airship. feels INCREDIBLY bad when you're lost and checking every nook and cranny for where to go next, or when you've ran yourself out of pulse meter when trying to pulse fly in locations that aren't littered with the blue pulse bulbs. special shoutouts to the pyramid, you can screw up especially when trying to do it early and the run is completely dead, but you have to just sit there and wait while you scroll through twitter or whatever. \n\n-music and voice acting quality was all over the place. i'm not more than a hobbyist but a lot of the voices sound like they were recorded on a variety of audio hardware, run through audacity w/ noise reduction and normalization, and tossed in. it's an indie game so please don't take this as the worst critique in the world, i'm sure the VAs were all fellow hobbyists/amateurs and there's literally nothing wrong with that, but a good handful of the yells, insults, and grunts were doing NOTHING for me. some of the music just sounds like penis music, i can't think of a better term. there were definitely a few great tunes on the atmospheric end of things but overall some of them, in particular 2 or 3 boss themes, just kinda sucked. also the segues between combat and atmospheric music was not executed well at all for several areas.\n\n-the fog level in particular had a lot of stuttering especially during combat. not looking forward to the braindead \"works fine on my machine\" type of people, but i'm on a ryzen 9 3900x, a 5900XT sapphire pulse, and 32 GB of 3600mhz ram. I'm pretty sure a machine with a tenth of the power should be able to run a gamemaker studio 2 game, it's on the switch and that thing's basically a leapfrog.\n\ni really wanted to like this game but like i said at the start, it feels like a sales pitch (albiet a great one) with everything not related to the selling point feeling tacked on. I hope this dev learns more about level design in particular and keeps making more games, because this game really does feel like it's designed to appeal to me w/ the mix of genres and the list of inspirations this game seems to wear on its sleeve.\n\ntldr the angled dash memory doesn't let you wavedash, and ur left in a crappy sticky sliding animation when you try. 1/10 can't believe i played this game\n",
      "100%'ed the LUCT version of the game and I'm slowly working my way through this version now.\n\nOver all the game itself is solid. If you're reading this, its a brilliant tactics game that helped define the genre. However most of the changes they made in reborn, while innovative, ultimately feel constraining. \n\nFor example, they've limited spell slots to 4, so you can only ever take 4 different spells. One or two of which (missile + indirect) are taken by a damage spell of your choice, leaving you with even less spell customization than you'd think. And its unfortunately the same situation with skills, as one will always be taken up by your weapon skill. \n\nThe cards that drop in battle, while an interesting system on paper, just end up cluttering the field most of the time, often with auto-skill activation up, which most of your units won't even really want compared to the other options. \n\nRandom battles were also removed, limiting chances to recruit to a few key dungeons as well as removing some of the more amusing battle locations from the game. \n\nI've also seen some people complain about the level cap, but in my current play-though of the game, it isn't too much of a concern for me, but it may be for others. \n\nOver all, it just feels like they've taken a step back from what Tactics ogre: Let us cling together, gave us. Yes there's bloat in that version, but it also gave us a feeling of freedom when we were putting our teams together that this version lacks. I am grateful that we saw a remake of this game within my lifetime, but I wish they had improved on Luct, rather than take steps back from it. \n\nIf they ever increase the amount of spells and/or skills you can take, to like 6-8, then I'd probably switch my review to a yes. But until then, with a heavy heart I have to say that this version just isn't as good as Luct so far.",
      "After playing the game for almost 10 hours which i know is not a lot but still i had a great time the story kept me hooked from start to finish and i was always excited to find out what was going to happen next. I loved the idea that you could choose to play as a ghost and never get detected or never kill anyone or just go for the high chaos im going to kill everyone playstyle and even know the ability to choose your playstyle is quite oftenly seen these days but back in 2012 it was quite inovative.\n\nGameplay:\nIt had great combat and stealth.(Not Suprising based on thre fact that your an assasin)\nStory was well how to put this \"A rollercoaster of emotion\" it keeps you hooked from start to finish and you will never want to stop playing until you finaly get to the end.\n\nReplay Value:\nNow this is a big one in my opinion because i like games that make you play for hours and hours and I would say that Dishonored has great replay value this is mainly due to the fact that there are a lot of different acheivements, ways to complete each mission, different magic paths and weapon paths that can only be be completed if you play the game again and if your not comftable with fully restarting you dont have to because once you finish the main storyline you unlock the option to play them over which is useful if you want to unlock some of the other acheivements for example Clean Hands to get this acheivement your not allowed to kill anyone in the whole story how you do this i have no idea but thats the reason this game has good replay value.\n\nDLC:\nEven though i do not own the DLC (i will be purchasing them soon) from my knowledge of the normal game and how great that was it would suprise me if the DLC was bad.\n\nIn conclusion i would highly reccomend this game to anyone who doenst already own it!\n",

Well, here I go anyway.\n\n\"Where do I start?\" This is the question asked by anyone playing Gmod for their first time. It's also my question that I ask about this review I am writing. Hmm...\n\n_The gameplay...the gameplay...hmm... Well, there's singleplayer sandbox. You can do...uh, whatever you want really. Just addon a few addons, and you can be entertained for hours. Battle NPCs, make cool scenes for cool screenshots, explore maps, be a superhero (spiderman addon!), and much, much, much, much- you get my point, right? Almost all content is user-generated. Make your own content! Multiplayer. In Multiplayer Gmod you can roleplay. I'm talking normal RP (DarkRP), Military RP, Star Wars RP, etc, etc. In multiplayer Gmod, you can battle, prophunt (yay), hide 'n seek, and much, much, more.\n\n_Graphics? I'll rate the graphics...drumroll please... 7/10. This game is and older game. Came out in 2006. I guess the graphics are good for 2006, and people enjoy the game and don't complain much about the graphics, but I'm not gonna lie, they are outdated and look old. It's not 2006 anymore.\n\n_Hear the bullets flying. The zombies growling. The people chatting. The boxes jumping... The sound in this game is great! Every sound is loud and clear, and there are a varitey of sounds.\n\n_Play this game. Play it again. Play it some more. Play some now, and play some later. Play it over and over. Play it as long as you want.\n\n_My Personal opinion. Get this game. Now. Get Gmod on sale or not. I'm not gonna stop playing it for a while and I'm already at 50+ hours of playtime. I love this game! WAIT! Before you go and buy this, then you wonder why there are all the missing maps and errors in most games, get Counter Strike: Source, so ALL the textures are supported. You need it to play MOST multiplayer games.\n\n\nGameplay: 9/10\nGraphics: 7/10\nStory: N/A\nSound: 8/10\nReplayability: 10/10\n\nOverall 8.5\n\nEven though, this is one positive review on Garry's Mod, out of the thousands of positive reviews that have been submitted Garry's Mod, I hope this one convinces you to buy...

      "From my og demo feedback, not much changed sadly:\n\nOh boy....\n\nI will start with the most glaring issue:\n-It's friggin IMPOSSIBLE to find an online match\n\nNow some other stuff that I found odd or bad:\n-The camera.... oh god.... I get it, it's supposed to \"limit\" the playing area (specially for local gameplay) but it punishes people in first place... that's friggin dumb in a RACING game, also also if you go under other track sometimes you can't see sh*t (the going under other track piece seems to be fixed in the final release)\n\n-The car randomly drives itself ???? (maybe it's the antenna thingy I chose at car selection.... would be good a tooltip or SOMETHING so I know wtf is that about)\n\n-NO CONTROL REBINDING OPTIONS..... in 2023 \n\n-If you \"die\" near a checkpoint, though luck pal you WILL miss the next section too cause you won't respawn in time... that's.... just unfun and dumb.\n\n-The \"shortcut\" option definetly does not work, I intentionally crafted a track with cuts and the game will kill you if you try to do those..... good job devs. (This seems to be fixed or working properly in final release)\n\n-Since I couldn't find an online match EVER, I played only in local lobby or vs AI, now here comes the issue, the \"placing\" round locks everyone to the same \"screen\", there is no zoom, you can get trolled by another player preventing you to move to a place to connect track or hazards, rendering your placement turn void and useless, I don't know if this is intentional or just a downside of playing on local mode, you may have free cam in multi, but alas I couldn't try that. BTW.... WHY THERE IS NO ZOOM OPTION\n\nThe good:\n-The games runs smooth as butter, with everything maxed on my midend rig, good one devs\n\n-The cars seem to be varied and with some gimmicks, alas you have NO TOOLTIPS or info what that possible gimmick may be..... why ?\n\n-The track pieces, hazards and weapons are quite varied and some weird shennanigans are ensured to happen, feels like a Trackmania troll track being build in real time 10/10\n\nThe \"mehhh\":\n\n-The weapons/items some of them are mindbogglingly hard to understand wtf they do, there is a grey metallic ball even that seems to do nothing or I haven't figured out how to use it... again... a tool tip maybe ? a section about weapons/items in the main menu mayhaps ?\n\nAnd that's that, sorry if my writing seems a bit aggresive, I just was kinda hyped about the game and it feels a bit of a let down so far.

Put over a low heat until the butter and chocolate have melted, stirring occasionally to mix them.\n\nSTEP 3\nRemove the bowl from the pan. Alternatively, cover the bowl loosely with cling film and put in the microwave for 2 minutes on High. Leave the melted mixture to cool to room temperature.\n\nSTEP 4\nWhile you wait for the chocolate to cool, position a shelf in the middle of your oven and turn the oven on to 180C/160C fan/gas 4.\n\nSTEP 5\nUsing a shallow 20cm square tin, cut out a square of non-stick baking parchment to line the base. Tip 85g plain flour and 40g cocoa powder into a sieve held over a medium bowl. Tap and shake the sieve so they run through together and you get rid of any lumps.\n\nSTEP 6\nChop 50g white chocolate and 50g milk chocolate into chunks on a board.\n\nSTEP 7\nBreak 3 large eggs into a large bowl and tip in 275g golden caster sugar. With an electric mixer on maximum speed, whisk the eggs and sugar. They will look thick and creamy, like a milk shake. This can take 3-8 minutes, depending on how powerful your mixer is. You’ll know it’s ready when the mixture becomes really pale and about double its original volume. Another check is to turn off the mixer, lift out the beaters and wiggle them from side to side. If the mixture that runs off the beaters leaves a trail on the surface of the mixture in the bowl for a second or two, you’re there.\n\nSTEP 8\nPour the cooled chocolate mixture over the eggy mousse, then gently fold together with a rubber spatula. Plunge the spatula in at one side, take it underneath and bring it up the opposite side and in again at the middle. Continue going under and over in a figure of eight, moving the bowl round after each folding so you can get at it from all sides, until the two mixtures are one and the colour is a mottled dark brown. The idea is to marry them without knocking out the air, so be as gentle and slow as you like.\n\nSTEP 9\nHold the sieve over the bowl of eggy chocolate mixture and resift the cocoa and flour mixture, shaking the sieve from side to side, to cover the top evenly.\n\nSTEP 10\nGently fold in this powder using the same figure of eight action as before. The mixture will look dry and dusty at first, and a bit unpromising, but if you keep going very gently and patiently, it will end up looking gungy and fudgy. Stop just before you feel you should, as you don’t want to overdo this mixing.\n\nSTEP 11\nFinally, stir in the white and milk chocolate chunks until they’re dotted throughout.\n\nSTEP 12\nPour the mixture into the prepared tin, scraping every bit out of the bowl with the spatula. Gently ease the mixture into the corners of the tin and paddle the spatula from side to side across the top to level it.\n\nSTEP 13\nPut in the oven and set your timer for 25 mins. When the buzzer goes, open the oven, pull the shelf out a bit and gently shake the tin. If the brownie wobbles in the middle, it’s not quite done, so slide it back in and bake for another 5 minutes until the top has a shiny, papery crust and the sides are just beginning to come away from the tin. Take out of the oven.\n\nSTEP 14\nLeave the whole thing in the tin until completely cold, then, if you’re using the brownie tin, lift up the protruding rim slightly and slide the uncut brownie out on its base. If you’re using a normal tin, lift out the brownie with the foil. Cut into quarters, then cut each quarter into four squares and finally into triangles.\n\nSTEP 15\nThey’ll keep in an airtight container for a good two weeks and in the freezer for up to a month.\n\n:Mic drop:",

      "Everyone complained about the bugs and glitches but the real problems are that the game's systems are terribly outdated. People were promised a next-gen experience. I've played games from a decade ago that have better open worlds then this. \n\n- Police appear out of nowhere.\n- Police are amazingly easy to escape. You can walk a block away and lose them.\n- Civilian NPC's appear and disappear when you're not looking.\n- The A.I. is alot my artificial then intelligent. The only reaction they ever have is to duck or completely disappear in thin air. \n- The A.I. is basically on rails; they will not drive or walk around anything you put in front of them, they'll just stop and sit there for eternity.\n- The world doesn't actually feel alive (no random encounters). NPC enemies spawn in the exact same place every single time without fail.\n- Bars and food are exactly the same vendor with a different coat of paint. No matter where you go you can't sit down and eat something, or sit and enjoy a virtual drink (unless it's a talking-scene tied to a quest).\n- You can't interact with shop keepers beyond buying something or receiving maybe two lines of chit-chat. You can't rob them. You can't kill them. You can't get quests from them. They won't even react if you lob a grenade at them.\n- The \"car chases\" are on rails and there's only 3-4 prescripted car chases in the game.\n- Only 2% of \"choices\" your character makes in dialogue has any effect on the story. The rest are just alternate dialogue to give the appearance of choice and replayability. \n- Character starting paths (Street kid, Nomad, Corpo) have little to no affect beyond the first 20 minutes of the game and simple dialogue changes.\n- Player characters have no reflection unless you use the specific mirror located in your apartment. \n- You can't alter the look of your character after the initial character creation. Not even a haircut.\n- Can't customize your apartment in any way, shape, or form.\n- There's almost no reason to ever go back to your apartment after being there the first time.\n- Vehicles can't be customized; no new paints, liveries, or body-pieces.\n- There are 4 mini-games total: Hacking, shooting-range, boxing, and car racing. There are only two shooting-range quests, only 6 boxing matches, and only 4 races. That's it as far as mini-games go.\n\nYou can fix bugs but unless CD somehow improves the lack-luster world and experience they created, I can't recommend this game to anyone.",
      "Visually-speaking, this is possibly the highest quality otome I've ever played. Characters blink, their mouths move when they speak, and even backgrounds have some animated aspects, such as water movement, crackling fires and other neat little touches. The art is top-notch and, in my opinion, the game's strongest point.\n\nAnother aspect that makes Bustafellows a standout is the heroine. Teuta has much more presence than a lot of other protagonists in the genre because she has a face, voice and strong personality. She's her own character and not one of those 'we're going to make MC as bland as humanly possible for self-insertion purposes' heroines, which I very much appreciated.\n\nThe Steam version is a bit clunky compared to the console release, and at times it suffered from some pacing issues, but all the characters and their interactions were enjoyable. The main story was great; I really loved the group dynamic they established in the common route, and while Shu and Crow were definitely my favorites, there was nobody I really disliked as a love interest. They each had an interesting story behind them and unique dynamic with Teuta.\n\nThe final stories that attempt to wrap everything up were the only part of the game that just really didn't do it for me. I can't go into much detail without spoilers, but the best I can describe it is everything comes at you too fast, parts of it felt out of nowhere, and for me it was a downer. Not awful enough to ruin the game, and some of the ideas were good, but I feel like they were executed poorly.\n\nAll in all, Bustafellows is one of the better otome games out there. It's not perfect, but its strengths shine brighter than its flaws, and I'm dearly hoping Bustafelllows Season 2 gets localized so I can see more of its wonderful art and characters.",

      "As a cybersecurity professional , I would classify this game as malware, or at the least adware.\nWhy? It opens up a number, at least 10 when I checked, of connections to various points on the internet which have no purpose in running the game. They are only there so the vendor can spam you with advertising, track you, or for other unspecified activities. \nAs such, I can NOT recommend this game. \n\nTo verify, I disconnected my computer from the internet. The game ran fine without the advertising and tracking. \nThen I connected back to the internet, and launched the game. The game opened at least 10 connections(!).\nThen, while still connected to the internet, I blocked the game's network-connecting executables in the firewall. In such a case, the game behaves differently, apparently it sees there is an active connection so it runs for a while, then when it cannot make it's for-bad-purposes network connections, it terminates and you can't play. \nThis is bad behavior that I would only expect from spyware and malware. I hope the vendor fixes it so the software runs in the manner they declare - it is supposed to not require network connectivity after the initial run as they describe in the System Requirements. \nSteam should be reigning in this behavior as well.",
      "Do you kinda like 4X games, but mostly the first 2-3 hours of the game where you're exploring and hacking a basic civilization out of the wilderness and desperately fending off natural threats while trying to keep people fed and productive? If so, this game is for you. Nice tight gameplay loop where things never get stagnant for too long; always novel threats and opportunities, and you're not tied to any one settlement for very long, so victory and defeat alike are more temporary. Not to mention a really astounding amount of fun, polished content for an early access game! Eremite, Hooded Horse, I salute you.",
      "Overall, there's just too many things about this game that rub me the wrong way.\n\nFirst of all, I definitely like the art, visuals, music, voice acting, and writing. They don't hold your hand when it comes to explaining the story and it forces you to pay attention and also encourages you to try lots of different function combinations so you can learn more about the characters, if you care to.\n\nOther than that, though, there's not much I like. The most important aspect of games to me is whether the gameplay is fun, and honestly transistor's gameplay isn't that much fun for me. Like others have said, not being able to do anything after you pause time and plan out a sequence of moves just sucks. They don't even give you enough mobility to dodge shots. All you can really do is try to get to cover and hide out until your meter replenishes. And if you opt to instead play without using turn (or using turn to pause and think and then unpausing and simply executing your actions manually), you'll probably disappointed by that experience when comparing it to the action oriented gameplay of bastion. One of the worst things, in my opinion, is that you lose access to functions when you lose all your health. Honestly I'd rather just die and restart from checkpoint. I can see that they're trying to encourage you to try different combinations of things, but it still just frustrates me losing the build that I was in the process of learning. And when your options are limited the gameplay just gets more and more boring because you might have to resort to gimmicky tactics depending on what functions you are left with. Overall, it's certainly a unique idea to blend the turn-based with real-time combat, but, in practice, it ends up just not being all that fun to me. I'd rather play a turn based game or an action game. My brain doesn't like switching between the two so rapidly.\n\nI would say get this heavily discounted and play it for the uniqueness and aesthetics. Don't come here expecting something very heavy or that you're going to really want to sink countless hours into or replay. My first playthrough was done in 6 hours and I was glad to be done with it. I have to complement them for not dragging it out or having some frustratingly long and tedious boss fight at the end. If the story went on even an hour longer I might've just gotten sick of it and given up.\n\nIf you're into experience games more along the lines of how you experience art or other aesthetic experiences (and not necesarilly for the thrill of challenge and victory), you should definitely consider this game. There's a lot there to process. I personally don't care much about that sort of thing when it comes to games, though.",
      "It's one of my favorite games of all time, yet I cannot recommend it. And it pains me.\n\nLike many others, I think that the latest update, alpha 17, was a huge step in the wrong direction. Instead of being a zombie-survival game with awesome building mechanics where you could build huge and massive bases, it simply became a zombie-killing grindfest, where bases don’t matter, because zombies chew through concrete like it was nothing.\n\nAlso, don't get me started on the zombie AI. It was fine in alpha 16 and the zombies acted as you would expect; dumb. In alpha 17, the pathing of the AI is just ridiculous, where the zombies are able to estimate the path of least resistance, as if they were not only sapient, but extremely intelligent. This has led to the current base building-meta; mazes and ramps. /facepalm\n\nThe skill system was utterly destroyed as well. In Alpha 16, you could improve cardio by running, you could improve mining-efficiency by, well mining - so on so forth. Now, you just kill zombies to gain exp, get perk points and then spend said perk points. To be fair, they have buffed exp gains from other activities recently, but you still simply gain and spend perk points - yet another horrible downgrade.\n\nAlso, let’s talk about loot. In Alpha 16 you could loot items ranging from quality 1 to 600. Weapons and certain tools had components of individual quality that you could then combine to form said weapon/tool, that would have the average quality level of said parts. The quality would determine the damage/durability of the weapon etc. This system was great and gave an incitement to go out in the world and continue to loot, even if you had, say the AK47, because you could improve it vastly by finding better parts. This has been replaced by a system where all weapons/tools are looted whole in a quality system ranging from 1 to 6. Yes, 1 to 6. Minimal difference in damage/durability, but hey, at least you can attach mods to the weapons now. The amount of mods you can attach are determined by the level of the item. You can now improve the damage of your rifle by painting it in another color. Great…\n\nThe performance of the game… hehehehe. All the new textures and lighting of A17 has brought so many performance issues, and yet again, it used to be just fine in Alpha 16. Don’t bother mentioning it to the devs, they’ll just give you a douchy response about your rig being a potato, even though you’re running with high-end parts. \n\nIn conclusion, no I would not recommend the game. However, you can opt in for playing Alpha 16, which I would recommend – if you can accept that the game might never evolve any further.",

      "It's strange how this will be the first review I ever write for a game. I always thought it would be written for a game like Fallout, Elderscrolls or some huge open world survival horror. And yet it's this little piece of art that has me aching to write something, if only for a minute.\nWhen I had finished this, a few minutes ago, I couldn't believe that they only charge a pittence for it. I thought to myself that if people can charge you 70 euro for games that are poorly executed and badly made from start to finish, then this game should have a much higher pricetag. It wasn't before looking up and seeing that I just finished the first episode in a mere three hours that I understood their reasoning. I feel, however, obliged to tell you all that the three hours spent in this game were worth more to me than the hundreads of hours I've spent in most other games combined. Not because the story was awsome, or the graphics made me gape in awe, but rather that every single aspect of the game in combination managed to grip me and pull me in so that time became temporarily meaningless. Imagine if games held this standard. Imagine if your favorite action, your favorite adventure game or even your favorite driver had this kind of execution. \nYou can tell a good story in a bad way, and you can tell a bad story in a good way. The story in this game might not be the most interesting story you've ever heard, but it's good, and in the execution of it you are drawn in, captured by it, moved by it.\n\nMost adventure games will entertain, they'll give you some ups and downs along the way, but ultimately they will feel like games.\nI've never felt so fulfilled after \"playing a game\" as I did today. Original, beautiful and masterfully executed. I can't wait for the next episode.",

      "EDIT: they made putting easier!  I can finally shoot even and below on the first few courses.  Ignore my complaints about impossible putting below.  I'm back playing this again and enjoying it much more since the putting changes.\n\nI have a love/hate relationship with this game.  It's the closest thing to an enjoyable disc golf game on the PC that I've ever seen, and on that basis I recommend it.  Unlike most sports games, where I can play better on the computer than I can in real life, in this game that's not the case.  After six miserable hours of failure in this game I can safely promise you that I'm wildly better at real life disc golf than I ever will be with this game.\n\nPositives:\n\n- Discs mostly work the way they should (assuming you understand from IRL play how a particular disc should  behave depending on speed and throwing angle) though I feel like flight paths when you're throwing up or down in elevation are off sometimes, but if you throw a fast understable disc at too low a speed it will tail off into the left immediately and when you want to crank up and hyzer bomb the same disc at high speed it gives you the long S you expect and so forth\n- No bugs really (a couple of times the character model went wonky when a disc landed on/next to a rock wall)\n- Graphics are fine by me\n\nCons (possibly only for me, you may not suck at this):\n\n- The entire game is based on a \"stop the tick mark on a spot as it circles a ring\" type swing meter, and I'm absolute trash at it\n- Feels like no progress, other than buying discs--I've upgraded the three skill meters a lot and it has never felt like game play changed much (lol, it certainly hasn't gotten any easier!)\n- Putting is im-fucking-possible, at least for me, it's way too hard--putts that would be gimmes for a novice in real life are a crapshoot, especially if there's any elevation difference\n- After six hours I have only unlocked the first course and half of the second course . . . I may try to go back to this at some point, but for now I've given up on this sucker which is a shame--there are a bunch of other courses that I will never see (my fault, to be sure--I'm terrible at that stupid swing meter)\n\nI haven't played any better options, so while I'm probably giving up at six hours in I'd still recommend it to anyone who's into disc golf.  It's clearly too hard for me, but assuming you're not a complete klutz you will probably have better luck with it.",

This game is a feast for the eyes and ears with cutscenes, voice acting, and more. Ok, I just love this game. It's so damn good.",
      "I definitely would not recommend this. The aesthetic of it might appeal to some people, which is what initially drew me in, but the visual awe wears off after seeing the same scene too many times. The game is best played with paper and pencil in hand so that you waste as little time as possible wandering around in a straight line. \n\nThis game survives off of the mysterious nature of its content in the sense that if people knew how small the experience was, they would not buy it. I was thoroughly let down by this game, especially since its promotional material hyped me up for an exploration game with a unique method of interacting with the world. \n\nThe main feature that sets the game apart from other titles, the use of the telephone to access parts of the static world, becomes little more than a password screen used to pick up where you left off or were booted out of your game by a short time limit. After the first two or three times I used the game's core feature, I was tired of it and wished there was a way to play the game that was faster or had more depth.\n\nFor anyone who has played or seen any amount of gameplay from Yume Nikki, you will realise that this game's design begs the audience to compare the two. However, the most useful comparison to draw between the two is by using the game that Madotsuki can play in her room as an example. In Madotsuki's game, \"Nasu,\" is a joyless game about catching fruit. It is repetitive, intentionally annoying, has no bearing on your progression/success, and is meant to urge you toward doing something else. Unfortunately, this is a suitable comparison, as it succeeded in making me feel like Madotsuki in real life and I want to turn off the game and do almost anything else in record time.\n\nI truly wanted to like this game, but I cannot justify spending $5 for this experience when I played better flash games all the way back in middle school for free.",

Better graphics, better level design, better everything. It's a really tight experience without any filler and with an interesting story, so any fans of RPGMaker-type horror games will find this a highly enjoyable experience.\n\nYou can also increase the game's window size, so don't worry if you're running a high-resolution display. This is a feature that is not exactly common for these types of games, but this game has got you covered.\n\nI'm looking forward to future games from the dev!",

      "If you somehow don't know what this is: It's a meta-narrative focused walking sim with a funny narrator. Only you know if that kind of thing sounds like a good time to you.\n\nSubtract about 26 hours from my playtime because I'm a lunatic who left the game running for a whole day to get a silly achievement.\n\nI loved the HD remix (never played the og mod), and I really liked this one too, but I will say that a lot of the commentary the original offered doesn't hit as hard or hold up as well almost a decade later, just because the narrative structure and how narrative is tied to gameplay of many story-driven games has changed in that time (because of course it has), as well as the mindset of a lot of players being different. So I think that it's worth keeping in mind the cultural moment the original was made during... if you're the thinky type who likes to overthink things. You massive nerd.\n\nStill, it felt nice to jump back in and spend a little more time with the narrator, and there were some legitimately striking moments in the new content that I found to be quite powerful and engaging.

      "This game surprised me in how good it was. I had heard about it, like everyone, and also like a lot of people I had dismissed it as a watered-down Dark Souls clone with a Star Wars skin, and let it collect dust in my Steam collection.\n\nI was wrong. The game's combat is tight and polished, just the right difficulty on Normal. The movement, the general game feel, is superb. The game has a competent story with excellent characterizations, character arcs, dialogue, exposition, world-building, and pacing.  The music feels like top-shelf Star Wars without being a lazy copypasta of John Williams's score (though you'll hear sprinklings of familiar motifs throughout, of course). \n\nThere are collectibles (they are all cosmetics), but it's a tasteful, reasonable amount of them, and they are distributed in a way that feels fun instead of like a chore, and you're never pressured into collecting them with menus or reminders; they are entirely optional in both a technical and a psychological sense. I actually found it fun to collect new appearances in order to play dress-up \"Fashion Souls\". \n\nThere are bosses, and they are challenging but not frustrating. Definitely easier than Dark Souls's harder bosses like Ornstein or Artorias, but still tricky enough that it feels rewarding to overcome them.\n\nIf I had to describe this game in two words, it would be \"just right\". There is just the right amount of each little element that it feels fun, never tedious, never like a grind. I'm a jaded old man who has seen it all and who is not easy to entertain, and I found this game extremely refreshing. If you read this review during the sale where it's only 3.99 USD, get it immediately.",
      "I got this game on a whim because I once played this series like... a decade ago. DW3/4 to be specific. And even though I know full well that this sort of game is basically meant for consoles, I managed to play it just fine once I adjusted the key bindings to stuff that worked well for me. Anyway... game.\n\nIf, like me, you have played these games before, you pretty much know what you are in for. If you have never played any of these games, I'm not quite sure what else is quite like it. Basically it's a fighting game, except it is on large battlefield maps where you murder thousands of random and a handful of named NPC's while following objectives in order to complete each level. If that sounds repetitive... well it can certainly be that. It's the ultimate hack and slash-fest game, and if you get bored with murdering insane numbers of enemies, then chances are this game is not for you.\n\nThe game is based upon the Three Kingdoms era of Ancient China (184-280, roughly), and, despite the absurd outfits and personalities of many of the characters in the game, it is actually fairly consistent with what is known about the period. Or rather, it is consistent with the famous novel 'Romance of the Three Kingdoms' by Luo Guanzhong, which is basically a work of historical fiction that takes real events and bends them a bit according to the whims and views of the author. Which, of course, means that certain characters (particularly Shu-Han characters like Xuande/Liu Bei) are depicted as noble honorable sorts fighting for justice while others (like Mengde/Cao Cao) are depicted as villanous and driven by ambition. I don't want to dig too deep into this because there most likely are entire books written about how Luo Guanzhong messed around with the characters, but the depictions he made are pretty much what are found in this and all previous DW games. The nice thing though is that if you read between the lines (or maybe it's just because I am very familiar with the source material this game is based off of), you can see the flaws in the author's bias in the game as well. Namely that Liu Bei was a massive hypocrite every bit as ambitious as his rivals, and that Cao Cao, while not exactly the nicest guy around, wasn't the hellspawn other characters (like Liu Bei) called him.\n\nAnyway, the game follows the story decently well, though some creative license and trimming down obviously has happened. I still liked how the game depicted things most of the time. Perhaps my favorite was Lu Bu's campaign which, while maintaining the massive \"OMG ITS LU BU\" hype that all DW games have had, reveals exactly why the real Lu Bu got himself executed in chapter 19 of a 120 chapter book: that he was dumb as a brick, betrayed people constantly, and never listened to anyone's advice. While the old DW games I played did have storylines for him, they didn't take the historical route that this game's (default) story path takes. The same goes for the numerous character deaths shown, though many of these are made more dramatic than they actually were.\n\nAlso, while the playable character cast has increased to the point of total insanity (including some that may not have even existed or actually fought on battlefields), I did like that, in the time between DW4 and this, they added a number of characters that rounded out the cast further by including some of the other lesser-known strategists (Chen Gong, Lu Su) and characters who rose to prominence in the later parts of the story (Deng Ai, the sons of Guan Yu/Zhang Fei, as well as the entire Jin faction who were the ultimate winners of this whole mess). I thought that was a nice treat since these sorts had been badly neglected in past games, where everything seemed to stop at the year 234 (when Kongming/Zhuge Liang died), which was roughly the chronological halfway point of the entire story.\n\nOk, I better stop and just finish this up.\n\nIn short, It's a DW game. That means that on the one hand, the combat gets repetitive, many of the characters are very hard to take seriously, and many of the story events are overdramatized to the point of being kind of ridiculous. On the other hand, there is a MASSIVE amount of content (and all those DLC's for this \"Complete Edition\" are purely cosmetic), big battles are kind of fun, and one can even argue that the storyline's inherent cheesiness may actually be more a positive than a negative.\n\nIf you have never played one of these games before, this is the one i'd look at because (to my knowledge) it's the newest one and has an insane amount of content even compared to its predecessors. If you have played these and liked them before... why not? If you didn't like these games however, then most likely this will do nothing to change your opinion.\n\nFor all it's goofiness and repetition, DW is still entertaining enough for me to waste sizeable amounts of time with it. Hooray and stuff.",
      "I'll preface this by admitting that it makes sense for so many of the \"helpful\" reviews to be negative; it's good to warn customers of a game they won't enjoy, and The Witness definitely isn't for everybody.  That said, this is among my favorite games, and I was looking forward to The Witness for a very long time, so the fact that it lived up to my expectations says a lot.\n\n(You may find it helpful to know my preferences, so here are some of my other favorites: Fez, Portal, Infinifactory, LIMBO, The Beginner's Guide, and of course, Braid.)\n\nAs other reviewers have pointed out, The Witness isn't \"fun\"; that's not a criticism, it's just an accurate observation.  The Witness is treading unfamiliar territory, but only for a video game: most other artistic mediums have been used to explore themes other than \"fun,\" and it makes sense that this medium can be used similarly.\n\nInsofar as objective criteria exist for judging the quality of a video game, The Witness meets every standard I can think of: the game runs smoothly, the team have been timely about patching bugs, the visuals (gorgeous and stylized) and audio (understated and lacking music) are expertly executed, and the design of the world and puzzles is meticulous (and ambitious).\n\nThe only objective drawbacks I can think of are:\n\n1) The absence of an FOV slider (important for those who suffer from motion-sickness), which the developers have hinted may be added in a future update. UPDATE: this has been added, along with some other configuration options.\n\n2) Some of the puzzles are impossible to solve if you're deaf or color-blind.\n\nFrom what I can tell, The Witness is about making your own observations and forming your own theories about how the game mechanics work (the title of the game is relevant to its content); it's partly about solving puzzles, but more so it's about figuring out what the puzzles even are and how they work in the first place; given that, it's easy to see why The Witness fails to provide players with a clear goal or feedback: that would undermine the core of the game.  Patient curiosity is the best mindset with which to approach The Witness; it's like a piece of cloth with a loose thread: you pull it, and it keeps unraveling, and unraveling, and unraveling...\n\nThe intrigue of The Witness stems from constant and subtle revelations about how the game functions, which tend to overturn your previous theories and force you to let go of your presumptions, all without ever jumping the shark.\n\nThe Witness is slow to get rolling, patiently waiting while you adjust yourself to the mechanics and freely allowing you hold on to your false sense of comprehension.  You might expect a game like this to be eager to shove its paradigm-shifting revelations in your face, but it generally isn't: The Witness makes no effort to divulge its secrets, and when you peel back another layer, you can take comfort in the fact that it's a real accomplishment on your part.\n\nThe island is dense with puzzles (more so than it appears at first), and each of the nearly 700 puzzles (according to the developers) presents its own unique challenge, and a peek into the mechanics of the game (if you're paying attention).  The puzzles are each short, but satisfying and interconnected, so it's easy to leave the game at any time, and they're grouped into areas, where each area explores a particular game mechanic.\n\nBecause you're free to wander the island, you can walk away from one area if you get stuck and try a different one.  I usually had two or three areas I could choose between at any time.  If you try to play through each area, beginning to end, one at a time, I imagine you'll not enjoy yourself very much.  Once you get stuck on a puzzle, rather than continue banging your head against it, I recommend venturing off to find a different one; returning to a puzzle with a fresh palette and new mechanics under your belt may shake something loose.  The puzzles generally shouldn't require guesswork, and all of them are fair.\n\nThere's no narrative in The Witness.  You'll find recordings scattered around the island, which contain quotes from people throughout history, generally on the topics of awareness, discovery, investigation, and the monotheistic concept of a god.\n\nBeing an atheist, some of these fell flat for me, while others less concerned with theism hit hard, and one even had me teary-eyed.  Each one rang with the sort of sincerity that will either move you, or make you very uncomfortable, depending on how it plays against your own life and beliefs.\n\nIf I'm to be honest, I think The Witness has affected me on a personal level: its themes of exploration and discovery, and its quiet faith in your capacity to unravel its mysteries are comforting.  If you're in the mood for some introspection, you'll probably enjoy it as I have.",
      "For those of you with controllers:\n\nPress B to quack. \n\nPress Left Trigger to change the pitch of your quack; the more pressure you put on Left Trigger, the higher pitched your quack will be. \n\nThe more you know.\n\n\n\nDuck Game is an awesome game where a group of up to 4 ducks are pitted amongst eachother with a plethora of unique weapons. Matches are fast paced, with the only goal being \"stay alive longer than your friends\". It almost reminds me of a competetive version of Super Crate Box (the gunplay feels similar). \n\nIf you're looking for a goofy game to play with some of your friends, whether locally or online, pick this game up.",
      "Started strong, ended annoyingly.\n\nMoral of the story? People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.\n\nIt paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that \"routine\" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.\n\nI liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters. But it all fell apart and tries to teach a very vapid moral that someone in their early 20's who has never had a meaningful relationship would idealize.\n\nAt least it was short.\n",
      "[h1]Strategy at its finest[/h1]\n\nInto the Breach is Subset Game’s latest title, following on from their massive hit, FTL. I put off trying Into the Breach for a long while, but I finally got it when it dropped down to $10 on HB a couple of months ago and I’m so glad I did. This game isn’t for everyone, it’s kind of rogue-like mech chess, but if it clicks for you then it’ll be one of the best strategy games you’ll ever play.\n\n[h1]Positives:[/h1]\n[list][*]First up, the game looks fantastic. The pixel art here is great, from the backgrounds to the mechs and even the pilot portraits. The animations here area also really good. There’s nothing too complicated here but it’s all well executed. On the topic of appearances, I also really like the way the maps are laid out, the 8x8 grids on a plain background work really well here and it reminds me of simple boardgames. I think it works well for the game.\n\n[*]As with any good strategy game, it’s easy to pick up, but hard to master. You have a squad of three mechs (there are a few different mech groups to unlock with gold coins (?) and you can also create custom groups from the mechs you’ve unlocked). Each group has a unique element, but they all follow the basic structure of one close-range mech, one long-range mech and one support mech. Each mech has a different ability/weapon and they’re all well varied. The mech teams are really well designed here so that no one mech is super powerful and they all work really well as a unit. \n\n[*]The combat is excellent. It’s really simple but it works so well. You’ll quickly learn the different roles your mechs have and figure out the best strategies to use them. There are two ways to kill most enemies. Getting rid of all of their HP or pushing them into water/lava (with the exception of boss enemies or flying enemies). However, a lot of the time you probably won’t even be trying to kill your enemies in a given turn. You can always see what the enemies will do on their next turn and so you always want to be playing to react to/prevent their next move. Typically, enemies target civilian buildings or buildings related to your objective, so it’s usually better to focus on moving them away from these buildings rather than focusing on killing them. If you’re really smart/lucky you can also push enemies so that they attack each other, as friendly fire is a major part of this game. It’s really satisfying when you line it up right so the enemies are killing each other rather than attacking you or the buildings you defend. You can even block them from spawning by moving something on top of them!\n\n[*]Unlocks in this game are handled better than in FTL in my opinion. There are six actions that you can complete with each mech squad to earn those gold coins I mentioned in order to unlock new mech squads. The first three are the three possible victories: two, three and four island (more on that in a second) and then the other three achievements are unique to each mech squad. They’re centred around the unique aspect of each squad, tasking you to get a bit creative with the way that you’re playing. I know some players didn’t like the way that unlocks worked but I think it’s a really good way to handle it and encourages you to try new strategies. \n\n[*]The game has five islands, with one of those being the final boss fight. Each island is basically a different biome with different enemies and environmental hazards. They aren’t necessarily easier or harder than each other to start with, but the difficulty does increase as you move from island to island. There is some crossover with the enemies you’ll see, but they at the very least have a different appearance and most of them behave differently. There are also enemies unique to each island. \n\n[*]On each island, you’ll need to complete several missions before facing off against the island’s mini-boss. The missions all have different objectives for you to complete, though the win condition is always just to survive all of the turns (typically 5 turns). The different objectives vary but there are usual two, with some easier missions only having one and harder missions having three. Completing these objectives gets you certain rewards. You can either get stars, which are used upon completing an island to purchase new pilots, abilities or weapons. There is grid power which restores or increases the grid power you start with (grid power is lost when buildings are destroyed, losing all grid power results in a loss). Lastly, some of the missions award power cores (usually you only see this as the third reward for a hard mission) which allow you to upgrade your mech’s weapons or abilities (super handy). The mission variety is fairly good.\n\n[*]There are a range of different pilots in the game. You always start with one ‘special’ pilot and two regular pilots but more can be found in cryo-pods or bought at the end-of-island store. All pilots earn xp at the end of missions and when they level up they get some kind of upgrade, like more mech health or an extra movement per turn. The ‘special’ pilots all have some kind of special ability, such as being able to attack twice if you don’t move or the ability for the piloted mech to fly. Some of these require a power core, but they’re definitely worth it.  [/list]\n\n[h1]Negatives: [/h1]\n[list][*]Honestly, I’m clutching at straws here for negatives. One thing I would mention is that I don’t think this game will have as much replay value as FTL does for most people (completionists have an awful lot to do here) which shouldn’t put you off from getting it, but is something to base your expectations on. I also felt like Chris Avellone was a bit wasted on this game, his writing is fantastic but there just isn’t much of it. [/list]\n\n[h1]Verdict: [/h1]\n\nInto the Breach is as close to a perfect strategy game as I’ve ever played and it’s an excellent follow-up to FTL. This game is easy to pick up, hard to master and it looks beautiful the whole time you’re playing this weird mech chess. I can’t recommend this enough and at $15 it’s an absolute steal. This was easily one of my favourite releases of 2018 and anyone who likes strategy absolutely needs this in their library. \n\nIf you found this review helpful, please check out my other reviews over at [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33633486/]Kemo's Corner.[/url]",
      "In a world where \"enhanced edition\" has started to be synonymous with \"will run on modern hardware if you shell out $20\" it's absolutely refreshing to see Larian deliver this masterpiece free of charge to owners of the original. You start out with an already fantastic game that's received numerous game of the year and editor's choice awards. Then you spend a year polishing that game, and adding new features. The result is brilliant Enhanced Edtion of an already fantastic game.\n\nNew features for EE:\n[list]\n[*] Fully voice acted - Every line of dialog now has voice acting. The voice acting is really good too\n[*] Dual wield - Rogues now look more iconic with the ability to dual wield\n[*] Grenades - You can craft and throw various sorts of grenades. \n[*] Tactician Mode - A new  challenging mode where encounters are redesigned to be harder by adding new spells and enemies into the mix. Classic mode still available obviously.\n[*] Split screen co-op \n[*] Controller support\n[*] Updated graphics - The UI is totally reworked, the graphics are updated, and spells have new effects\n[*] Updates to the story  - The story, esepcially the ending, was rewritten a bit to clear up some confusing aspects\n[/list]\n\nI'm sure there's more, but really these ought to be reason enough to play this game."

    "prompt": "以下の2つのデータグループを比較して、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない表現パターンや内容の特徴を特定してください。\n\n【グループA】\n- Stunning pixel art platformer where you will travel through different eras fighting hordes of enemies even using the ability to change time! Super recommended, a must try if you like platformers!\n- Would be nice to get a definitive upgrade rather than paying full price for dragon quest xi definitive version\n- Great game! \nLooking foward for the next chapters of the game!\nI love the spritework, its amazing!\nEven the music is very catchy and memorable \nFor an Early Access game, this game is very charsimatic and has tons of personality!\n\nIts just a shame that it was short in my opinion, i know you are going to add more stuff obviously, but i was hoping to get much more out of it because i loved it alot xD.\n\nPirate Software, I can't stress enough how much my excitement for this game is,  the demo back in 2017 already left me intrigued, but now im excited to see how this all plays out!\n- This game is amazing! Truly the Dark Souls of little girl simulators.\n\nI’m glad that Dark Souls taught me how to dodge in literally every video game, it unknowingly prepared me for this. Ender Lilies is a Soulslike with JoJo Stand combat. That’s an instant win for me.\n\nThe world is depressing, suffocating and overwhelmingly beautiful. Each stories of the main spirits are well written and realistically human. The endings are top notch too.\n\nIf you’re even considering playing it… play it… I promise you won’t regret it. I was much more emotionally invested in this game than I was on Hollow Knight. Lilly is an amazing protagonist… and she never even utters a word. She doesn’t have to.\n\nIt's a beautiful game with fun combat, awesome art and amazing music. My only real complaint was a bit of exploration fatigue having to go around finding all the collectibles. \n\nI think the easiest way to sum up Ender Lilies is \"It's Momodora, but better.\" It has the same gameplay loop of \"slash slash roll behind the enemy slash slash repeat\" and fairly challenging bosses, in a much bigger and more non-linear world with nearly every single room having some sort of collectible. It's also aesthetically atmospheric and pleasing, and the soundtrack is great.\n\nI can safely say that this game is a creative masterpiece. And in the end… Like Lilly, don’t we all have a little girl inside of us, telling us to stop all this silliness and go back to being the proper good boys our Mother wanted us to be?\n\n10/10\n- please don't give an ironic positive review for this \"game\". It truly deserves the tag of \"overwhelmingly negative\" reviews.\n- This is such a great game. It's a well put together survival game with many things to do. Whether you want to just build a sandbox wilderness empire or try to escape, it's entirely fun no matter what. I've tried to actually complete the game, but I always end up building a massive epic fortress complete with my very own beefalo farm. The only thing that I personally don't like about this game is the stumble-upon style of actually completing the quests (they're not really quests, but I can't think of anything else to call them). Other than that, this game is a beautiful masterpiece. Very artistic, creative and fun. I definitely recommend it to anyone who loves survival games of any sort.\n- I wish i could recommend this more than once but sadly i cannot. Like everyone else im experiencing stuttering and the 30 frame rate cap but that is where my cons end. I dont have any special pc rig by any means yet even still i am enjoying this game SO MUCH. The story is so captivating i cant believe it, and the combat system? THE COMBAT SYSTEM IS SO FRICKING AMAZING I CANT BELIEVE IT. I HAVE NEVER FELT MORE LIKE BATMAN THAN I HAVE WHILE PLAYING THIS GAME. I ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE CONSIDERING BUYING THIS GAME AND DO YOU KNOW WHY. BECAUSE YOU'RE BATMAN. THE COMBAT SYSTEM IS INCREDIBLE. THE FLUIDITY OF ALL CONTROLS, INCREDIBLE. AND THE STORY? YEP, YOU GUESSED IT, INCREDIBLE. I CAN'T THANK ROCKSTEADY ENOUGH FOR MAKING THIS MASTERPIECE OF A GAME, IT IS SO ******* AMAZING I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n- a very interesting FPS multiplayer and co-op, It would be better if it was still in development like early access because it needs some work. shorter spawn times, vehicles , larger and more varied maps, what this game has that no other FPS has is realistic weapons. you will not find another game that models modern military grade firearms more realisticily in terms of what they sound like ,recoil, look, feel ( to the extent that a pc game can offer) they are amazing and I would buy this game for 8 bucks just for that alone. But it does need work , this game could be a great title to rival Battlefield and COD franchises ( maybe not Advanced Warfare) it may not surpass those titles but it could give them a better run for the money.\n- The popularity of this game is deserved, but very concerning.\n\nPopular indie games have a habit of ascertaining a very loud, territorial, and highly defensive following. Not only is it overwhelming for a creator, but also for its community. It creates an echo chamber that is opposed to foundational changes, which are necessary for early access games. I hope that Zeekerss will utilize this with experimental updates that explore possible additions and fixes.\n\nThat being said, the gameplay is really entertaining and complex for something that is relatively simple. It features a proximity voice chat which is ESSENTIAL, not only for the gameplay, but for the best experience. It should be played without any knowledge of its contents and with others who don't know anything either. The low-resolution, low-poly, aliasing aren't what sell its visuals - the animations, technology and UI design do. The player's running animation is cheesy as hell and it's great. A lot of the animations and movement in this game are genuinely spectacular. I haven't had this much fun with something new in a long time, and that's insanely rare for me.\n\n(Ironically, one of those recent games was DOORS, another Roblox developer game. Now, I couldn't pin it down, but I could tell it was made by a Roblox developer without seeing the splash screen. Maybe it's the jumping? The inventory slots? The items?)\n\n[Play if you like / vice versa:  SCP: CONTAINMENT BREACH, DOORS, DEEP ROCK GALACTIC.]\n\nFeedback: \n- [spoiler]The mansions would be more impactful if every location had a random chance to be one. It would need to be balanced out by that random chance becoming higher on later planets. Is it inspired by the Memories movie, by the way?[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The way the girl is handled is diabolical and I LOVE it.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]It would be very interesting to have a character that plays back what the players say.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]Something else that would be interesting is a fake player roaming around to misdirect.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The backrooms reference is way too common and is really out of place. It also wastes an opportunity to actually have some kind of rare, temporary dimensional door that a player can get separated by.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The moon interiors lack visual distinction and don't reflect their locations.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The enemy variety is pretty great, but some feel really out of place. Mines/turrets in the mansions? Jesters in bunkers? It's aesthetically dissonant. It would be much better if the enemies were categorized to be in specific places. There could still be varying overlaps; like some enemies could be in all places, some are only in one, and others are in a few but not others. This would allow for a great opportunity to have different \"biomes\" or bunkers, like military, paranormal, bio/alien research, etc. [/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]A lot of enemy designs are actually really freaky and fit within the established environments. Coilheads have a really great sound, but the giant spring is really wacky. The Jester is even worse, with a massive skull and human legs that no one can take seriously. [/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]You could have moons that play off the mechanics of a specific enemy pool to create unique, difficult circumstances.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The exteriors lack loot.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]As far as I have noticed, the mountain creatures are generally unfair. If they aren't already, they should be dependent on the presence of flashlights, glowing loot, ship lights, flashbangs, etc.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The sprint meter could be dropped, as the loot weight and footstep volume are effective in punishing the player.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]I worry that the game will adopt a system in which new moons are locked behind higher and higher costs. If it does, new content will only be accessible after playing a lot of what you've seen before, and it wouldn't be guaranteed. Simultaneously, new content could be immediately accessible, but then overwhelm and cram the base game.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The \"days remaining\" mechanic could be repurposed as a \"liftoffs remaining\" mechanic. This would allow moons, which would have different rotational speeds, to allow different durations of visits. This could allow for longer visits with higher rewards and risk, similar to Deep Rock Galactic's \"Deep Dives.\"[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The game doesn't have much lore, and since that's not the focus, that's fine. If this were to change in the future, consider stronger world-building that interweaves its contents.[/spoiler]\n- The music is really out of place when it plays in interiors, but the title music kicks ass.\n- The \"taunts\" are great and I hope we get even more.\n- The health UI looks way too similar to Outer Wilds.\n- The bestiary and logs should probably be client-side.\n- The quotas should scale dependent on player quota, as more players means more money.\n- [spoiler]The turrets and mines should really detect the monsters. That's what they're there for, no?[/spoilers]\n- Persona 5 ain't shit\nPokemon ain't shit\nFinal Fantasy ain't shit.\n\nStar Ocean 2's been the shit, will always be the shit, and with this remaster - IS THE BEST REMASTER FOR A JRPG OF ALL TIME. THE GOAT FROM SPACE RETURNS!\n\nAlso is it just me or is Precis extra horny on main? I don't recall her being this forward on the PS1, but hey - cool game that doesn't shy away from the old stuff on the hunt for ESG Blackrock points.\n\nTEN OUTTA TEN\n- Life is Norway sure is Strange huh :)\nAs you can see the game has a low poly artstyle, which I normally don't much like, but here it looks extremely good, especially when the camera zooms out to show more of the landscape.\nDefinitely also check out the dev's other game, Milkmaid of the Milky Way. Both games are very good.\n- If you somehow don't know what this is: It's a meta-narrative focused walking sim with a funny narrator. Only you know if that kind of thing sounds like a good time to you.\n\nSubtract about 26 hours from my playtime because I'm a lunatic who left the game running for a whole day to get a silly achievement.\n\nI loved the HD remix (never played the og mod), and I really liked this one too, but I will say that a lot of the commentary the original offered doesn't hit as hard or hold up as well almost a decade later, just because the narrative structure and how narrative is tied to gameplay of many story-driven games has changed in that time (because of course it has), as well as the mindset of a lot of players being different. So I think that it's worth keeping in mind the cultural moment the original was made during... if you're the thinky type who likes to overthink things. You massive nerd.\n\nStill, it felt nice to jump back in and spend a little more time with the narrator, and there were some legitimately striking moments in the new content that I found to be quite powerful and engaging. Overall, though, having played the original, getting all the new stuff (and revisiting the old) felt a lot more like checking off a to-do list than active exploration teasing at the boundaries of the game and it's layout than the first one.\n- Normally, I am hard-set on if a game is good, or bad. This game? its in the middle. I mean, a lot of the game is actually really cool, it looks great, it doesn't explain why basically almost every single person is a walking hunk of muscle, but there are some serious flaws. Not just the weird ones like \"kitchen knives break after you stab someone 3 times\" or \"I just ran over an entire sidewalk of people, and the police are nowhere to be found\", but some seriously terrible glitches that make the game unplayable. Such as the whole space-car thing. \"lalala... driving along the road...\" all of the sudden KABAM your car goes flying, hits the ground, explodes, you die, and you get charged money. You use a car to try and get back to where you were going, and BANG same thing happens again. Also, the cops, even though they are extremely spread out and don't appear to have any form of 911 or anything, are nuts with guns. You, who are supposed to be some sort of superultracop, don't even carry a knife. A FREAKING KNIFE. So if you want a gun, you have to kill a police officer, BUT WAIT HE DIDN'T DRAW HIS GUN AND YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE A HOLSTER so you have to wait until another police officer shows up, hope that he tries to shoot you instead of tackling you, and then run up to him while he shoots at you, press f when you are right in front of him, and grab his gun. Meanwhile the entire police force is going to where you are. Thats just how to get a pistol. Whats that? You want a real gun? One that doesn't take 7 shots(literally) to kill a unarmored policeman? Well, you have to hole up in some building, which its hard to find one with an interior, and just keep shooting the police officers when they charge in. Eventually, after maybe 30 officers are dead, they send in their \"elite team\" of guys... with no helmets... no armor other than a vest... and either a shotgun or a submachine gun. The farthest I have gotten to is with these guys dressed in all grey with helmets and assault rifles, they are meant to be the wall, because it can take up to an entire clip of your submachine gun to take one down. Oh, and back to the cars, WHAT THE HECK IS WITH THE CAR ATTACKING. It made me almost fall out of my chair laughing when I realized that I could use my car to \"lunge\" left and right, and take out other cars. I guess the devs didn't know that cars can't drive straight sideways. Your character has no weapons as well, so it looks kinda stupid when you are blocking and punching a bunch of guys with tire irons, knives, and whatnot. Oh yeah, the weapons break after you swing a few times. The game also has weird weapons. You can pick up an umbrella, a purse, heck even a grocery bag, or a take-out box, to use as a weapon, but these things are one use, and deal less damage then a punch. Overall, this game is a little too unrealistic, to the point where it really removes you from the game. Not to mention the glitches, you would think that the \"new and improved\" sleeping dogs would be \"new and improved\" not the horrible, glitchy mess it is now. I really tried to play it, but I just got tired of being gunned down while I am trying to break into a car and start it up, which takes like a good 20 seconds, which is a lot of time when you have 10 cops unloading their bottomless clips at you. I got tired of randomly being flung into space. I got tired of a cop arresting me, and instead of allowing me to break free and whatnot, me and the cop take a \"small adventure\" gliding across the road through cars and buildings. I got tired of a game thats supposed to be fixed and nearly glitchless, when in reality most early access games play better. I am sorry.\n- [h1]\"Connecting to Racenet...\"[/H1]\n\nSo Dirt Rally 2.0, or for the sake of brevity D2 is brilliant, when you're tearing down the leafy gravel tracks of the US of A, or picking your way through boulder strewn horrors of Argentina (which frankly feel more in line with spintyres than an actual rally course, be prepared to spend a lot of time in first and second gear), or haring along the asphalt of Spain (a worthy successor to the somewhat technical and twiddly Germany) this game is *outsta-\n\n\"Connecting to racenet....\"\n\nHang on.

The physics model from Dirt Rally has been pretty much refined upon in every single way, with new features such as Tyre Wear, and Track Degredation making significant changes to how you'll attack each stage, having the ability to select tyre type matters too, since each tyre type will wear through the available grip differently (and the state of the track will in turn factor how fast you chew through those t-\n\n[H1]Wait for it, waaaaait for iiiiiit....[/H1]\n\n\"Connecting to racenet, it appears there is a discrepancy between your data and Racenet, your event has been reset.\"\n\n... Now I have to start over in Argentina. It's fine, Argentina is nice, it means I can tell you about the excellent track designs, which I'm fairly sure much like Dirt Rally, have been taken from real world locations and are distilled down versions of their real lif-\n\n\"Unable to connect to racenet. MyTeam is Unavailable.\"\n\n...\n\nYou know what? None of what I say is going to matter. Because as much as I might wax lyrical about how far Dirt Rally 2 has advanced over Dirt Rally 1 (it's not all good news, but by and large the improvements are genuine and real) there's this one, [b]giant elephant[/b] that keeps wrecking my enjoyment of the career mode.\n\n[H1]\"A discrepancy has been found in the career data. Resetting Career.\"[/H1]\n\n... And there it is.\n\n[H1]He's gonna lose it just about... Now.[/H1]\n\nYou f***. You absolute f***. You mother***king piece of f***ing ***tastic pile of w***. F*** you, and all your f***ing relatives and all the children you have, or may have, now or in the future you b***arding pile of sp*** flavoured sherbets.\n\nFor the last 10 hours, my enjoyment of this game has been punctuated with constant issues with RaceNet attempting to grab me and f*** me from behind. And we're not talking the nice kind of happy f***ing, oh no, we're talking pound you in the ***, elephant d***, ma***ngo grade railing that has made life so teeth grindingly unpleasant that even Codemasters airdropping everyone affected ONE MEEEEEEEELEON CREDITS only offers scant salve to the reaming that RaceNet has given me.\n\nAnd now the game has been opened to the general public, which means RaceNet is about to go down faster than a hooker who just got a stack of benjamins for \"live services\". I do not expect any form of stability for the next few days, and quite possibly my Career to reset again. Motherf***ing piece of ****ing ****ed in the ****ing *** frankenf***ed **** **** ******* <the rest of this rant has been censored by David Cameron's decency filter>\n\nIf they remove RaceNet from the Singleplayer and yes, let me emphasise this - SINGLEPLAYER CAREER MODE - this becomes an automatic buy, and an automatic thumbs up from me.\n\nAs Racenet stands, breaking down more often than a catwalk model, and being as unreliable as cut-me-own-throat Dibbler's meat pie floaters, I warn all of you. STAY AWAY. STAY THE **** AWAY. THIS **** WILL DRIVE YOU ****ING NUTS. IT'S MADE ME LOSE WHAT'S LEFT OF MY ****ING HAIR. I WANT TO LOVE THIS GAME BUT IT WON'T LET ME. IT WON'T LET ME BECAUSE RACENET IS A PILE OF <the rest of this rant has been censored, again, by David Cameron's decency filter>.\n\nVerdict: [b]Wait for RaceNet to be pulled out of the SINGLEPLAYER CAREER MODE, and then buy it[/b]\n\n-storms back in- OH! AND THE CO-DRIVER FROM DIRT RALLY 1'S VOICE WAS BETTER! FITE ME! -storms out again-\n- 11 Jun 2023 Purchased the game again.  The weird distorted things are significantly reduced. The flight physics are improved. There are many mods and payware add-ons available. This is an excellent game for pilotage. There is a huge well mannered diverse community and the use of YourControls allows for a decent shared cock-pit experience.\n\nI recommend buying this game for the serious flight simmer.\n\n\n22 Jan 2021 Stunning graphics. mostly, with some really weird distorted things.   This is a very interesting game for those who are not very focused on real world aviation.  The airports are not accurately represented and the aircraft do not respond realistically, unless you are not interested in detail.   I think that it is an interesting product for casual entertainment, but serious flight enthusiasts will likely be disappointed.  I expect that with time users will create mods (aircraft and airports) to repair the inaccuracies, and fix the lack of detail, but I doubt that the weird graphics will ever be fixed.\n- The weakest RE since RE6. \n\nFeels half baked as heck on a game design level. Too many damn cutscenes and areas where you're just on rails. Really, the game design seems to take a massive step back from RE7 and even a bigger step back in terms of puzzles. Really a shame.\n\nNot to mention the performance is pretty terrible and inconsistent. Not to mention the lack of full keyboard bindings and support. Really, this port feels like a whole afterthought to a game that already feels like an afterthought.\n\nIt does get better on the back end but not enough to balance out that weak front end.\n- 100%'ed the LUCT version of the game and I'm slowly working my way through this version now.\n\nOver all the game itself is solid. If you're reading this, its a brilliant tactics game that helped define the genre. However most of the changes they made in reborn, while innovative, ultimately feel constraining. \n\nFor example, they've limited spell slots to 4, so you can only ever take 4 different spells. One or two of which (missile + indirect) are taken by a damage spell of your choice, leaving you with even less spell customization than you'd think. And its unfortunately the same situation with skills, as one will always be taken up by your weapon skill. \n\nThe cards that drop in battle, while an interesting system on paper, just end up cluttering the field most of the time, often with auto-skill activation up, which most of your units won't even really want compared to the other options. \n\nRandom battles were also removed, limiting chances to recruit to a few key dungeons as well as removing some of the more amusing battle locations from the game. \n\nI've also seen some people complain about the level cap, but in my current play-though of the game, it isn't too much of a concern for me, but it may be for others. \n\nOver all, it just feels like they've taken a step back from what Tactics ogre: Let us cling together, gave us. Yes there's bloat in that version, but it also gave us a feeling of freedom when we were putting our teams together that this version lacks. I am grateful that we saw a remake of this game within my lifetime, but I wish they had improved on Luct, rather than take steps back from it. \n\nIf they ever increase the amount of spells and/or skills you can take, to like 6-8, then I'd probably switch my review to a yes. But until then, with a heavy heart I have to say that this version just isn't as good as Luct so far.\n- This game is meditation, the thought-cleansing effect of driving a thousand kilometres along the highway cannot be understated. Occasionally poor AI choices behind the wheel may spike your blood pressure but overwhelmingly ETS2 is a relaxing thing to stick on after a rough day. And if that's not enough you can just drive into oncoming traffic in your indestructible death machine.\n\nAn alternate title for this game could be \"Zen and the Art of Logistics\".\n- They need to add more weapons like a galil or m249 or something and maybe more vehicles and playmodes.But overall so many possibilities\n- ULTRAKILL is a fine game with cool movement mechanics. However most of the guns don't feel beefy at all and, really, there's not much content to be had. Wait for ACT 3 before forking out $20 for this.\n\nedit: after getting every p rank, gaming\n- Bioshock Infinite is the third and (presumably) final game in the venerable Bioshock series of narrative driven FPS action games.  Gameplay, as always, consists of somewhat linear FPS combat with a \"genetic\" progression advancement system that lets you upgrade your abilities through \"splicing\" \"plasmids\".  This gives you somewhat supernatural abilities to augment the more traditional shooting of enemies with guns that we all enjoy from FPS games.  There's also the usual gamut of minigames, with a carnival theme to them. \n\nFrom the technical perspective, even though this is getting a little old, it's a AAA game and it shows.  Everything gamers expect is delivered here in terms of visual tweaks, control customisation, 4K support and a lot of graphics fine tuning options to allow gamers to experience a perfectly optimised experience.  There's not much else to say when developers get it right!  The visuals are equally top notch. \n\nWhile a great technical implementation is a must, and a minimum requirement for a recommendable game, of course Bioshock Infinite goes beyond that to deliver a masterpiece story that will leave gamers hooked, and perhaps a little bereft once it's over, but that's how all great stories should be.\n\nBioshock Infinite is a must-play for fans of narrative FPS games, although I do recommend trying Bioshock 1 & 2 first.  It's not required, but just like you wouldn't enjoy it as much if you watched Return of the Jedi first, you should try the first two episodes of Bioshock before the third one.\n- [h1]AT A GLANCE[/h1]\n(Full review follows below)\n\n[list]\n[*] [b]Game Name:[/b] The Swapper\n[*] [b]Original Release:[/b] 2013\n[*] [b]Genre Tags:[/b] Atmospheric; 2D; Puzzle-Platformer; Sci-Fi \n[*] [b]My Overall Grade:[/b] A-\n[*] [b]Estimated Playtime (Campaign):[/b] 3-5 hours\n[*] [b]Multiplayer Aspect:[/b] None\n[*] [b]Recommended To:[/b] Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Aesthetes; Game atmosphere connoisseurs; Strong narrative advocates; Puzzle game aficionados\n[/list]\t\n\n[h1]REVIEW[/h1]\n[b]The Swapper[/b] is an enjoyable 2D puzzle-platformer that lacks gameplay innovation but rises above the crowd on the shoulders of its superbly well-designed atmosphere and provocative narrative.  The actual puzzle-solving aspect of the game is adequate, but with minimal diversity and accretion.  It is definitely a story-driven experience, with the gameplay taking a passenger seat.  If you can appreciate a game in that style, this is a good bet for you. \n\nThe entrancing narrative and the style in which it transpires work in concert with the mystifying ambiance to create a wondrous experience. The story touches on some thought-provoking metaphysical issues, while skillfully avoiding a fall too deep into the rabbit hole to keep the average person’s interest. Much of the rest of the narrative is comfortable, cliché sci-fi tropes that we all know and love.\n\nThe gameplay and the puzzles are far from [i]bad[/i], but they also are nothing special.  As I alluded to: they are sufficient, but fail to develop into anything overly interesting. Very little changes from the first puzzle to the last, so it does get a little bit dry.  That said, some of the later ones are quite tricky and a few require not only puzzle-solving ability but also decent reflexes. \n\nThe graphics are pleasurable and align perfectly with the vibe of the game. But the whole soundscape is what truly brings the atmosphere of [b]The Swapper[/b] to life. The ambient soundtrack, the cryptic chatter, and the selectively placed voice-overs contribute a wonderful blend of emotions and mystery. If you are into it, this is a game you might enjoy with the lights off and your headphones on (or however else you may get into the zone).  \n\n[b]The Swapper[/b] is a brief, interesting, and enjoyable experience. It is not a complex or intricate puzzle-platformer, but I recommend it to any fan of the genre who would appreciate the atmosphere and narrative.\n\n[i][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/murphyslawyercuration#curation]Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations![/url][/i]\n- I've been playing this game since it was in Kickstarter! It is the best Story Rich game that I have ever played and the most unique. I have played through maybe 7 times and it's different every time. The ability to replay this game countless times is what makes it such a great game. Tons of questions that change based on the questions you've asked, you see a question that might not be there after you ask another question instead. Every version of this game that I played kept my interest and had me sitting on the edge of my seat waiting for more. I have reached 2 endings so far and I can't wait to see what happens next. The Developers are great, I can't wait to see what they create next.\n- Has combination of tight controls and well designed levels that makes platforming satisfying, excellent graphical style and music, as well as tons of unlockable content that will keep you playing even after finishing the story.\n\nVery solid platformer.\n\nThe only downside is there's no online coop; only local.\n- First off, just want to say this isn't a Metroidvania. This is a Zelda clone. And a good one!\n\nI bought this game because I heard it really put stress on you. You have limited time to complete the game and NPCs will begin dying if you aren't fast enough. Pretty crazy, right? Well, I do have a few gripes with that, but let me point out the good stuff first:\n+ Amazing combat. You have access to both guns and swords, but most of your damage will likely come from melee weapons since they have the ability to do an extremely-easy-to-pull-off PARRY! Parrying an enemy stuns it and gives your next attack against it a massive damage multiplier. All enemies, all bosses, and most projectiles are parryable, so this is what combat ends up revolving around. Even though I call it easy, you still get that cool feeling when you walk into an ambush and clear it without taking a hit, so it never gets dull as you go through the game.\n\n+ Good dungeon design. Since this game takes after Zelda, it's not shy about inserting a few puzzles into its dungeons. The overworld as well has quite a few surprising secrets and side quests that you won't be expecting when you play for the first time.\n\n+ Sequence breaks. This is mostly for New Game+ (or New Game Extra, a separate mode where you have access to major exploration items from the start, but not your whole endgame inventory), but it was interesting to find out how many secret paths and shortcuts there were, and how tightly they were managed. The devs thought of everything!\n\nSo now for the bad stuff.\n- Underwhelming story. Guess how much is really explained over the course of this story. If you guessed \"all of it\", you would be completely wrong and here's your dunce hat. Unsighted ends up spending so much of its time on the protagonist's relationships that it fails to answer several of the more important questions concerning the game's backstory. Why was there was a war? Who started it? Where are the humans now? Why are they so disorganized? Why do they seem to have no chain of command whatsoever? How did the automatons ever win anything at all at any point when they seem so extremely outclassed? I guess it doesn't matter. Look, there's two robot-girls kissing.\n\n- Fake pressure. I heard there was going to be pressure before I started the game, so I decided to go DEFCON 1 from the get-go and rush everything. I ended up completing the game in 10 in-game days and I felt pretty good about it. Zero NPC deaths! Zero! I'm a super awesome amazing hero, right? Well, credits roll and... the only achievement I get is the one for beating the game. No one really cares and apparently you're meant to play through multiple times anyway. So... why did I ever care? Why is this mechanic even in the game? All it did was make me shy away from general exploration and side quests since all of those things are less important than, ya know, saving the world. You can call that interesting, but when it has no payoff, it ends up being frustrating.\n\n- No post-game. Did I mention, if you bumrush the game and finish with just hours left on everyone's timers, you don't get to do any extra no-timer exploring afterwards? No, the game's over. Load the save and you get set back to where you were before fighting the final boss. If you want to do any actual exploring, that's what \"Explorer\" mode is for. You know, that mode that makes you feel like you're cheating?\n\nBasically, Unsighted is another game filled with missed opportunities. I recommend this game because the core gameplay and level design is very well done and very well executed, but you should probably know this before you start:\n\nThe only pressure here is the one you imagine. Since the game does nothing to acknowledge your successes, just play it at your own pace and don't be shy about using Explorer. Shame on the devs for hailing the agony of defeat, but not the thrill of victory.\n- The story of this game is interesting and well written, but it doesn't fully make up for the game's flaws. Here are the problems I saw with the game.\n\n1. There are a wide variety of guns available, but very few combinations of those guns are viable. The shotguns are rarely viable for combat with gun wielding enemies, since advancing far enough forward to make shotgun damage effective inevitably puts you in the line of fire of enough of your enemies to prove lethal. Other weapons like sniper rifles and pistols have critically low DPS and a low maximum ammo cap, making them almost universally not viable. Additionally this game likes to spring ambushes on the player in a way that takes away any advantage gained from long range optics. The special pneumatic weapons in the game also suffer from a low ammo cap. This leaves you with assault rifles, which the game seems to have been made for.\n\n2. In encounters with bestial enemies it is frequently impossible to avoid taking damage. The enemies sprint at you in packs which even sustained automatic shotgun fire cannot fully stop. Some of the boss enemies are even worse in this department. In normal mode with the larger health pool and regeneration over time this wouldn't be such a problem. But in ranger mode this makes certain obstacles unbeatable. You might have a boss which takes your entire ammo pool from both guns to kill, and which gets a guaranteed hit on you once every thirty seconds. If you go into that boss fight hurt and with no healing items, then you'll be met with mathematically guaranteed failure. The simple fix for this is to give the player a dodge function to avoid taking an instance of damage.\n\n3. This story has a few decisions to make, but mostly it is on rails. This isn't always a problem in a game, but it is when your character gets repeatedly taken unawares by things you as the player have already figured out. You as the player may sense that Artyom is being tricked, is about to be ambushed, or is going to let the bad guy get away through poor decision making. You just have to frustratedly walk into the cut scene and let it happen anyways. Its fine for this to happen at least once. But by the fourth or fifth instance it becomes infuriating to play as the character who just gets tricked and captured all the time.\n- [b]What was added:[/b]\n- Roguelike mode\n- New campaigns\n- 5 new units\n- Groove/Super groove\n- 4 new commanders\n- New OST, including Commanders'\n\n[b]What did it cost:[/b]\n- No more Arcade and Puzzles\n- A lot of maps removed from Multiplayer\n- Can't randomize weather anymore (????)\n- Can't use previous OST\n- No more Co-op campaign\n- Nothing to unlock with stars. All characters are already unlocked, so there is no point completing the campaign with more than 1 star per mission.\n\n[b]With that being said, here are some issues:[/b]\n- Balancing may need some work. Won't get into details, but it doesn't feel right, as it wasn't right in Wargroove\n- AI is still bad. Even worse than before. They just didn't touch it. They will use their Groove on cooldown most of the time, without bothering about the Supergroove. Commanders will run into you only to get surrounded and killed.\n- Once a player lose, all of his team lose, putting the game to an end. Though there is a toggle in map editor to disable it, but doesn't seem to work\n- A lot of tooltips missing for settings. We don't know what most settings are doing...\n- Tried to make a map where Commanders can respawn after 2 turns, to prevent AI to lose instantly, and let them play more agressive. But when you increment counters or set flags booleans, they get changed for both teams, making it impossible to script... Can't debug efficiently either.\n- The new Commanders' themes are glitchy when looping\n- The Codex didn't get updated properly. When selecting a Commander, we can only see a short text for the Groove, without any details.\n- In Map Editors, there are two entries for Wulfar, but using different names.\n\nI'd say if you liked Wargroove 1, you'd just like that one too. But it feels really disappointing right now. I don't know why they removed features instead of just adding new ones... In 2020, they said they were working on AI. But they did absolutely nothing.\n- Complete scam - game barely works. Devs got it to load with stability and then dropped all funding and support for the game. Complete contract violation with Steam. I actually cant believe it is still in the Steam store. DO NOT BUY !!! I was not allowed to refund it even with only .4 hours played, due to \"management issues\" within Double Fine. I am guessing Steam cant get their money out of them either.\n- If you played the OG this is basically the same but with a few added side stories you can unlock as you complete different routes in the game. The extra dlc maybe would take you a bit over an hour to complete all of them if you speed through it, but does not have any optional dialogue so it's more of just some lore and extra character interactions. Still pretty solid dlc if you are a fan and want a little bit of extra stuff :)\n- *Sigh* This game was just tiring. I wouldn't come to say it was a complete rip off of Paper's Please, but it was a very similar game but just worse. Mainly to the point that I played, at most, 10 minutes, I saw multiple repeats of the same messages, and the only updates were legislation, unlike in Papers, Please where you got new rules and new tools almost every day. I won't completely judge the game since I haven't played it the entire way through, but it's just not very good. Plain and simple.\n- Only one word to describe this game\n\nOutdated.\n\nThere is no real point to get this game unless you want a slightly better looking UI and atmosphere. L4D2 already contains the campaigns from L4D1 and is where the entire Left 4 Dead community is. Only a small playerbase still plays l4d1, mostly out of nostalgia. But there is quite literally no reason to get the game.\n\nYou can grab it if you are into achievements, but only do so when it goes on sale, i grabbed it for a couple penny, still a bad idea.\n- This version comes bundled together with some kind of horrid bloatware called \"Steam\" which functions as a type of DRM meaning you do not actually own the game. Avoid at all costs, buy it on CD instead!\n- This is my first Formula One game, I never expected before to like this type of games but I do and I'm glad that the 2017 version was my first one because it's very polished and enjoyable.\n\nThe game is basically a simulator of real F1 racing with everything that belongs to it. The gameplay is very similar to what we are used to in Codemasters games - a carrer mode where you choose a team and try to meet their expectations. It's not easy, it needs a lot of skills and I don't recommend playing with a keyboard (I personally use an Xbox controller).\n\nWhen it comes to racing games I'm always mostly interested in multiplayer and I'm pleased that the multiplayer mode works well, it's cross-platform, supports up to 20 players and it's really fun.\n\nThe game was ported by Feral Interactive using Vulkan, the general optimization is great and the performance is very stable. I had an issue with constant crashing after ~5-10 minutes so I sent an e-mail to Feral and their Linux support team was very happy to help. The issue of mine was fixed in less than 3 days and they uploaded the fix on Steam using a beta release channel to let me test it so I'm more than happy with the level of tech support.\n\nNothing more to say, if you are looking for a competitive racing game with decent multiplayer then you shouldn't miss this game.\n\n[h1]System info & performance report[/h1]\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Platform[/td]\n        [td]Linux | Arch[/td]\n    [/tr]\n   [tr]\n        [td]Desktop environment[/td]\n        [td]Gnome Shell 3.26[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]API[/td]\n        [td]Vulkan[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]CPU/GPU/RAM[/td]\n        [td]i5 7300HQ / GTX 1050 Ti [396.24] / 12 GB[/td]\n    [/tr]\n [tr]\n        [td]Settings[/td]\n        [td]1080p, high[/td]\n    [/tr]\n [tr]\n        [td]FPS[/td]\n        [td]50-60 average[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\nhttps://youtu.be/UOssSi3a3PU\n[i][b]Note:[/b] ~10 fps loss due to recording[/i]\n\n[h1]Technical side[/h1]\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Available APIs[/td]\n        [td]Vulkan-exclusive[/td]\n    [/tr]\n\t[tr]\n        [td]Multiplayer[/td]\n        [td]cross-platform Linux <-> Mac OSX <-> Windows[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Config location[/td]\n        [td] ✓ Good | ~/.local/share/feral-interactive/F1 2017[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Linux version rating[/td]\n        [td]Perfect | 5/5[/td]\n    [/tr]\n   [tr]\n        [td]Controller support[/td]\n        [td]Excellent (tested with an Xbox 360 wireless controller, \"xpad\" Linux built-in (default) kernel module)[/td]\n    [/tr]\n   [tr]\n        [td]Any issues (fullscreen, performance, crashes...) ?[/td]\n        [td]Not anymore (fixed by Feral)[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Ported by[/td]\n        [td]Feral Interactive[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n- To be completely honest, throughout my entire playthrough, I was thinking on giving this game a \"Not Recommended\" but it really wouldn't have deserved it. This game is at the same time both very difficult to recommend as to not recommend. It is really a beatiful and extremely original game, with a pretty well told interesting story. However, the problem it has is that it doesn't really work as a puzzle game. Puzzle solutions don't make logical sense most of the time and you end up brute forcing your way through most of the game. This means trying every posibility until something works and moves the story foward, and this is just not good puzzle design. This also distracts you from the story being told, which is in itself not so easy to understand, it requirers you to be paying attention to details, so your brain has to be constantly switching between \"puzzle mode\" and \"story mode\". Anyway, you can tell a lot of love was put into this game, and that is why I ultimately recommend it.\n7.5/10-\n- After playing thousands of games both singleplayer and multiplayer, unlocking all achievements and getting every solo map medal, I think it's time for a review:\n\nIf you like tower defence games: I recommend.\nIf you like any previous Bloons games: I recommend.\nIf you want something casual and chill: I recommend.\nIf you want a bit of a challenge: I recommend.\n\nThe tower type variety is interesting and diverse, with 5 tiers of upgrades each (plus special \"paragon\" towers)\nThe game devs have been providing free updates for years.\nThere's lots of achievements and medals to get.\nThere's online co-op, boss events and even different game-modes.\n\nThe game is more expensive than it used to be, but literally any sale price makes it worth a buy!\n- PROS-\n-finally out on steam\n-excellent factory builder with many features for easy factory automation\n-easily 40-50 hours of game play in it's current state\n-beautiful map design with plenty of space and verticality, multiple biomes each with their own beauty and quirks\n-overall very appealing graphics/visuals\n-easy to understand structures to build with but factory complexity increases overtime requiring some thought that doesn't leave you bored building your factory bigger in late-game\n-tons of potential for future updates\n\n\nCONS-\n-lacking all story elements at this point in time (June 2020)\n--multiplayer is filled with some bugs, nothing game breaking but constantly annoying: \n-only host can drive a vehicle without lagging effectively making it impossible for the person connecting to drive anything more than a few feet\n-constant de-sync on client side so don't expect to smoothly see the host's location\n-hyper tube transportation of significant length or otherwise complex shape can lead to the game losing track of the client and freezing them in place requiring a disconnect and reconnect, sometimes outside of the tube in a precarious position. \n-FPS in multiplayer is quite reduced or otherwise locked to ~60fps give or take 20, might be by design but it causes some issues.) \n\n-power production could probably be improved with higher tier coal burners and water pumps (and higher tier pipes that allow extra flow), seems simple to add but so far not an available tech.\n-difficulty of power production is what limits factory size at this point so I hope the next update brings that upgrade (only so many pure coal nodes and oil nodes)\n-somewhat limited water sources in many biomes\n\nfinal thoughts: over-all a great purchase, but I wouldn't blame you if you want to wait for more stable multiplayer or for the game to be finished.\nEarly access isn't for everyone but for me I just see it as getting to replay the game a few times over the development.\n- its a very stressful game and rly hard but the fact that u can lose all ur progress because of a mistake is on another level of insane but in the end if u r determined u will finish it and the feeling when u finish it after all the time is very good i never felt this good in my life about finishing a game or a puzzle its a rly good game i recommend\n- \"You've played for 1000 hours.

More extensive non-spoiler reactions\n \nPart 1: Recommendations for You\nIf you're like me and you try to get all the extra scene dialogue, then please, if you take nothing else from this, give yourself time to play this game yourself.

The game is just too long to binge in a reasonably short amount of time, and if you do binge, you're going to lose a lot.\n \nMy recommendations:\n1. Give yourself time to play the game. Let it sink in, and take notes- it'll be rewarded. The game is literally too dense and too long to binge reasonably if you like 100%ing.\n \n2. Get invested in the characters and pay attention to them, not just the (admittedly stellar) mysteries.\n \n3. Explore the game, its mechanics, and its dialogue yourself. Don't be afraid to restart a Somnium several times; the more options you pick, the more meaningful information you get.\n \n4. If you're a puzzle lover then try to solve the game yourself. You're going to have a blast if you manage it, and the game has tons of built-in hint systems to make it even easier, fairer, and more fun.\n \n5. Try to go in knowing at little as you can. The marketing has already done a great job. Focus on finishing the game and bringing it all together.\n \n6. On PC, force anti-aliasing on using your graphics card to make the game prettier. Game ran and controlled smoothly with few bugs.\n \n7. You don't need AI1 to play AI2, but I think AI2 does spoil AI1, though you could still enjoy them in reverse order.\n \n7. If you're sensitive to horny then just read less background dialogue in Ryuki side. Gore is pretty toned down, and there isn't any single huge CW.\n \nYou can stop reading now if you don't want your playthrough tainted by my reactions/expectations effected.\n \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nPart 2: Who am I, and how do I play?\nI'm an Uchikoshi fanatic. I've played all his English-translated games, and visual novels are my favorite genre of game. I've played a lot of visuals novels, but Uchizawa's are my favorites. I usually try to 100% complete all the scenes and see all the bonus dialogue. I've also played a lot of other genres of game, and I do like fun gameplay, but the most important things to me tend to be:\n \nA. An interesting story is absolutely what gets me invested\nB. Bunches of novel ideas like unique plot points I haven't seen before, philosophical ideas, or puzzles\nC. Characters that I at least don't actively hate; I can like a game for the above two, but characters still matter\nD. Deep personal connection, usually formed by connections to real people or how a game shaped my life\n \nThose are the ways I rate my top games. For the last 8 years, my top 2 favorite games have been the same:\n \nMy top favorite game of all time is Remember11. I love the plot, the ideas, the twists, the characters, and it's what got me truly invested in Uchikoshi. It's very much a mystery game first with an unravelling mystery and themes I love to explore.\n \nMy second favorite game is Virtue's Last Reward. I love the interactive moral dilemmas. VLR's use of the Prisoner's Dilemma jumpstarted my interested in Philosophy which led me to major in Philosophy. I don't like the characters as much save for a few, but it's still very important to me.\n \nNow, let me tell you how I've played AINI: I've basically been playing non-stop since June 13th.\n \nTake this with a grain of salt because I've been documenting as I play (the average main story playtime seems to be 20-35 hours, with 100% likely taking 50+), but right now, I have 97 hours of playtime. I have not gotten all the dialogue, achievements, or fully explored the abundance of extra mechanics. Instead, I have a 616-page reaction document full of constant laughs, cries, screams, passing out, and most of all love.\n \nPart 3: My Review\nThe R11 #1 and VLR #2 holy duology held true for 8 years. Also, AI1 isn't one of my favorite standalone games; it has huge personal connection for me because of the community and the AI1 ARG, but it wasn't my favorite as a game.\n \nI gave all that background because I want you to take me seriously when I say this:\nAI2 is my new favorite game. The #1 spot has been Easily dethroned.\n \nThe themes, twists, characters, ideas, gameplay, visuals, voice acting, fair mystery, presentation, mechanics, and comedy all of it resonates together perfectly. I don't even tend to value gameplay or visuals, but at many times, this game is fun to play while looking genuinely beautiful and cinematic.\n \nThe story reads like a proper Uchikoshi + Nakazawa return to form. The mystery is fair, interesting, meaningful, and complex told satisfyingly. There are many deep ideas, concepts, and themes utilized in thought-provoking ways.\n \nGameplay-wise, there are tons of mechanics that are utilized to make each Somnium unique; they all feel designed by love, fair, and reflective of the character through gorgeous symbolism. They blow the first game completely out of the water. Each one is its own experience to explore and a visual delight. There are also tons of mechanics for you to discover that make AI2 a fun game to play.\n \nThe animations, voices, and directing are cinematic; this game is actually breathtaking a lot of the time. It's backed up by great and charming character writing- despite the fact Mizuki is my favorite AI1 character with 0 contest, I grew to like much of the AI2 cast the same amount.\n \nAI2 is a story about halves and splitting, but also love and coming together- please, see it through until it's whole. I hope and believe you will all fall in love with AI2 like me; AI2 is all I've ever wanted. AI2 is my dream game come true; it's a gorgeous love letter to all Uchikoshi fans who love Zero Escape's puzzles, Infinity's mysteries, and AI's characters and humor.\n- SICK Art Style\nSICK Mechanics\nSICK Game\n- When I first played Battlefield 1 it literally sent me to the hospital, cause you’re supposed to seek immediate medical attention if your erection lasts longer than 4 hours.\n\nThis is easily one of the most badass games  in history. The music, the landscape, the gunplay, the hit register and the satisfying kill effect, EVERYTHING is just amazing. The last true Battlefield game. I enjoyed every second of this amazing game.  \n\nBF1 isn’t fully historically accurate but it is historically immersive. The war stories in this game genuinely made me emotional sometimes and I’m not ashamed to admit that. \n\nAs someone who is more on the “historical accuracy” side of games, I can say without a doubt that Battlefield 1 did an incredible job. Hell, they were even able to be diverse without pandering to anybody! The 1st Russian Women’s Battalion of Death, the Harlem Hellfighters, people from French-occupied northwestern Africa, the list goes on. What sets this game’s inclusivity of a variety of people and groups from other games is that it does so when it has a reason to and is still accurate to the time and setting. \n\nThat’s one of the main reasons why Battlefield 5 pissed me off so much. Instead of a British woman with a prosthetic arm wielding a cricket bat in WW2, why not include Lyudmila Pavlichenko, aka Lady Death, a female Russian sniper who had 309 confirmed kills? What about the French women who fought? They were in extremely small numbers, but they were a thing. Historically accurate inclusion is fucking awesome, and I love when games do it. But inclusivity for its own sake is terrible and it cheapens said character’s presence in the game’s setting. \n\nEven the DLC are fantastic. I remember how amazing I felt when the “for the Tsar” DLC came out and I first played it. I have never seen people fight so hard to the death in a video game without a whole lot of rage. It was amazing. I felt like I was part of the Russian revolution. Please do yourself a favor and buy this game.\n\n9/10\n\nOnly gave it a 9 ‘cause the 1 is already there…\n- This review only relates to the single player campaign. At 50 years old I have zero interest in multiplayer.\n\nAfter playing Gears of War 4, I was looking forward to this title. I wasn't disappointed. I found the new upgrade system with Jack enjoyable. The campaign was fun to play with minor exceptions. Graphics, sound, and voice acting were amazing. Campaign took me about 11 hours to beat. I consider that well worth the $60 I paid for the game.\n\nMy only real gripe about the single player campaign:  As a father of 3 girls, I'm all for strong female leading characters. Kait just isn't it, though. I didn't care for her in 4 and that didn't change in 5. For me she seems out of her league and just isn't believable as a team member. She's like Elizabeth Swan, the governor's daughter in Pirates of the Caribbean. She's a kidnapped damsel in distress in one movie, and the Pirate King in the next. It just doesn't work, for me anyway.\n- As a fan of Mimimi's Stealth Strategy Game,\nI love it so much, the operation system is getting smoother and more user-friendly comparing to Desperados III & Shadow Tactics.\nAlso I like how they added new elements to the game to make it more playable (E.g. Flexible team choice, character stories)\n\nThe only thing I don't like is the art.\nGame design is good but it'd be great if there's good looking characters...\n- The good news: you came out of cryogenic suspension in good health.\n\nThe bad news: you're critically low on supplies.\n\nThe good news: there are plenty of other vessels within range.\n\nThe bad news: they're all derelict.\n\nThe good news: you have a fleet of salvage drones you can send into the derelicts to gather supplies.\n\nThe bad news: your drones aren't the only things moving around those derelicts. And the other moving things are hostile. And the half-broken infrastructure on those derelicts is prone to fail explosively. And parts of your drones and your ship break too. And your only interaction with the outside world is with the drones. And your only interaction with the drones is through a clunky command-line interface. And you may be the last human alive anywhere. And if your drones die, you're next.\n\nSo on the balance, it's mostly bad news.\n- good game but later missions seem to be less polished ran in multiple bugs when playing as The Son enemies getting stuck in impossible to reach places and for some odd reason some characters have dog killing animations that for the most part are bugged and only work half the time causing an insta death and a retry don't even understand why later in the game you have to do animations to kill dogs as for basically the whole game you don't need to perform animations also seems to have some input lag throughout the whole game but overall its decent and when its on sale you should buy it.\n- solid proof that the story could be the absolute worst garbage imaginable but if the gameplay rules, it literally wont matter. the gameplay in this is bomb-diggity.\n- lmao they made tetris into a full blown religious experience\n- After playing the game for almost 10 hours which i know is not a lot but still i had a great time the story kept me hooked from start to finish and i was always excited to find out what was going to happen next. I loved the idea that you could choose to play as a ghost and never get detected or never kill anyone or just go for the high chaos im going to kill everyone playstyle and even know the ability to choose your playstyle is quite oftenly seen these days but back in 2012 it was quite inovative.\n\nGameplay:\nIt had great combat and stealth.(Not Suprising based on thre fact that your an assasin)\nStory was well how to put this \"A rollercoaster of emotion\" it keeps you hooked from start to finish and you will never want to stop playing until you finaly get to the end.\n\nReplay Value:\nNow this is a big one in my opinion because i like games that make you play for hours and hours and I would say that Dishonored has great replay value this is mainly due to the fact that there are a lot of different acheivements, ways to complete each mission, different magic paths and weapon paths that can only be be completed if you play the game again and if your not comftable with fully restarting you dont have to because once you finish the main storyline you unlock the option to play them over which is useful if you want to unlock some of the other acheivements for example Clean Hands to get this acheivement your not allowed to kill anyone in the whole story how you do this i have no idea but thats the reason this game has good replay value.\n\nDLC:\nEven though i do not own the DLC (i will be purchasing them soon) from my knowledge of the normal game and how great that was it would suprise me if the DLC was bad.\n\nIn conclusion i would highly reccomend this game to anyone who doenst already own it!\n\n- I like furry art, but first and foremost im a RPG gamer, and as such I will rend judgment impartially. \n\nThe story is not bad, but still falls in the average category and it is predictable, gameplay is the same as the first Fuga (I have no problems there) but there are few new enemies,  so the strategy to beat the regular battles is very repetitive. My biggest complain remains the same since Tail Concerto and it is the dificulty... which is way too easy, there is no hard / nightmare mode for veteran players, Im not asking to die repeatedly like in dark souls but Cyberconnect2 needs to understand some players like a challenge in their games.\n\nMusic is ok and Hack is the best character of the lot (Tah tah tah tah  taaah!!!!!) I would play Fuga 3 just for him.\n\nIt pains me to give the thumbs down, but Cyberconnect2 needs to work a little harder.\n- Go ahead and try to find something to criticize about this game. \n\nMaybe graphics scalability? Can you even be offended at that? The game does use polygonal graphics and what appears to be vertex lighting, but I think most integrated graphics chips can handle this amount of detail. Don't quote me on that one. Most systems out there can run this game no problem... If they are Windows systems.\n\nMaybe the friend requirement? Flipping through the manual yourself still provides an interesting experience. The entire game can be beaten with one person or with the participation of 20 or more people. How many games are like that?\n\nLack of voice chat feature? The game has full Steam support, making this a non-issue.\n\nLack of netcode? The design of the game makes this irrelevant. You don't even need an internet connection, but to initially download the game.\n\nFrustration? You can pick up or close the game at any time. Learning to play it without griping at others or being discouraged is probably good for your social health. It's far less frustrating or \"cheap\" than many modern games, too: bounding boxes in Dark Souls 2, spawns in flanking in Call of Duty, unreasonable level design in Hotline Miami 2. Bombs are self-contained puzzles and you lose only seconds if you make a mistake, not hours of effort. In fact, the more level-headed you are, the better you will be at the game.\n\nBrevity? This one I could see, but the main collection of bombs is only to introduce the mechanics and give some gimmicky setups in the first place. Once you complete it, you can free play whenever you want, as the design calls for well over 11^11 (that's about 2.9 * 10^11) variations. It's unlikely you will ever play the same bomb twice if your objective is variation.\n\nCost? It's $15 right now; if you go in with friends it's a drop in the bucket. I don't feel too bad about the development:cost differential, but I suppose that's up to personal preference.\n\nKeep Talking and Nobody explodes is an accessible, inexpensive, tightly designed game. Even if you've never played a party game or don't care for them, this one is a glimmering example. After hours of consideration, the only problem I can think of is that it seems to be Windows-only at the moment. Do you have Windows and some fraction of $15? Do you like fun games that reward skill, intelligence, and cooperation? If you said yes, it's time to buy.\n- I'm 45, I've had good times and bad times.  I've fallen in love, grown up, gotten married, beaten alcoholism, \nhad a child, fought off depression, led my wife through her kidney failure, carried the death of loved ones, and come back from the brink.  I've weathered the storm of life like anyone else . . . I'm not special.  I'm not rich, but comfortable, and I've gathered quite a steam library as a hobby over the last 10 years.  Something I have rarely done, during my time with almost 4000 titles, is write a review.  Two, maybe three for 4000 games.  Think about that for a second.\n\nI'm 45.  I just cried playing a video game, something I can't ever remember doing.  I feel like my heart is going to burst.  It's joy, and sadness.  It's like a good memory with a parent who's long gone, bubbled up at random, making you laugh and ache at the same time.  It's bittersweet.\n\nThe music and visuals are subtle and flashy at the same time, they get under you and lift you up.  It's got spirit of the 60's, the heart of the 80's, and feels like every memorable video game trope from the 2000's, with the social softness of the 2020's.  It's huge and tiny at the same time, and thoughtfull and meditative together . . . it tells the story of leaving your comfort zone, and makes you comfortable.  It's heavy and light.  It's all of these and more.\n\nMy emotions are a flood.  I had to write a review, and let people know how I feel.  I can't describe it, I feel like I found my heart again, and I didn't even know it was lost.  Life was comfortable before 2:00pm today . . . now it's magical.  It's these small things that I forget, and remember, and then forget again . . . the birth of my son, the feeling of nervous sweetness on my first date with my wife, an unexpected comment from a random stranger about my eyes, finding an old photo of my dad that no one ever remembered taking --\n\n-- This game is like that sweet, fleeting memory.\n\nTL;DR:  45-year old man cries after finding his heart lost in a game, and writes a review while his wife asks him if he's okay.\n\n11/10, would purchase these feels again.\n- When I say this game changed the way I thought about life, I mean it. And before you say this game isn't worth 44 dollars, you are wrong. I would pay more than double just for this once in a lifetime experience.\n\nWhile this game may look like a stupid bishoujo romance game, it is so much more. Don't let the weird artstyle or obnoxious eyes fool you, this game will make you laugh. cry, depressed, happy, and everything in between. It is so extensive, so great, that there are over 13 character routes and stories to play in this game, all of which are good (some are incredible) and have some of the best, most fleshed our characters I have seen. This game is about life, change, friends, love, and most importantly, family. Every route in this game has a connection to family. (Clannad is a close-enough translation of family in Irish)\n\nIn case it helps, I'm a grown man who had a rather negative outlook on life, and this game me cry buckets. If you ever have thought about getting married and having kids, this game will MAKE you want to have a family. The clever writing and how the protagonist, Okazaki, changes throughout his life is all done so well. It made me realize how much we complain about our lives, but we don't need much to be happy or be motivated. In case it helps again, my mom loves this game, she connects with it quite a bit. Yet again, nothing bad to say here, only to say that Key is incredible and I will be reading some of their other works like Little Busters and Kanon.\n- One of the best most fun and addicting all-time games. However, the plants should be nazi's and the zombies should be jews. There is also a hispanic snail in your garden that sleeps on the job.\n- This is somehow the only game where you can play as an anti-fascist faction in Nazi Germany, drive the Nazis into the ocean, kill Hitler and reclaim Germany as a democracy, and that's somehow the most boring possible outcome.\n- PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE VENTURING INTO 999!\n\n\n\nI refunded the game thinking they removed so much of the narrative but I was wrong, the game has now 2 different types of screens, the \"ADV screen\" and the \"Novel screen\". Make sure you switch to \"Novel screen\" as soon as you start playing and stay on that screen as the \"ADV screen\" only displays dialogue and NOTHING ELSE, if you stay on this screen you'll miss all the extra bits that can help to figure out certain details that allow you to find all the endings and figure out the entire story top to bottom.\nHappy gaming.\n\nEDIT: @Snivader pointed out my mistake, edited the review.\n\n\n\nExtra small tip to help you through your journey. Take a notepad (or anything you can scribble down onto), and write down key dates / codes / people that you encounter through the game and keep them close while playing the entire trilogy. I can guarantee you that your mind will be blown by the end of the trilogy (provided you can keep up with the weird events that go down in these games).\n- Red Matter 2 sets a new bar for VR mystery/suspense/story based games. I've thought about reaching out to the developer and thanking them it's that good. If you're a space lover like me, DON'T MISS THIS! Some very memorable moments in this, and the graphics are even better than Alyx sometimes. The music also is well done. Just enough to give you some atmosphere, but not overdone. If you also played the original this is worth getting for a continuation of the original story too. Very little is re-hashed so you've got to pay some attention to succeed. This also gets fairly creepy, more than the original, so if you're averse to horror games, this may not be for you. All in all, as I just finished this days ago, I'm still fairly blown away at how good it was. The developer has really found their niche. Still getting chills from the ending of this.\n- Most stable game I ever played?\nPlayed multiplayer with 3 ppl living across the world from me, \nnever desynch, never a lag, never any issue at all except some very very minor stuff.\n\nMasterful really, well done.\nGREAT GAME TOO!\n- A forward-hurtling psychedelic tube shooter with a tremendous sense of speed and odd, zen relaxation. The closest thing I have to compare it to is probably [i]Rez[/i]: if you liked that, definitely give this a whirl.\n\nConversions of arcade classics and legends are commonplace. But an arcade [i]myth?[/i] Only one springs to mind: [b]POLYBIUS[/b]. There one minute and gone the next, so they say - an enigmatic arcade cabinet installed and removed by mysterious men in black: rumours of people hooked to the screen and unable to remember or communicate what they saw afterwards, save for that it was immersive, fast, colourful, and strangely hypnotic. A fly-by-night company that went out of business? A government mind control experiment? Probably not, no. A hoax. An urban legend. A myth.\n\nBut a myth was all Jeff Minter needed. If you're previously unfamiliar with Jeff Minter and his stable Llamasoft, he's been creating weird arcade-inspired games and \"lightsynths\" (as in, the inspiration for Milkdrop and other music visualisers) out of a barn in Wales since the 1980s. His creations are marked by being fast, psychedelic, and strangely sheep-themed, generally in search of the kind of gameplay that invites the player to get \"in the zone\". And so it is here.\n\nIn search of a new original creation, he turned his mind to the arcade legend Polybius as inspiration, and his interpretation is oddly faithful:[list]\n[*]Immersive: it supports VR if you have it, wrapping you into the game world - it draws you into the screen even if you don't.\n[*]Fast: capable of and designed for very high-refresh rates if you can support them.\n[*]Colourful: look at the screenshots, you get the idea.\n[*]Hypnotic: hurtling forwards shooting abstract things in tunnel patterns seems like it would be intense, and it is, but - [i]Relax. Just look at the centre of the screen as you move forward. Go through the horns. Let it take you[/i].[/list]\n\nOnce you get the hang of it and start relaxing into it and getting into that sense of flow, it's curiously calming. I can see myself bringing this out for a quick session after a stressful day: it's particularly good to dip into. Long sessions might result in seeing patterns on the walls, Tetris-style.\n\nIt's not for everyone: Minter's games never have been. In particular, you may wish to skip this one if you have sensory conditions that make you susceptible to motion sickness, or photosensitive epilepsy.\n\nGood music too, and doesn't need high specs either. Recommended.\n- You had me at creating adventure log, well actually no, at the starting song perhaps. How many years have I been waiting for full fledge, non portable DQ since DQVIII in PS2 ?\n\nThis PC port is a great one, neat and very beautiful. I was playing at 4k/~30fps and since my GPU is not fast enough I switched to 1440p/~50-60fps instead. I wish more and more JRPGs to do PC concurrent launch like this one. A day later I switched back to 4k and change internal resolution to 80% then it was pretty much perfect.\n\n- You can choose default A/B button.\n- You can choose resolution and 30/60 FPS mode. There is a way to unlock 60+ FPS for gaming monitors, google it.\n- You can invert cameras both ways.\n- You can choose classic battle mode.\n- You can press L3 and enjoy the view.\n- Load time is non-existence with SSD.\n- Ultra Widescreen is NOT supported. Waiting for mods at the moment.\n- Keyboard and Mouse is fine but playing with controller is wayy better.\n- Fully customisable keys / controllers.\n- Story synopsys at game loading screen.\n- Silent Protagonist.\n- Full voice cutscenes.\n- Auto-run button.\n- You can jump.\n- An interesting experience for RPGMaker vidya enthusiasts.\n\nBefore you pick up this title, be sure to download and play the demo, as the demo is the (free) first episode of the series, this game being the second episode.\n\nA Psychological Thriller, as stated in the description, is probably the best way to describe this series, an adventure through bizzare yet oddly pretty settings.\n\nThe first episode is quite a fun, humorous adventure, but still manages to be gripping and gut-wrenching in some areas. Difficult for me to describe in words, but it's free, so there's no reason not to play it.\n\nThe second episode strays from the fun, humorous side of things and focuses more on story, an unexpected yet completely welcome change of tone. If you enjoyed the first and got to like the characters, the second episode is well worth the price.\n\nFeel free to pick it up if it seems interesting to you.\n- For every like this review gets, I will consume 1 spoonful of mayonnaise\n- I waited 12+ years for a proper sequel to A Crack in Time (yes i know the other games came out but tbh they didn't do much for me) for it only to come out for the PS5. Unfortunately, I wasn't getting a new console for just one game. \n\nNow, two years later I'm playing it on the PC.  While surreal, I am super glad they ported this series to a different platform, and the game was totally worth the wait.\n\nThe port by Nixxes ran very nice for me. I had a few hitches in the dimensional portal scenes, and one crash in a total of 12hrs of playtime. I do understand that some people are having issues and that does suck & does not disqualify their experiences, however, It is not even close to how bad TLOU Pt.1's port was.  \n\nIt's another Insomniac banger, and if you've played any of their games you already know whats up. I beat the game in 12 hrs on the 2nd to last difficulty grabbing whatever side content/collectibles I could before the story captivated me. As is tradition, there is a NG+ mode (haven't touched yet) and I look forward to trying it. I'll probably update the review at that point, but the games are always repayable due to their collect-a-thon nature, that and being so damn fun you have a dumb ear-to-ear smile for all of the playtime.  \n \nIf you enjoyed the Ratchet and Clank games in the past, its way more of that + the dimensional gimmick which is really well done and very neat tech wise. I love the new movement features and Rivet is a very good addition to the cast. I hope she stays relevant in the story in the future. Game feels super good to play as well, weapons are great as always. The writing is still funny and enjoyable. It's just a good time, and I highly recommend it, even at full price.\n\nLastly, I would like to direct a message to Sony/PS Studios/Insomniac Games:\nPLEASE PORT THE OTHER AND OLDER R&C GAMES PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE IPELASE PLs I WILL PAY $70\n- WARNING. This game is pure drug. Don't buy unless You have no kids, no wife and You have a lot free time. I mean thousands of hours.\n\nYour brain will turn into a machine calculating the optimal use of all available resources on the map, there are hundreds of them and each discovery brings new threats from the beautiful mother nature. At some point You may experience unexpected dreams about high tech and well tuned factories.\n\nEarly Access in this case means something similar to never ending story. When You think \"I have done everything\" new update shows up and You're starting doing mess again.\n\nI can only have reservations about the multiplayer mode, where there are funny glitches, disappearing objects, self-propelled vehicles, lack of character synchronization, etc. However, this does not prevent having continuous fun in the co-op mode.\n\nI hope You like it so much as I did.\n\nEDIT: Still thinking of buying it? Don't think, just do it. U8 changed a lot, it's now Unreal Engine 5 with Lumen effects, devs are pushing forward to get final product release. Join the party!\n- if we showed this to senators in the 90's video games would be banned today\n- Play this game in roguelike mode (no extra lives) as that seems to be how it was designed. By letting objects of the same type touch each other you will be able to deal damage to or destroy them all with one move! Attacking enemies will damage you back so you have to use potions that also drop down to heal.\n\nI see some of the reviews here saying this game sucks and it's all randomness. It's a roguelike though, so there is a good deal of randomness but the fun comes from gaining skill with the mechanics and making the right decisions. If you can carve out lone pieces and allow a bunch of the same object to get into a big cluster, popping that huge chain is super satisfying. \n\nThe game was very intimidating at first and I would die in the first 2 stages over and over, but I eventually got the hang of things and beat the game for the first time pretty quickly. This game requires patience to get a hang of the mechanics but once you do it's a fun little time waster to open up every once in a while. There are lots of characters to unlock too and they all bring their own strategies to the table.\n- [h1] Look at my hours real quick. That's about. 4 hours? [/h1]\n\nFallout 76 is boring. There's no other way to put it. The Core objective of Fallout 76 was to gear the Fallout 4 engine for multiplayer. They succeeded! The art is visually amazing, even down to the 2D art shown all over this store page, so what's wrong?\n\nConsider who's still playing this game. Who's desperate enough to play this game? Well, It's not a lot of people. And they aren't very good people. It's just people. Existing. I had 0 conversations during my 4 hours. \n\nLets talk playing. The game is boring. Since I just mentioned the objective, lets talk about the NPC's ETC. [b] I got this game for free, I cannot emphasize how little this game means to me. It's terrible. [/b] The NPC's & story were not part of core development therefore the game suffers. You get stuck doing some quests you don't care about and play a game you'd rather not play. The NPC's are essential as expected so, you cannot kill them either. \n\nMicrotransactions Via Atomic Shop & Premium plague the game [i] but lets talk about more! [/i] There's free events like a crate dropping & player trading outposts. Wanna know what's wrong here? The game boils down to, find a player trading outpost and buy sh*t, or just dropping crates? well the crates are full of nothing. the games gear-towards premium really gives you nothing in terms of loot so you're playing what is a hollow, unfinished, boring, game. Even in 2021! \n\nCreatures & enemies are cool however there's a big issue of the game not being cool. You may say its worth it to play just to engage the wild-life but even they feel soul-less and void of life. I don't know how you make a game so devoid of soul really. I've met mannequins with more personality than anything I met in Fallout 76. \n\nThe world isn't interesting, it's a barren void forestry area. Sometimes you get a tiny bit of quest, however aside from this game being a complete and utter lore-destroyer for those interested, what it does leave is not good enough to compensate for all of the cons. Honestly, if this was a mod for 4, I'd feel better. But even when getting this for free, I feel scammed.\n\n[b] I'll end this by repeating my hours. 4. At no point was I excited. Enthralled. Interested. I sat for 4 hours, wanting to tear my hair out and scream, because I was so bored. I had tests in school, more interesting than this. The entire 4 hours I spent playing, I wish I had played anything else, & I got this for free! I genuinely wish you the best of help if you end up buying this game. It's horrific. [/b]\n- DO NOT LET OTHERS FOOL YOU!.\n\nI have been playing Souls games since before there were souls games.\n\nThe remaster of DS1 is not perfect. But it is a very good way to play the game again with new or even old friends who also love the franchise.\n\nMy current PC specs are:\ni5-6500\nGTX1060 3gb\n24g DDR4\nAsus Maximus Hero 8 mobo\n\nI get a constant 60fps while in 2k resolution in EVERY ZONE of the game. No dips, no stuttering, no tearing.\nThere are some misaligned textures in spots but it is nothing you will see unless you know where to look.\n\nHave yet to run into any cheaters!. \n\nFUN FACT!: If you know of any of the more \"well known\" cheaters?, goto their steam profile and block all communications. It will not allow them to join into your world as the game runs on steam's client servers.\n\nIf you love the souls games. If you already own DS1?, IT IS WORTH the $25 dollars (CAD) to experience it all again and this time with friends and better fps!.\n- Great story, great features. But in my honest opinion unless your going for a nostalgia trip, give it a pass. The gun play and AI alone is enough for me to justify a refund, I mean shit cops hear the sounds of gunshots right next to them and act like nothing is happening. Immersion 0/10 sorry. I must admit I really enjoyed this game on console, but I am gonna have to take the money and run. Notice how almost all of the reviews just say All YOU haD to do Was FoLlow The DAmn Train cj or Ill HAve TWo NumBER 9s. I cant say I didn't expect this game to be a little shit judging by how old it is, but I will NOT suck it off and say buy it, the actual game play is PATHETIC. In all honesty I think this game remastered with gta v's physics and polish would be SOOO much better than gta v. They really captured the hood life in this one, damn shame it fucking sucks. This game's age sadly isn't up to par and sadly, it's getting a fat thumbs down from this boomer.\n- Classic Mortal Kombat with modern-day graphics & extra mechanics.\nA Fun Educational Game For learning more about the inner workings of the Human Body and Skeletal system.\nfamily friendly pg clean game for children!\n\nHere Is How To Fix The Crashing Problem! \n< Go to your library, click on MKX.\n> Locate the part that says \"DLC\", it should be right below the achievements.\n< You'll see Install pack 1 through 20 something.\n> Select all of them and they will begin to install manually.\n\nhope you enjoy playing.\nGood Luck🌹\n7.5/10\n- I came across Dreamscaper after playing 200 hours of Hades. I was looking for similar games that could recapture some of the magic of discovery and progression that made Hades such a delightful experience.\n\nDreamscaper is not Hades. There probably isn't any game that can measure up to the experience of playing Hades, and there probably won't be for a long while. But a lot of the same elements are there, and I did really enjoy Dreamscaper for what it was.\n\nThe \"story\" in Dreamscaper is more of a personal journey. There aren't really \"events occurring\" so much as a character working through her issues. The supporting characters are fairly interesting, though not quite on par with the literally larger-than-life dynamic personalities of Hades. But to be fair, the characters in Dreamscaper are ordinary folks, not mythological deities.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the game is \"nostalgic.\" It's an exploration of the protagonist's childhood memories, so that makes sense. There is a very different energy here than Hades' cheeky and horny angst. It's more sad and calm.\n\nIn terms of the feel of playing the game, Dreamscaper has a lot of similarities to Hades. There is a varied arsenal of different weapons and abilities, progression through randomized levels with boss fights, a wide selection of permanent character upgrades to purchase using resources gathered during runs, a relationship system to grow closer with the characters, etc. Unlike Hades, every aspect of your loadout can change throughout a run: you can swap out weapons and abilities as you encounter new and better ones along the way. It's both more flexible than Hades and less; you're not locked in to one weapon for the entire run, and there are many more weapons and abilities (and combinations thereof); but with more randomness comes less control, so it's a lot harder to craft and hone a particular build in Dreamscaper than in Hades. A lot of the \"builds\" are elemental damage modifiers, in which all you're trying to do is find a bunch of gear that (say) deals Lightning damage or increases your Lightning damage dealt. The upgrades are largely \"number get bigger,\" and while it can be satisfying to get a bunch of cool multipliers, it does feel less \"combo\"y or \"breakable\" than Hades (though there are certainly some very powerful and broken-feeling builds you can end up with).\n\nThe gameplay is challenging, like Hades, though perhaps slightly less. Like Hades, a lot of your ability to clear rooms and defeat bosses effectively comes from learning their attack patterns and timings. I do wish there were more variety to the enemies, as many of them are just \"the guy from the last level but he is stronger and has more abilities now\" (though that criticism applies to Hades as well). The boss fights are by and large much easier once you learn their patterns, though there are still a few that can be tough for certain builds. The \"hard version\" of bosses are definitely a force to be reckoned with, though.\n\nThe art and music are attractive and inviting. It's much more The Sims than Guilty Gear, but in a way that fits the atmosphere nicely. It's stylized in a very different way than Hades, but it works in its own way.\n\nThe developers are also very community-oriented and are responsive to community input through their Discord. The Hades developers probably are too, but I have no direct experience interacting with them.\n\nSo in conclusion, if you liked Hades because of its horny angst, badass metal riffs, mythological themes, and bloody humor, you may not have much interest in Dreamscaper. But if you liked Hades because of its randomized runs, variety of weapons and builds, feeling of progression, challenging boss fights, and dynamic cast of characters with complicated relationships, then you should absolutely pick up Dreamscaper. And if you didn't like Hades, then you probably stopped reading this review after the first paragraph.\n- [h1]Old, but has massive depth of content // Recommended for immersive role-players[/h1]\n\n+ Combat in general, and melee combat in particular, is very polished and open for an older title; everything can be controlled, such as directional blocking, without overcomplicating the mechanics involved\n+ Character creation is meticulously in-depth; initial backstory creation works seamlessly with selection of primary attributes in a way that makes the final product always feel refreshingly unique\n+ 'Story' is about as open-ended as can be, to the point where the game essentially has no story, and is something of a thirteenth century sand-box title; the player has complete, unadulterated freedom\n+ The game encourages the player to recruit and build a personal army as he/she progresses, and the mechanics put in place for doing so are well-rounded and complex\n+ Extremely easy and satisfying to mod; highly recommended\n+ Sorting and commanding one's troops is key, and the player would do well to benefit fromt he excellent command mechanics of the game; strategy is massively important and competently implemented\n+ Economics of the game add another layer of challenge to the game; trade and balancing one's income against one's expenses are both crucial elements to consider\n+ Multiplayer is fairly standard, run-of-the-mill stuff, but it's still densely populated and everything seems to connect well; the charm of the game, and its solid combat system, keep the players coming back in droves after more than five years\n\n- Politics, which are interesting and engaging in scope, end up being a somewhat weaker feature in practice, as NPCs are largely static during negotiations; this does break the immersion slightly, as it seems that your successes are based purely on stats, and not on the actual implications of one's choices\n- Quests often become tedious and repetitive\n- Tutorial is underwheling and largely insufficient to introduce the more in-depth mechanics that will be used outside of combat\n- Visuals are outdated and didn't stand well the test of time; even for the year of release, the textures and polygon counts are well below par\n\n[h1]LockeProposal's Big Day Out[/h1]\n\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/bigdayout#]Community Group[/url]\n[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/7611703/]Curator Page[/url]\n[url=https://www.reddit.com/r/SeriousSteamReviews/]Serious Steam Reviews subReddit[/url]\n- This game is like cocaine. \nI always tell myself just one more, then im done. I'll do homework. I'll sleep. I'll eat something. \nBut you know what? That last death was cheap, I'll do one more to make up for it. I just need 1000 gold for that upgrade, I'll just do one more to get it. Always just one more. \n\nThings I like:\n\n+Strong RPG Progression - Gold from your run can be spent on stats, equipment, abilities, etc. making multiple runs and longer runs more rewarding.\n\n+The game is witty and has flavor. -- there are various conditions your new characters can have such as being blind, gay or having a fear of chickens, amongst many, many others. Dying is in this sense, pretty fun. The writing has a lot of charm!\n\n+The controls are very tight -- this game has good controls. It's easy to do what you want, which is good because it's very tough and you will die a lot.\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n- The bosses in new game plus don't get harder -- As you progress into new game + or ++ or +++ and beyond, the bosses don't scale well, despite the general enemies leveling up to basically become bosses themselves. Not a huge deal, but it's the only negative I have.\n\nThen at some point you realize you've beaten the game, Thankfully there is a new game plus.\nMaybe just one more playthrough...\n- Not For Broadcast is in the simplest of terms, a multi-tasking simulator.\n\nYou sit in a news control room and you have to keep track of multiple things: censoring curse words, switching between cameras, playing ads at the right time, ensuring your broadcast frequency isn't disrupted, as well as keeping an eye out for a bunch of other strange things that appear later in the game.\n\nThis isn't the easiest of games as it requires a good deal of attentiveness. The description isn't joking when they call this \"high-pressure\". You have to rely heavily on both audio and visual cues to make sure your broadcast doesn't get screwed up. As this is the news (and live), there is no rewind or undo button. If you mess up and want to get a good performance grade, you'll need to redo the entire news segment. \nIf you're a perfectionist like me, a 10 min segment can end up turning into an hour of trying to perfect that news segment. As such, I do hope an option to quick save, or at the very least, save and quit, can later be put into the game. It felt rather taxing having to keep an eye on so many things for so long. But as with any game, excellence isn't an art, it's a habit. You'll find yourself turning into a multitasking expert eventually.\n\nThankfully, the actors in the game do a great job of making the experience an entertaining one. There is a good amount of humour written into each broadcast, although I must admit I wasn't quite able to pay attention to all the dialogue, as I was too busy trying to switch to the right cameras whilst ensuring my electricity didn't get cut out. Luckily, the game does have an archive which allows you to playback the broadcasts. Without that, I'd probably be missing out on 70% of what was going on.\n\nThere is also a text narrative, choices matter portion in between news segments. As of now, it feels a little out of place and incomplete, but then again, this is an Early Access review.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that at the time of writing this review, there isn't really any \"propaganda\" aspect to the game yet.\n\nPerformance-wise, the game runs pretty smoothly. I did encounter occasional crashes if I looked left or right and back and forth too quickly, but other than that, the game is pretty much bug-free. Also, this game has my RTX 2070 Super running at rather high temps for some reason. Rather surprising for a game that doesn't appear to have particularly high-end graphics.\n\nAnyway, I'll be looking forward to see what comes next for this game. Definitely worth the buy despite being Early Access.\n- the game itself is pretty ok and fun for what it is, and runs great on deck. but man, F**K THE ALWAYS-ONLINE-DRM WHICH AT TIMES TAKES AGES TO CONNECT, GETTING THE GAME STUCK IN THE MENU WITH NOTHING TO DO!!\n\n>> Update after 20h played:\nI really enjoy playing the game. It is good, it is fun and runs great on the Steam Deck, which is especially important to me, as I tend to travel a lot as part of my job.\n\nThat being said, however, is core of the issue: The Always-On-DRM actually prevents me from playing this game on the go. Having this sort of DRM is, in my opinion, only predatory and inexcusable in any way. I get that the online-components of the game will not work when I am on the move, but I am mainly interested in the single player experience, from which I am also locked out. I am even locked out of the main menu without a stable internet collection, which is just ridiculous.\n- First of all, I really like the Game, it's Gameplay is wonderful and i really enjoy the parkour to combat mix in it. Although i noticed a lot of bugs especially in COOP i still enjoy logging on the game.\n\nThe Story is good but doesn't need a upgrade in my opinion. I like that certain map changes and Story decisions are dependant on some side quests and on each other.\n\nNow to the sad part:\n\nTencent recently bought Techland which was controversial at first, but then DL points were added which made a lot of people mad at Tencent and partially Techland, understandably.\nThey Including me don't want the game to die out because a greedy company wants to make some quick buck.\n\nAlthough i have to say myself, other Tencent bought games still are quite enjoyable.\n\nI just hope that Techland does the right thing in future and makes the current state of DL points less predatory and more Cosmetic based pure.\n\nIn it current state we still have no knifes without Bundles, but that was before Tencent so the blame for that goes to Techland, but i am excited for future updates and playing Dying light 2, even without buying DL points :)\n\nI'll give this game a solid 7/10 for the bugs, microtransactions but also because it has good gameplay and community reach\n\n(I have edited my original negative review about the pure rant about DL points because i also wanted to consider current gameplay and more)\n- Hi dev, if you were wondering whether anyone would actually use your HDR feature, I am. thanks\n- I played this game because I had a very strained relationship with my mother somewhere along my teenage years and in the end it came to be that we never saw each other anymore, nor had anymore contact as well. I decided to give this game a try because I wanted to feel what was like to have that bubbly bond between a mother and son again, back when I was younger. \n\nWell, it gave those feelings back to me, and it gave it like a sucker punch to the guts. \n\nI still listen to the OST from time to time and it still reminds me of times of childhood back before when everything became so terrifying.\n\nGive your mother a hug or a call at least if you can before you can never anymore.\n- Alpha, Beta, Finished Product... I hear lots of Blah blah blahs complaining about this game not being out of Alpha after years and years, but it isn't like we've been paying a monthly fee for it.  I paid one time to support this game and I've got years of play out of a product that I enjoy.  There aren't too many games that scratch an itch like this game for me... Open World, completely editable/buildable environment and zombies!  One of my biggest issues with a game that I like is that after I buy it, they release a few DLCs and then move on to their next product.  Alpha, Beta, Finished or Not... the developers have given me years of standing by their product and many updates with new content and mechanics.  For that alone, I love their game!\n\nGraphics: 3 outta 5 graphics, she looks a little dated but they keep updating it... It looks better than it originally did.  There's growth\nReplayability: 5 outta 5\nGameplay:3 outta 5... sometimes she's a little clunky\n\nI definitely still believe that this game is worth buying and that they devs and their product is worth supporting.  Hopefully this is helpful to someone.\n- Oh boy. This is a beautiful game. There's unlockable items, a hidden boss, lots of enemies, and characters that change your play styles. Numerous ways to make the game accessible for you!\n\nBut is the game fun? I'd say no, the game was just ok. I wasn't really solving puzzles so much dealing with a RNG generator. Ironically the bosses felt slower and more boring than the levels, they are a battle of patience, wait until the potions fall - hit them 3 or 4 times - repeat.\n\nWould I revisit this game after some patches or dlc? No, probably not. Unfortunately I think this game has some base design problems and not content or quality problems.\n- No matter what the reviews say, this game is pretty excellent.\nGameplay wise its pretty good, the match 3 systems are fun and almost exciting to play at times.\nTheres no sex, which isn't a bad thing as if thats what you're looking for just search for it online lol\nThe stories are good and the designs are pretty, sure it's short but it fits the pricepoint.\n\nThe developers have announced that they've gone bankrupt which is a shame but what can you do.\n\nOverall 8/10\n- Do yourself a favor if you get eye-strain or nauseated from the forced motion blur and/or the chromatic aberration and go to %appdata%/Local/FinchGame/Saved/Config/WindowsNoEditor and open the \"Engine.ini\" file and copy in the following:\n\n[/Script/Engine.RendererSettings]\nr.SceneColorFringe.Max=0\nr.DefaultFeature.MotionBlur=0\n\nThis will disable both effects which in my case completely removed any strain I was having.\n- Love Anemone\nLove Cal\nLove Tangent\nLove Dys\nLove Marz\nLove Tammy\nLove Sym\nLove Nomi\nLove Rex\nWe don't talk about Vace\n- Stephen's Sausage Roll is a game that the developer doesn't want normal people to buy, it seems. The description is literally, \"A simple 3d puzzle game.\", there is one video that shows you nothing about the game, and it's priced at $32 CND.\n\nFortunately, I'm here to tell you to get off your ass and to buy this wonderful game. The graphics are alright, the music is OK, but the puzzles are sublime.\n\nIn each level, the goal is the same: cook all the sausages and exit the level by standing on the exit level sign in the right orientation. You cook sausages by pushing them over a grill. Like in sokoban games, you can't pull the sausage (yet...), only push it. Another huge wrinkle is that sides of the sausage can only touch the grill once. If you touch a cooked side of a sausage to the grill, it will be burned and you fail the level. This little wrinkle will make you pull your hair out in some levels as you try and figure out how the hell you are going to maneuver the sausages around so they get cooked properly. A neat thing about the game is that if you fail, you can still continue playing the level, which might help you figure out how to play it.\n\nYou'll have a section (part of an island) that has a number of puzzles for you to solve in any order, so if you get stuck, you can try another one (until you get to the last puzzle of the section). Once you complete a section, a new section will open up with more puzzles.\n\nYour little guy has tank controls, which you will find extremely useful, as turning to the left or right near a sausage will push it in different directions. A nice detail is that the all of the puzzles make up the island section. When you activate a puzzle, the rest of the island drops away into the sea, leaving you on a tiny puzzle island.\n\nEach section introduces new mechanics into the game. First you'll just be pushing the sausages, but then you'll be stacking them, skewering them (you would think this would make things easier, but no! You can't turn when you have a skewered sausage!), walking on them...\n\nI would say that these levels are on the level of Snakebird, though I found many of them easier than Snakebird's puzzles (maybe I'm better at sokoban games than I know?). These are the kind of puzzles that you walk away from frustrated, but come back to a few hours later with the solution. This is the game where there are so many ah-ha! moments that make you feel smart. You have no idea what to do at first, but eventually you get better and better. You might not see solutions at first, but you begin to see where you need to go to solve the puzzle, and then work backwards from there. It's wonderful!\n\nIf you're having trouble, there's a community guide that has all the solutions, which is super helpful (though not as much when I was playing because it wasn't complete!).\n\nIt might be expensive, but I took 36 hours to solve all the puzzles and it was worth every penny.\n- Early review right now after a quick hour of play.\n\nLater Alligator (and I swear I'm not biased towards this game at all) is a gorgeously 2d-animated, primarily point-and-click, cartoony romp through Alligator New York City. Everyone's alligators. The gameplay itself is simplistic; unlike normal point-and-click games of this style that you might have come to expect, there's no picking up items, there's no real big decision making. It crosses over more with Professor Layton-style gameplay, wandering around the city and picking up little collectibles by clicking on various pieces of the environment.\n\nScattered in between these are a plentiful trove of minigames in all sorts of styles. As far as I can tell, they begin to increase in complexity the further you go through (for reference, the first minigame is pretty much not fail-able; you're asked to track a Queen in 3 Card Monte, however the hapless alligator running the game barely moves the cards and flails on the two that *aren't* the queen.)\n\nHowever, it seems that the gameplay and the minigames are meant more as a vehicle for the whimsical comedy of the writing and the eclectic cast of characters present throughout the city. Each character is quirky and fun in their own way, with their own little story. And that's the real draw of this game. \n\nSo this game so far doesn't particularly lend itself to anyone looking to challenge themselves. But if you just want some good feelings, a laugh, and a spot of relaxation, Later Alligator delivers in spades.\n- 3 things:\n\n-Flatten land\n\n-Click citadel to get warriors\n\n-Click warriors at their warriors\n\nGood job, you've just mastered the entire game.\n\nThe game includes such crazy moments as:\n\n-Flattening land\n\n-Seeing the enemy flatten land\n\n-flattening your land faster\n\n-Clicking trees and rocks since your workers can't do shit\n\n-Clicking your warriors into their town\n\n-Watching your warriors fight their warriors\n\n-Accidentliy Alt+Tabing and having the game get stuck in windowed mode\n\n10/10 Would trust Peter Moloneux and be dissapointed again... apparently.\n\nProtip, send this to someone that loves you and watch them try to pretend that they enjoy it.\n- In my personal opinion,Total War Warhammer 3 is better than its predecessor in every way.\n\nFactions:\nThey did an excellent job t fine tuning the older factions to the point where every faction now feels fully fleshed out and playable. The starting units are fun and the starting areas are usually in a better position. Sure, some factions start off in a really awkward ass places with really strong armies surrounding them, but overall, everything feels much more thought out.\n\nThe new factions they added to this game are fun altho for someone who might be just getting into the game, id recommend going with someone like Grand Cathay and move on from there.\n\nMap:\nThe world map is huge and i love it. The battle fields you fight in are detailed and look absolutely stunning. Fights look like movies sometimes so grab some popcorn and watch your armies die since you were munching on popcorn and not moving your units.\n\nRTS:\nthe RTS side of this game is what got the biggest improvement in my opinion. Everything is so much more clear and the battles just look insanely good. The game feels a bit more fast phase which i don't mind at all since WH2 felt like a battle of attrition sometimes and missile infantry seemed really bad.\n\nOverall i can safely say this i my favorite game currently. The multiplayer is super fun but judging by the reviews some of you leave on this game, its safe to say you have no friends to play with. \n\nDLC might cost bit more than it used to but people will complain about anything if its not free.\n- I have always wanted to play Resdient Evil 4, and I wanted to play this game so badly.  I am giving a negative review simply because the games FPS on the PC are bad, that could be because of Windows 10 because I heared rumors that the game does not run well on it and such, so that could be the problem.   Another problem I faced is the lip sync is dealyed when it's on the cutscenes so that makes everything slow and such.  The gameplay from what I seen however is pretty great and I think Resdient Evil 4 is a great game, but this port is not, get it for the GC, Will, PS2, or any of the consloes that has this game.\n- Okay so first and foremost the reason why I'm giving this a thumbs up is simple. The game does what it set out to do perfectly. Because of that I have no complaints about it's style.\n\nHOWEVER.\n\nI personally do not like the game. It is my own personal hangup. But I can understand why other people will enjoy it.\n\nThe game is fast paced, level by level FPS with challenges. Almost every single one of them is timed if not all of them are timed. It's similar to Doom or Killing Floor. Only there are no cusomizations implemented at time of play. \n\nThe game is challenging and offers you many different faucets on those challenges. It has different gun types for different enemies, different strategies and all of them complicated and challenging. But that's the point right?\n\nRegardless, the game was pretty fun and if you're looking for a level by level challenge system set to a similar style of Doom then you might just enjoy this game.\n\nIf this wasn't enough for you then please check out the video on my YouTube Channel for a more precise in depth explanation (link below).\n\nThanks for reading and I hope I helped some of you out there to spend your money wisely.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXiok7bhPdY\n- I knew Journey is a great game,maybe one of the best video games in history,but...\n\nI didn't know why so many people moved by such a simple gameplay.\nI didn't know why people had a Journey-Fever,even players just bought PS3 only for this game.\nI didn't know how close a relationship could be in 100mins only.\nI didn't know how bad i wished to go back to the peak and stay with my friend i'll never meet again.\n\nNow I Know.\n\n“It is better to walk with a friend in the dark than alone in the light” – Helen Keller\n\nIt was an interesting experience for me, I had never played this game nor heard of it until recently. I went and looked at the store page, My Brother/Friend Ethan-Winters Just Told Me this game in the steam store now, so went ahead and bought it. After buying it, went and started up the game some day later. Went into the game, saw another model character that looks like mine, I thought it was an AI because I had thought it was a single player game. So I decided to play along with it, we went through the story, it progressed quite fast, mainly because we both did not really bother to check out other things. The more I played, the more I realized that the guy I was playing with was most definitely not an AI, it was a genuine player. As we went through the story, our cooperation got smoother, we no longer have a solo player attitude, we would signal to each other, wait for each other and walked, fly with each other. It was smoothing, relaxing, a truly unique experience. Even with the setbacks we had throughout our progression, we never gave up, we stuck together from the desert till the end, when one of us screwed up, we patiently waited for the other, chiming to the person where we are. I remember at the end, when i screwed up a jump and did not see the other player, I was genuinely scared, sad, I frantically searched for the person but to no avail. I was distraught, sad and disappointed but I continued onward. When I went up, there he was, chiming for me, assuring me that he had not left yet. I felt happy, comforted when I saw the person waiting for me and together we finished the story. I am not one to do reviews, but it was such a unique experience among my years of gaming that I had to share it. Thank you, punks for the experience, truly thank you. And thank you, for bothering to read my review.\n\ni'll never forget our journey kind stranger.\n\nThis wasn't a game, it was an experience. I highly recommend you do this.\n- [h1]One of the few multiplayer games that reminds me that people can be amazing[/h1]\n\nI've been playing games for a long time, I've seen some sh*t. I've seen people crumble, I've lost friends, I've watched people eat each other even when they are winning. When people are supposed to be working together and yet they would rather treat their ally like trash because they refuse to take the blame for their own wrongdoing.\n\nSquad is a game in which I have seen true potential. A group of 40 individuals work together to plan, execute, and accomplish masterful plans to outsmart their enemy. I've seen teams rally from the depths of defeat and flip unwinable games into incredible victories. Heros emerging from the storm of mortars landing upon their bunker, to squad leaders risking their own lives to save those of their squad.\n\nSquad is not a game for the light hearted. To enjoy squad to the fulllest, you must communicate, work together, and form a bond with the soldiers at your side. You are a team, you are a unit, and you will never win alone. Be it a medic patching the wounds of your comrades, a logistics driver supplying your team with the supplies they need at the front line, or a squad leader putting the responsibility of 8 individuals on your shoulders, each person is a vital component of the team.\n\nFor this reason, Squad has now become my most played game on steam. The depth, the people, the comraderie, it's an amazing experience that no other game captures. I encourage you all to try it out on a free weekend as I originally did, I have been playing it ever since.\n\nI'll see you on the front line.\n- This game vs. HOI3:\n---------------------\n\nAdvantages:\n\n1.) The production system is more interesting and engaging, and far more balanced than the old IC system of HOI3. \n2.) The unit creation system is far more in depth and interesting, featuring many different brigade types and support companies, allowing you to change your divisions however you would like. \n3.) This game is far more stable than HOI3.\n4.) This game is updated regularly and has bugfixes regularly too, with content being added free along with every DLC. \n5.) The modding community of HOI4 is far larger with excellent mods such as Kaiserreich, Millenium Dawn, Red World, and Endseig.\n6.) HOI4 muliplayer is actually playable without making you want to shoot yourself.\n7.) China is no longer something Japan can take within 2 months.\n8.) An actual peace conference system and ideologies that actually impact the game.\n9.) Far easier to get into than HOI3.\n10.) Less railroading and the AI wont spaz if you do something ahistorical.\n11.) Planes are no longer as cancer as they used to be.\n12.) Far less micromanagement if you choose not to want to micro.\n13.) A better tutorial (still not a great one though.)\n\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n1.) The research system is bare bones in comparison to HOI3.\n2.) The War in the Pacific is basically nonexistant and naval warfare is awful (to be improved with next patch, being released eventually:tm:)\n3.) People dont really join the war in HOI4 unless theyre directly attacked, making continents like South America completely useless due to the fact that none of the countries there ever do anything but still build up their military, contributing lag.\n4.) Due to the game's engine, it can only use a single one of your processing cores, meaning regardless of your computer quality the game will run kinda slowly.\n5.) Speaking of slowly, the game is poorly optimized and frame loss is extremely common, especially 1942 onwards, when majors can have upwards of 300+ divisions. \n6.) The AI is often braindead, doing hilariously incompetent things such as charging endlessly into your lines, removing all its troops from your front, leaving major areas completely undefended, and completely ignoring the aerial aspect of the war.\n7.) Specific AI are even more braindead than the rest, specifically island nations, or nations that otherwise need to use navies and airforces more. Yes, the Japanese, American, and British AI are some of the worst in the game. In a WW2 game. \n8.) Your allies are completely useless and often you will find yourself doing all the fighting yourself, or even being hindered by your own allies. Playing as Germany the Italians likely wont place a single division in North Africa. In D-Day, you will either be the only one contributing anything or your allies will contribute so much that the supply is ruined and your troops all die of attrition. As the USSR you will recieve 0 lend lease, and as China you will get absolutely no support from the west. \n9.) HOI3 is a lot cheaper than HOI4\n\n\nOther things which I feel are worth mentioning but arent really advantages or disadvantages:\n\n1.) HOI4 contains a lot more alt-history options, which while not for everyone, are fun to try out. \n2.) The focus-tree system is something completely different from anything in HOI3.\n3.) The game has a less in-depth OOB(Order of Battle), which while to some people is nice because theyre bad with OOB, others dislike. Specifically this game lacks corps. \n4.) The battle-planning system of HOI4, while easier to use than the one in HOI3, is still flawwed. In HOI3 it did absolutely nothing, but in this game it is a core part of playing. Unless you want to mircomanage every single division, like you did in HOI3, you will use this system. \n5.) While simpler, the game still possesses a learning curve.\n\n------------------------\n\nOverall: \n\nHOI4 is a far less grounded and historical experience than HOI3. Is this a good or bad thing? That depends on your perspective. HOI4 obviously has significant advantages over HOI3 in certain areas but many consider HOI3 to be an overall better game. Personally I recommend HOI3 if you want a more micro-intensive, historical experience, and HOI4 if you want to just sit back and relax for a couple hours murdering millions of people. \n\nPersonally I would suggest either game, but thats just me.\n- Yes, the Origin client is somewhere between annoying and broken, depending on your hardware. And yes, Dragon Age Keep is still a big jumble of poorly explained choices that affect your game in a thousand little ways if you choose to use it. And yeah, none of the old technical issues really got fixed before coming to steam - this isn't a remaster - so shiny hair and lips for everyone.\n\nBut it's nice to be able to take a walk in Thedas again, and sink into the story, and admire what is probably the last real Bioware game before EA completely turned them into another ouroboros of live service bullshit. \n\nGet it on sale, for the nostalgia if nothing else.\n- You play as a girl dashing through enemies by pressing 2 buttons. That's literally it. Each stage is the length of a song and as you play more you'll unlock more songs. \n\n\nI highly recommend this game if you're a 5 year old who can be easily entertained.\n- I fucking love this game (and the original Guacamelee as well). It's excellent, challenging platforming with a hilarious sense of humor. I'm an archaeologist who works in Mexico and this game is littered with funny and well-researched nods to Mexican history and pre-history. I imagine that matters less to the non-archaeologists out there, but the fact that they took the time to research all their jokes speaks to the care that went into this game.\n- Fez is Phil Fish's stupendous indie tour-de-force, focussing on a little dude who learns to conquer the world of 3D! \n\nFez is incredibly addictive and pleasant to play. As Phil himself states in Indie Game: The Movie, it's a stop and smell the flowers kind of game. I spent 15 hours fully completing this game and loved every minute of it. Genuinely one of my favourite games ever. \n\nThere's puzzling, platforming and cute quirks everywhere. A wonderful and fun game for everyone. Wanna enjoy the experience even more? Watch Indie Game The Movie before playing and appreciate the amount of time and effort put into this wonderful creation.\n\n-Nilesy\n- Just finished it. Having trouble putting words together.\n\nI went on a road trip around the US last year, and on my way down the west coast was surprised by how many giant factories passed by, puffing smoke into the air. One even had Google reviews, where it became clear that the town residents who worked there posted good reviews, and everyone else wanted the factory gone.\n\nThose did not compare to the oil refineries in Louisiana, one of which I had to pull off of the highway to properly behold. Certainly I'd seen images of them, but in real life their scale is hard to believe. And they're so bright, both because of innumerable light bulbs and the infamous refinery flame spouts. Even going through the pictures I took while worried the refinery security was going to attack, the size of these things accurately portrayed in none of them. I'd already played the NORCO demo by this point, and had it in my mind throughout my time in the area. There was even an encounter with an old man working at a convenience store somewhere around 1-2am who asked me if I believed in God with a crazed look in his eye, something I would not know was reality foreshadowing this game until the past week.\n\nSo my impression here, forming as I type this, is as follows: \n\nThe surreal imagery and sublime writing in NORCO combine to seem more accurate to my brief experience in the places resembling the real life Norco than any photo or video I've seen.\n\nA lot more can be said about this game, but I'm currently trying to untie my thoughts. So maybe later. For now, just know that I'd thoroughly recommend this game.\n- [h1]\"Lost in Play\" is an enchanting and nostalgic game that provides players with a whimsical journey into the world of childhood imagination.

(I personally went from 25-40 fps on medium and very low, to 55-65 by inputting a simple launch parameter, this command/launch parameter \"fix\" does NOT work for everyone) \n\n\nAside from those 2 negatives I cannot think of anything else that's bad enough to be worth mentioning. \n\n\n\nOverall this game is great, even if doing solos, but is even more fun when playing with friends, I would entirely recommend it to a friend, so long as their PC is capable of handling it, or if the launch parameter works for them\n\n\n\n\nSystem specs the game was played on:\n\nIntel Core i7 6700 HQ Skylake 3.6 ghz\n\nNvidia GTX 960m 2GB \n\n16gb's DDR4 2133mhz\n\nWindows 10 \n\n(System was an ASUS ROG gaming laptop) \n\n\n\nEDIT: For those who may be looking for the launch parameter me and friends used:\n\n\nNavigate to the game in your library\n\nRight click and go to properties, click \"Set Launch Options\" and enter the following command\n\n\n\n-USEALLAVAILABLECORES -malloc=system -sm4\n- Before I continue writing my review on this game, I got to say that the PC port of Valkyria Chronicles is one of the best, if not, [u]the[/u] best port. The game was originally exclusive for the PlayStation 3 back in 2008. The game was well received, but garnered low sales that would put the sequels Valkyria Chronicles 2 and 3 on the PSP. I actually never heard of this game before until a few week prior to the PC release on November 2014. That said, I will have to give a standing ovation to Sega for putting an effort to make the PC port well optimized in 1080p (or more) at 60 FPS (or more). Sega has my attention and I will present this review.\n \nValkyria Chronicles focuses on Welkin Gunther, a son of a legendary general who fought in the First Europan War, leads a platoon of some adults and teenage volunteers to defend their country against the invading forces of the Imperial Alliance. The game presents a mix of tactical strategy and third-person action that is very unique in the strategy game genre. Does this game deserve your attention? \n\nThe story takes place in a “fictional” European continent where the Second Europan War was fought primarily between the Atlantic Federation (think of all of the European countries, in a geographical sense) versus the Imperial Alliance (Russia, in a geographic sense). Gallia is a “neutral” country where it contains a unique resource known as Ragnite. Thus, the Imperial Alliance invade Gallia to get Ragnite to fuel up their war resources. One of the greatest parts about the game is how well the developers use analogies from World War II into the game and its execution is well-received. The analogies ranged from weapon designs (like the Gallian Scout weapons that look like the Soviet SVT-40 to the Imperial weaponry comparison to the real-life MP40 and STG44, and plenty others). The analogy extends to vehicles and geopolitical conflicts. \n\nThe character developments in the game are highly impressive, particularly with the relationship between Welkin (protagonist) and Alicia Melchiott (deuteragonist). The themes in Valkyria Chronicles consist a good mix of “light” moments (like hope as an example) and “semi-grotesque” themes of war (such as discrimination/racism, personal ambition over soldiers’ lives, and others themes that will unravel later on). Some reviewers criticized the game as being not serious on the themes about war. Honestly, I don’t think that the game is supposed to be depressing and a good mix between “light” and “dark” is best suited for the game. The story starts really slow in the beginning and actually begin to progress as you reach a certain point in the story. The plot is pretty good in most area while few scenes are a bit “awkward” in terms of sudden shifts between a sad event to a “positive motivation”. \n\nThe gameplay in Valkyria Chronicles is turn-based, but it is very unique because once you click on a character to choose, you can actually control the character to move to any location in third-person you like as long you have enough Action Points (basically, the movement bar). Experience points and money are earned by Ranks (like A, B, C, and D) by completing an objective within a certain number of turns (Example: Getting a ‘A’ rank within 3 turns or less to get the maximum amount of exp and money). However, it is possible that you can actually kill all of the enemies on the map, complete the objective, and still get an ‘A’ rank in the majority of missions (except for a few of them). \n\nWith the exp and money, you train your soldiers based on classes Scout, Shocktrooper, Lancer (Anti-Tank/Explosives), Engineers, and Sniper rather than individuals. The money are used up to upgrade weapons, buy tank parts, and purchasing “reports” from a reporter in certain chapters in the story. The game would last you a good 30-50 hours if you play the game in a smart, tactical manner or have an “OCD” on getting an “A” rank on every single mission in the story or a mix of both (like I did). \n\nThe game does have some faults, particularly when it comes to classes. Reviewers argued that Scouts are too overpowered, but in my view, it is best to say that scouts are too reliable since they have the most movement bar and top-tier weapons like the ZM Kar 8 (the game's version of Soviet PTRS-41 that can obliterate any enemy, even medium and heavy tanks if you shoot it in the back). Engineers are useless in the game since you won’t repair your tank very often (depending on your play style) and Scouts are the better alternative. There are some bugs in the game that is related to the monitor refresh rate (if you play it on a 144 Hz monitor like I did) in certain missions in the story. PC controls are a bit awkward when you control the tank. There are a few moments in the story that has some poor “transitions” (an example would be that an upsetting moment happened in the story and all of a sudden, some of the major characters wanted a medal for their part on a major battle in the next cutscene as if that upsetting moment never happen or affected them). \n\nThe game is often compared to XCOM when it comes to gameplay. This may be true, but Valkyria Chronicles is very unique since you can actually control the character in third person instead of the computer doing it for you when you command the character to move from Point A to B, in bird’s eye view. The game engine is very aesthetic and presents the story very well. I’m glad the Sega released Valkyria Chronicles to the PC and I am very pleased to hear that a (possible) new Valkyria Chronicles game is being trademarked (and hopefully in development) thanks to the PC sales. The default price of $20 is a good deal, -50% off is a great deal, -75% is a perfect steal. Valkyria Chronicles is one of my top games for 2014 due to its unique strategy gameplay and superb PC port optimization. I am looking forward for the new game that is being trademarked (or possible PC ports or revamp for VC2 and 3). This game has my highest recommendation for any strategy gamer who want to find something original, unique, and beautiful.\n- Ok to make it short.\n\n- Poor graphics (like 10 years old PC game)\nBUT nothing more to complain about.\n\n- great atmosphere, great story, very good fighting mechanics. Of course great price.\n\nIf you have nothing against japan style - just play the game. One of funniest games in some years for me.\n\n【グループB】\n- As a cybersecurity professional , I would classify this game as malware, or at the least adware.\nWhy? It opens up a number, at least 10 when I checked, of connections to various points on the internet which have no purpose in running the game. They are only there so the vendor can spam you with advertising, track you, or for other unspecified activities. \nAs such, I can NOT recommend this game. \n\nTo verify, I disconnected my computer from the internet. The game ran fine without the advertising and tracking. \nThen I connected back to the internet, and launched the game. The game opened at least 10 connections(!).\nThen, while still connected to the internet, I blocked the game's network-connecting executables in the firewall. In such a case, the game behaves differently, apparently it sees there is an active connection so it runs for a while, then when it cannot make it's for-bad-purposes network connections, it terminates and you can't play. \nThis is bad behavior that I would only expect from spyware and malware. I hope the vendor fixes it so the software runs in the manner they declare - it is supposed to not require network connectivity after the initial run as they describe in the System Requirements. \nSteam should be reigning in this behavior as well.\n- Stephen's Sausage Roll is a game that the developer doesn't want normal people to buy, it seems. The description is literally, \"A simple 3d puzzle game.\", there is one video that shows you nothing about the game, and it's priced at $32 CND.\n\nFortunately, I'm here to tell you to get off your ass and to buy this wonderful game. The graphics are alright, the music is OK, but the puzzles are sublime.\n\nIn each level, the goal is the same: cook all the sausages and exit the level by standing on the exit level sign in the right orientation. You cook sausages by pushing them over a grill. Like in sokoban games, you can't pull the sausage (yet...), only push it. Another huge wrinkle is that sides of the sausage can only touch the grill once. If you touch a cooked side of a sausage to the grill, it will be burned and you fail the level. This little wrinkle will make you pull your hair out in some levels as you try and figure out how the hell you are going to maneuver the sausages around so they get cooked properly. A neat thing about the game is that if you fail, you can still continue playing the level, which might help you figure out how to play it.\n\nYou'll have a section (part of an island) that has a number of puzzles for you to solve in any order, so if you get stuck, you can try another one (until you get to the last puzzle of the section). Once you complete a section, a new section will open up with more puzzles.\n\nYour little guy has tank controls, which you will find extremely useful, as turning to the left or right near a sausage will push it in different directions. A nice detail is that the all of the puzzles make up the island section. When you activate a puzzle, the rest of the island drops away into the sea, leaving you on a tiny puzzle island.\n\nEach section introduces new mechanics into the game. First you'll just be pushing the sausages, but then you'll be stacking them, skewering them (you would think this would make things easier, but no! You can't turn when you have a skewered sausage!), walking on them...\n\nI would say that these levels are on the level of Snakebird, though I found many of them easier than Snakebird's puzzles (maybe I'm better at sokoban games than I know?). These are the kind of puzzles that you walk away from frustrated, but come back to a few hours later with the solution. This is the game where there are so many ah-ha! moments that make you feel smart. You have no idea what to do at first, but eventually you get better and better. You might not see solutions at first, but you begin to see where you need to go to solve the puzzle, and then work backwards from there. It's wonderful!\n\nIf you're having trouble, there's a community guide that has all the solutions, which is super helpful (though not as much when I was playing because it wasn't complete!).\n\nIt might be expensive, but I took 36 hours to solve all the puzzles and it was worth every penny.\n- Before I start this review, I want to make something clear. This comes from a place not of hatred, but of love. Destiny is a game near and dear to my heart and it angers me to see the way Bungie has handled it. I know they can do better.\nI've played the Destiny series since year 1, Destiny 1. I've been through its highs, its lows, and everything inbetween this game I love. I've seen content droughts, content surges, content drops and flops. I've seen this game rise... and fall.\nIt's time I faced facts, I stop huffing Copium, and be truthful; despite being with this game for years, I genuinely can't recommend it to anybody. Not in the state the game is right now. This isn't just another user complaining about a there not being new content to play constantly without any droughts, but as a player genuinely concerned for the direction Bungie is taking the game, the way the past and recent DLC have been handled, how they've monetized this game, and how they've treated their veteran playerbase.\nI bought the $100 Special Edition back when this game first released. All that content I bought with my hard earned money. Within a year $100 worth of content turned free to play. $100 for me turned into $0 for the average player within one year. I received no compensation for buying the game so early except an Emblem. An emblem. Not a potential for a free season pass when the seasons first started, no refund for my money, nothing. Where is this content now? Gone. Not a piece of it is still in the game. My compensation for this content leaving? Nothing still.\nForsaken, the best DLC they've released for this game. The DLC that brought D2 from being a shitshow to being a great, relevant game with a good story tacked on it? Wiped from this game's code.\nThe game may be \"Free to play\" but you'll sink hundreds of dollars for DLC, seasonal passes, and now separate dungeon passes worth as much as your average season pass. It's too much money to ask for people that Bungie can and will wipe from the game's code in a few months time.\nYes, the content they do bring is fun, but drip-feeding us the same content for months without any relevant changes is just not a fun game to play. What is there to do anyways? We have:\nRaids, high quality but the same ones every time\nStrikes, fun but repetitive after years of getting so little new ones\nDungeons, similar problems to the above, fun but repetitive from lack of variety\nSeasonal content, not worth doing anything but the current season unless you're trying to follow up with the game story\nCrucible with a shitty tryhard meta and hardly any new maps\nGambit, a gamemode they've basically given up on with maps they've removed from the pool\nSeasonal events, fun but the same damn thing every season\nNone of these feel fresh after years and years of doing the same ones and watching old favorites get sunset from the game.\nAnd it's not like Bungie can't look back at D1 for inspiration; Sparrow Racing League is something players have been clamoring for, it'd be something fresh that Bungie can use to entice players to stay in the game. Bungie has gone on record stating that \"by the time they've designed an SRL map for Destiny 2, they could have made several strikes maps\" which to me states that A: they aren't willing to put in the effort for player experience and B: aren't willing to make several strike maps worth of content at once.\nAnd getting new players into Destiny? The most painful experience I've tried to do. This game's onboarding experience is horrible, mismanaged, and held back by half the content being locked behind a paywall. From friends I've tried to get into the game, the new player experience is:\nOverwhelming\nConfusing\nNo sense of clear direction\nAll the cool stuff is locked behind paid dlc\nWhy was I put into this random mission when I booted up the game (seasonal mission you start with at every season)\nAny many more comments that made them not want to play the game.\n\nI know this review was basically a rant about how I feel this game is going with no clear rime or reason, jumping from topic to topic, but I just want to see this game thrive the way I know it can. Because Bungie has shown to be a competent company with quality products, but I'm just not seeing that right now.\nAnd i also want compensation for the $100 I watched vanish in the span of a year.\n- Started strong, ended annoyingly.\n\nMoral of the story? People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.\n\nIt paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that \"routine\" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.\n\nI liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters. But it all fell apart and tries to teach a very vapid moral that someone in their early 20's who has never had a meaningful relationship would idealize.\n\nAt least it was short.\n\n- oh good god how do i remove things from my library\n- I really wanted to like it, but i can't, in good faith, recommend A Space for the Unbound to anyone. It's a crying shame, because i deeply respect the intention behind the project. I love the whimsical, yet somewhat grounded premise: anyone who likes Makoto Shinkai movies will feel right at home. The intrigue, even though the plot twists are fairly obvious, still creates an unsettling feeling of uncertainty and dread that clashes (in a good way) with cheerful, bright colors of youth. A Space for the Unbound is mainly a point-and-click quest, but the developers still tried to spice the gameplay up a little with mini-games and little one-off mechanics that successfully break up the monotony.\n\nAnd yet... For every memorable, emotional peak A Space for the Unbound presents an hour of pure, unadulterated filler. Almost every \"puzzle\" is a multi-step fetch quest that requires you to backtrack multiple times with no other reason than to pad the length of the gameplay sections. It also indulges in \"gotcha\" moments, where the game deliberately fools you into the wrong solution, while the right one, of course, requires you to back track somewhere. Yes, the hometown of our main heroes is not that big, but that's hardly an excuse. Even more so in numerous dream sequences, where you are often times forced to go back and forth between someone's mind and reality to collect key items. Spacedives represent a wonderful opportunity to do something different, but A Space for the Unbound rarely delivers on that front.\n\nMost people praise the game for the story, the characters and the fact that it was made in Indonesia -- an under-represented region when it comes to games. But neither of those three have any solid writing to stand on their own. Sure, Atma and Raya can be sweet, but developers never allow their relationship to truly blossom. There's almost no banter, she's not even a constant presence in the story. Raya is important to the world of A Space for the Unbound, but doesn't really feel important to the player. Yes, the game tries really hard to tug at your heartstrings, but more often than not does so in a terribly hamfisted manner. It's supposed to be so profound and melodramatic that, at a certain point, it becomes difficult to take the game seriously.\n\nOh, and speaking of representing the community, A Space for the Unbound doesn't do a good job. The town itself is cute and full of life, there's no argument about that, but all of its inhabintants are either nameless mannequins with a so-so pixel-art, or just item bots. You speak to them once or twice, they give you what you need to advance the plot, and that's it. The fact that the game forces you to run laps around the town on an endless search for items doesn't make it any more charming or cozy. While, on the other hand, the authors only briefly touch on real societal issues, so as not to spoil the whimsy. In short, it's a huge nothingburger of a letdown, despite the fact that the whole setting is clearly supposed to be warm and nostalgic.\n\nYes, you can excuse some of those flaws by the main plot twist, which i will not spoild. But while it does make certain things more clear in hindsight, again, it does not portray the story in a good light. A Space for the Unbound really wants to be a Makoto Shinkai movie by way of Night in the Woods, but falls tragically short wherever you look. However, despite my criticisms, i hope Mojiken will not stop making games. It is very clear that the devs have tremendous passion and some talent on display -- it just needs refinement.\n- An excellent maximalist mashup of Slay The Spire with some Tower Defence and CCG Mechanics. Not as tight and elegantly designed as StS, but with a lot more variety in card design leads to a lot more varied and wild interactions and deck composition. Compulsive and mechanically satisfying, Monster Train embraces excess in a satisfying way, even if the whole package is wrapped up in a slightly odd aesthetic package of half remembered hearthstone knock offs. (The soundtrack, incidentally, slaps)\n- [i]While the artwork and combat remain enjoyable, the story, writing, and pacing were a major letdown.[/i]  \n\n***\nMINOR SPOILERS BELOW. If you're going to play the game, play before reading.\n***\n\n[b]The mature storylines, hard-hitting decisions, beautiful worldbuilding, and tight writing that made the first two so immersive is not present in this game.[/b] (You'll notice immediately that the writing for the caravan in the capital is [i]particular[/i] trite, awkward to read, and uninteresting.)\n\nUnfortunately, it's not just the writing that's weak. [i]The pacing is off.[/i] Antecedents are confusing, characters you'd expect to speak don't, events that should have been foreshadowed come out of nowhere. More frustrating are the serious character continuity \"errors,\" and arcs that disappear, change, or go nowhere. [i]In short, the events, decisions, and conflict from the previous games do not appear or resolve in a way that was suggested by the previous two[/i].\n\n\nHere's one example. In Banner Saga 2, Fosolt is unexpectedly rescued by Bolverk. [i]\"I have a message for Alette from the dead varl king,\" [/i]he said. That's pretty intriuging! Maybe there's a mystery, an oracle, an item, or just cool information about the Varl and their strange king? Maybe there'll finally be context about the bridge decision!\n\n[i]No! He has nothing interesting to say or add, and then his storyline just gets dropped and forgotten.[/i]\n\nWell, Bolverk's been possessed by Bellower! Gosh, who knows what Bellower will say? In fact, I can't wait to find out what happens to Bellower's body! \n\nWell, actually, Bolver's [i]not[/i] possessed, not really, certainly not like it was implied last game, and Bellower's body -- [i]a primary focus of the first two games[/i] -- isn't mentioned [i]once[/i]\n\nOr how about how they casually mention that Eyvyn is not only the [i]head[/i] of the Valka order, but also that he's had periodic bursts of hereditary madness all along? That's... odd. And it's not presented as an well-thought out [i]reveal[/i] or anything. It's presented matter-of-factly, like they were trying to ret-con in a less interesting story, or were tone deaf.\n\nYou'll notice that all the characters are underutilized and have unfulfilled storylines/tensions. Hakon has hard choices to make; Canary's a little crazy; Yrsa is mysterious; Gil's in love with Alette, etc. Will these build into choices? Reveals? Dependent endings based on choices? Will there be discussions referencing the past? Reflections on travels? Hints of despair?\n\nNo. In mine, Gil was [i]murdered[/i] and no one even bothered to reference it. Canary's situation never comes to a head. You never have to choose between Varls and Humans. Murdering people doesn't make people threaten to leave. Ubin returns randomly as an uber Varl and he's... learned the horseborne's language? Travelled the southlands? In like, a month? In a way that doesn't advance the plot? It's just... weakly done.\n\n\nThere are [i]so many[/i] examples like this, where the stories don't quite fit correctly, where what you picked up on in the early games about the [i]mysteries[/i] and the [i]world[/i] and what made it a [i]vibrant[/i] place were forgotten about by the writers. [b]The result is that it the game plays out in unsatisfying ways, in tenseless scenarios made vapid by watered-down morality, an inability to leverage the situation in fun ways, and low-quality writing, paucity of choice-making, a lack of exploration, lack of plot twists, simplified overworld mechanics -- all culminating in an almost staggeringly one-dimensional and shallow ending.[/b]\n\nThe Banner Saga series was always an experience that was greater than the sum of its part. An [i]experience[/i]. Of being [i]riveted[/i] to the computer, checking the map, worrying over supplies, guessing at mysteries, having my breath taken away at each hill. Unfortunately, that's not the case in this game. \n\n\nGameplay-wise, it's also a bit of a letdown. Combat is fun-ish, but you can make invincible character combinations and the mechanics don't even try to deal with this. There's an interesting new reinforcement mechanic that's not used heavily, and never pushes you like you think the end of the world would. You never really have to split up your forces. There's no novelty. Like maybe using a hero in a battle makes them fatigued, so you have to switch them up? Maybe you can station them different places, making them unusable for combat? Maybe you need to choose eight for a secret mission caravan? Maybe dream sequences? No, nothing like that. \n\nThe overworld gameplay had some changes that never really felt significant. Moreover, quite a bit felt taken away. You can't rest, do training missions, no longer weigh food vs upgrades. One example of all thise tone deafness was Iver's march through the destroyed world was consistently at \"Great Morale!\"\n\nThere didn't seem to be many flavor choices (\"Do we hang the criminals or let them join us?\"), including much less on social themes (\"Should women fight, if it disturbs the traditionally-minded men?\" \"One clan's rowdy, what do we do?\" \"They threaten to leave if so and so isn't banished\"), and less delayed results and fewer significant decisions, including among the game's built-up tensions among the factions. \n\n\nThere's also some cases of development [i]feeling[/i] cheap. Remember opening Banner Saga 2, and feeling that it was [i]fresh[/i], and [i]upgraded[/i]? There's little to make you feel that way here. The artwork is okay, but the environments feel more generic, with less variety, and the surreal landscapes in the darkness aren't especially interesting to look at for long periods of time. Iver is voiced by Bolverk's voice actor, and they sound exactly the same. The new title system is a fun idea, but is visually integrated into the game's menu system with the finesse of a cheap mod. \n\nThere's a moment in the game where the screen goes black for scrolling text and voiceover narration explaining the upcoming mechanic. Um, a character can't explain that? It was similar how the many two second animations are used, not to supplement the story, but to [i]replace[/i] written portions, making you feel unsure about what's going on. And finally, the game's pretty short, without fun combat challenges or interesting newgame+ challenges. \n\n\nWhat's [i]particularly[/i] frustrating is that the game's release date was moved forward four months. I don't know the story why, but I do know that a few more months of polish and story embellishment might have delivered the beautiful, grippingly interactive story we were hoping for. Because this is a watered down version of the previous two in just about every way.\n\nThis negative review is for whatever processes lead to this mediocre finale.\n\n---\n\n[i]Here's a plot that would have made more sense. Zephyr arrives and speaks to you secretly. There's a god that's still alive! Neat, now we'll finally get more story on that. Yay, fun caravan mode, now we need to take longships somewhere interesting!\n\nBut uh-oh! There's a Sundr villain going there as well, with an army of dredge! But at least now we'll finally get more story about the Sundr! \n\nThe god reveals something interesting, talks about Juno, the sun, gives a means to protect the city and help Iver. But when you return to the city, now the king and rugga and the factions have devolved into fighting based on your choices. How are you going to handle this? Which of many possibilities will ascend to the throne? How will you defend the city? And what mystery lies beneath the mountain of the city...\n\nFor Iver's caravan, there should be pockets of dredge villages kept alive by Spellsingers. Now you need to decide to plunder them or not! More stuff to do! Maybe go to the remains of the Varl capital first? Fight warped Valka? Realize deceptions, machinations, corruption, hear stories? Find new characters, have old ones die?\n\nInstead there... wasn't a plot?[/i]\n- I was hoping for a good game but I can't believe the positive reviews. Really annoying on a personal level. If you like your hand held and revel in 3rd person view then enjoy, but I think it's terrible. I was on the mountain jumping across a platform. \"Press ENTER\" to 'grab' it suggests. I press ENTER and what do you know? Nothing happens. Well, you die continually because what it tells you to do (zzzzz) doesn't work. Ah, maybe this is part of the 'difficulty'...hahahaha.\n\nNot a patch on any Far Cry or GTA even though these are full of directions. First Tomb Raider I've bought and definitely the last. What is it with games these days telling you what to do every step of the way: Do this...do that....go here....find item...take item...drop item...fire now.....pull lever...talk....rest....jump.... quit game and uninstall, ya that's the best option. As this game is created for a dumbed-down society or tailored for intellectually challenged meercats, some of us can see where the industry is heading. What happened to thinking for yourself???\n\nI don't need to progess far in this game because the first 10 minutes says enough. Do this, do that, blah blah blah...\n- \"The good things, the happy things, all of it changes. Nothing can stay the same forever. Still...can you find it in your heart to still love this place?\" (paraphrase)\n\nClannad . . .\n\nOH Clannad . . .\n\nI remember watching the anime in high school, and absolutely falling in love with it. Upon realizing the REAL story was told in a visual novel...I HAD to get my hands on it. I almost died of a joy-induced heart attack when a legitimate English version of the game was released on Steam.\n\nThis game bro. This f***** game. When I was a senior in high school back in the day, this game was my refuge. I was mostly friends with older kids back then, so by the time I was a senior I didn't really have anybody to chill with cuz all my friends already graduated. Its kinda hard for me to make new friends, then and now if I'm being honest. I related to Nagisa a lot for that reason. \n\nI mostly related to Tomoya and Sunohara tho. One of my best friends growing up really reminded me of Sunohara no cap lol. Type of dude who was the comic relief/brunt of everyone's s*** talking but w/ a mutual understanding its done in jest and love. And when things ever got serious we always had each others' backs, and even tho he's a goofball and kind of a meme, he's seriously loyal and a true ride or die.\n\nMany times when Tomoya was expressing himself in this game, I had to almost pinch my face and remind myself I'm not the one thinking these thoughts: I'm playing a VN lol. That's how much I seriously related to Tomoya. In so many aspects and ways that would make my review even longer than it is now if I were to attempt to explain why I relate to Tomoya so much. Yeah, sure that could just be shrewd character design from Maeda Jun's part, but it was almost uncanny how many of the things Tomoya went thru when he was younger/issues with his father/intimacy issues he develops later on in adulthood etc. almost perfectly mirrored what I was struggling with irl. It gave me something to relate to. It expressed emotions I was having trouble even admitting were present in my own self. Maybe that's the real reason I love Clannad so much, and maybe because of that I sit here biased with rose-colored nostalgia goggles. But even if I type this review with a tinge of rose-coloring obstructing my critical eyes, I can say with confidence that Clannad is more than a game. More than an anime. \n\nClannad is an experience. An experience I wish I could forget all about...just so I could experience it anew all over again. Whether you experience Clannad thru the anime, VN, movie, whatever...Clannad is an experience in a league of its own in my book. And the best way to have your Clannad experience is by playing this masterpiece of a Visual Novel. Hands down. \n\nHonestly, I'd ideally have all Clannad virgins go straight to the VN and play it to completion but that's just not a realistic request as this game takes the average player 80+ hours to complete just the main story apart from optional achievements haha. If you're a fan of the anime...why haven't you played the VN yet!? Lol. If you've never seen the anime or movie I'd STILL recommend playing this game. Just keep in mind to use a guide (just trust me on that. please) and be willing for it to be a bit boring at first. If you stick with it, believe me...it's not gonna stay boring for long.\n\nIf you liked the anime but hated the anime ending, PLAY THE VN. No spoilers, but trust me when I say the VN ending is the true conclusion of the Clannad experience. You'll find out what I mean if you stick with the VISUAL NOVEL to the end.\n\nI didn't go to my senior prom. I spent it playing this game. And I don't regret that decision one bit to this day. I experienced this game, standing in similar shoes as Tomoya at that time irl: rebellious kid about to graduate high school with no real goals or aspirations, struggling to find it hard to \"love this place\" or truly find something passionate to live for. I didn't want to go to college. There was nothing I wanted to do there. Most of the people in my grade back then thought I was quiet and lonely freshman-sophomore, then bad news junior-senior when I started acting out. I was just, lost. \n\nExperiencing Clannad helped me find what I was truly passionate about in life. Family. Friendship (as corny as that may sound). Being able to step up for what only YOU can protect when life is calling you to maturity.\n\nClannad helped me see that even though things can get dark... even though tragedies will happen regardless of our efforts to keep them from happening... even though things can never, and will never, ever stay the same in this life...and even if you lose your way eventually... and sadly reach such a lost and depressed state in life, that you mistakenly conclude for a short while you'd rather sever all your connections and ties with the world and everybody in it... in an effort to try to prevent experiencing even more pain... \n\nThat \"loving this place,\" loving this world, loving people, and forming deep, lifelong and lasting connections with this world and its people, NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS, is ALWAYS, ALWAYS, worth it in the end. Especially when it matters the most.\n\nNow I'm not gonna front: Clannad isn't for everybody. Some people just can't get into the moe art style. Some people may find it a bit too melodramatic at times. Some people may find some of the comedy or bits of the story weird, or just not their cup of tea. Some people may find it hard to relate to all of the characters, and for some people it won't have a Cindarella's slipper level of relatability like it did for me. For those people who are kinda feelin \"ehh idk if i'll really like this game\" I'd say it'd be smart to watch the anime first. But if you're feeling good about it and wanna experience Clannad the BEST way: cop this VN. Just wait for the good bits to slowly boil. Patience is a virtue :) And save yourself hours of rage by using a guide from the beginning until the after-story credits roll. With Clannad I'd say its almost always recommended to use a guide.\n\nAnd if you love the anime and haven't played the VN... you're weirdo number 1, 2, 3, 4 and even 5. Haha I'm playin but srsly get the VN already you owe it to yourself to experience the VN. Knowing what happens in the story and getting some events \"spoiled\" doesn't detract from the VN experience. That I promise you. As someone who watched the anime before playing the VN, who's now such an obvious fanboy of the Clannad VN as demonstrated by my wall of text of a review (lol), trust me: I'd bet money you'll love this game just as much as I do.  \n\nTo Maeda Jun, and all of the brilliant writers of this quintessential, modern classic of a story: thank you. Thank you for gifting all of us the experience that is Clannad. Because of your labours, you've helped a wayward knucklehead like me finally be able to declare this in spirit and in truth:\n\n\"I love this place.\"\n\nLong live Kazamatsuri!\n- I have never cried so damn much at a game\n- Earlier this week I did the impossible - I came out to a family member. One of my two sisters, in specific.\n\nI was nervous but relieved to know she accepted and supported me - and thought, you know, perhaps we should call and talk about some things. We had that call this Wednesday and I expressed a lot of my resentment towards my family - being stuck at home with some of my family, more specifically my [spoiler]mom[/spoiler], has completely wrecked my mental health. I'm still closeted from them and I live with each passing day, worried [spoiler]she'd[/spoiler] reject me - for being non-binary, for dating a trans person, for disappointing [spoiler]her[/spoiler].\n\nMy sister told me that [spoiler] my mom [/spoiler] only hears what [spoiler]she[/spoiler] wants to hear, that [spoiler]she[/spoiler] only thinks about what [spoiler]she[/spoiler] wants to see in [spoiler]her[/spoiler] kids despite often saying otherwise. From her experience, [spoiler]mom[/spoiler] seemed to be a very not open and is often a close-minded individual. \nComing into If Found..., I had only broke down early Thursday morning as my many months of frustrations and anxieties finally given the voice it needed.\n\nIf you've played the game it'd make sense if I told you that Kasio's experience with her parents in If Found... hurt reading for me - it genuinely hurt. Seeing her mom's first letter and annotating it with \"She's trying. But she has all these ideas of how I should be.\" and \"She didn't even consider she might need to apologize too.\" was something I sat at for a long time, probably longer than any other part of her journal that I was erasing through at a normal pace.\n\nMoments like that made me realize that this game is something I never knew I needed - a realization that hey, think about the move out you're doing in a month as rebuilding - as leaving the past behind. That there isn't anything wrong with that, and that you can really be yourself once we're out there, together. That family doesn't have to be bound by blood and it's really about the people who's there for you, even at your absolute worst. That I don't need to seek acceptance through others - but rather be more accepting of myself.\n\n[spoiler]\"I find I care less and less what other people think of me, and more for my own opinion. And these days I'm so much more comfortable in my own skin.\"[/spoiler]\n\nThere's people I can think of who need to read and see this.\n\nIf Found... left me with hope - and it's leaving me with a lot to think about. Thank you so much for this game, DREAMFEEL. I wish I could articulate this game better like other people have - but it's been a lot lately and I need to rest - if you're coming across this review/text you should without a doubt play it, especially if you've felt similarly trapped like both me and Kasio did.\n\nP.S. - If you find the eraser mechanic to be a little strenuous you can increase the size of the eraser in the options!\n- Black Mesa is a fantastic remake of the Original Valve classic and one of the greatest of all time video games, Half-Life.  This sci-fi classic FPS has you take on what might seem like a hum-drum day in the life of an experimental physicist, but things go quite off rails when experimenting with a strange material sample from an even stranger dude in a suit. \n\nAfter a while (and shooting a lot of aliens and bashing their heads in with a crowbar) you'll save the world... but now Black Mesa lets you do this with dramatically updated graphics, 4K support and a plethora of visual tweaks so you can rest assured this will run great on any gaming rig. \n\nA must have for big fans of Half-Life or gamers who are new to the scene and never got to play the original.   When on sale, of course!\n- I am a day one player who quit the game within a few days. After coming back after almost 2 years, I am shocked and surprised. The overall improvement is great, quests are not bothering you. Story and atmosphere is hooking you up and the overall experience is good. Leveling up is easy and also you are not struggling as in most MMOs.\n\nDespite the past of the game, I think it is worth trying.\n- This game is basically awesome, under 3 conditions:\n\n1- You get rid of all on-screen icons (i.e. incoming attacks, ennemy spotting)\n2- Do not care about secondary missions only here to further lenghten the game's lifespan\n3- Play the game as you would if  YOU were in charge\n\nBasically, nevermind the Ubisoft micro transactions' system and other abhorrent company induced  greed-leaned system to get stuff faster and more easily by robbing you out of your hard-earned cash...you can finish the game without spending a single dime in the store, it's all pay to win...\nThe open-world aspect is very satisfying and rewarding, in terms of progression, don't fall for the micro transaction system\nCombat is easy even in the highest difficulty setting, but makes you think you are badass when you slash through waves of ennemies, whose AI is rather basic, with your arsenal of rockets, LMGs and explosives but it is satisfying as fuck!\n\nImagine strapping C4 to your plane, jump out of it, have it crashing down an ennemy outpost meanwhile you are parachuting down and throwing hand grenades their way, land on a roof and eliminate the remaining ennemies with fire ammo shotgun and a motherfucking M60 with armor-piercing bullets while throwing dynamites and there you have it...FarCry5 in a nutshell\n\nOh and don't forget about the flame-thrower lol, who doesn't love a flame-thrower scorching ennemies to their own demise eh?\n\nFarCry5 got it all, extreme freedom of how you wanna handle a situation (stealthily or all guns blazing) while being challenging enough in the highest difficulty setting!\nP.S. don't forget to turn off all the on-screen icons, really ruins it for hardcore FPS fans by making it extremely easy, please hear me out, you don't need these!\n- The fact that you can't pause the game during cutscenes and conversations, is very frustrating. The cinematics are long (and sometimes exhausting). If your baby wakes up, If your phone rings, if someone's at the door, if you need to take a pan out of the oven... you can't pause the game! What's the deal with that? Put a pause feature! We have the technology!\n- This game is more than just a driving simulator. It's a landscape experience.\n\nScreenshots won't reveal the full beauty of this game, cause they don't show how daytime and weather change while you drive, how the first sunbeams flash through trees and hills as you leave the night behind, how massive forests reveal as you climb mountain roads and cut through curvy canyons, or the mad contrast of Las Vegas' vibrant colors vs the lonely Route-66-style desert roads... these moments are gold, and define the atmosphere of a game that can be as relaxing or challenging as you want, based on the truck and cargo that you pick – but it will always be a beautiful trip.\n\nAlso, THIS is the game that TRULY deserves the Labor of Love award. In a year that has been most difficult for everyone, SCS managed to add more than ever: 2 map expansion DLCs, 3 completely new trucks brands (for FREE!), completely rework the lighting system (after complely overhauling the audio engine)... They just make the game better. Every year. For free.\n\nFor years now, SCS keep improving and remain honest, loyal and supportive to their customers and games. What more can you ask.\n\n(P.S. They just revealed plans for official co-op multiplayer.)\n- If you are looking for a review for this game this aint it, but if you want a fire brownie recipe then you are at the right place\n\nIngredients:\n185g unsalted butter\n185g best dark chocolate\n85g plain flour\n40g cocoa powder\n50g white chocolate\n50g milk chocolate\n3 large eggs\n275g golden caster sugar\n\nMethod:\nSTEP 1\nCut 185g unsalted butter into small cubes and tip into a medium bowl. Break 185g dark chocolate into small pieces and drop into the bowl.\n\nSTEP 2\nFill a small saucepan about a quarter full with hot water, then sit the bowl on top so it rests on the rim of the pan, not touching the water. Put over a low heat until the butter and chocolate have melted, stirring occasionally to mix them.\n\nSTEP 3\nRemove the bowl from the pan. Alternatively, cover the bowl loosely with cling film and put in the microwave for 2 minutes on High. Leave the melted mixture to cool to room temperature.\n\nSTEP 4\nWhile you wait for the chocolate to cool, position a shelf in the middle of your oven and turn the oven on to 180C/160C fan/gas 4.\n\nSTEP 5\nUsing a shallow 20cm square tin, cut out a square of non-stick baking parchment to line the base. Tip 85g plain flour and 40g cocoa powder into a sieve held over a medium bowl. Tap and shake the sieve so they run through together and you get rid of any lumps.\n\nSTEP 6\nChop 50g white chocolate and 50g milk chocolate into chunks on a board.\n\nSTEP 7\nBreak 3 large eggs into a large bowl and tip in 275g golden caster sugar. With an electric mixer on maximum speed, whisk the eggs and sugar. They will look thick and creamy, like a milk shake. This can take 3-8 minutes, depending on how powerful your mixer is. You’ll know it’s ready when the mixture becomes really pale and about double its original volume. Another check is to turn off the mixer, lift out the beaters and wiggle them from side to side. If the mixture that runs off the beaters leaves a trail on the surface of the mixture in the bowl for a second or two, you’re there.\n\nSTEP 8\nPour the cooled chocolate mixture over the eggy mousse, then gently fold together with a rubber spatula. Plunge the spatula in at one side, take it underneath and bring it up the opposite side and in again at the middle. Continue going under and over in a figure of eight, moving the bowl round after each folding so you can get at it from all sides, until the two mixtures are one and the colour is a mottled dark brown. The idea is to marry them without knocking out the air, so be as gentle and slow as you like.\n\nSTEP 9\nHold the sieve over the bowl of eggy chocolate mixture and resift the cocoa and flour mixture, shaking the sieve from side to side, to cover the top evenly.\n\nSTEP 10\nGently fold in this powder using the same figure of eight action as before. The mixture will look dry and dusty at first, and a bit unpromising, but if you keep going very gently and patiently, it will end up looking gungy and fudgy. Stop just before you feel you should, as you don’t want to overdo this mixing.\n\nSTEP 11\nFinally, stir in the white and milk chocolate chunks until they’re dotted throughout.\n\nSTEP 12\nPour the mixture into the prepared tin, scraping every bit out of the bowl with the spatula. Gently ease the mixture into the corners of the tin and paddle the spatula from side to side across the top to level it.\n\nSTEP 13\nPut in the oven and set your timer for 25 mins. When the buzzer goes, open the oven, pull the shelf out a bit and gently shake the tin. If the brownie wobbles in the middle, it’s not quite done, so slide it back in and bake for another 5 minutes until the top has a shiny, papery crust and the sides are just beginning to come away from the tin. Take out of the oven.\n\nSTEP 14\nLeave the whole thing in the tin until completely cold, then, if you’re using the brownie tin, lift up the protruding rim slightly and slide the uncut brownie out on its base. If you’re using a normal tin, lift out the brownie with the foil. Cut into quarters, then cut each quarter into four squares and finally into triangles.\n\nSTEP 15\nThey’ll keep in an airtight container for a good two weeks and in the freezer for up to a month.\n\n:Mic drop:\n- It has poor simulation of hand skeleton, so you can't use all fingers, benefits of Index Knuckles controller or VR gloves, etc. And, scenario doesn't allow you to do anything, actually, except one straightforward way. Some things are elaborated, but mostly it isn't worth time or money. But I'm rating it as professional developer for VR, sexual content itself is not matter nor interested for me. My advice for game developer is to add more hand tracking features and more scenarios - in this case it can be something better.\n- Always have to be online, even to play single player. Why?\n\nThis would be a perfect Steam Deck game, but they fucked it up.\n\nUPDATE OCT 20th: So they added off-line mode just for Steam Deck, which is great, but not allowing off-line mode on your PC is strange. Hopefully they update it again.\n- This game can be really fun with friends and the cosmetics are pretty cool.\n- First I thought this game is WAY TOO COMPLICATED.\nNow I still think the game is very complex for beginners. And I'm still a newbie.\nI had to watch several youtube videos to get the hang of it.\n\nBesides that, the game is really awesome!\n- [h1]An old classic that's fresher than lots of today's titles.[/h1]\n\n[i]Day of the Tentacle[/i] first launched in 1993. I remember, because I was a teenager then and couldn't play it as my PC didn't meet the minimum requirements! This was actually the sequel to an earlier game, [i]Maniac Mansion[/i], which was released in 1987. I played [i]Maniac Mansion[/i] a few years after it came out, but did not complete it as the game's movement and controls were just too dated and clunky for me (even back then) to be bothered with. \n\nPlaying [i]Maniac Mansion[/i] is not at all necessary in order to enjoy [i]Day of the Tentacle[/i], though those who have will definitely find greater connection to the game's characters, especially the Edison family.\n\n23 years later, [i]Day of the Tentacle Remastered[/i] is essentially the same as it was before, but with sleeker graphics and a more modernised interface. While the story hasn't changed, it surprisingly (or not) hasn't aged one bit either - tentacle mutates and seeks to conquer the world, and only you (and your friends) can stop him! Though straightforward, the game's charm is in its various amusing time travel locations and the weird and wonderful characters you meet along the way. This is a prime example of where [i]\"it's all about the journey, not the destination.\"[/i]\n\n\n[h1]Yays![/h1]\n\n+ Vibrant, colourful, hi-res cartoon-style graphics.\n+ Well-designed rooms, locations and scenery.\n+ Fully voiced, with good voice acting for the most part. (The guy who plays Dr Fred is awesome.)\n+ Interesting, memorable characters.\n+ Fun, amusing story.\n+ Wacky humour.\n+ Clear goals.\n+ Cool easter eggs. (Under \"achievements\".)\n+ Contains a free game ([i]Maniac Mansion[/i])!\n+ Puzzles are mostly enjoyable and require some creative thinking.\n+ Many gameplay hours.\n+ Trading cards.\n\n[h1]Nays.[/h1]\n\n- [url=steamcommunity.com/app/388210/discussions/0/392184522713202518/]Audio starts stuttering[/url] after a while, due to memory problems.\n- Achievements remain hidden, even after the game is completed, so you can't see what you're missing.\n- Some puzzles have illogical or nonsensical solutions.\n- Bugs: e.g. When looking at one of the items, Laverne's voice sounds when Bernard speaks.\n- No mouse command to fast-forward dialogue; instead, you have to press \".\" which is really inconvenient, especially when the whole point of a point-n-click game is to [i]not[/i] have to use your keyboard!\n- Some counter-intuitive puzzle set-ups: E.g. For the videotape puzzle, a button which looks like the \"STOP\" button, is actually the \"RECORD\" button. Anyone who's ever used a VCR or tape recorder would know that the square symbol denotes \"STOP\", while the round button denotes \"RECORD\". \n- Hoagie's periodic belches sound absolutely disgusting!\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nThis was a hugely enjoyable experience from start to finish. Though the nostalgia factor played a part in my case, even if you've never heard of the [i]Maniac Mansion[/i] series, as long as you count yourself a point-n-click adventure game fan, this is a must-play because it just gets so many things right. Add to that the timeless plot and wacky characters, and you have yourself a game that will play just as fresh & new decades down the road.\n\n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [td][u]Disclaimer:[/u] [i]Game played for free, with many thanks to my dear friend [url=steamcommunity.com/id/kflorence]KFlo[/url]. :)[/i][/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n- Okay this is a weird situation. I personally don't like this game all that much, but I do still recommend it nonetheless. That's because despite me not being personally huge on it, I can't deny that it is a very well-crafted game that definitely will give people the experience they want if this is the type of game they're looking for. I, turns out, am not part of the crowd that is targeted for said experience. I just found the whole trial and error stealth RTS style of this game to just not be my cup of tea, but again I can't deny its very well-crafted. I also think the art style and voice acting and story are all very well done as well. So yeah, if you're fond of games of this type, then go for it. I'm sure you won't be disappointed. I, for one, don't think I'm entirely sold on it though.\n- I am a 43 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he helped me. Loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.\nThank you <3\n- The game is very good, it's fun and had everything to be a great success, but unfortunately because the anti-piracy, the game doesn't work well, even above 100 fps it feels lag, the game stutters, a strange gameplay.\n\nJust REMOVE DENUVO and the game will have the deserved success.\n\nUnfortunately, they still haven't realized that those who pirate, don't spend money with or without protection, and those who pay like us, have a game with problems.\n\nA good game doesn't need protection to sell, just be good, simple as that.\n- A solid \"Get Va11HallA instead, unless this is on sale. Otherwise, maybe.\".\n\nCoffee Talk: Fantasy Coffee-brewing Action, is a day-by-day visual novel with slight coffee-brewing mechanics on the side. Its storyline is broken up into several days, of which customers visit your coffee shop and talk. The first few days are rather short: no longer than a few minutes, but as the story advances the days become more packed with story. The game as a whole is rather short, less than 3 hours to complete the main storyline. Overall, generally a well rounded game, but not $15. On the other hand, it compares rather poorly to Va11halla, a game with a nigh identical format, but has more characters, story, and charm. If you liked Va11halla, and really can't wait for N1RVAnnA, then get it on sale. Otherwise, just get Va11halla. But I'm still recommending it because steam doesn't allow maybes, and there's very little competition for this niche of VN.\n- Simply fantastic. Probably the best TRUE RPG I've ever played. Your choices matter, dialogue options matter, the order in which you do things matter, even such small things such as the items you hold in your hand matter. Every build is viable, go heavy in Physical stats and you'll have difficulty solving things Logically, but maybe you can brute force your way through something. Go heavy in Logic and you'll be weak in a one-to-one fight, but maybe you'll be so fast to figure things out that it'll never come to that. You'll see things that the dim-witted brute with high Physical didn't. Failure is encouraged, there are many routes in the game you cannot open without failing something else first.\n\nA true combat system does not exist. At all. Physical altercations are decided through dice rolls based on how you've built your character. And virtually all of them are optional. I like this decision a lot. I've always found it immersion-breaking in RPGs when you're just running around the countryside, killing every bandit or animal that comes your way. This one keeps fights realistic with REAL consequences depending how things go.\n\nBarring having to restart my game once due to a bug (quicksave often, autosaves are few), the game had no major technical issues. There was a single point in the game where a vital skill check required a specific skill to be built, and I'm not sure if there were any alternate routes. I couldn't find any, just had to savescum the check. Aside from that, you have options as to how to approach everything. I'm not sure if that was an oversight or if I just missed something.\n\nCan't go into the story much without spoilers (and you DON'T want it spoiled, it's great.) But it's very well-written and even hilarious at some points. But don't be fooled, it's not a comedy game. It tackles very serious topics such as Fascism, Communism, Mental Illness, Addiction, and many other things.\n\nOverall an amazing RPG experience that I cannot recommend enough. Will definitely play through this several times to see how things go with different builds. Highly suggest you purchase this if you have any interest.\n- I shall start by saying that if you are deciding to buy this game then don't let the negative reviews sway you. In general, Fallout 4 is an amazing game and can be incredibly fun.\n\nPros: \n-Very immersive and will drain so many hours, days, weeks and months from your life.\n-Far Harbour, Automotron and (first half of) NukaWorld DLC have really good stories, quests and environments.\n-Mostly fluid combat system. Everything depends on how you want to play the game.\n\nCons: \n-WIll drain so much of your life away (might've forgotten my gf's birthday ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ )\n-Main story was incredibly lackluster compared to previous Fallout games\n-Giving you the option to be literally any kind of character you want to be....except you're always tied to being a parent.\n-a few repitive quests. (although gives you opportunities to approach these quests, areas and enemies differently\n\nAll in all, If you're a Fallout fan because of previous stories then you might not feel fulfilled playing this game, however if you love character creations, lore and immersive environments with untold stories then I completely recommend this game to you.\n- [h1]A game meant to bring back memories that is similar to Super Mario World on the SNES and it does this with relatively few gameplay and gimmick elements.

After all, it has to be ready for take-off in order for children everywhere to receive their presents on schedule. But a wicked troll blasts us out of the sky just as the test drive is about to end. He went over the line and wants to ruin Christmas for everyone on Earth. It is up to us to bring the troll to his senses and save Christmas for everyone.\n\nTLoS brings players to one world and six levels of great platforming that are reminiscent of Super Mario World (SNES) but simplified. There are only six levels total, one of which is a castle, before the final battle with the troll. The only difference is that we will be collecting chocolate cookies rather than the traditional yellow coins. We also lose part of our cloak when we are injured, so it's not uncommon for you to find yourself jumping through the levels wearing nothing but red boxer shorts. For instance, red blocks can give you a new coat, which means extra life, or Santa socks and hats, which give a power-up or simply chocolate cookies. The power-up allows you to throw stones as if you had collected the Fire Flower from Super Mario, and that's about it. TLoS also offers a 2-4 co-op player mode, in which players will be able to work together to complete this short and family-friendly adventure.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3009359595\n\nSimilar to Super Mario World, you walk to a level to choose them in the Overworld. Once we reach a certain level, we are allowed to walk, leap, and even sprint. Additionally, there are other indications on the screen that show you how many cookies you have already gathered and how much time is remaining to finish the level. We get an extra life when 100 cookies are collected. We can activate a checkpoint about halfway through the level to pick up exactly where the checkpoint was reached, instead of having to do the entire level all over again. The game also features side-scrolling and underwater levels. The only problem is that if you quit at level three, close the game and start again, you have to start from level one, so you have to play the game in one go. This means that there are no save points or \"save states\". Considering the length of the game, this is not a big deal, but it's still \"annoying\".\n\n[h3] My Specs [/h3]\n\n[code]CPU: i9 9900k\nGPU: RTX 2080 Ti\nRAM: DDR4 32 GB RAM\nOS: Win10\nResolution: 1440p @144hz\n[/code]\n\n[h3] Conclusion [/h3]\n\nWe are all hoping that Nintendo will release their IPs on Steam so that we can play with them one more time. We may all agree, based on experience, that this is probably never going to happen, but Indie developers are there to make it happen. To avoid the tedious teachings at school, you used to be able to play these types of games in class on the usual Flash Player websites, and now you can play them on Steam. Though it's not a masterpiece, it's extremely minimalistic, and it's unquestionably too short, the 20 minutes I spent playing it were nevertheless a lot of fun, especially because the platforming is accurate and not wonky at all. Just remember, it's very minimalistic and may be too minimalistic for some, but if that doesn't bother you, feel free to go ahead and try it out.\n\nIt would be my personal highlight if there were additional levels, more secret exits, more power-up alternatives, and more hours of overall playtime.\n\n[h2] Final Verdict: 8/10 A typical gas station snack that turns out to be a surprisingly good one.🎅 [/h2]\n- [h1]Technology[/h1]\nThe game is (was?) awfully poorly optimized.\nI don't think this game looks good enough for the hardware it requires. Some old RTS games looked similar to this title but required much less to run (I am referencing how the technology is better but the \"PC to FPS\" ratio has gone downhills).\n\nI understand that calculating AI choices and the simulation take a lot of resources, but this is not a game with a few thousand AI players like e.g. EU4 is. This is a relatively small map with just some AI players. This game also does not look that much better than some other RTS/TBS titles and I had FPS issues even with the lowest settings.\n\nI first ran this title with R9 280, so a quite old GPU, but that GPU was fully capable of running many decently modern games. This is IMO unacceptable, the developer can't optimize the game, and releases poorly coded product. I tested different graphic settings and noticed nearly no differences in the framerate.\n\nI then upgraded my PC to the top AM4 CPU and a very new GPU card (6600XT, overclocked) and the game ran fine on the highest settings, but I would not call it super smooth. All the other games run perfectly.\nElden Ring, Baldurs Gate 3, Cyberpunk (absolutely 0 issues in Cyberpunk). I would say CA messed up their game and didn't care to optimize it.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThe game is rather decent, it's enjoyable and has a connection to the lore of Warhammer.\nYou can't say a bad word about the general RTS mechanics, the battles and whatever. Just a normal RTS...\n\nIt just isn't the greatest RTS/TBS. Compared to Heroes of Might and Magic 3, or titles like let's say Cossacks, Age of Empires, or maybe Supreme Commander... It is unique in the Total War way, but given the amount of games in the series, it's ... not unique really (I have seen everything this game offers in different titles over the years).\n\nJust a giant simulation with a surprising lack of mechanics for an RTS game (as in economic aspect, diplomacy, map tactics. I think Europa Universalis IV is a good example of a really advanced tactics model in an RTS/TBS game and Civ 6 would be a great example of map design/economics). I personally don't like the maps for real-time battles. These maps seem quite crude and the skirmishes are badly designed.\n\nIn order to inflict maximum casualties you would need to kill every single unit. It should be enough that you break the enemy and automatically win. It's also quite unbalanced. Depending on what you kill first the results can wildly vary (including the AI acting much differently every time and the proposed outcomes of auto-resolved battles are just unhinged).\n\n I probably would like this game more without the \"real-time\" battles, but I assume it's the \"Total War\" way. To me it's time intensive and just not interesting. I liked Warhammer 40k's battles much more. They felt more tactical. Placement of units in this game does matter, but I had more fun playing The Battle for Middle Earth 15 years ago than this. I think the units panic too quickly and the characters don't matter enough.\n\nIt's the closest to the HoMM in terms of map and characters, however it lacks many things that made HoMM great (like tailored character development with meaningful spells and ability to recruit units, find artifacts on the map etc). The cities feel kind of empty, the mechanics are rather poorly described/introduced and just weird for an RTS (for my liking). \n\nI am not sure why there is so little care about the main characters. It would be very cool to build them up, be able to find artifacts on the map (besides the Sword of Khaine, that's just one item) and do something else than just advance some skills in the skill tree. Even if you invest your time in them then they can be sieged and just die.\n\nI also don't like some mechanics, for example the corruption, or slaves (they are not much intuitive. I think they should create clearer GUI and work on the general set of game rules, rather than make every faction different but also following totally different rules. Are we supposed to compete in a campaign and how if we follow different rules?). \nSome game prompts are meant to \"help\" learning the game, but they not always load up and they also don't explain small logos (traits) of the units, it's pretty useless. You need to use web browser anyway. Why to bother?\nIn that aspect - I think the designers totally messed up the UI/UX.\n\n21st August 2023 update: I played Baldur's Gate 3 and imagine they paid enough of work to actually make icons explain the traits of characters or items, amazing is it not? Seems to be lack of care. Every single icon in BG3 is fully explained. I could learn the game's rules and effectively build my characters.\n\n[h1]Genre[/h1]\nThe game is pretty fine, it gives some fun when playing it. Feels like Warhammer I guess? I personally am more of the 40k fan, but a game in the old universe is making lots of sense and the character design with world design are high quality.\n\n[h1] Summary (what made me dump this game also) [/h1]\nThe character design is quite impressive and it seems that they cared about the \"vibe\", but the game is just a money grab. why are there 3 game titles instead of one? What is the main improvement in between all of these titles?\nEach one of them has dozens of DLCs. An average person surely won't spend 300$ just to play more factions.\n\nWhat angered me so much I stopped playing after the purchase:\nThe publisher releases a paid product that claims to have free DLCs - some of them are, but the most important one isn't, and without it the game has got only 50% functionality and feels like a demo.\nRTS game without skirmish mode or some kind of \"do whatever\" mode is a meme. This isn't a DnD campaign board (and ironically such a campaign would allow for much more than selection of 5 heroes on one map lol), but an RTS in a specific universe.\n\nEvery normal RTS game has got a skirmish/free play mode (The Battle for the Middle-earth, Command and Conquer, Supreme Commander, Cossacks, Starcraft. Like every single RTS EVER) and this is especially filthy when you proclaim to release FREE functionality for the title, but then the player gets informed that they must buy TWO titles (WH1 and WH2) to get functionalities in the one they wanted to expand. Such a money grab, and even then the game is still locked behind micro-transactions/DLCs. I wanted to play a game, not donate to the \"poor\" publisher in 10 different ways. If the publisher wants money then they can sell better games.\n\nAwfully lot of DLCs, that don't add many things into the game. The base game doesn't feel like a game, but a rather Free to Play game account, that has 80% of content locked. Choosing from like 4 factions, especially in a game which varies so wildly depending on the faction (the factions aren't meant to be following any common rules it seems).\n\nWhat I also dislike is the publisher urging you to create an account to claim some of the \"free\" DLCs - the purpose is to collect data, and force you into their own website I assume (to raise statistics and show it to the management?). Why bother releasing game on Steam if you can't offer free DLCs to Steam users? I don't want your stupid 3rd party website.\n\nI don't recommend this game. I like Warhammer, but CA is a terrible company. I updated this review and in the meantime there have been at least a few different internet dramas with them involved.\n\nI would personally rather pay 70$ to a company that cares and provides a fun product (e.g. Lorian), than a DLC-locked tech demo... that \"stock\" Warhammer sure is.\n- Having currently 1340 hours of playtime and having reached the highest achievable rank (Grand Champion), I can't currently recommend others to follow what I've been doing.\n\nWhile I love the game for it's smooth gameplay and somewhat balanced roster of playable character, the company, Stunlock Studios, are simply not caring for this game the way it deserves. In the start of 2018 we got a roadmap of promised features. This roadmap has since been tossed aside, and the community mocked, as they left battlerite arena development for months to do a battleroyale gamemode, which then turned into a standalone game, which then flopped and as of now has around 1/10 of the active playerbase that Battlerite has.\n\nAs others have also said, the matchmaking is horrible, especially at higher ranks. This can probably be attributed to the low playercount. At the highest ranks, it would not be uncommon to have a queue of 10-15 minutes only to be matched against people at a significantly lower skill level, which then leaves everyone in the match unhappy. This is in Europe, which I believe is the region with the highest playercount.\n\nTo sum it up, I believe this was a game with great potential, which has been wasted by a company with 40 employees, somehow only doing updates like they were a company of 3 people.\n- If you're a STAR RAIDERS fan, look elsewhere, it's broken.\nFirst off, I  think they did a fantastic job on the Star Raiders port,\nthe controls are spot on, it works seamlessly with a controller,\nall the keyboard controls were mapped brilliantly, great job.\n\nBut....\n\nAlthough the NOVICE and PILOT missions work well, those who adorn the game will\nselect WARRIOR or COMMANDER and sadly, these higher levels are broken.\n\nOnce you get down to the remaining 8 enemies or so on the map, the difficulty ramps up to insanity.\nCome out of a warp, get plummeted by 3+ meteors in a row.\nPhotons gone.\nRinse and repeat until you just give up, it's relentless, and I've yet to be able to finish a game on COMMANDER\nlevel because of this.\n\nI've tried all the different speed modes, original, opengl and direct3d, nothing helps, it's broken.\n\nAnother minor gripe is that the \"Destroyed Engines\" mode is just the \"Damaged Engines\" and barely impacts\nyour speed.\n\nI really hope that this is patched, I'll gladly revise the review once it is.\n\nEverything else is great, the arcade ports are fine, the controls are practically 1:1 in the trackball games,\nthey all feel just like the arcade (unlike Atari Vault, cough cough).\n\nThe Jaguar games are a blast, T2K still rules. I would have loved to see AvP, perhaps a future DLC.\n\nBut the main reason I spent $40 was for Star Raiders, one of my all time favorite games, and in it's current\nstate, I feel like I've wasted my money, sadly I spent so much time troubleshooting it, my refund window is gone.\n\nI'd say wait for this on a heavy sale and if you're a die hard Star Raiders fan, don't do it until it's patched!\n\nAnd still no word from the developers on any patches.........you guys out there?!? \n\n- [i]\"The Display says 'Nothing'\"[/i]\n\"Nothing or 'Nothing'\"?\n[i]\"It's BLANK!\"[/i]\n\"'Blank' OK Great. What is on the Middle Right button?\"\n[i]\"NO!\"[/i]\n\"Middle Right!\"\n[i]\"NO!\"[/i]\n\"What you you mean No!? I HAVE THE MANUAL!\"\n\n[h1]**BOOOOOOOOM**[/h1]\n\n10/10\n- Finally a visual novel that allows me to pick my favourite man without it locking me out due to not completing every other route. Limbo here I come baby\n- Plays and looks just like the Park Ranger and Cruise Director HOG series, if you enjoyed those then you will likely enjoy this series. Game is composed of hidden object scenes and simple puzzle transitions that have a loose story to bridge the movement between them. The hidden object scenes follow an older couple as they take their grandchildren to a variety of European counties on their vacation, they sprinkle in a few interesting facts between each location. There are collectibles in each scene along with a raccoon. I overall enjoyed it for a laid back experience and the weirdly fun photostock based scenes. It took me about 2.5 hours to play through the game along with the bonus scenes/puzzles.\n- [b][i]Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout[/i][/b] is a 60 Player Battle Royal game of minigames to triumph over everybody for the sweet, GOLDEN CROWN\n[list]\n[*] Put in about 40 hours in combination on Beta 1 & 2\n[*] Won a ton and lost a ton\n[*] Enjoyed EVERY SECOND \n[/list]\n[b][u]PROS[/u][/b]\n[list]\n[*] Decent amount of minigames for launch, and even when you play the same ones they feel fun when different things happen\n[*] Games go fast if you're winning OR losing, you're able to play a lot and experience the game faster to get better\n[*] The BIG majority of the cosmetics in the game are NOT locked behind a paywall. Release has one $5 DLC for a hamburger, slurpee, and frie cosmetic but there are a TON of cosmetics to earn through the free battle pass they give you + the daily shop where you can buy cosmetics with earned in game currency\n[*] Customization for your character is extremely extensive and allows a lot of different combos\n[*] The game is literally just FUN, like play for hours with friends fun. There is NO stress\n[/list]\n[b][u]CONS[/u][/b]\n[list]\n[*] See-saw minigame is very advantaged to the players in the front due to how messed up the see saws behind you get clogged with players and being on sides for WAY too long\n[*] Grabbing is a bit weird and janky, sometimes its useful and sometimes it actually screws you over\n[*] Ragdoll physics sometimes cause you to roll a ton after falling (I like this feature a ton but others don't)\n[/list]\n\n[b] I definitely reccommend picking this game up. The Devs put a lot of time and effort into a game and for $20 it is actually steal. This game will provide hours of content, especially with them already announcing they will update with new cosmetics and mini-games as ready. Please give this game a shot :)\n- a very interesting FPS multiplayer and co-op, It would be better if it was still in development like early access because it needs some work. shorter spawn times, vehicles , larger and more varied maps, what this game has that no other FPS has is realistic weapons. you will not find another game that models modern military grade firearms more realisticily in terms of what they sound like ,recoil, look, feel ( to the extent that a pc game can offer) they are amazing and I would buy this game for 8 bucks just for that alone. But it does need work , this game could be a great title to rival Battlefield and COD franchises ( maybe not Advanced Warfare) it may not surpass those titles but it could give them a better run for the money.\n- nice game but pls improve ur anti cheat\n- F2P update: Hey it's free now! STDs are free - avoid it.\n\nIt was great at the start, I put many hours into it. \n\nAaaand now it's aggressively monetised, forces all this microtransaction garbage on you, battle pass rubbish, skins, emotes, crates, more than one premium currency.\n\nAND they have the gall to ask £26.99 RRP for this? $30 to have the privilege of paying more money.\n\nMake it free at this point, you want to be Fortnite so bad.\n\nYou either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.\n- Don't let the horror tag scare you off; there are no jump scares, no over-the-top gore (there is some, but it's all pixels), nothing that leads to nightmares (at least not for me); and there are good endings too.\n\nA good story that takes about 4 hours to complete (including multiple endings -- there's a chapter select option after you finish so you don't have to replay the whole game). Some puzzles, a lot of cutscenes (all skippable, but worth reading). There's a lot of humour to be found in here too!\n- To be honest, I could've typed this review up years ago when I got this, but I never knew how to make a review. But I'm here now, and I'm doing this... Okay, here we go...\nThe Good(AKA:Everything):\n-Cars go crunch here so you don't have to crash IRL(Though I know that won't stop all of you...).\n-Great cars and maps with nice little details.\n-An INCREDIBLE modding community. There's and ENDLESS supply of content coming out all the time from hard-working individuals, all so we can take your masterpieces and turn them into heaps of scrap.\nThe Bad(AKA:What bad?):\n-This is on me... but it can get a little boring, as your mostly just crashing cars. There are so challenges to do in game, and there are so many things you COULD do... but I guess I don't have the imagination to do that. Like I said, this is bad on me. No fault of the game.\n-Game is really graphics heavy, so a higher-end PC is recommended. Nothing too fancy, but RAM and GPU are hardest hit... maybe processor too...(I'm not that smart with tech...) But this isn't truly bad, as you probably already have good spec if you're looking to play a physics-heavy game.\n-Load times... They used to be bad, but they've gotten considerably better in recent updates. But... the more mods you get, the more it'll have to load. A good PC should be able to handle it, but just keep this in mind.(I have 100's of mods, and it's not too bad...)\nAnd well, that's it. Sorry this it so long... One of my first reviews, after all. But this game deserves to looked at in detail. If you play it once, you'll come back to it here and there to have more fun. So, in short, I HIGHLY recommend this game!\nIf you read this far, thank you so much! I tried my best here!\n\n- Someone has to be the first, I guess.\n\nI don't know, I just didn't really feel too hooked on the game's premise. I feel less like I'm solving a puzzle and more like I'm hitting a pinata for all the clues. Every replay, I'm just going to have to do something whacky in order to get a new clue as to what might further my cause. And that doesn't really make me feel like I'm a part of a story, as much as a I feel like I'm going through an eternally looping monday, getting increasingly distanced to the world around me as I finally end up throwing myself overboard, because 'why not?'.\n\nI won't refund it, because I think the devs have poured a lot of heart into this game and I do think they deserve the money, but I couldn't really find too much entertainment in the game.\n- (UPDATED AS OF 1/1/23 AT BOTTOM)\n\nGame doesn't load. Running steam/EA (Origin)/Fifa23.exe as admins doesn't work. Reinstalling EA Anticheat doesn't work. Allowing everything thru firewall and antivirus (even turning them off) doesn't work. Changing bios to secure boot didn't work. Reinstalling game doesn't work. Any and all combinations of the above does not work.\n\nRequested refund from Steam. I have played maybe 4-6 hours right when it came out before the small update they pushed stopped it being able to load. I tried reverting to that initial version, doesn't work. But because Steam said I played more than 2 hours they won't refund it, even though it doesn't work. They told me to talk to EA. Requested refund from EA. They said to talk to Steam.\n\nGame won't work. EA wont fix it. They steal your money. Filing a report with the Better Business Bureau AND a deceptive practices report with the State's AG office, against BOTH Steam and EA. F them both, thieving C's.\n\n\nUPDATE:\n\nFiled a BBB report on EA. They said they cannot offer resolution such as a refund since I purchased through Steam. When I ask for a refund through Steam they state even though the game no longer works, its past their refund window and they cannot refund. \n\nSo, filing a BBB report on Steam. If that fails to refund, then I am filing a Deceptive Practices report with my State's Attorney General's Office. I'll update further, potential class action lawsuit in the works.\n\nAlso Steam has an F rating on the BBB - I wonder why??\n\n\nUPDATE 2 (1/1/2023);\nFinally got the game to play, here is how (worked for me - may not for others)\n-Uninstall Fifa 23\n-Uninstall EA App\n-Uninstall EA Anticheat in Programs Folder \n-Delete all EA Folders in Programs Folder\n-Close Steam, right click, Properties, Compatibility Tab, Run As Administrator.\n-Used CCleaner to delete all temporary files and clean registry errors\n-Settings, Gaming, Xbox Control Bar, Turn the Slider Off\n-Restart\n-Install Origin App, login, close, set to run as administrator\n-Reinstall Fifa 23 through Steam\n-Set Fifa 23 to run as administrator in the steamapps folder.\n-Set EA Anticheat to run as administrator in both locations: Programs Folder (under EA) AND Programs(x86) Folder under Steam\n-Restart\nOpen Steam, Open Origin, Run Fifa through Steam - WORKED FINALLY\n\nNOTE: I have been running in secure boot mode this whole time, so if you arent set to secure boot, you will also have to set that.\n\nI still dont recommend this game. It took me 4 months to figure out how to run this POS with zero help from EA and Steam. They also dropped the price of this sh!t game to like 25$ after I paid 85$ for early access and couldnt play it for 4 months. Think they'll refund that extra 60$? Fk no. So done with EA, never buying again.\n- After the past few years of broken, buggy AAA games I've started to lose the passion I once had for the industry. This masterpiece came out of no where and completely reignited my love for gaming. PLEASE do not sleep on this game, it's such a breath of fresh air from the garbage you'd normally expect from modern day companies. Definitely taking a spot in my top 5 favorites and I haven't even scratched the surface of the game yet, it's just that good. Beautiful art style, crisp animations, a unique concept, FUN gameplay, its everything I've been wanting and more. Kudos to the devs for making this absolute banger <3\n- On January 9th,  without warning, explanation, or justification, and lacking all sense of logic, Capcom forcefully reset customizable ingame key-binds and removed the ability to rebind them. These new forced and [b][u]locked[/u][/b] key-binds are extremely biased in favor of [i]right-hand-dominant, able-handed[/i] persons and can not be remapped or swapped. However, as this function has been revoked from PC keyboard/mouse customers, it has been ADDED for console controllers. \n\nCapcom has yet to address or even acknowledge this change.\n\n[b]If you are left-handed, handicapped, or for other reasons require customizable mouse/keyboard functions, Capcom has forcefully revoked the ability for you to play this game anymore.[/b]\n- Game does not become better with release.\nDups AI still retarded, they literally wasting time instead of doing work.\n\nJust a quick example:\nDup can go to the left side of map dig !!ONE!! block, then go to right side of the map and harvest !!ONE!! plant, then go back to the left side of map and dig second block. It's unbelivable boring watching all these.\n\nAnd you still can't destroy ruins, OMG. You can lunch rocket but can't destroy some ruins.\n- I really liked the concept of this game of navigating through orbits to collect crates and then successfully landing on the exit.  However, there just isn't enough content to justify it being sold as a complete product, especially at its current price of $6.99.  You see everything there is in the first couple of levels.  No new mechanics are added to the game as you progress.  The developer admits that the game is too simple and the fix was to add artificial difficulty to make the game longer.  For instance, rather than have intuitive controls using toggles, it requires the player to activate thrusters with one hand and turn them off with another.  The level design stops adding anything new and just adds more tedious narrow paths that must be navigated rather than an actual challenge or puzzles.  Finally, the DLC appears to be “pay to win” rather than getting any new content, it just gives the player access to aircraft that should be included already in the game.  By level 9 it is near impossible to progress any further with the default ship as it cannot accelerate fast enough to get through the small orbit and requires purchasing the DLC to advance the level.\n- TLDR: Right now, since there are no \"NEUTRAL\" reviews on Steam, IN IT'S CURRENT STATE, its a no from me. If the bugs get ironed out, its a pretty good game. If it gets fixed, I'll likely change to a recommend.\n\nGot 2 copies as a Fig Backer to play with my brother. My single player experience (POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILERS):\n\nGOOD:\n--Love that the choices REALLY matter and there are a LOT of them in this game.\n--Many different ways to approach a situation and your reputation affects interactions. Your reputation MAY be good enough to talk yourself out of fights! Many opportunities for KISS ASS and HARD ASS and other Squad builds (Nerd stuff, Mechanics, etc.) to be useful throughout the game.\n--The fire modes have grown on me. Some weapons have their own perks which add a fire mode. Other fire modes are available via perks you can obtain in the perk tree. The Precision Strike you get once your strike meter is full is very powerful and can change a fight (can malfunction a robot with aimed shot or fire a huge burst to take out multiple hostiles).\n--You can build a new squad member at any time that will start at your current level. Messed up a squad member build? That's okay, just create a new one.\n--I like the PREPARE and AMBUSH abilities. PREPARE lets you save up to 2 AP for next turn. The AMBUSH ability allows your squad members to trade in some AP to fire on an enemy that enters their range during hostile turns.\n--I love the Animal Whisperer skill and animal companions. I like the variety of animals you can bring along with your squad.\n--Shift key to highlight stuff you can interact with. This takes away having to pixel hunt for obscured boxes and containers. When you get old and can't see as well you appreciate stuff like this.\n--I like that I only have to loot one body at the end of combat and I can easily cycle through and grab the loot from all the other lootable bodies in the area.\n--A high Luck attribute will occasionally result in more loot, and even free actions. Sometimes you'll get a free attack or a free movement from a lucky action.\n--I like the variety and usefulness of Utilities (+5% XP, +2 PER, +1 Weapon/Armor modding, etc.)\n--A lot of stuff that can be used for cover can also be shot and destroyed.\n--Humor can be a bit over-the-top, but I've chortled quite a few times.\n\nNOT SURE:\n--Can only charm a single animal per squad member with Animal Whisperer. You CAN get other special animal followers that don't count as the single. While disappointed, I can see why they limited it (more would be OP and they can start to get in the way during combat).\n--Enemies have a circular view area, which means even if you're trying to sneak past behind them, you can still be \"seen\" after a brief time.\n\nBAD/BUGS:\n--Cant team crouch. You have to manually go through all of your squad and crouch them 1 by 1, and it costs 2 AP to crouch in combat. You also cant move crouched as far as I know. You can't \"change stances\" (AKA crouch or stand up) while in cover, either. Save a game right before a fight with all your squad members crouched and ready to go? When combat locks up and you have to load the save, you have to re-crouch everybody.\n--Combat can lock up, causing you to have to reload a previous save (for me, twice per play session usually but sometimes twice for the same fight).\n--Attributes, Skills, Combat Buffs/Debuffs (and probably other stuff) need more tool tips.\n--Lost character progression.\n--Very laggy Dialogue Tree and later in the game the inventory gets laggy too.\n--Creating a Bookworm Squad Member with 1 STR creates a situation where your Squad Member is losing 3 CON (total hit points) every level up and will be erased like Marty McFly in B2TF.\n--Load screens are too long. 30+ seconds to load into different zones, over 1.5 minutes to load a game on SSD. From another review: \"while we wait, let us read the lore books we've collected.\"\n--Squad portraits don't stay in order.\n--When you have more than 6 Ranger recruits in the select character screen, the \"Companions\" section gets pushed off-screen, hiding their portraits, and making it very unintuitive to add them back into your squad (you have to use the keyboard). Need a scroll bar here.\n--Saves don't have specific names so can be easily overwritten. There is only 1 autosave by default, and later on the game autosaves right after a game changing decision, making you have to revert to a manual save (2 hours earlier for me) if you wanted to try different options. I recommend turning on timed saves as well as taking advantage of quicksaves (and of course saving often!)\n--FPS drops, sometimes so bad you have to reload.\n--Squad Members shooting through walls/floors/ceilings.\n--Radiation difficult to detect in some areas and no warning (other than your squad health draining) going from radiation level 2 to 3 for instance.\n--Combat messages briefly appear above your acting Squad Member's head and are easy to miss (like \"Out of Range\")\n--When getting shot at, the camera doesn't always auto focus on who is shooting you.\n--At least three bugged missions I can think of (but hey, one is an unlimited money glitch so more of a feature).\n--Character models and other things (switches) not loading properly leading to invisible characters you can interact with (or fight with, as it happens in combat sometimes too).\n--The game can become unresponsive when trying to move 2 Squad Members separately and interact with someone.\n--Explosive Barrels not actually exploding when shot (this seems to be related to being too far away from the barrel when sniping it, as if you get closer, they'll actually explode).\n--Cybernetic Implants are a good idea, but they take up your Utility Slot instead of giving you another slot dedicated to them so when you have the ability to finally use them, it feels more like a trade-off rather than an augmentation.\n--No Inventory filter for Utilities. Gotta scroll through your hundreds of items and the Utilities aren't even grouped together entirely in the inventory, they are scattered throughout.\n--When you open a door to a closed room, fog of war usually obscures what is in the room until you physically walk a squad member into the room.\n--Cannot have multiple types of the same animal in a Squad with multiple Animal Whisperers.\n--Don't try to loot two containers at once.\n--Some traps can't be disarmed.\n--Various graphic glitches like missing texture or dialogue bubbles that are blank or don't disappear.\n--Can't remove and reuse weapon mods.\n--Some equipped weapons will display inflated damage numbers (by 300% in some cases) until re-equipped. Not even sure how long it has been that way or if it was affecting my game.\n--If you misclick the filter categories in a vendor encounter on the World Map, it'll kick you out of the encounter to the radio and you can't get back to the random encounter at that time. I only mention this since I've done it so many times.\n--You can't pause the game which may or may not affect time sensitive quests. You can be detected and attacked in the menu (escape key) or in your inventory.\n--There is no way to have Special companions/followers that you get from Missions follow a different squad member. If you dump that Squad Member later, you lose the follower too (as far as I know).\n--Get radio signals with \"coordinates to follow\" yet I have no clue who from or what it opened up on the map (if anything).\n--Gaining access to certain parts of the Rangers HQ requires you to do something pretty awful.\n--I'm out of room....\n\nIt feels like I'm fighting against the game more than the Wasteland sometimes. I don't even want to try multiplayer until it gets fixed (and my brother doesn't either).\n\nIf you're a developer of this game, thank you for your time and effort! Polish it up and I'll be happy to change this to a recommend! Edited for clarity/additions and I cut a lot. Thank you for reading and thank you for the comments and awards! Have a great day and be kind to others.\n- Honestly this game feels like it was made for me.\nQuoting iron pineapple:\"this guy (the dev) just gets it\". And he really does! The level design is great and the areas are cool and unique and a real joy to explore! A really slick zelda-like souls-like-ish game. \nBut that's not all.\nThe gimmick of this game, and the thing that really sets it apart and makes it go above the rest, is the manual. The whole gimmick is that the game is written, mostly, in an unknown runic language, forcing the player to figure out game mechanics, progression and puzzles on their own. You have only one thing to help you: as you progress you collect pages of a manual, in the style of those old console games, which gives you again pseudo-cryptic hints, because it's also mostly in the other language.\nThe way the manual and the knowledge based progression flow into the design of the game is nothing short of genius. It's hard to gosh about just how amazing it is, because that would be spoiling it, but it's completely genius. \nGame's a masterpiece for me, a strange mesh of Hollow Knight  meets  Outer Wilds-based knowledge progression. \nDefinitely a must-buy, don't even worry about it going on a sale, it's an easy indie GOTY for me\n- OMG I LOVE THIS SO MUCH!\nFun to control, it runs fine on my potato Laptop\nIts colorful\nits fun\nits amazingly well animated\ni love the map, i love the bosses so far, i love everythign about this,\nlock on aiming with RB is awesome, special weapons, parries, and attacks you buy from the shop ^^ this is \nPURE GOLD\n- I remembered when I was 8, back then I used to play this on my PS3. It was one of the first RPG games i've ever played aside from Pokemon on GameBoy / Nintendo DS. This game made me feel like I'm in an another world back then. I had dreams of my companion and Drippy. It was such a nostalgic moment when I opened this game, and I was abit sad because I wished that I could turn back time and finish this game when I was a kid. I wasn't able to finish it at that time due to my brother taking away the PS3 overseas. Because now, after getting older, there are so many responsibilities that I must hold on to. Playing games like this during childhood truly changes the vibe of experiencing it. Now I only got a glimpse of it when I opened it for an hour or so. Maybe one day I'll finish this game, once I'm free from reality.\n- I've been waiting since the likes of Planescape Torment and Baldurs Gate 2 for a game to match their sheer perfection, many games came quite close, but Divinity Original Sin just manages to hit so many nails on the head its not funny. It looks great and still plays fine on my aging PC, it has a great storyline, it's two protagonists have some great interactions and dialogue. The voice acting is spot on and it has the most sublime OST.\n\nThe combat is turn-based but do not let this put you off, there are so many choices in combat with the interaction of spells with each other and the environment, that the game just begs you to experiment with different tactics.\n\nThis game just oozes pure class, it was a labour of love for Larian and it shows in every tiny detail of the game.\nIf you like RPG games (or even just pure quality games), you need to play this game, it is the benchmark I will use in comparing other games in future.\n\nWell done Larian.\n- I played the demo and instantly became enamored. The mix of Slay the Spire-style deck-building with elements of the ship combat from FTL: Faster Than Light is an absolutely fascinating mix, and the \"single-axis\" movement system adds a whole extra layer that I've never seen in anything except the Mega Man: Battle Network series.\n\nI bought the full game within the first hour of being available. After having played for nearly 4 hours at the time of writing, my opinion hasn't changed in the slightest. I already love what's available and so far I feel like I've barely scratched the surface.\n\nI can't wait to see what awaits in the future for this awesome title.\n\nEDIT: As a small addition, I will say: I beat my very first run, which is set to the lowest difficulty (Normal). I jumped up to Hard to try to unlock a new ship, and I haven't been able to beat a run since then. It's probably just that I'm bad, all things considered, but be aware that the changes made with difficulty increases are probably more impactful than they may seem.\n\nAlso I wanna say to the devs: thank you for launching the game with mod support and working on making it easier! But also please look into getting Steam Workshop support if you can!\n- This is half of a very good game. You might be impressed in the first 10 hours, but after that it becomes evident you are playing the skeleton of what could be a generational game. Here is some of the good and some of the bad.\n\nThe Good:\n-Graphics look great, even on lower settings\n-Decently varied battle maps\n-Sound design makes killing blows feel amazing\n-Decent variety of weapons\n\nThe Bad:\n-Extremely shallow \"campaign\"\n-Almost zero role playing elements. Every character behaves identically towards you. Even your own wife will try to introduce herself. Kill someone's father/brother/entire clan? They will never mention it and will behave towards you just like anyone else.\n-\"Realistic mode\" means all your enemies will be absolute tank meat sponges while you are made of glass.\n-After you get your first settlement the game becomes extremely tedious. You will play whack a mole with enemy armies who take almost no time to recuperate. Wipe out 3 enemy armies in a massive, \"war changing battle\"? Oops, looks like all of those armies are back to full strength in a matter of days.\n-Almost zero variation of playstyles. Sure you can be a trader or a rogue mercenary for the early game, but you will always end up cheesing the smithing economy mechanics to support the larger armies you need in the mid game\n\nThis is simply an unfinished game. The fact they have been selling it for $50 successfully for years is wild.\nWould have much rather paid $100 for a fully finished product.\n\nUnless they have a massive overhaul on the \"Official Release\" October 25th, I cannot recommend this game. Shame.\n- First off, the graphics pictured here are NOT what the game looks like. Even in Ultra mode it doesn't come close to looking this \"good.\" \n\nSecond, this game is best played with a controller. Not that I mind this, but after years of mouse + keyboard play it was difficult to get used to switching over.\n\nThird, it says you can alter the dungeon and create new paths and doorways and etc. I received an item that supposedly allowed me to do this but I couldn't get it to work.\n\nFinally, for the price of this game, it should be something spectacular. It wasn't. I've purchased $10 games on Steam that are much better than this. Wait for a big sale if you're interested in this game.\n- 🎃 Tя!cked not Tяeated 🎃 full price $29.99 you can only play a 10 min Light Version. I had hoped that was a joke? I tried Steam \"Offline\" mode still blocked me from Full Monty 18+ XP Room 👎🏻\n\nSteam Refunded 😩 see discussions click 💭 icon\n\n⚪️ $29.99 is greedy money grab for no sex play content.\n⚪️ We can't get anyone to answer back how we buy 18+ Version.\n⚪️ I can see from the Web Site they have a Mobile VR Truck just for Sensual VR and look to now be renting rooms in popular restaurants around Germany. \n\nI honestly believe until the DEV's of this game have fully exhausted it's Euro revenue stream from VR Room Rentals and VR Mobile Truck. They will not sell us the public it's 18+ XP Room from it's Web Site.  \n\nNote to Publisher: Anything less than changing this to a Free Demo from all the above I've stated.  Then you don't belong on steam store.\n- For the past 4 years I couldn't get myself to finish a single game without having to force myself to do it(and even then I failed). I couldn't enjoy SP games no matter how good the gameplay or the story was. I kept buying games hoping to find that one game that would do the trick. This was FF XV for me. Despite of all my friends advising me against buying it because it was just going to be another game that would sit around in my library, I decided to give it a try.\n\nIt actually felt like I went back in time to when I could play SP games for hours without getting bored after an hour or two.\n\nI admit I skipped most sidequests and I'll try going back to them sooner or later, although it may not be the best game out there in terms of content(you can finish the game on easy skipping most secondary quests in about 20-25 hours) or story development, playing through it felt like a new experience. In fact, even after finishing the game there's still plenty of things to do and in my opinion, even playing it through again just to spend more time with Noctis and his friends is worth it.\n\nThe story is not mindblowing, the combat system is really fun but far from flawless, most sidequests aren't well written but at its core, at least for me, FF XV has something to it that other games lack. I can't say it magically restored my old passion for gaming but it has given me a reason to at least try to get into it again.\n\nIf you haven't played it yet I sincerely envy you, I would love to experience it all over again from the start, it has been a memorable journey to say the least and I hope that you are willing to give it a try. ^^\n- I bought this game in order to review it, seeing as there were no current reviews for it. \nI thought I'd help the game out by maybe giving it that tiny bit of publicity it needed to get off the ground.\nIn doing so I have failed. As this game isn't worth reviewing, there is nothing to review. Well, I should say there is stuff to review but I feel as though the dev's didn't even attempt to make this a game that anyone would enjoy. Well actually I'll let them off of the target of \"enjoy\", I'd go further to say it doesn't even feel like they tried to make a game that someone who had nothing to do and was bored out of their mind would say maybe I'll play this for a bit\nI jumped straight in, ignored the help in menu and started playing. It took me at least 4-5 mins before I even had the slightest concept of what was going on and what I had to achieve. Once I did get the hang of it I still thought \"I must be missing something, I'm not really doing anything\" so I ventured to the help menu to find that nope, thats it buddy.\nThe controls are lacking, the soundtrack and the sound effects (which happen to be a melody playing) do not blend at all, (they play completely out of time on top of the soundtrack).\nYou can buy it and prove me wrong, go ahead. This is just my opinion.\n- buy it on sale. campaign was decent, however The Last Tiger mission was a standout. Multiplayer experience is ok overall, the hackers make it the worst bit. 6.5/10, if Dice fixes their servers and clears out the hackers then maybe it's worthy of an 8/10.\n- Just go play it. It's only $20, and you have a 2hr refund limit. You'll love it way before then.\n\n...still here? Quick review. Awesome platformer, hits all the marks in flying colors. Let's compare w Mario Maker, the most similar game to this one:\n\n[edit: Updated to compare to SMM2 instead of 1]\nWhat Mario Maker 2 Does Better\n- Mario\n- Different themes/gameplay physics across multiple mario games\n- Much larger playerbase\n\nWhat Levelhead Does Better\n- Oh my god the search functionality\n    - Search by creator, difficulty, tags, what's popular, etc.\n    - TL;DR you can find the awesome, and avoid the crap\n- Level discovery\n    - Can actively advertise my levels\n    - Get rewarded for playing people's levels\n- $20\n- Dying doesn't take 12 years to respawn\n- Fun, short campaign to slowly unlock more creative tools after seeing how they are used\n- Local Co-op (or online with Parsec)\n- Leaderboards (if you care, I personally don't)\n\nI cannot stress enough how AMAZING it is to not have to suffer through crap levels. The search functionality is soooo good; as a casual player, it is the sole reason I stopped playing Mario Maker 1. Mario Maker 2 is better, but it still falls terribly short. I think the best part is that Levelhead gives people control over the visibility of their levels, as well as incentives to play other peoples, and that is something that SMM2 unfortunately lacks.\n- I even set a calendar reminder so that I could get this on release. I wish I hadn't bothered. Going great guns until I got to the passage. Game over as I can't progress. Tried allsorts to drop the jammer but unable to do so. I guess it is a case of waiting for all the bugs to get resolved.\n- Impulse Control is a lazy, badly made ripoff of Angry Birds, with slightly less features and options, poorer physics, worse quality assets, and overall worse gameplay.  But to differentiate, they slapped a Facebook style personality quiz on the front, much like putting a hat on Frankensteins Monster works well as a disguise, you know.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, the game doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.\n\nThere's no options to change the resolution for the game or customise the graphics settings.  There's no way for gamers to ensure this is running at the native resolution of their displays... there's no guarantee this game will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.  There's no way for gamers to try improve the low quality graphics.\n\nThese technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.\n\nThe game is completely free.  This is noble a gesture that shows dedication to both gamers, and the gaming industry.  Nothing speaks more to a developers belief in themselves and their product than making their game available for everyone without remuneration.  It's a shame in this case that the implementation is below the minimum standards a dedicated PC game should offer to enthusiasts.  The quality here is simply too low for me to recommend, even for free.  I really feel like this should have been a mobile app, like the Angry Birds game this is a blatant ripoff of, but then it would have to compete with Angry Birds.  It certainly doesn't belong on PC.  Sometimes the only way to win is not to play.\n- I like this game because it is so relaxing. It has a great mix of monsters in it. You are not frighting monsters  all the time. I give this game a 5 star rating. I wish thee was a Dragon Quest Builder;s 3.\n- (This is a spoilerfree Review)\nI recommend not to search any character or even the name of the game to avoid spoilers.\n\nBasic:\nDanganronpa Trigger Happy Havoc is a murder-mystery game with a focus on deep Story.\nThere are 3 main games and 1 spin-off game. This is the First one to start with.\nYou can expect about 40 to 50 hours in this game (depending on how fast you can read and think)\nI recommend reading all dialogue and not skipping any cutscenes.\nThe overall gameplay is simple and hard at the same time, but I bet everybody could play it.\n\nStory: (Spoilerfree/no spoiler)\nThe game is about a bunch of Students who were being dragged into a Killing Game.\nThe only way to escape is by killing another Student and getting away with it.\nYou'll learn more about it while playing, there are a bunch of unsolved questions in the beginning.\n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay is mostly divided into 2 different Parts: typical visual novel gameplay\n(freetime use and social interaction) and the Class Trials. In these class trials\nyou have to solve some Minigames but mostly try to discover the Murderer (or imposter if you played Among us).\nThe class trials are definitely the best Part of the game and you can be hyped about each of them.\nBefore each class trial you have to do some Investigation about the Murder and during that time you can\ntheorize who it was and how they've done it.\n\nCharacters:\nThe characters in this Game are as different as they can be. I bet you'll have different favourite ones.\nAll I can say is that you'll learn to love each and everyone on their own way.\n\nBuy Recommendation:\nDo I recommend everybody to buy this Game? No. If you are getting bored because you mostly \nonly play Shooters and MOBA's, I dont think you will enjoy this Game even if I did. But to everybody else\nwho enjoys mystery games like Ace Attorney or even mystery/detective shows I highly recommend buying this game\nand try it out. You'll enjoy it!\n\nAs I said try to avoid any spoilers. So dont look in the Steam Workshops etc.\nThank you for reading!\n- This game is for sure not perfect, but worth buying for a specific type of gamer.\n\n[b]What is good in this game?[/b]\n- It has a pretty solid gun gameplay. The movement is quick and polished as well.\n- One level is on average 20 seconds. It's fun to improve your gameplay to get better times in the small levels. \n- It's really a blast getting a perfect run, killing enemies in bullet time or exploiting the enemies weakspots.\n- There is content for around 10-15 hours. Maybe more if you consider going for 100%.\n\n[b]Anyway there are also some flaws: [/b]\n- In Neon White or Ghostrunner the movement and pace through the levels often feels like a perfect choreographic \"dance\"\n- The levels and the areas in Warstride are verry tight. I often lost pace through \"stupid\" placed rocks or small doors.\n- There is not much to explore. The levels are verry linear. While in Neon White it was so much fun to explore shortcuts or other hidden possibilities to improve ur time there are no such mechanics in Warstride at all. I'd love to have some exploration at least in the \"long levels\".\n- It could get repetitive for some players as it's a core element to complete the levels on 5 different difficulties. \n\n[b]Conclusion: [/b]\nIf you like fast paced games like Ghostrunner, Neon White or Doom and you have no problem in repeating short levels several times and u don't except an extraordinary game u will have fun for several hours on a low price.\n\n- Absolutely dated graphics that make visibility in this game a total exercise for your eyes, enemies and teammates blend into the background and scenery constantly, friendly markers everywhere obstructing your vision, insanely fast TTK with frustrating bleed mechanics...\n\nAnd the list goes on, it's beyond me how this game is being called a better one than Battlefield, are we even playing the same game at all? This game made me go back playing Battlefield 3. If you want to play a better game than 2042, play any of the others. BF3, BF4, BF1 or even 5, but please, stop shilling games like this and trying to justify it with the price and how many worked on it, this game is not even close to being better than a battlefield game at all\n- Horrible FOV, glitchy looking graphics, everything is blurred even with motion blur off, absolutely no chance of that multiplayer mod, shoddy PC port... Pretty boring and clunky tbh. Don't buy this.\n- $15 during the autumn sale was a great price for a ton of fun and a game with some truly breathtaking visuals and effects, one of the best looking games I have ever seen. It is a worthy addition to the JC franchise. Combat is more of the same from JC2, there's tons of explosions, a big open world, great sound and music, and solid mission progression without having to grind which is becoming a thing of the past now with microtransactions in games. The game's biggest flaws are that dirt bike handling is the worst vehicle handling I have ever seen in any video game, some wingsuit missions are beyond frustrating, and it is Square so it of course isn't optimized very well unless you have a powerful setup. That and the ending is one big lazy cop out sucky easy boss fight.\n\nI was luckily able to bypass optimization issues with a powerful setup and minor tweaks. So don't risk it unless this is on sale, your pc is powerful, and also provided you don't mind a few crashes in a couple missions. Just remember that Square is #1 in continually barfing out horrible pc ports and they will never learn so even with a beast pc you are still taking a chance.\n\n7/10 because of a ton of glitches I didn't mention that would take way too long to write down, and because of Square continually sucking balls on making optimized pc games. In which they cannot do.\n- Please please please give this one a try, especially if you're a fan of existentialism, bittersweet stories, cyberpunk dystopias, gambling with your life every day, living life one step at a time, the small things that matter, cats and feeling like sh!t, but in a good way\n- I waited 12+ years for a proper sequel to A Crack in Time (yes i know the other games came out but tbh they didn't do much for me) for it only to come out for the PS5. Unfortunately, I wasn't getting a new console for just one game. \n\nNow, two years later I'm playing it on the PC.  While surreal, I am super glad they ported this series to a different platform, and the game was totally worth the wait.\n\nThe port by Nixxes ran very nice for me. I had a few hitches in the dimensional portal scenes, and one crash in a total of 12hrs of playtime. I do understand that some people are having issues and that does suck & does not disqualify their experiences, however, It is not even close to how bad TLOU Pt.1's port was.  \n\nIt's another Insomniac banger, and if you've played any of their games you already know whats up. I beat the game in 12 hrs on the 2nd to last difficulty grabbing whatever side content/collectibles I could before the story captivated me. As is tradition, there is a NG+ mode (haven't touched yet) and I look forward to trying it. I'll probably update the review at that point, but the games are always repayable due to their collect-a-thon nature, that and being so damn fun you have a dumb ear-to-ear smile for all of the playtime.  \n \nIf you enjoyed the Ratchet and Clank games in the past, its way more of that + the dimensional gimmick which is really well done and very neat tech wise. I love the new movement features and Rivet is a very good addition to the cast. I hope she stays relevant in the story in the future. Game feels super good to play as well, weapons are great as always. The writing is still funny and enjoyable. It's just a good time, and I highly recommend it, even at full price.\n\nLastly, I would like to direct a message to Sony/PS Studios/Insomniac Games:\nPLEASE PORT THE OTHER AND OLDER R&C GAMES PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE IPELASE PLs I WILL PAY $70\n- The fact that you can't pause the game during cutscenes and conversations, is very frustrating. The cinematics are long (and sometimes exhausting). If your baby wakes up, If your phone rings, if someone's at the door, if you need to take a pan out of the oven... you can't pause the game! What's the deal with that? Put a pause feature! We have the technology!\n- Absolutely amazing. PLEASE don't judge this game based on how it looks. You must try it yourself! I thought it would be terrible but a friend convinced me to try it, and I'm glad he did. I haven't had so much fun in a game in a long time.\n- I have always wanted to play Resdient Evil 4, and I wanted to play this game so badly.  I am giving a negative review simply because the games FPS on the PC are bad, that could be because of Windows 10 because I heared rumors that the game does not run well on it and such, so that could be the problem.   Another problem I faced is the lip sync is dealyed when it's on the cutscenes so that makes everything slow and such.  The gameplay from what I seen however is pretty great and I think Resdient Evil 4 is a great game, but this port is not, get it for the GC, Will, PS2, or any of the consloes that has this game.\n- A missed opportunity. But, if you liked the original, you'll like this one as well.\n\nGreat graphics and sound, just like its predecessor. Once again, bonus points for ultrawide support. No complaints about the presentation, but some of the characters definitely rub me the wrong way. YMMV in that department. \n\nI had read that the original writer passed away. I see this left the team with a difficult choice. To their credit, I could not tell the difference between the two. It emulates the same style and tone, and I imagine this is intentional to honor the spirit of the original author's intent. Unfortunately, I think the writing was the worst part of the original by far, and I see this as a missed opportunity to move on from that. \n\nAll of the supernatural elements in this story are but the thinnest of veils for what is ultimately a collection of modern day social media discourse. There is rampant virtue signaling, and every character speaks about the world around them as if they live inside Twitter. There are a scant few genuine moments, and I can appreciate the fact that the writer(s?) clearly feel a lot of angst about putting themselves out there and the creative process in general. There is a complete lack of subtlety in the writing regarding this, but I see it and I get it. \n\nIt feels a lot more disappointing than the first one, as we're familiar with much of the cast already, and there's not a lot of progress or poignancy in their respective narratives. I genuinely came away from this game feeling like I spent a few hours reading Twitter threads. It's nothing but surface level social commentary.\n\nGiven that the intent here was probably to honor the original writer, I'd still be in for a Coffee Talk 3 in the hopes that they show some growth and try something different. If that one also ends up being the same, I'd definitely call it quits. \n\nFWIW, this is certainly a worthy tribute for those who do not find fault with the original.\n- This game is adrenaline, speed and acid to the absolute maximum and it delivers - you'll be doing exactly what you see in the trailers in absolutely no time and feeling like a badass!\n\nWe have all the menu, leaderboards and replay system as in Devil Daggers along with a new clips section for highlights from runs. \nThe new scoring system is a HUGE improvement. In DD you had to survive as long as possible leading to it becoming repetitive as you grinded, here the score is based on how fast you can kill stuff and there is an ending to the run meaning you might survive to the end and kill the boss - but someone else could beat your score by killing stuff faster in the first min and then dying. \nThis adds loads more risk to the game as you WANT to take those risks to kill stuff faster.\n\nOnly let down is the controls, the simple control scheme worked in Devil daggers as there wasn't much going on but it REALLY hurts now theres so many new mechanics causing both a lot of unintended actions like with RMB is your laser and you can scatter this off the ground or like you see in the trailers shoot the gems for your homing daggers trouble is RMB is also grab meaning if you look at a gem and start to power your laser you simple pick up the gem and no laser huge momentum loss. Likewise spacebar is jump, dash, slide, fake and air slam this not only leads to awkward \"thats not what i wanted\" moments but also cramps my hand since you are constantly spamming for dash which is 2 presses...\n\nIf the controls dont bother you or get some love this game is easily a 10/10.\n- Hi dev, if you were wondering whether anyone would actually use your HDR feature, I am. thanks\n- An excellent maximalist mashup of Slay The Spire with some Tower Defence and CCG Mechanics. Not as tight and elegantly designed as StS, but with a lot more variety in card design leads to a lot more varied and wild interactions and deck composition. Compulsive and mechanically satisfying, Monster Train embraces excess in a satisfying way, even if the whole package is wrapped up in a slightly odd aesthetic package of half remembered hearthstone knock offs. (The soundtrack, incidentally, slaps)\n- An amazingly fun and short adventure from the creator of Rakuen. Mr. Saitou is a game based in the same universe as Rakuen, but follows the story a salaryman, Mr. Saitou. Mr. Saitou takes you on a journey that explores some serious undertones, but approaches the subjects with incredible sensitivity, respect and some very light and silly humor. There's tons of flavor text to be discovered, pop culture references to be recognized and if you've played Rakuen, familiar characters to meet. As you make your way through the story, there are lots of puzzles that are simplistic, but well thought out in a way that adds to the story.The game is made to be played in 1 sitting that may vary depending on how much you interact with the world. This game can also be played by many ages and is family friendly. You DO NOT have to play Rakuen first to enjoy this game or understand it, but it will definitely add a depth of sentimentality to the game, as there are some call backs. I would absolutely recommend this game to anyone and you may find yourself learning something about your own life during Mr. Saitou's journey.Have a long day!\n- First of all, I really like the Game, it's Gameplay is wonderful and i really enjoy the parkour to combat mix in it. Although i noticed a lot of bugs especially in COOP i still enjoy logging on the game.\n\nThe Story is good but doesn't need a upgrade in my opinion. I like that certain map changes and Story decisions are dependant on some side quests and on each other.\n\nNow to the sad part:\n\nTencent recently bought Techland which was controversial at first, but then DL points were added which made a lot of people mad at Tencent and partially Techland, understandably.\nThey Including me don't want the game to die out because a greedy company wants to make some quick buck.\n\nAlthough i have to say myself, other Tencent bought games still are quite enjoyable.\n\nI just hope that Techland does the right thing in future and makes the current state of DL points less predatory and more Cosmetic based pure.\n\nIn it current state we still have no knifes without Bundles, but that was before Tencent so the blame for that goes to Techland, but i am excited for future updates and playing Dying light 2, even without buying DL points :)\n\nI'll give this game a solid 7/10 for the bugs, microtransactions but also because it has good gameplay and community reach\n\n(I have edited my original negative review about the pure rant about DL points because i also wanted to consider current gameplay and more)\n- +Long (&quality) story mode\n\n-Sometimes utterly lost so I have to backtrack or look at playthroughs\n-No skill tree\n-Loading screens\n-Some game breaking bugs so I had to cheat to pass it (e.g. pistons in tunnel) \n-Repetitive: turn this wheel, kill this bunch of enemies to open the lock,...\n-Enemies become bullet sponges on higher difficulty modes\n-No Xen chapters, so quite a cliffhanger...\n\nIn short: it is a decent game because of the good story, but people that recommend it are probably just on a nostalgia trip.\n- This game can be great at times but extremely frustrating most of the time. 80% change to hit, miss every time. I can't keep playing a game with so much crappy coding.\n- An amazing game, you can go from doing great and having a full and maxed level crew, and end up fighting the wrong guy as they systematically destroy your ship systems leaving your weapons and shields off-line as your crew burns to death while suffocating. Very fun and has endless replayibility\n- !!!!READ TO THE BOTTOM OR SCROLL!!!!\n       !!!!69 FREE PACKS + MORE CARDS AND COSMETICS CODES!!\n                        \n I did this for the NEW community:)         \n !!MAKE SURE TO UPVOTE AND OR AWARD SO EVERYONE NEW CAN SEE!!\n\ni have played almost all the MTG online iterations, MTG 2012 2013 2014, DUEL, MTGO, Magic the Gathering Online \nTactics, and now Arena. \nMTG 2012-2014 were fun but they were limited to the cards released those years\nMagic the Gathering Online was cool, you could trade and sell cards, do actual cube and draft with bought packs, but the interface was dated even after the update..\nMagic duels was sold to us as the end all, going forward no new program just duels and they would add sets as they released..(It wasn't, they didn't)\n\nMTG Arena (this one) has done everything they said and they did not abandon it after a few years. It may have just arrived on steam but it has been a beta then stand alone client for years (i was accepted into the beta 3/2018 and beta wrapped up 9/25/2019 to give an idea) They are releasing sets and keeping in line with standard releases, they offer a ton of formats and you can earn your cards and decks. i have earned thousands of cards and hundreds and hundreds of packs for free, 1-2 packs per day is easy, and yes it takes time but each month the ladder resets and you work your way up in ranked or you can just play another format or unranked to earn gold/xp,coins which translate into packs, save your gold for drafts and open packs and pick cards or just buy a ton of packs and earn them for free with exp! Also every 6 packs you open you get a choose your own blank rare gold wild card, and every 30 packs a mythic wildcard , also you get blank commons and uncommons in packs and by playing.  and PS there is a ton of people playing all the time, you never have to wait long for a match or even a draft to kick off.\n\n(New Account info and Instructions)\nNew Accounts have to play and complete 5 mini matches to unlock 12 free cards and 5 free starter decks, then upon completion you will enter into the client and see color challenges..skip that, click on the mail icon (top right) to claim 21 free packs (as of writing) from different recent sets, then click the home button (top right) to get out of the color challenge screen to the actual deck builder and match entry\n\nHere is a list of codes that will give you a ton of packs, cards and cosmetics, the packs, also count toward your free rare and mythic wildcard count you get by opening every 6 packs. by opening these you should have enough to craft your own starter decks and even pick quite a few blank rare mythic and common uncommon wild cards ( i just tried to make a new account and i got 69 free packs total that translated to 18 common 25 uncommon 12 rare and 4 mythic wildcards and a ton of actual rares mythics and hundreds of other cards (your mileage may vary depending on how many wildcards you find in the packs as well) \n\n(enter these in the store, top right \"redeem code\" field) \nIM SURE THERE ARE MORE CODES OUT THERE THESE ARE THE ONES I KNOW WORK IN 2023\nFree Booster Pack Codes ( 48 packs from these code alone for a total of 69 with the free mail claims at time of writing)\nPlayBRO\nPlayDMUAlchemy\nPlayDMU\nplayHBG\nPlayAlchemyNewCapenna\nPlaySNC\nPlayNEOAlchemy\nPlayNEO\nPlayVOW\nPlayMID\nPlayDND\nPlayKaldheim\nPlayZendikar\nPLAYM21\nPlayIkoria\nPlayTheros\n\nEXP CODES:\nThreads\t1,000 XP\n\nCOSMETIC CODES:\nFNMATHOME\nInformationIsPower\nCrimeIsAnArtForm\nAlwaysFinishTheJob\nFunIsntFree\nReadTheFinePrint\n:updated:\n\n*REMEMBER TO UPVOTE THIS POST AND SHARE WITH OTHERS, MORE PLAYERS THE BETTER:)*\n- I love this game. I've clocked over 300 hours in it through Origin (on my ONE character xD ). It's an excellent game, even despite it being an \"open world faffaround simulator\" which was all the rage at the time.\n\nAnd finally on Steam!? Yay! Or yay..?\n\nBut, as we know, we can't have good things. Massive thumb down to the EA Origin \"integration\" in Steam. EA, how about just stop being such massive ducks?\n\nThis is the same \"we hate our customers\" behaviour expressed by d-bags like Ubisoft and Epic. Only that EA sort of makes it worse. They *know* how much people hate the unnecessary and malicious Uplay \"integration\" that Ubisoft have forced on us for several years. Seeing this, EA decides that doing the exact same thing, with their total-garbage Origin client made even worse, is surely the only way to harass the customers enough to be worthy of the EA brand. \n\nDO NOT BUY OR LINK your Steam account if you own the game on Origin from earlier. \nIf you buy a game on Steam, which you already own on Origin, it will overwrite your Origin game.\nIf you then refund the game on Steam, this will remove the game from Origin too (even if you already own it there!), and you'll spend hours in line to get a hold of customer support. Then you must chat with bots, or people who are so void of understanding (and likely not paid near enough to care) that they might as well be bots. And if you're lucky, you might, after going through 4 or 5 different \"agents\", finally get to talk to a person that comprehends English and is authorised to do anything beyond telling you \"they'll discuss it with their team\". Then you might get your game back. \nBut! You won't get back the GOTY. Because the Steam-Orgin-GOTY overwrites your Origin GOTY. And when refunding, via Steam, you're left with a dumb/lame/placeholder copy of the GOTY in your Origin library, which doesn't work, but somehow just lingers there. Then you need to get a Digital Deluxe Edition + all DLC to get back to where you were.\n\nThis [integration] is such a tremendous show of manure, that I'm actually left wondering if EA planned it. Did Andrew Wilson take one of his billions of pocked change and say \"hey, we should make an extra effort here, to make sure that this integration is as frustrating and poorly implemented as possible, but still functional, such that things are barely limping along but just barely, because nothing is as frustrating as something that just barely sorta works but only sorta, and only by the skin of its teeth. That'll teach those entitled peasants.\"\n\nSo yeah. Great game. Bad EA.\n\nUpdate! A new Origin experience: The EA App! An all new website, wrapped inside an all new Electron wrapper! For an all new Frustrating(TM) experience and much better hogging of your PC performance.\n- Lots of people parrot the \"tech demo\" or \"benchmark of the singularity\" lines without forming their own opinions.\n\nMe personally, as a fan of Supreme Commander, I enjoyed this game more then I thought I would. I only played the single player campaigns and haven't touched multiplayer. \n\nThe gameplay is exactly what it should be for this kind of game. When I first saw this game I didn't like how every unit was a hovering unit, but it makes sense with the class system the game has. Frigates are basically infantry, Cruisers are tanks, Dreadnauts are hero/high tier. The game borrows from Dawn of War with the territory control mechanic.\n- you're looking for a game review you've come to the wrong place. But if youre looking for a fantastic ravioli recipe you've come to the right place.\n\nIngredients\n- To Make the Dough\n375 grams (3 cups) plain flour\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n2 eggs\n1/4 cup (50 ml / 3½ tablespoons) olive oil\n1/2 cup (120 ml / 8 tablespoons) water\nExtra flour for dusting \n\n\n- To Make Cheese Filling\n15 ounces (425 grams) container Ricotta cheese\n5 ounces (142 g/about 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons) \"3 Cheese Italian Blend\" (Parmesan, Romano & Asiago)\nNote: grate these cheeses yourself and create your own custom blend.\n1/2 cup cheddar cheese\n2 eggs, lightly beaten\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/2 teaspoon pepper\n\n\n- Extras\nYour favorite sauce for the ravioli (i.e. marinara/ marijuana)\nParmesan cheese\nBasil\nFried vegetables\nShrimp\nFish slices\nChicken pieces \nMake the Ravioli filling.\n\n- In a small mixing bowl, add the ricotta and mash with a fork.\n- Add in the 3-cheese blend, Cheddar cheese, eggs, salt, and pepper.\n- Mix all ingredients thoroughly until you have a smooth, paste-like consistency.\n- Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. \n\nMake the Ravioli dough.\n\n- Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.\n- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.\n- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.\n- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.\n- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.\n- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).\n- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. \n\nFill the Ravioli shells.\n\n- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.\n- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.\n- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.\n- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.\n- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. \n\nForm the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.\n\n- Roll the dough into two sheets\n- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.\n- Fill with the ravioli mixture.\n- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.\n- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.\n\nCook the Ravioli.\n\n- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.\n- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.\n- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest \n- Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed plates\n\nServe it up.\nTop with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!\n- This game is like cocaine. \nI always tell myself just one more, then im done. I'll do homework. I'll sleep. I'll eat something. \nBut you know what? That last death was cheap, I'll do one more to make up for it. I just need 1000 gold for that upgrade, I'll just do one more to get it. Always just one more. \n\nThings I like:\n\n+Strong RPG Progression - Gold from your run can be spent on stats, equipment, abilities, etc. making multiple runs and longer runs more rewarding.\n\n+The game is witty and has flavor. -- there are various conditions your new characters can have such as being blind, gay or having a fear of chickens, amongst many, many others. Dying is in this sense, pretty fun. The writing has a lot of charm!\n\n+The controls are very tight -- this game has good controls. It's easy to do what you want, which is good because it's very tough and you will die a lot.\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n- The bosses in new game plus don't get harder -- As you progress into new game + or ++ or +++ and beyond, the bosses don't scale well, despite the general enemies leveling up to basically become bosses themselves. Not a huge deal, but it's the only negative I have.\n\nThen at some point you realize you've beaten the game, Thankfully there is a new game plus.\nMaybe just one more playthrough...\n- My previous review reflected the terrible state of the game as it was on launch day. After years of improvements, the game has had its map design & cover placement tweaked, pretty-boy playermodels have been dirtied up, cringy voicelines were adjusted & a bunch of new content has been added. A lot of my complaints were addressed and I recognize the amount of work the team has done to bring the game back. It finally feels content complete and has reached an acceptable level of quality that should've been there when it came out.\n\nHowever, I am still disappointed to say it falls very short of its predecessors in terms of gameplay, map design and atmosphere. I see no reason to play this instead of BF3/BF4. \n\nPlay the map Grand Bazaar in Battlefield 3. Look at all of the particle effects, post processing and detail that map has. It has such a thick rainy atmosphere. Play it through to the end and you'll see how players tear up the map and make it look destroyed. In BF4's Paracel Storm, the foliage will sway & the waves will rise as the strong winds of a storm approaches the map. Watch as a sandstorm creeps up in Gulf of Oman and eventually engulfs it in a torrent of chaos. These landscapes have so much drama that the ones in 2042 lack. Sure, there are sandstorms and tornadoes, but they still look so sterile compared to the previous games this title stands upon.\n\nConceptually, 2042's world is supposed to be on its knees. The growing reality of extreme climate, natural disasters becoming commonplace and the world powers fighting over the last resources Earth has to offer depicts a dire situation to immerse ourselves in. This makes me imagine maps where earthquakes adjust the layout of flags throughout the round, or tsunamis roll in and what once was a playable area is now flooded. Giant tornado events that tear down skyscrapers. Sandstorms that turn the widest of maps into a close-quarters brawl. \n\nThe maps in the game have some aspects of this concept but nowhere to the amount that it should. The technology is there. The previous games have had a genuinely impressive level of immersion and atmosphere. 2042 did not have this on launch and it still doesn't. This could have been the wild natural disaster Battlefield game where we see SHTF.\n\nI don't care that we have 128 player matches or goofy butt specialists to play as. They missed the mark with 2042 and no update can fix that, conceptually, it never was able to realize its potential.\n- Not For Broadcast is in the simplest of terms, a multi-tasking simulator.\n\nYou sit in a news control room and you have to keep track of multiple things: censoring curse words, switching between cameras, playing ads at the right time, ensuring your broadcast frequency isn't disrupted, as well as keeping an eye out for a bunch of other strange things that appear later in the game.\n\nThis isn't the easiest of games as it requires a good deal of attentiveness. The description isn't joking when they call this \"high-pressure\". You have to rely heavily on both audio and visual cues to make sure your broadcast doesn't get screwed up. As this is the news (and live), there is no rewind or undo button. If you mess up and want to get a good performance grade, you'll need to redo the entire news segment. \nIf you're a perfectionist like me, a 10 min segment can end up turning into an hour of trying to perfect that news segment. As such, I do hope an option to quick save, or at the very least, save and quit, can later be put into the game. It felt rather taxing having to keep an eye on so many things for so long. But as with any game, excellence isn't an art, it's a habit. You'll find yourself turning into a multitasking expert eventually.\n\nThankfully, the actors in the game do a great job of making the experience an entertaining one. There is a good amount of humour written into each broadcast, although I must admit I wasn't quite able to pay attention to all the dialogue, as I was too busy trying to switch to the right cameras whilst ensuring my electricity didn't get cut out. Luckily, the game does have an archive which allows you to playback the broadcasts. Without that, I'd probably be missing out on 70% of what was going on.\n\nThere is also a text narrative, choices matter portion in between news segments. As of now, it feels a little out of place and incomplete, but then again, this is an Early Access review.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that at the time of writing this review, there isn't really any \"propaganda\" aspect to the game yet.\n\nPerformance-wise, the game runs pretty smoothly. I did encounter occasional crashes if I looked left or right and back and forth too quickly, but other than that, the game is pretty much bug-free. Also, this game has my RTX 2070 Super running at rather high temps for some reason. Rather surprising for a game that doesn't appear to have particularly high-end graphics.\n\nAnyway, I'll be looking forward to see what comes next for this game. Definitely worth the buy despite being Early Access.\n- buy it on sale. campaign was decent, however The Last Tiger mission was a standout. Multiplayer experience is ok overall, the hackers make it the worst bit. 6.5/10, if Dice fixes their servers and clears out the hackers then maybe it's worthy of an 8/10.\n- I like to think of this game as what a Telltale game should have been.\nReal decisions that have real consequences. Allies who leave you due to the actions you take, betrayal due to dumb decisions. All of which only happen due to the choices you can make.\nBut instead of quicktime events, you play some games of Gwent.\nSome really difficult decisions as well, ones that i had to seriously stop and think about. A couple of stupidly easy ones as well, but i can forgive that.\nAlso some fantastic tongue in cheek references to other games/pop culture that i had some laugh out loud moments.\n\nYou also get to upgrade and customise your deck as you earn new cards along the way and they do that well. Save a <random character so as no spoiler> and convince him to journey with you? You know have access to his cool card (and trust me, there are some really cool cards). \nBut piss him off so he leaves, well his card is no longer available to you. I'm actually convinced ive missed a possible card or two due to some story decisions.\n\nIf there was one thing i think the game lacks, its risk.\nSome people have complained that its too easy, even on the hardest difficulty, which i think has some truth to it, but even that i dont think is the real problem.\nThe real problem is that if you lose a fight, it doesnt let you continue, you just retry till you win.\nSo if the game asks you, do you engage in a risky fight to save some of your trapped soldiers or do you leave them to their fate, you obviously would always choose the risky fight, as there is no punishment to losing the fight. You just keep retrying till you win.\nIt does take the weight away from a bunch of decisions and i also think it takes away that feeling if triumph you should get when you win the difficult fight and save the troops. You literally risked nothing.\nHowever, There are more than enough difficult decisions that have nothing to do with combat that you will still love this game.\nNot sure how they could fix this at this point, since the story is already fairly detailed with branching decisions.\nMaybe something to keep in mind for the next game. Give us fights that if we lose affect the story badly. Make it feel riskier for us to always choose the better path, so we are tempted to choose the easier one and therefore feel good when we succeed the  hard one, or feel the consequences when we fail the harder path.\n\nIs it worth the cost? I honestly think so, I haven't regret the money ive spent so far. Some people complaining its too short for what it costs (based on the 30 hour estimate, not them having actually played it), but for me its a really good quality 30 hours and i wish more games would take note.\nPeople complaining about 30 dollars for 30 hours are the reason Dragon Age Inquisition had 60 hours of useless grindy soul destroying fetch quests instead of being a streamlined, awesome game.\n- Do yourself a favor.  Go in as blind as possible.  Don't look at any guides.  The system of getting pages of the manual that you can't fully understand is a stroke of genius.\n\nAlso I haven't found a waterfall that *doesn't* have a secret behind it.\n\n**EDIT: Finished the game**\n\nI'll admit for many of the later \"post-game puzzles\" I looked at a guide for.  The in game language is very difficult to decipher blindly, and if you're not familiar with English you probably shouldn't even bother.  \n\nThe surprising thing about this game is you can pretty much do any puzzle at any given time once you get one or two specific items, but because of how the manual is handled, you'll never know how until you see the pages (or experiment a lot)\n\nI think the most amount of tries I've spent on a boss fight was 7-8, but nothing is stopping you from exploring more and finding stat boosts.\n- I appreciate the sincerity of Jusant. You can tell its creators have placed genuine care into their product, which has made the experience of playing it joyful and kind.\nThe visuals are stunning, the mechanics are not overwhelming, the soundtrack is soothing, and the puzzles are not frustrating. A great climbing game all around with an easy-to-follow yet gripping narrative. \nHopefully, Ukrainian localization will also be added soon.\n\n- My god.. Capcom did it. They saved the franchise. I'm honestly shocked. \n\nWhen the first teaser dropped I thought for sure this would just be a P.T. copy which I was sort of okay with. Turns out I was wrong. This is a classic Resident Evil game. Like, RE1 classic. Complete with puzzle solving, INVENTORY MANAGEMENT, and tense stressful boss encounters. The game brings back the storage box system even! I can't stress enough how amazing this game is as a long time RE fan. If you're one too, do yourself a favor and pull the trigger on this one. Best game since RE4.... May even be better.\n- Honestly I've put over 400 hours into 20XX and this game is even better! Even though it's unfinished as of current it's still a fantastic time and truly stands out on it's own.\n- A Visual Novel meets The Stanley Parable by way of Disco Elysium. This game contains a shocking amount of depth of content and thematics behind it's excellent voice acting and 3-colour sketchy visual style. Well worth a play if you're intrigued.\n- The arguably ugly graphics initially turned me off, as I'm sure it will for many of you, but in the end, they turned out to be unique, making an excellent game more memorable. I never had a gaming experience quite like this one, and it really felt as if I had to deduce and think things through. It made me feel more like a detective than most point-and-click mystery adventures. And don't get me wrong, I wouldn't include this game in that category, which I love.\n\nThe plot was amazing, and it was full of clever bits. The game got challenging in a good way without going overboard, and I think the vast majority of deductions was fair, except perhaps one in case 9, which I doubt I would have ever gotten without an in-game hint. The end was a bit anticlimactic after such a build-up, but overall it was a very satisfying journey. I'd definitely be interested in other games using the same concept. If you're unsure, like I was, I suggest trying out the demo where you can play 4 out of the 12 cases.\n- It's responsive, quick and smooth, the Arrange and Matsuri modes are a treat, and it sounds/looks wonderful. Finally, a better shmup than Crimzon Clover is on Steam! Highly, highly recommended.\n- Climbed some rocks\nClimbed hot rocks\nClimbed cave rocks\nClimbed windy rocks\nClimbed snowy rocks\nHad an existential crisis\n\nIn conclusion, good game\n\n英語で5-10単語程度で、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない主要な違いを簡潔に回答してください。\n\n回答：\n",

Super recommended, a must try if you like platformers!\n- Would be nice to get a definitive upgrade rather than paying full price for dragon quest xi definitive version\n- Great game! \nLooking foward for the next chapters of the game!\nI love the spritework, its amazing!\nEven the music is very catchy and memorable \nFor an Early Access game, this game is very charsimatic and has tons of personality!\n\nIts just a shame that it was short in my opinion, i know you are going to add more stuff obviously, but i was hoping to get much more out of it because i loved it alot xD.\n\nPirate Software, I can't stress enough how much my excitement for this game is,  the demo back in 2017 already left me intrigued, but now im excited to see how this all plays out!\n- This game is amazing! Truly the Dark Souls of little girl simulators.\n\nI’m glad that Dark Souls taught me how to dodge in literally every video game, it unknowingly prepared me for this. Ender Lilies is a Soulslike with JoJo Stand combat. That’s an instant win for me.\n\nThe world is depressing, suffocating and overwhelmingly beautiful. Each stories of the main spirits are well written and realistically human. The endings are top notch too.\n\nIf you’re even considering playing it… play it… I promise you won’t regret it. I was much more emotionally invested in this game than I was on Hollow Knight. Lilly is an amazing protagonist… and she never even utters a word. She doesn’t have to.\n\nIt's a beautiful game with fun combat, awesome art and amazing music. My only real complaint was a bit of exploration fatigue having to go around finding all the collectibles. \n\nI think the easiest way to sum up Ender Lilies is \"It's Momodora, but better.\" It has the same gameplay loop of \"slash slash roll behind the enemy slash slash repeat\" and fairly challenging bosses, in a much bigger and more non-linear world with nearly every single room having some sort of collectible. It's also aesthetically atmospheric and pleasing, and the soundtrack is great.\n\nI can safely say that this game is a creative masterpiece. And in the end… Like Lilly, don’t we all have a little girl inside of us, telling us to stop all this silliness and go back to being the proper good boys our Mother wanted us to be?\n\n10/10\n- please don't give an ironic positive review for this \"game\". It truly deserves the tag of \"overwhelmingly negative\" reviews.\n- This is such a great game. It's a well put together survival game with many things to do. Whether you want to just build a sandbox wilderness empire or try to escape, it's entirely fun no matter what. I've tried to actually complete the game, but I always end up building a massive epic fortress complete with my very own beefalo farm. The only thing that I personally don't like about this game is the stumble-upon style of actually completing the quests (they're not really quests, but I can't think of anything else to call them). Other than that, this game is a beautiful masterpiece. Very artistic, creative and fun. I definitely recommend it to anyone who loves survival games of any sort.\n- I wish i could recommend this more than once but sadly i cannot. Like everyone else im experiencing stuttering and the 30 frame rate cap but that is where my cons end. I dont have any special pc rig by any means yet even still i am enjoying this game SO MUCH. The story is so captivating i cant believe it, and the combat system? THE COMBAT SYSTEM IS SO FRICKING AMAZING I CANT BELIEVE IT. I HAVE NEVER FELT MORE LIKE BATMAN THAN I HAVE WHILE PLAYING THIS GAME. I ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE CONSIDERING BUYING THIS GAME AND DO YOU KNOW WHY. BECAUSE YOU'RE BATMAN. THE COMBAT SYSTEM IS INCREDIBLE. THE FLUIDITY OF ALL CONTROLS, INCREDIBLE. AND THE STORY? YEP, YOU GUESSED IT, INCREDIBLE. I CAN'T THANK ROCKSTEADY ENOUGH FOR MAKING THIS MASTERPIECE OF A GAME, IT IS SO ******* AMAZING I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n- a very interesting FPS multiplayer and co-op, It would be better if it was still in development like early access because it needs some work. shorter spawn times, vehicles , larger and more varied maps, what this game has that no other FPS has is realistic weapons. you will not find another game that models modern military grade firearms more realisticily in terms of what they sound like ,recoil, look, feel ( to the extent that a pc game can offer) they are amazing and I would buy this game for 8 bucks just for that alone. But it does need work , this game could be a great title to rival Battlefield and COD franchises ( maybe not Advanced Warfare) it may not surpass those titles but it could give them a better run for the money.\n- The popularity of this game is deserved, but very concerning.\n\nPopular indie games have a habit of ascertaining a very loud, territorial, and highly defensive following. Not only is it overwhelming for a creator, but also for its community. It creates an echo chamber that is opposed to foundational changes, which are necessary for early access games. I hope that Zeekerss will utilize this with experimental updates that explore possible additions and fixes.\n\nThat being said, the gameplay is really entertaining and complex for something that is relatively simple. It features a proximity voice chat which is ESSENTIAL, not only for the gameplay, but for the best experience. It should be played without any knowledge of its contents and with others who don't know anything either. The low-resolution, low-poly, aliasing aren't what sell its visuals - the animations, technology and UI design do. The player's running animation is cheesy as hell and it's great. A lot of the animations and movement in this game are genuinely spectacular. I haven't had this much fun with something new in a long time, and that's insanely rare for me.\n\n(Ironically, one of those recent games was DOORS, another Roblox developer game. Now, I couldn't pin it down, but I could tell it was made by a Roblox developer without seeing the splash screen. Maybe it's the jumping? The inventory slots? The items?)\n\n[Play if you like / vice versa:  SCP: CONTAINMENT BREACH, DOORS, DEEP ROCK GALACTIC.]\n\nFeedback: \n- [spoiler]The mansions would be more impactful if every location had a random chance to be one. It would need to be balanced out by that random chance becoming higher on later planets. Is it inspired by the Memories movie, by the way?[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The way the girl is handled is diabolical and I LOVE it.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]It would be very interesting to have a character that plays back what the players say.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]Something else that would be interesting is a fake player roaming around to misdirect.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The backrooms reference is way too common and is really out of place. It also wastes an opportunity to actually have some kind of rare, temporary dimensional door that a player can get separated by.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The moon interiors lack visual distinction and don't reflect their locations.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The enemy variety is pretty great, but some feel really out of place. Mines/turrets in the mansions? Jesters in bunkers? It's aesthetically dissonant. It would be much better if the enemies were categorized to be in specific places. There could still be varying overlaps; like some enemies could be in all places, some are only in one, and others are in a few but not others. This would allow for a great opportunity to have different \"biomes\" or bunkers, like military, paranormal, bio/alien research, etc. [/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]A lot of enemy designs are actually really freaky and fit within the established environments. Coilheads have a really great sound, but the giant spring is really wacky. The Jester is even worse, with a massive skull and human legs that no one can take seriously. [/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]You could have moons that play off the mechanics of a specific enemy pool to create unique, difficult circumstances.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The exteriors lack loot.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]As far as I have noticed, the mountain creatures are generally unfair. If they aren't already, they should be dependent on the presence of flashlights, glowing loot, ship lights, flashbangs, etc.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The sprint meter could be dropped, as the loot weight and footstep volume are effective in punishing the player.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]I worry that the game will adopt a system in which new moons are locked behind higher and higher costs. If it does, new content will only be accessible after playing a lot of what you've seen before, and it wouldn't be guaranteed. Simultaneously, new content could be immediately accessible, but then overwhelm and cram the base game.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The \"days remaining\" mechanic could be repurposed as a \"liftoffs remaining\" mechanic. This would allow moons, which would have different rotational speeds, to allow different durations of visits. This could allow for longer visits with higher rewards and risk, similar to Deep Rock Galactic's \"Deep Dives.\"[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The game doesn't have much lore, and since that's not the focus, that's fine. If this were to change in the future, consider stronger world-building that interweaves its contents.[/spoiler]\n- The music is really out of place when it plays in interiors, but the title music kicks ass.\n- The \"taunts\" are great and I hope we get even more.\n- The health UI looks way too similar to Outer Wilds.\n- The bestiary and logs should probably be client-side.\n- The quotas should scale dependent on player quota, as more players means more money.\n- [spoiler]The turrets and mines should really detect the monsters. That's what they're there for, no?[/spoilers]\n- Persona 5 ain't shit\nPokemon ain't shit\nFinal Fantasy ain't shit.\n\nStar Ocean 2's been the shit, will always be the shit, and with this remaster - IS THE BEST REMASTER FOR A JRPG OF ALL TIME. THE GOAT FROM SPACE RETURNS!\n\nAlso is it just me or is Precis extra horny on main? I don't recall her being this forward on the PS1, but hey - cool game that doesn't shy away from the old stuff on the hunt for ESG Blackrock points.\n\nTEN OUTTA TEN\n- Life is Norway sure is Strange huh :)\nAs you can see the game has a low poly artstyle, which I normally don't much like, but here it looks extremely good, especially when the camera zooms out to show more of the landscape.\nDefinitely also check out the dev's other game, Milkmaid of the Milky Way. Both games are very good.\n- If you somehow don't know what this is: It's a meta-narrative focused walking sim with a funny narrator. Only you know if that kind of thing sounds like a good time to you.\n\nSubtract about 26 hours from my playtime because I'm a lunatic who left the game running for a whole day to get a silly achievement.\n\nI loved the HD remix (never played the og mod), and I really liked this one too, but I will say that a lot of the commentary the original offered doesn't hit as hard or hold up as well almost a decade later, just because the narrative structure and how narrative is tied to gameplay of many story-driven games has changed in that time (because of course it has), as well as the mindset of a lot of players being different. So I think that it's worth keeping in mind the cultural moment the original was made during... if you're the thinky type who likes to overthink things. You massive nerd.\n\nStill, it felt nice to jump back in and spend a little more time with the narrator, and there were some legitimately striking moments in the new content that I found to be quite powerful and engaging. Overall, though, having played the original, getting all the new stuff (and revisiting the old) felt a lot more like checking off a to-do list than active exploration teasing at the boundaries of the game and it's layout than the first one.\n- Normally, I am hard-set on if a game is good, or bad. This game? its in the middle. I mean, a lot of the game is actually really cool, it looks great, it doesn't explain why basically almost every single person is a walking hunk of muscle, but there are some serious flaws. Not just the weird ones like \"kitchen knives break after you stab someone 3 times\" or \"I just ran over an entire sidewalk of people, and the police are nowhere to be found\", but some seriously terrible glitches that make the game unplayable. Such as the whole space-car thing. \"lalala... driving along the road...\" all of the sudden KABAM your car goes flying, hits the ground, explodes, you die, and you get charged money. You use a car to try and get back to where you were going, and BANG same thing happens again. Also, the cops, even though they are extremely spread out and don't appear to have any form of 911 or anything, are nuts with guns. You, who are supposed to be some sort of superultracop, don't even carry a knife. A FREAKING KNIFE. So if you want a gun, you have to kill a police officer, BUT WAIT HE DIDN'T DRAW HIS GUN AND YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE A HOLSTER so you have to wait until another police officer shows up, hope that he tries to shoot you instead of tackling you, and then run up to him while he shoots at you, press f when you are right in front of him, and grab his gun. Meanwhile the entire police force is going to where you are. Thats just how to get a pistol. Whats that? You want a real gun? One that doesn't take 7 shots(literally) to kill a unarmored policeman? Well, you have to hole up in some building, which its hard to find one with an interior, and just keep shooting the police officers when they charge in. Eventually, after maybe 30 officers are dead, they send in their \"elite team\" of guys... with no helmets... no armor other than a vest... and either a shotgun or a submachine gun. The farthest I have gotten to is with these guys dressed in all grey with helmets and assault rifles, they are meant to be the wall, because it can take up to an entire clip of your submachine gun to take one down. Oh, and back to the cars, WHAT THE HECK IS WITH THE CAR ATTACKING. It made me almost fall out of my chair laughing when I realized that I could use my car to \"lunge\" left and right, and take out other cars. I guess the devs didn't know that cars can't drive straight sideways. Your character has no weapons as well, so it looks kinda stupid when you are blocking and punching a bunch of guys with tire irons, knives, and whatnot. Oh yeah, the weapons break after you swing a few times. The game also has weird weapons. You can pick up an umbrella, a purse, heck even a grocery bag, or a take-out box, to use as a weapon, but these things are one use, and deal less damage then a punch. Overall, this game is a little too unrealistic, to the point where it really removes you from the game. Not to mention the glitches, you would think that the \"new and improved\" sleeping dogs would be \"new and improved\" not the horrible, glitchy mess it is now. I really tried to play it, but I just got tired of being gunned down while I am trying to break into a car and start it up, which takes like a good 20 seconds, which is a lot of time when you have 10 cops unloading their bottomless clips at you. I got tired of randomly being flung into space. I got tired of a cop arresting me, and instead of allowing me to break free and whatnot, me and the cop take a \"small adventure\" gliding across the road through cars and buildings. I got tired of a game thats supposed to be fixed and nearly glitchless, when in reality most early access games play better. I am sorry.\n- [h1]\"Connecting to Racenet...\"[/H1]\n\nSo Dirt Rally 2.0, or for the sake of brevity D2 is brilliant, when you're tearing down the leafy gravel tracks of the US of A, or picking your way through boulder strewn horrors of Argentina (which frankly feel more in line with spintyres than an actual rally course, be prepared to spend a lot of time in first and second gear), or haring along the asphalt of Spain (a worthy successor to the somewhat technical and twiddly Germany) this game is *outsta-\n\n\"Connecting to racenet....\"\n\nHang on. Bear with me. My career isn't accessible. Let me restart the client and get back to gushing over the game. The physics model from Dirt Rally has been pretty much refined upon in every single way, with new features such as Tyre Wear, and Track Degredation making significant changes to how you'll attack each stage, having the ability to select tyre type matters too, since each tyre type will wear through the available grip differently (and the state of the track will in turn factor how fast you chew through those t-\n\n[H1]Wait for it, waaaaait for iiiiiit....[/H1]\n\n\"Connecting to racenet, it appears there is a discrepancy between your data and Racenet, your event has been reset.\"\n\n... Now I have to start over in Argentina. It's fine, Argentina is nice, it means I can tell you about the excellent track designs, which I'm fairly sure much like Dirt Rally, have been taken from real world locations and are distilled down versions of their real lif-\n\n\"Unable to connect to racenet. MyTeam is Unavailable.\"\n\n...\n\nYou know what? None of what I say is going to matter. Because as much as I might wax lyrical about how far Dirt Rally 2 has advanced over Dirt Rally 1 (it's not all good news, but by and large the improvements are genuine and real) there's this one, [b]giant elephant[/b] that keeps wrecking my enjoyment of the career mode.\n\n[H1]\"A discrepancy has been found in the career data. Resetting Career.\"[/H1]\n\n... And there it is.\n\n[H1]He's gonna lose it just about... Now.[/H1]\n\nYou f***. You absolute f***. You mother***king piece of f***ing ***tastic pile of w***. F*** you, and all your f***ing relatives and all the children you have, or may have, now or in the future you b***arding pile of sp*** flavoured sherbets.\n\nFor the last 10 hours, my enjoyment of this game has been punctuated with constant issues with RaceNet attempting to grab me and f*** me from behind. And we're not talking the nice kind of happy f***ing, oh no, we're talking pound you in the ***, elephant d***, ma***ngo grade railing that has made life so teeth grindingly unpleasant that even Codemasters airdropping everyone affected ONE MEEEEEEEELEON CREDITS only offers scant salve to the reaming that RaceNet has given me.\n\nAnd now the game has been opened to the general public, which means RaceNet is about to go down faster than a hooker who just got a stack of benjamins for \"live services\". I do not expect any form of stability for the next few days, and quite possibly my Career to reset again. Motherf***ing piece of ****ing ****ed in the ****ing *** frankenf***ed **** **** ******* <the rest of this rant has been censored by David Cameron's decency filter>\n\nIf they remove RaceNet from the Singleplayer and yes, let me emphasise this - SINGLEPLAYER CAREER MODE - this becomes an automatic buy, and an automatic thumbs up from me.\n\nAs Racenet stands, breaking down more often than a catwalk model, and being as unreliable as cut-me-own-throat Dibbler's meat pie floaters, I warn all of you. STAY AWAY. STAY THE **** AWAY. THIS **** WILL DRIVE YOU ****ING NUTS. IT'S MADE ME LOSE WHAT'S LEFT OF MY ****ING HAIR. I WANT TO LOVE THIS GAME BUT IT WON'T LET ME. IT WON'T LET ME BECAUSE RACENET IS A PILE OF <the rest of this rant has been censored, again, by David Cameron's decency filter>.\n\nVerdict: [b]Wait for RaceNet to be pulled out of the SINGLEPLAYER CAREER MODE, and then buy it[/b]\n\n-storms back in- OH! AND THE CO-DRIVER FROM DIRT RALLY 1'S VOICE WAS BETTER! FITE ME! -storms out again-\n- 11 Jun 2023 Purchased the game again.  The weird distorted things are significantly reduced. The flight physics are improved. There are many mods and payware add-ons available. This is an excellent game for pilotage. There is a huge well mannered diverse community and the use of YourControls allows for a decent shared cock-pit experience.\n\nI recommend buying this game for the serious flight simmer.\n\n\n22 Jan 2021 Stunning graphics. mostly, with some really weird distorted things.   This is a very interesting game for those who are not very focused on real world aviation.  The airports are not accurately represented and the aircraft do not respond realistically, unless you are not interested in detail.   I think that it is an interesting product for casual entertainment, but serious flight enthusiasts will likely be disappointed.  I expect that with time users will create mods (aircraft and airports) to repair the inaccuracies, and fix the lack of detail, but I doubt that the weird graphics will ever be fixed.\n- The weakest RE since RE6. \n\nFeels half baked as heck on a game design level. Too many damn cutscenes and areas where you're just on rails. Really, the game design seems to take a massive step back from RE7 and even a bigger step back in terms of puzzles. Really a shame.\n\nNot to mention the performance is pretty terrible and inconsistent. Not to mention the lack of full keyboard bindings and support. Really, this port feels like a whole afterthought to a game that already feels like an afterthought.\n\nIt does get better on the back end but not enough to balance out that weak front end.\n- 100%'ed the LUCT version of the game and I'm slowly working my way through this version now.\n\nOver all the game itself is solid. If you're reading this, its a brilliant tactics game that helped define the genre. However most of the changes they made in reborn, while innovative, ultimately feel constraining. \n\nFor example, they've limited spell slots to 4, so you can only ever take 4 different spells. One or two of which (missile + indirect) are taken by a damage spell of your choice, leaving you with even less spell customization than you'd think. And its unfortunately the same situation with skills, as one will always be taken up by your weapon skill. \n\nThe cards that drop in battle, while an interesting system on paper, just end up cluttering the field most of the time, often with auto-skill activation up, which most of your units won't even really want compared to the other options. \n\nRandom battles were also removed, limiting chances to recruit to a few key dungeons as well as removing some of the more amusing battle locations from the game. \n\nI've also seen some people complain about the level cap, but in my current play-though of the game, it isn't too much of a concern for me, but it may be for others. \n\nOver all, it just feels like they've taken a step back from what Tactics ogre: Let us cling together, gave us. Yes there's bloat in that version, but it also gave us a feeling of freedom when we were putting our teams together that this version lacks. I am grateful that we saw a remake of this game within my lifetime, but I wish they had improved on Luct, rather than take steps back from it. \n\nIf they ever increase the amount of spells and/or skills you can take, to like 6-8, then I'd probably switch my review to a yes. But until then, with a heavy heart I have to say that this version just isn't as good as Luct so far.\n- This game is meditation, the thought-cleansing effect of driving a thousand kilometres along the highway cannot be understated. Occasionally poor AI choices behind the wheel may spike your blood pressure but overwhelmingly ETS2 is a relaxing thing to stick on after a rough day. And if that's not enough you can just drive into oncoming traffic in your indestructible death machine.\n\nAn alternate title for this game could be \"Zen and the Art of Logistics\".\n- They need to add more weapons like a galil or m249 or something and maybe more vehicles and playmodes.But overall so many possibilities\n- ULTRAKILL is a fine game with cool movement mechanics. However most of the guns don't feel beefy at all and, really, there's not much content to be had. Wait for ACT 3 before forking out $20 for this.\n\nedit: after getting every p rank, gaming\n- Bioshock Infinite is the third and (presumably) final game in the venerable Bioshock series of narrative driven FPS action games.  Gameplay, as always, consists of somewhat linear FPS combat with a \"genetic\" progression advancement system that lets you upgrade your abilities through \"splicing\" \"plasmids\".  This gives you somewhat supernatural abilities to augment the more traditional shooting of enemies with guns that we all enjoy from FPS games.  There's also the usual gamut of minigames, with a carnival theme to them. \n\nFrom the technical perspective, even though this is getting a little old, it's a AAA game and it shows.  Everything gamers expect is delivered here in terms of visual tweaks, control customisation, 4K support and a lot of graphics fine tuning options to allow gamers to experience a perfectly optimised experience.  There's not much else to say when developers get it right!  The visuals are equally top notch. \n\nWhile a great technical implementation is a must, and a minimum requirement for a recommendable game, of course Bioshock Infinite goes beyond that to deliver a masterpiece story that will leave gamers hooked, and perhaps a little bereft once it's over, but that's how all great stories should be.\n\nBioshock Infinite is a must-play for fans of narrative FPS games, although I do recommend trying Bioshock 1 & 2 first.  It's not required, but just like you wouldn't enjoy it as much if you watched Return of the Jedi first, you should try the first two episodes of Bioshock before the third one.\n- [h1]AT A GLANCE[/h1]\n(Full review follows below)\n\n[list]\n[*] [b]Game Name:[/b] The Swapper\n[*] [b]Original Release:[/b] 2013\n[*] [b]Genre Tags:[/b] Atmospheric; 2D; Puzzle-Platformer; Sci-Fi \n[*] [b]My Overall Grade:[/b] A-\n[*] [b]Estimated Playtime (Campaign):[/b] 3-5 hours\n[*] [b]Multiplayer Aspect:[/b] None\n[*] [b]Recommended To:[/b] Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Aesthetes; Game atmosphere connoisseurs; Strong narrative advocates; Puzzle game aficionados\n[/list]\t\n\n[h1]REVIEW[/h1]\n[b]The Swapper[/b] is an enjoyable 2D puzzle-platformer that lacks gameplay innovation but rises above the crowd on the shoulders of its superbly well-designed atmosphere and provocative narrative.  The actual puzzle-solving aspect of the game is adequate, but with minimal diversity and accretion.  It is definitely a story-driven experience, with the gameplay taking a passenger seat.  If you can appreciate a game in that style, this is a good bet for you. \n\nThe entrancing narrative and the style in which it transpires work in concert with the mystifying ambiance to create a wondrous experience. The story touches on some thought-provoking metaphysical issues, while skillfully avoiding a fall too deep into the rabbit hole to keep the average person’s interest. Much of the rest of the narrative is comfortable, cliché sci-fi tropes that we all know and love.\n\nThe gameplay and the puzzles are far from [i]bad[/i], but they also are nothing special.  As I alluded to: they are sufficient, but fail to develop into anything overly interesting. Very little changes from the first puzzle to the last, so it does get a little bit dry.  That said, some of the later ones are quite tricky and a few require not only puzzle-solving ability but also decent reflexes. \n\nThe graphics are pleasurable and align perfectly with the vibe of the game. But the whole soundscape is what truly brings the atmosphere of [b]The Swapper[/b] to life. The ambient soundtrack, the cryptic chatter, and the selectively placed voice-overs contribute a wonderful blend of emotions and mystery. If you are into it, this is a game you might enjoy with the lights off and your headphones on (or however else you may get into the zone).  \n\n[b]The Swapper[/b] is a brief, interesting, and enjoyable experience. It is not a complex or intricate puzzle-platformer, but I recommend it to any fan of the genre who would appreciate the atmosphere and narrative.\n\n[i][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/murphyslawyercuration#curation]Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations![/url][/i]\n- I've been playing this game since it was in Kickstarter! It is the best Story Rich game that I have ever played and the most unique. I have played through maybe 7 times and it's different every time. The ability to replay this game countless times is what makes it such a great game. Tons of questions that change based on the questions you've asked, you see a question that might not be there after you ask another question instead. Every version of this game that I played kept my interest and had me sitting on the edge of my seat waiting for more. I have reached 2 endings so far and I can't wait to see what happens next. The Developers are great, I can't wait to see what they create next.\n- Has combination of tight controls and well designed levels that makes platforming satisfying, excellent graphical style and music, as well as tons of unlockable content that will keep you playing even after finishing the story.\n\nVery solid platformer.\n\nThe only downside is there's no online coop; only local.\n- First off, just want to say this isn't a Metroidvania. This is a Zelda clone. And a good one!\n\nI bought this game because I heard it really put stress on you. You have limited time to complete the game and NPCs will begin dying if you aren't fast enough. Pretty crazy, right? Well, I do have a few gripes with that, but let me point out the good stuff first:\n+ Amazing combat. You have access to both guns and swords, but most of your damage will likely come from melee weapons since they have the ability to do an extremely-easy-to-pull-off PARRY! Parrying an enemy stuns it and gives your next attack against it a massive damage multiplier. All enemies, all bosses, and most projectiles are parryable, so this is what combat ends up revolving around. Even though I call it easy, you still get that cool feeling when you walk into an ambush and clear it without taking a hit, so it never gets dull as you go through the game.\n\n+ Good dungeon design. Since this game takes after Zelda, it's not shy about inserting a few puzzles into its dungeons. The overworld as well has quite a few surprising secrets and side quests that you won't be expecting when you play for the first time.\n\n+ Sequence breaks. This is mostly for New Game+ (or New Game Extra, a separate mode where you have access to major exploration items from the start, but not your whole endgame inventory), but it was interesting to find out how many secret paths and shortcuts there were, and how tightly they were managed. The devs thought of everything!\n\nSo now for the bad stuff.\n- Underwhelming story. Guess how much is really explained over the course of this story. If you guessed \"all of it\", you would be completely wrong and here's your dunce hat. Unsighted ends up spending so much of its time on the protagonist's relationships that it fails to answer several of the more important questions concerning the game's backstory. Why was there was a war? Who started it? Where are the humans now? Why are they so disorganized? Why do they seem to have no chain of command whatsoever? How did the automatons ever win anything at all at any point when they seem so extremely outclassed? I guess it doesn't matter. Look, there's two robot-girls kissing.\n\n- Fake pressure. I heard there was going to be pressure before I started the game, so I decided to go DEFCON 1 from the get-go and rush everything. I ended up completing the game in 10 in-game days and I felt pretty good about it. Zero NPC deaths! Zero! I'm a super awesome amazing hero, right? Well, credits roll and... the only achievement I get is the one for beating the game. No one really cares and apparently you're meant to play through multiple times anyway. So... why did I ever care? Why is this mechanic even in the game? All it did was make me shy away from general exploration and side quests since all of those things are less important than, ya know, saving the world. You can call that interesting, but when it has no payoff, it ends up being frustrating.\n\n- No post-game. Did I mention, if you bumrush the game and finish with just hours left on everyone's timers, you don't get to do any extra no-timer exploring afterwards? No, the game's over. Load the save and you get set back to where you were before fighting the final boss. If you want to do any actual exploring, that's what \"Explorer\" mode is for. You know, that mode that makes you feel like you're cheating?\n\nBasically, Unsighted is another game filled with missed opportunities. I recommend this game because the core gameplay and level design is very well done and very well executed, but you should probably know this before you start:\n\nThe only pressure here is the one you imagine. Since the game does nothing to acknowledge your successes, just play it at your own pace and don't be shy about using Explorer. Shame on the devs for hailing the agony of defeat, but not the thrill of victory.\n- The story of this game is interesting and well written, but it doesn't fully make up for the game's flaws. Here are the problems I saw with the game.\n\n1. There are a wide variety of guns available, but very few combinations of those guns are viable. The shotguns are rarely viable for combat with gun wielding enemies, since advancing far enough forward to make shotgun damage effective inevitably puts you in the line of fire of enough of your enemies to prove lethal. Other weapons like sniper rifles and pistols have critically low DPS and a low maximum ammo cap, making them almost universally not viable. Additionally this game likes to spring ambushes on the player in a way that takes away any advantage gained from long range optics. The special pneumatic weapons in the game also suffer from a low ammo cap. This leaves you with assault rifles, which the game seems to have been made for.\n\n2. In encounters with bestial enemies it is frequently impossible to avoid taking damage. The enemies sprint at you in packs which even sustained automatic shotgun fire cannot fully stop. Some of the boss enemies are even worse in this department. In normal mode with the larger health pool and regeneration over time this wouldn't be such a problem. But in ranger mode this makes certain obstacles unbeatable. You might have a boss which takes your entire ammo pool from both guns to kill, and which gets a guaranteed hit on you once every thirty seconds. If you go into that boss fight hurt and with no healing items, then you'll be met with mathematically guaranteed failure. The simple fix for this is to give the player a dodge function to avoid taking an instance of damage.\n\n3. This story has a few decisions to make, but mostly it is on rails. This isn't always a problem in a game, but it is when your character gets repeatedly taken unawares by things you as the player have already figured out. You as the player may sense that Artyom is being tricked, is about to be ambushed, or is going to let the bad guy get away through poor decision making. You just have to frustratedly walk into the cut scene and let it happen anyways. Its fine for this to happen at least once. But by the fourth or fifth instance it becomes infuriating to play as the character who just gets tricked and captured all the time.\n- [b]What was added:[/b]\n- Roguelike mode\n- New campaigns\n- 5 new units\n- Groove/Super groove\n- 4 new commanders\n- New OST, including Commanders'\n\n[b]What did it cost:[/b]\n- No more Arcade and Puzzles\n- A lot of maps removed from Multiplayer\n- Can't randomize weather anymore (????)\n- Can't use previous OST\n- No more Co-op campaign\n- Nothing to unlock with stars. All characters are already unlocked, so there is no point completing the campaign with more than 1 star per mission.\n\n[b]With that being said, here are some issues:[/b]\n- Balancing may need some work. Won't get into details, but it doesn't feel right, as it wasn't right in Wargroove\n- AI is still bad. Even worse than before. They just didn't touch it. They will use their Groove on cooldown most of the time, without bothering about the Supergroove. Commanders will run into you only to get surrounded and killed.\n- Once a player lose, all of his team lose, putting the game to an end. Though there is a toggle in map editor to disable it, but doesn't seem to work\n- A lot of tooltips missing for settings. We don't know what most settings are doing...\n- Tried to make a map where Commanders can respawn after 2 turns, to prevent AI to lose instantly, and let them play more agressive. But when you increment counters or set flags booleans, they get changed for both teams, making it impossible to script... Can't debug efficiently either.\n- The new Commanders' themes are glitchy when looping\n- The Codex didn't get updated properly. When selecting a Commander, we can only see a short text for the Groove, without any details.\n- In Map Editors, there are two entries for Wulfar, but using different names.\n\nI'd say if you liked Wargroove 1, you'd just like that one too. But it feels really disappointing right now. I don't know why they removed features instead of just adding new ones... In 2020, they said they were working on AI. But they did absolutely nothing.\n- Complete scam - game barely works. Devs got it to load with stability and then dropped all funding and support for the game. Complete contract violation with Steam. I actually cant believe it is still in the Steam store. DO NOT BUY !!! I was not allowed to refund it even with only .4 hours played, due to \"management issues\" within Double Fine. I am guessing Steam cant get their money out of them either.\n- If you played the OG this is basically the same but with a few added side stories you can unlock as you complete different routes in the game. The extra dlc maybe would take you a bit over an hour to complete all of them if you speed through it, but does not have any optional dialogue so it's more of just some lore and extra character interactions. Still pretty solid dlc if you are a fan and want a little bit of extra stuff :)\n- *Sigh* This game was just tiring. I wouldn't come to say it was a complete rip off of Paper's Please, but it was a very similar game but just worse. Mainly to the point that I played, at most, 10 minutes, I saw multiple repeats of the same messages, and the only updates were legislation, unlike in Papers, Please where you got new rules and new tools almost every day. I won't completely judge the game since I haven't played it the entire way through, but it's just not very good. Plain and simple.\n- Only one word to describe this game\n\nOutdated.\n\nThere is no real point to get this game unless you want a slightly better looking UI and atmosphere. L4D2 already contains the campaigns from L4D1 and is where the entire Left 4 Dead community is. Only a small playerbase still plays l4d1, mostly out of nostalgia. But there is quite literally no reason to get the game.\n\nYou can grab it if you are into achievements, but only do so when it goes on sale, i grabbed it for a couple penny, still a bad idea.\n- This version comes bundled together with some kind of horrid bloatware called \"Steam\" which functions as a type of DRM meaning you do not actually own the game. Avoid at all costs, buy it on CD instead!\n- This is my first Formula One game, I never expected before to like this type of games but I do and I'm glad that the 2017 version was my first one because it's very polished and enjoyable.\n\nThe game is basically a simulator of real F1 racing with everything that belongs to it. The gameplay is very similar to what we are used to in Codemasters games - a carrer mode where you choose a team and try to meet their expectations. It's not easy, it needs a lot of skills and I don't recommend playing with a keyboard (I personally use an Xbox controller).\n\nWhen it comes to racing games I'm always mostly interested in multiplayer and I'm pleased that the multiplayer mode works well, it's cross-platform, supports up to 20 players and it's really fun.\n\nThe game was ported by Feral Interactive using Vulkan, the general optimization is great and the performance is very stable. I had an issue with constant crashing after ~5-10 minutes so I sent an e-mail to Feral and their Linux support team was very happy to help. The issue of mine was fixed in less than 3 days and they uploaded the fix on Steam using a beta release channel to let me test it so I'm more than happy with the level of tech support.\n\nNothing more to say, if you are looking for a competitive racing game with decent multiplayer then you shouldn't miss this game.\n\n[h1]System info & performance report[/h1]\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Platform[/td]\n        [td]Linux | Arch[/td]\n    [/tr]\n   [tr]\n        [td]Desktop environment[/td]\n        [td]Gnome Shell 3.26[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]API[/td]\n        [td]Vulkan[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]CPU/GPU/RAM[/td]\n        [td]i5 7300HQ / GTX 1050 Ti [396.24] / 12 GB[/td]\n    [/tr]\n [tr]\n        [td]Settings[/td]\n        [td]1080p, high[/td]\n    [/tr]\n [tr]\n        [td]FPS[/td]\n        [td]50-60 average[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\nhttps://youtu.be/UOssSi3a3PU\n[i][b]Note:[/b] ~10 fps loss due to recording[/i]\n\n[h1]Technical side[/h1]\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Available APIs[/td]\n        [td]Vulkan-exclusive[/td]\n    [/tr]\n\t[tr]\n        [td]Multiplayer[/td]\n        [td]cross-platform Linux <-> Mac OSX <-> Windows[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Config location[/td]\n        [td] ✓ Good | ~/.local/share/feral-interactive/F1 2017[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Linux version rating[/td]\n        [td]Perfect | 5/5[/td]\n    [/tr]\n   [tr]\n        [td]Controller support[/td]\n        [td]Excellent (tested with an Xbox 360 wireless controller, \"xpad\" Linux built-in (default) kernel module)[/td]\n    [/tr]\n   [tr]\n        [td]Any issues (fullscreen, performance, crashes...) ?[/td]\n        [td]Not anymore (fixed by Feral)[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Ported by[/td]\n        [td]Feral Interactive[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n- To be completely honest, throughout my entire playthrough, I was thinking on giving this game a \"Not Recommended\" but it really wouldn't have deserved it. This game is at the same time both very difficult to recommend as to not recommend. It is really a beatiful and extremely original game, with a pretty well told interesting story. However, the problem it has is that it doesn't really work as a puzzle game. Puzzle solutions don't make logical sense most of the time and you end up brute forcing your way through most of the game. This means trying every posibility until something works and moves the story foward, and this is just not good puzzle design. This also distracts you from the story being told, which is in itself not so easy to understand, it requirers you to be paying attention to details, so your brain has to be constantly switching between \"puzzle mode\" and \"story mode\". Anyway, you can tell a lot of love was put into this game, and that is why I ultimately recommend it.\n7.5/10-\n- After playing thousands of games both singleplayer and multiplayer, unlocking all achievements and getting every solo map medal, I think it's time for a review:\n\nIf you like tower defence games: I recommend.\nIf you like any previous Bloons games: I recommend.\nIf you want something casual and chill: I recommend.\nIf you want a bit of a challenge: I recommend.\n\nThe tower type variety is interesting and diverse, with 5 tiers of upgrades each (plus special \"paragon\" towers)\nThe game devs have been providing free updates for years.\nThere's lots of achievements and medals to get.\nThere's online co-op, boss events and even different game-modes.\n\nThe game is more expensive than it used to be, but literally any sale price makes it worth a buy!\n- PROS-\n-finally out on steam\n-excellent factory builder with many features for easy factory automation\n-easily 40-50 hours of game play in it's current state\n-beautiful map design with plenty of space and verticality, multiple biomes each with their own beauty and quirks\n-overall very appealing graphics/visuals\n-easy to understand structures to build with but factory complexity increases overtime requiring some thought that doesn't leave you bored building your factory bigger in late-game\n-tons of potential for future updates\n\n\nCONS-\n-lacking all story elements at this point in time (June 2020)\n--multiplayer is filled with some bugs, nothing game breaking but constantly annoying: \n-only host can drive a vehicle without lagging effectively making it impossible for the person connecting to drive anything more than a few feet\n-constant de-sync on client side so don't expect to smoothly see the host's location\n-hyper tube transportation of significant length or otherwise complex shape can lead to the game losing track of the client and freezing them in place requiring a disconnect and reconnect, sometimes outside of the tube in a precarious position. \n-FPS in multiplayer is quite reduced or otherwise locked to ~60fps give or take 20, might be by design but it causes some issues.) \n\n-power production could probably be improved with higher tier coal burners and water pumps (and higher tier pipes that allow extra flow), seems simple to add but so far not an available tech.\n-difficulty of power production is what limits factory size at this point so I hope the next update brings that upgrade (only so many pure coal nodes and oil nodes)\n-somewhat limited water sources in many biomes\n\nfinal thoughts: over-all a great purchase, but I wouldn't blame you if you want to wait for more stable multiplayer or for the game to be finished.\nEarly access isn't for everyone but for me I just see it as getting to replay the game a few times over the development.\n- its a very stressful game and rly hard but the fact that u can lose all ur progress because of a mistake is on another level of insane but in the end if u r determined u will finish it and the feeling when u finish it after all the time is very good i never felt this good in my life about finishing a game or a puzzle its a rly good game i recommend\n- \"You've played for 1000 hours. Would you recommend this game to other players?\"\n- Mori's 3-Part Review:\n1. Bare minimum information and recommendations to improve your playthrough\n2. Background information on me and my playthrough\n3. More extensive non-spoiler reactions\n \nPart 1: Recommendations for You\nIf you're like me and you try to get all the extra scene dialogue, then please, if you take nothing else from this, give yourself time to play this game yourself. There is actually so much content here, I really want you all to take your time to experience it as you go. The game is just too long to binge in a reasonably short amount of time, and if you do binge, you're going to lose a lot.\n \nMy recommendations:\n1. Give yourself time to play the game. Let it sink in, and take notes- it'll be rewarded. The game is literally too dense and too long to binge reasonably if you like 100%ing.\n \n2. Get invested in the characters and pay attention to them, not just the (admittedly stellar) mysteries.\n \n3. Explore the game, its mechanics, and its dialogue yourself. Don't be afraid to restart a Somnium several times; the more options you pick, the more meaningful information you get.\n \n4. If you're a puzzle lover then try to solve the game yourself. You're going to have a blast if you manage it, and the game has tons of built-in hint systems to make it even easier, fairer, and more fun.\n \n5. Try to go in knowing at little as you can. The marketing has already done a great job. Focus on finishing the game and bringing it all together.\n \n6. On PC, force anti-aliasing on using your graphics card to make the game prettier. Game ran and controlled smoothly with few bugs.\n \n7. You don't need AI1 to play AI2, but I think AI2 does spoil AI1, though you could still enjoy them in reverse order.\n \n7. If you're sensitive to horny then just read less background dialogue in Ryuki side. Gore is pretty toned down, and there isn't any single huge CW.\n \nYou can stop reading now if you don't want your playthrough tainted by my reactions/expectations effected.\n \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nPart 2: Who am I, and how do I play?\nI'm an Uchikoshi fanatic. I've played all his English-translated games, and visual novels are my favorite genre of game. I've played a lot of visuals novels, but Uchizawa's are my favorites. I usually try to 100% complete all the scenes and see all the bonus dialogue. I've also played a lot of other genres of game, and I do like fun gameplay, but the most important things to me tend to be:\n \nA. An interesting story is absolutely what gets me invested\nB. Bunches of novel ideas like unique plot points I haven't seen before, philosophical ideas, or puzzles\nC. Characters that I at least don't actively hate; I can like a game for the above two, but characters still matter\nD. Deep personal connection, usually formed by connections to real people or how a game shaped my life\n \nThose are the ways I rate my top games. For the last 8 years, my top 2 favorite games have been the same:\n \nMy top favorite game of all time is Remember11. I love the plot, the ideas, the twists, the characters, and it's what got me truly invested in Uchikoshi. It's very much a mystery game first with an unravelling mystery and themes I love to explore.\n \nMy second favorite game is Virtue's Last Reward. I love the interactive moral dilemmas. VLR's use of the Prisoner's Dilemma jumpstarted my interested in Philosophy which led me to major in Philosophy. I don't like the characters as much save for a few, but it's still very important to me.\n \nNow, let me tell you how I've played AINI: I've basically been playing non-stop since June 13th.\n \nTake this with a grain of salt because I've been documenting as I play (the average main story playtime seems to be 20-35 hours, with 100% likely taking 50+), but right now, I have 97 hours of playtime. I have not gotten all the dialogue, achievements, or fully explored the abundance of extra mechanics. Instead, I have a 616-page reaction document full of constant laughs, cries, screams, passing out, and most of all love.\n \nPart 3: My Review\nThe R11 #1 and VLR #2 holy duology held true for 8 years. Also, AI1 isn't one of my favorite standalone games; it has huge personal connection for me because of the community and the AI1 ARG, but it wasn't my favorite as a game.\n \nI gave all that background because I want you to take me seriously when I say this:\nAI2 is my new favorite game. The #1 spot has been Easily dethroned.\n \nThe themes, twists, characters, ideas, gameplay, visuals, voice acting, fair mystery, presentation, mechanics, and comedy all of it resonates together perfectly. I don't even tend to value gameplay or visuals, but at many times, this game is fun to play while looking genuinely beautiful and cinematic.\n \nThe story reads like a proper Uchikoshi + Nakazawa return to form. The mystery is fair, interesting, meaningful, and complex told satisfyingly. There are many deep ideas, concepts, and themes utilized in thought-provoking ways.\n \nGameplay-wise, there are tons of mechanics that are utilized to make each Somnium unique; they all feel designed by love, fair, and reflective of the character through gorgeous symbolism. They blow the first game completely out of the water. Each one is its own experience to explore and a visual delight. There are also tons of mechanics for you to discover that make AI2 a fun game to play.\n \nThe animations, voices, and directing are cinematic; this game is actually breathtaking a lot of the time. It's backed up by great and charming character writing- despite the fact Mizuki is my favorite AI1 character with 0 contest, I grew to like much of the AI2 cast the same amount.\n \nAI2 is a story about halves and splitting, but also love and coming together- please, see it through until it's whole. I hope and believe you will all fall in love with AI2 like me; AI2 is all I've ever wanted. AI2 is my dream game come true; it's a gorgeous love letter to all Uchikoshi fans who love Zero Escape's puzzles, Infinity's mysteries, and AI's characters and humor.\n- SICK Art Style\nSICK Mechanics\nSICK Game\n- When I first played Battlefield 1 it literally sent me to the hospital, cause you’re supposed to seek immediate medical attention if your erection lasts longer than 4 hours.\n\nThis is easily one of the most badass games  in history. The music, the landscape, the gunplay, the hit register and the satisfying kill effect, EVERYTHING is just amazing. The last true Battlefield game. I enjoyed every second of this amazing game.  \n\nBF1 isn’t fully historically accurate but it is historically immersive. The war stories in this game genuinely made me emotional sometimes and I’m not ashamed to admit that. \n\nAs someone who is more on the “historical accuracy” side of games, I can say without a doubt that Battlefield 1 did an incredible job. Hell, they were even able to be diverse without pandering to anybody! The 1st Russian Women’s Battalion of Death, the Harlem Hellfighters, people from French-occupied northwestern Africa, the list goes on. What sets this game’s inclusivity of a variety of people and groups from other games is that it does so when it has a reason to and is still accurate to the time and setting. \n\nThat’s one of the main reasons why Battlefield 5 pissed me off so much. Instead of a British woman with a prosthetic arm wielding a cricket bat in WW2, why not include Lyudmila Pavlichenko, aka Lady Death, a female Russian sniper who had 309 confirmed kills? What about the French women who fought? They were in extremely small numbers, but they were a thing. Historically accurate inclusion is fucking awesome, and I love when games do it. But inclusivity for its own sake is terrible and it cheapens said character’s presence in the game’s setting. \n\nEven the DLC are fantastic. I remember how amazing I felt when the “for the Tsar” DLC came out and I first played it. I have never seen people fight so hard to the death in a video game without a whole lot of rage. It was amazing. I felt like I was part of the Russian revolution. Please do yourself a favor and buy this game.\n\n9/10\n\nOnly gave it a 9 ‘cause the 1 is already there…\n- This review only relates to the single player campaign. At 50 years old I have zero interest in multiplayer.\n\nAfter playing Gears of War 4, I was looking forward to this title. I wasn't disappointed. I found the new upgrade system with Jack enjoyable. The campaign was fun to play with minor exceptions. Graphics, sound, and voice acting were amazing. Campaign took me about 11 hours to beat. I consider that well worth the $60 I paid for the game.\n\nMy only real gripe about the single player campaign:  As a father of 3 girls, I'm all for strong female leading characters. Kait just isn't it, though. I didn't care for her in 4 and that didn't change in 5. For me she seems out of her league and just isn't believable as a team member. She's like Elizabeth Swan, the governor's daughter in Pirates of the Caribbean. She's a kidnapped damsel in distress in one movie, and the Pirate King in the next. It just doesn't work, for me anyway.\n- As a fan of Mimimi's Stealth Strategy Game,\nI love it so much, the operation system is getting smoother and more user-friendly comparing to Desperados III & Shadow Tactics.\nAlso I like how they added new elements to the game to make it more playable (E.g. Flexible team choice, character stories)\n\nThe only thing I don't like is the art.\nGame design is good but it'd be great if there's good looking characters...\n- The good news: you came out of cryogenic suspension in good health.\n\nThe bad news: you're critically low on supplies.\n\nThe good news: there are plenty of other vessels within range.\n\nThe bad news: they're all derelict.\n\nThe good news: you have a fleet of salvage drones you can send into the derelicts to gather supplies.\n\nThe bad news: your drones aren't the only things moving around those derelicts. And the other moving things are hostile. And the half-broken infrastructure on those derelicts is prone to fail explosively. And parts of your drones and your ship break too. And your only interaction with the outside world is with the drones. And your only interaction with the drones is through a clunky command-line interface. And you may be the last human alive anywhere. And if your drones die, you're next.\n\nSo on the balance, it's mostly bad news.\n- good game but later missions seem to be less polished ran in multiple bugs when playing as The Son enemies getting stuck in impossible to reach places and for some odd reason some characters have dog killing animations that for the most part are bugged and only work half the time causing an insta death and a retry don't even understand why later in the game you have to do animations to kill dogs as for basically the whole game you don't need to perform animations also seems to have some input lag throughout the whole game but overall its decent and when its on sale you should buy it.\n- solid proof that the story could be the absolute worst garbage imaginable but if the gameplay rules, it literally wont matter. the gameplay in this is bomb-diggity.\n- lmao they made tetris into a full blown religious experience\n- After playing the game for almost 10 hours which i know is not a lot but still i had a great time the story kept me hooked from start to finish and i was always excited to find out what was going to happen next. I loved the idea that you could choose to play as a ghost and never get detected or never kill anyone or just go for the high chaos im going to kill everyone playstyle and even know the ability to choose your playstyle is quite oftenly seen these days but back in 2012 it was quite inovative.\n\nGameplay:\nIt had great combat and stealth.(Not Suprising based on thre fact that your an assasin)\nStory was well how to put this \"A rollercoaster of emotion\" it keeps you hooked from start to finish and you will never want to stop playing until you finaly get to the end.\n\nReplay Value:\nNow this is a big one in my opinion because i like games that make you play for hours and hours and I would say that Dishonored has great replay value this is mainly due to the fact that there are a lot of different acheivements, ways to complete each mission, different magic paths and weapon paths that can only be be completed if you play the game again and if your not comftable with fully restarting you dont have to because once you finish the main storyline you unlock the option to play them over which is useful if you want to unlock some of the other acheivements for example Clean Hands to get this acheivement your not allowed to kill anyone in the whole story how you do this i have no idea but thats the reason this game has good replay value.\n\nDLC:\nEven though i do not own the DLC (i will be purchasing them soon) from my knowledge of the normal game and how great that was it would suprise me if the DLC was bad.\n\nIn conclusion i would highly reccomend this game to anyone who doenst already own it!\n\n- I like furry art, but first and foremost im a RPG gamer, and as such I will rend judgment impartially. \n\nThe story is not bad, but still falls in the average category and it is predictable, gameplay is the same as the first Fuga (I have no problems there) but there are few new enemies,  so the strategy to beat the regular battles is very repetitive. My biggest complain remains the same since Tail Concerto and it is the dificulty... which is way too easy, there is no hard / nightmare mode for veteran players, Im not asking to die repeatedly like in dark souls but Cyberconnect2 needs to understand some players like a challenge in their games.\n\nMusic is ok and Hack is the best character of the lot (Tah tah tah tah  taaah!!!!!) I would play Fuga 3 just for him.\n\nIt pains me to give the thumbs down, but Cyberconnect2 needs to work a little harder.\n- Go ahead and try to find something to criticize about this game. \n\nMaybe graphics scalability? Can you even be offended at that? The game does use polygonal graphics and what appears to be vertex lighting, but I think most integrated graphics chips can handle this amount of detail. Don't quote me on that one. Most systems out there can run this game no problem... If they are Windows systems.\n\nMaybe the friend requirement? Flipping through the manual yourself still provides an interesting experience. The entire game can be beaten with one person or with the participation of 20 or more people. How many games are like that?\n\nLack of voice chat feature? The game has full Steam support, making this a non-issue.\n\nLack of netcode? The design of the game makes this irrelevant. You don't even need an internet connection, but to initially download the game.\n\nFrustration? You can pick up or close the game at any time. Learning to play it without griping at others or being discouraged is probably good for your social health. It's far less frustrating or \"cheap\" than many modern games, too: bounding boxes in Dark Souls 2, spawns in flanking in Call of Duty, unreasonable level design in Hotline Miami 2. Bombs are self-contained puzzles and you lose only seconds if you make a mistake, not hours of effort. In fact, the more level-headed you are, the better you will be at the game.\n\nBrevity? This one I could see, but the main collection of bombs is only to introduce the mechanics and give some gimmicky setups in the first place. Once you complete it, you can free play whenever you want, as the design calls for well over 11^11 (that's about 2.9 * 10^11) variations. It's unlikely you will ever play the same bomb twice if your objective is variation.\n\nCost? It's $15 right now; if you go in with friends it's a drop in the bucket. I don't feel too bad about the development:cost differential, but I suppose that's up to personal preference.\n\nKeep Talking and Nobody explodes is an accessible, inexpensive, tightly designed game. Even if you've never played a party game or don't care for them, this one is a glimmering example. After hours of consideration, the only problem I can think of is that it seems to be Windows-only at the moment. Do you have Windows and some fraction of $15? Do you like fun games that reward skill, intelligence, and cooperation? If you said yes, it's time to buy.\n- I'm 45, I've had good times and bad times.  I've fallen in love, grown up, gotten married, beaten alcoholism, \nhad a child, fought off depression, led my wife through her kidney failure, carried the death of loved ones, and come back from the brink.  I've weathered the storm of life like anyone else . . . I'm not special.  I'm not rich, but comfortable, and I've gathered quite a steam library as a hobby over the last 10 years.  Something I have rarely done, during my time with almost 4000 titles, is write a review.  Two, maybe three for 4000 games.  Think about that for a second.\n\nI'm 45.  I just cried playing a video game, something I can't ever remember doing.  I feel like my heart is going to burst.  It's joy, and sadness.  It's like a good memory with a parent who's long gone, bubbled up at random, making you laugh and ache at the same time.  It's bittersweet.\n\nThe music and visuals are subtle and flashy at the same time, they get under you and lift you up.  It's got spirit of the 60's, the heart of the 80's, and feels like every memorable video game trope from the 2000's, with the social softness of the 2020's.  It's huge and tiny at the same time, and thoughtfull and meditative together . . . it tells the story of leaving your comfort zone, and makes you comfortable.  It's heavy and light.  It's all of these and more.\n\nMy emotions are a flood.  I had to write a review, and let people know how I feel.  I can't describe it, I feel like I found my heart again, and I didn't even know it was lost.  Life was comfortable before 2:00pm today . . . now it's magical.  It's these small things that I forget, and remember, and then forget again . . . the birth of my son, the feeling of nervous sweetness on my first date with my wife, an unexpected comment from a random stranger about my eyes, finding an old photo of my dad that no one ever remembered taking --\n\n-- This game is like that sweet, fleeting memory.\n\nTL;DR:  45-year old man cries after finding his heart lost in a game, and writes a review while his wife asks him if he's okay.\n\n11/10, would purchase these feels again.\n- When I say this game changed the way I thought about life, I mean it. And before you say this game isn't worth 44 dollars, you are wrong. I would pay more than double just for this once in a lifetime experience.\n\nWhile this game may look like a stupid bishoujo romance game, it is so much more. Don't let the weird artstyle or obnoxious eyes fool you, this game will make you laugh. cry, depressed, happy, and everything in between. It is so extensive, so great, that there are over 13 character routes and stories to play in this game, all of which are good (some are incredible) and have some of the best, most fleshed our characters I have seen. This game is about life, change, friends, love, and most importantly, family. Every route in this game has a connection to family. (Clannad is a close-enough translation of family in Irish)\n\nIn case it helps, I'm a grown man who had a rather negative outlook on life, and this game me cry buckets. If you ever have thought about getting married and having kids, this game will MAKE you want to have a family. The clever writing and how the protagonist, Okazaki, changes throughout his life is all done so well. It made me realize how much we complain about our lives, but we don't need much to be happy or be motivated. In case it helps again, my mom loves this game, she connects with it quite a bit. Yet again, nothing bad to say here, only to say that Key is incredible and I will be reading some of their other works like Little Busters and Kanon.\n- One of the best most fun and addicting all-time games. However, the plants should be nazi's and the zombies should be jews. There is also a hispanic snail in your garden that sleeps on the job.\n- This is somehow the only game where you can play as an anti-fascist faction in Nazi Germany, drive the Nazis into the ocean, kill Hitler and reclaim Germany as a democracy, and that's somehow the most boring possible outcome.\n- PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE VENTURING INTO 999!\n\n\n\nI refunded the game thinking they removed so much of the narrative but I was wrong, the game has now 2 different types of screens, the \"ADV screen\" and the \"Novel screen\". Make sure you switch to \"Novel screen\" as soon as you start playing and stay on that screen as the \"ADV screen\" only displays dialogue and NOTHING ELSE, if you stay on this screen you'll miss all the extra bits that can help to figure out certain details that allow you to find all the endings and figure out the entire story top to bottom.\nHappy gaming.\n\nEDIT: @Snivader pointed out my mistake, edited the review.\n\n\n\nExtra small tip to help you through your journey. Take a notepad (or anything you can scribble down onto), and write down key dates / codes / people that you encounter through the game and keep them close while playing the entire trilogy. I can guarantee you that your mind will be blown by the end of the trilogy (provided you can keep up with the weird events that go down in these games).\n- Red Matter 2 sets a new bar for VR mystery/suspense/story based games. I've thought about reaching out to the developer and thanking them it's that good. If you're a space lover like me, DON'T MISS THIS! Some very memorable moments in this, and the graphics are even better than Alyx sometimes. The music also is well done. Just enough to give you some atmosphere, but not overdone. If you also played the original this is worth getting for a continuation of the original story too. Very little is re-hashed so you've got to pay some attention to succeed. This also gets fairly creepy, more than the original, so if you're averse to horror games, this may not be for you. All in all, as I just finished this days ago, I'm still fairly blown away at how good it was. The developer has really found their niche. Still getting chills from the ending of this.\n- Most stable game I ever played?\nPlayed multiplayer with 3 ppl living across the world from me, \nnever desynch, never a lag, never any issue at all except some very very minor stuff.\n\nMasterful really, well done.\nGREAT GAME TOO!\n- A forward-hurtling psychedelic tube shooter with a tremendous sense of speed and odd, zen relaxation. The closest thing I have to compare it to is probably [i]Rez[/i]: if you liked that, definitely give this a whirl.\n\nConversions of arcade classics and legends are commonplace. But an arcade [i]myth?[/i] Only one springs to mind: [b]POLYBIUS[/b]. There one minute and gone the next, so they say - an enigmatic arcade cabinet installed and removed by mysterious men in black: rumours of people hooked to the screen and unable to remember or communicate what they saw afterwards, save for that it was immersive, fast, colourful, and strangely hypnotic. A fly-by-night company that went out of business? A government mind control experiment? Probably not, no. A hoax. An urban legend. A myth.\n\nBut a myth was all Jeff Minter needed. If you're previously unfamiliar with Jeff Minter and his stable Llamasoft, he's been creating weird arcade-inspired games and \"lightsynths\" (as in, the inspiration for Milkdrop and other music visualisers) out of a barn in Wales since the 1980s. His creations are marked by being fast, psychedelic, and strangely sheep-themed, generally in search of the kind of gameplay that invites the player to get \"in the zone\". And so it is here.\n\nIn search of a new original creation, he turned his mind to the arcade legend Polybius as inspiration, and his interpretation is oddly faithful:[list]\n[*]Immersive: it supports VR if you have it, wrapping you into the game world - it draws you into the screen even if you don't.\n[*]Fast: capable of and designed for very high-refresh rates if you can support them.\n[*]Colourful: look at the screenshots, you get the idea.\n[*]Hypnotic: hurtling forwards shooting abstract things in tunnel patterns seems like it would be intense, and it is, but - [i]Relax. Just look at the centre of the screen as you move forward. Go through the horns. Let it take you[/i].[/list]\n\nOnce you get the hang of it and start relaxing into it and getting into that sense of flow, it's curiously calming. I can see myself bringing this out for a quick session after a stressful day: it's particularly good to dip into. Long sessions might result in seeing patterns on the walls, Tetris-style.\n\nIt's not for everyone: Minter's games never have been. In particular, you may wish to skip this one if you have sensory conditions that make you susceptible to motion sickness, or photosensitive epilepsy.\n\nGood music too, and doesn't need high specs either. Recommended.\n- You had me at creating adventure log, well actually no, at the starting song perhaps. How many years have I been waiting for full fledge, non portable DQ since DQVIII in PS2 ?\n\nThis PC port is a great one, neat and very beautiful. I was playing at 4k/~30fps and since my GPU is not fast enough I switched to 1440p/~50-60fps instead. I wish more and more JRPGs to do PC concurrent launch like this one. A day later I switched back to 4k and change internal resolution to 80% then it was pretty much perfect.\n\n- You can choose default A/B button.\n- You can choose resolution and 30/60 FPS mode. There is a way to unlock 60+ FPS for gaming monitors, google it.\n- You can invert cameras both ways.\n- You can choose classic battle mode.\n- You can press L3 and enjoy the view.\n- Load time is non-existence with SSD.\n- Ultra Widescreen is NOT supported. Waiting for mods at the moment.\n- Keyboard and Mouse is fine but playing with controller is wayy better.\n- Fully customisable keys / controllers.\n- Story synopsys at game loading screen.\n- Silent Protagonist.\n- Full voice cutscenes.\n- Auto-run button.\n- You can jump.\n- An interesting experience for RPGMaker vidya enthusiasts.\n\nBefore you pick up this title, be sure to download and play the demo, as the demo is the (free) first episode of the series, this game being the second episode.\n\nA Psychological Thriller, as stated in the description, is probably the best way to describe this series, an adventure through bizzare yet oddly pretty settings.\n\nThe first episode is quite a fun, humorous adventure, but still manages to be gripping and gut-wrenching in some areas. Difficult for me to describe in words, but it's free, so there's no reason not to play it.\n\nThe second episode strays from the fun, humorous side of things and focuses more on story, an unexpected yet completely welcome change of tone. If you enjoyed the first and got to like the characters, the second episode is well worth the price.\n\nFeel free to pick it up if it seems interesting to you.\n- For every like this review gets, I will consume 1 spoonful of mayonnaise\n- I waited 12+ years for a proper sequel to A Crack in Time (yes i know the other games came out but tbh they didn't do much for me) for it only to come out for the PS5. Unfortunately, I wasn't getting a new console for just one game. \n\nNow, two years later I'm playing it on the PC.  While surreal, I am super glad they ported this series to a different platform, and the game was totally worth the wait.\n\nThe port by Nixxes ran very nice for me. I had a few hitches in the dimensional portal scenes, and one crash in a total of 12hrs of playtime. I do understand that some people are having issues and that does suck & does not disqualify their experiences, however, It is not even close to how bad TLOU Pt.1's port was.  \n\nIt's another Insomniac banger, and if you've played any of their games you already know whats up. I beat the game in 12 hrs on the 2nd to last difficulty grabbing whatever side content/collectibles I could before the story captivated me. As is tradition, there is a NG+ mode (haven't touched yet) and I look forward to trying it. I'll probably update the review at that point, but the games are always repayable due to their collect-a-thon nature, that and being so damn fun you have a dumb ear-to-ear smile for all of the playtime.  \n \nIf you enjoyed the Ratchet and Clank games in the past, its way more of that + the dimensional gimmick which is really well done and very neat tech wise. I love the new movement features and Rivet is a very good addition to the cast. I hope she stays relevant in the story in the future. Game feels super good to play as well, weapons are great as always. The writing is still funny and enjoyable. It's just a good time, and I highly recommend it, even at full price.\n\nLastly, I would like to direct a message to Sony/PS Studios/Insomniac Games:\nPLEASE PORT THE OTHER AND OLDER R&C GAMES PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE IPELASE PLs I WILL PAY $70\n- WARNING. This game is pure drug. Don't buy unless You have no kids, no wife and You have a lot free time. I mean thousands of hours.\n\nYour brain will turn into a machine calculating the optimal use of all available resources on the map, there are hundreds of them and each discovery brings new threats from the beautiful mother nature. At some point You may experience unexpected dreams about high tech and well tuned factories.\n\nEarly Access in this case means something similar to never ending story. When You think \"I have done everything\" new update shows up and You're starting doing mess again.\n\nI can only have reservations about the multiplayer mode, where there are funny glitches, disappearing objects, self-propelled vehicles, lack of character synchronization, etc. However, this does not prevent having continuous fun in the co-op mode.\n\nI hope You like it so much as I did.\n\nEDIT: Still thinking of buying it? Don't think, just do it. U8 changed a lot, it's now Unreal Engine 5 with Lumen effects, devs are pushing forward to get final product release. Join the party!\n- if we showed this to senators in the 90's video games would be banned today\n- Play this game in roguelike mode (no extra lives) as that seems to be how it was designed. By letting objects of the same type touch each other you will be able to deal damage to or destroy them all with one move! Attacking enemies will damage you back so you have to use potions that also drop down to heal.\n\nI see some of the reviews here saying this game sucks and it's all randomness. It's a roguelike though, so there is a good deal of randomness but the fun comes from gaining skill with the mechanics and making the right decisions. If you can carve out lone pieces and allow a bunch of the same object to get into a big cluster, popping that huge chain is super satisfying. \n\nThe game was very intimidating at first and I would die in the first 2 stages over and over, but I eventually got the hang of things and beat the game for the first time pretty quickly. This game requires patience to get a hang of the mechanics but once you do it's a fun little time waster to open up every once in a while. There are lots of characters to unlock too and they all bring their own strategies to the table.\n- [h1] Look at my hours real quick. That's about. 4 hours? [/h1]\n\nFallout 76 is boring. There's no other way to put it. The Core objective of Fallout 76 was to gear the Fallout 4 engine for multiplayer. They succeeded! The art is visually amazing, even down to the 2D art shown all over this store page, so what's wrong?\n\nConsider who's still playing this game. Who's desperate enough to play this game? Well, It's not a lot of people. And they aren't very good people. It's just people. Existing. I had 0 conversations during my 4 hours. \n\nLets talk playing. The game is boring. Since I just mentioned the objective, lets talk about the NPC's ETC. [b] I got this game for free, I cannot emphasize how little this game means to me. It's terrible. [/b] The NPC's & story were not part of core development therefore the game suffers. You get stuck doing some quests you don't care about and play a game you'd rather not play. The NPC's are essential as expected so, you cannot kill them either. \n\nMicrotransactions Via Atomic Shop & Premium plague the game [i] but lets talk about more! [/i] There's free events like a crate dropping & player trading outposts. Wanna know what's wrong here? The game boils down to, find a player trading outpost and buy sh*t, or just dropping crates? well the crates are full of nothing. the games gear-towards premium really gives you nothing in terms of loot so you're playing what is a hollow, unfinished, boring, game. Even in 2021! \n\nCreatures & enemies are cool however there's a big issue of the game not being cool. You may say its worth it to play just to engage the wild-life but even they feel soul-less and void of life. I don't know how you make a game so devoid of soul really. I've met mannequins with more personality than anything I met in Fallout 76. \n\nThe world isn't interesting, it's a barren void forestry area. Sometimes you get a tiny bit of quest, however aside from this game being a complete and utter lore-destroyer for those interested, what it does leave is not good enough to compensate for all of the cons. Honestly, if this was a mod for 4, I'd feel better. But even when getting this for free, I feel scammed.\n\n[b] I'll end this by repeating my hours. 4. At no point was I excited. Enthralled. Interested. I sat for 4 hours, wanting to tear my hair out and scream, because I was so bored. I had tests in school, more interesting than this. The entire 4 hours I spent playing, I wish I had played anything else, & I got this for free! I genuinely wish you the best of help if you end up buying this game. It's horrific. [/b]\n- DO NOT LET OTHERS FOOL YOU!.\n\nI have been playing Souls games since before there were souls games.\n\nThe remaster of DS1 is not perfect. But it is a very good way to play the game again with new or even old friends who also love the franchise.\n\nMy current PC specs are:\ni5-6500\nGTX1060 3gb\n24g DDR4\nAsus Maximus Hero 8 mobo\n\nI get a constant 60fps while in 2k resolution in EVERY ZONE of the game. No dips, no stuttering, no tearing.\nThere are some misaligned textures in spots but it is nothing you will see unless you know where to look.\n\nHave yet to run into any cheaters!. \n\nFUN FACT!: If you know of any of the more \"well known\" cheaters?, goto their steam profile and block all communications. It will not allow them to join into your world as the game runs on steam's client servers.\n\nIf you love the souls games. If you already own DS1?, IT IS WORTH the $25 dollars (CAD) to experience it all again and this time with friends and better fps!.\n- Great story, great features. But in my honest opinion unless your going for a nostalgia trip, give it a pass. The gun play and AI alone is enough for me to justify a refund, I mean shit cops hear the sounds of gunshots right next to them and act like nothing is happening. Immersion 0/10 sorry. I must admit I really enjoyed this game on console, but I am gonna have to take the money and run. Notice how almost all of the reviews just say All YOU haD to do Was FoLlow The DAmn Train cj or Ill HAve TWo NumBER 9s. I cant say I didn't expect this game to be a little shit judging by how old it is, but I will NOT suck it off and say buy it, the actual game play is PATHETIC. In all honesty I think this game remastered with gta v's physics and polish would be SOOO much better than gta v. They really captured the hood life in this one, damn shame it fucking sucks. This game's age sadly isn't up to par and sadly, it's getting a fat thumbs down from this boomer.\n- Classic Mortal Kombat with modern-day graphics & extra mechanics.\nA Fun Educational Game For learning more about the inner workings of the Human Body and Skeletal system.\nfamily friendly pg clean game for children!\n\nHere Is How To Fix The Crashing Problem! \n< Go to your library, click on MKX.\n> Locate the part that says \"DLC\", it should be right below the achievements.\n< You'll see Install pack 1 through 20 something.\n> Select all of them and they will begin to install manually.\n\nhope you enjoy playing.\nGood Luck🌹\n7.5/10\n- I came across Dreamscaper after playing 200 hours of Hades. I was looking for similar games that could recapture some of the magic of discovery and progression that made Hades such a delightful experience.\n\nDreamscaper is not Hades. There probably isn't any game that can measure up to the experience of playing Hades, and there probably won't be for a long while. But a lot of the same elements are there, and I did really enjoy Dreamscaper for what it was.\n\nThe \"story\" in Dreamscaper is more of a personal journey. There aren't really \"events occurring\" so much as a character working through her issues. The supporting characters are fairly interesting, though not quite on par with the literally larger-than-life dynamic personalities of Hades. But to be fair, the characters in Dreamscaper are ordinary folks, not mythological deities.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the game is \"nostalgic.\" It's an exploration of the protagonist's childhood memories, so that makes sense. There is a very different energy here than Hades' cheeky and horny angst. It's more sad and calm.\n\nIn terms of the feel of playing the game, Dreamscaper has a lot of similarities to Hades. There is a varied arsenal of different weapons and abilities, progression through randomized levels with boss fights, a wide selection of permanent character upgrades to purchase using resources gathered during runs, a relationship system to grow closer with the characters, etc. Unlike Hades, every aspect of your loadout can change throughout a run: you can swap out weapons and abilities as you encounter new and better ones along the way. It's both more flexible than Hades and less; you're not locked in to one weapon for the entire run, and there are many more weapons and abilities (and combinations thereof); but with more randomness comes less control, so it's a lot harder to craft and hone a particular build in Dreamscaper than in Hades. A lot of the \"builds\" are elemental damage modifiers, in which all you're trying to do is find a bunch of gear that (say) deals Lightning damage or increases your Lightning damage dealt. The upgrades are largely \"number get bigger,\" and while it can be satisfying to get a bunch of cool multipliers, it does feel less \"combo\"y or \"breakable\" than Hades (though there are certainly some very powerful and broken-feeling builds you can end up with).\n\nThe gameplay is challenging, like Hades, though perhaps slightly less. Like Hades, a lot of your ability to clear rooms and defeat bosses effectively comes from learning their attack patterns and timings. I do wish there were more variety to the enemies, as many of them are just \"the guy from the last level but he is stronger and has more abilities now\" (though that criticism applies to Hades as well). The boss fights are by and large much easier once you learn their patterns, though there are still a few that can be tough for certain builds. The \"hard version\" of bosses are definitely a force to be reckoned with, though.\n\nThe art and music are attractive and inviting. It's much more The Sims than Guilty Gear, but in a way that fits the atmosphere nicely. It's stylized in a very different way than Hades, but it works in its own way.\n\nThe developers are also very community-oriented and are responsive to community input through their Discord. The Hades developers probably are too, but I have no direct experience interacting with them.\n\nSo in conclusion, if you liked Hades because of its horny angst, badass metal riffs, mythological themes, and bloody humor, you may not have much interest in Dreamscaper. But if you liked Hades because of its randomized runs, variety of weapons and builds, feeling of progression, challenging boss fights, and dynamic cast of characters with complicated relationships, then you should absolutely pick up Dreamscaper. And if you didn't like Hades, then you probably stopped reading this review after the first paragraph.\n- [h1]Old, but has massive depth of content // Recommended for immersive role-players[/h1]\n\n+ Combat in general, and melee combat in particular, is very polished and open for an older title; everything can be controlled, such as directional blocking, without overcomplicating the mechanics involved\n+ Character creation is meticulously in-depth; initial backstory creation works seamlessly with selection of primary attributes in a way that makes the final product always feel refreshingly unique\n+ 'Story' is about as open-ended as can be, to the point where the game essentially has no story, and is something of a thirteenth century sand-box title; the player has complete, unadulterated freedom\n+ The game encourages the player to recruit and build a personal army as he/she progresses, and the mechanics put in place for doing so are well-rounded and complex\n+ Extremely easy and satisfying to mod; highly recommended\n+ Sorting and commanding one's troops is key, and the player would do well to benefit fromt he excellent command mechanics of the game; strategy is massively important and competently implemented\n+ Economics of the game add another layer of challenge to the game; trade and balancing one's income against one's expenses are both crucial elements to consider\n+ Multiplayer is fairly standard, run-of-the-mill stuff, but it's still densely populated and everything seems to connect well; the charm of the game, and its solid combat system, keep the players coming back in droves after more than five years\n\n- Politics, which are interesting and engaging in scope, end up being a somewhat weaker feature in practice, as NPCs are largely static during negotiations; this does break the immersion slightly, as it seems that your successes are based purely on stats, and not on the actual implications of one's choices\n- Quests often become tedious and repetitive\n- Tutorial is underwheling and largely insufficient to introduce the more in-depth mechanics that will be used outside of combat\n- Visuals are outdated and didn't stand well the test of time; even for the year of release, the textures and polygon counts are well below par\n\n[h1]LockeProposal's Big Day Out[/h1]\n\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/bigdayout#]Community Group[/url]\n[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/7611703/]Curator Page[/url]\n[url=https://www.reddit.com/r/SeriousSteamReviews/]Serious Steam Reviews subReddit[/url]\n- This game is like cocaine. \nI always tell myself just one more, then im done. I'll do homework. I'll sleep. I'll eat something. \nBut you know what? That last death was cheap, I'll do one more to make up for it. I just need 1000 gold for that upgrade, I'll just do one more to get it. Always just one more. \n\nThings I like:\n\n+Strong RPG Progression - Gold from your run can be spent on stats, equipment, abilities, etc. making multiple runs and longer runs more rewarding.\n\n+The game is witty and has flavor. -- there are various conditions your new characters can have such as being blind, gay or having a fear of chickens, amongst many, many others. Dying is in this sense, pretty fun. The writing has a lot of charm!\n\n+The controls are very tight -- this game has good controls. It's easy to do what you want, which is good because it's very tough and you will die a lot.\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n- The bosses in new game plus don't get harder -- As you progress into new game + or ++ or +++ and beyond, the bosses don't scale well, despite the general enemies leveling up to basically become bosses themselves. Not a huge deal, but it's the only negative I have.\n\nThen at some point you realize you've beaten the game, Thankfully there is a new game plus.\nMaybe just one more playthrough...\n- Not For Broadcast is in the simplest of terms, a multi-tasking simulator.\n\nYou sit in a news control room and you have to keep track of multiple things: censoring curse words, switching between cameras, playing ads at the right time, ensuring your broadcast frequency isn't disrupted, as well as keeping an eye out for a bunch of other strange things that appear later in the game.\n\nThis isn't the easiest of games as it requires a good deal of attentiveness. The description isn't joking when they call this \"high-pressure\". You have to rely heavily on both audio and visual cues to make sure your broadcast doesn't get screwed up. As this is the news (and live), there is no rewind or undo button. If you mess up and want to get a good performance grade, you'll need to redo the entire news segment. \nIf you're a perfectionist like me, a 10 min segment can end up turning into an hour of trying to perfect that news segment. As such, I do hope an option to quick save, or at the very least, save and quit, can later be put into the game. It felt rather taxing having to keep an eye on so many things for so long. But as with any game, excellence isn't an art, it's a habit. You'll find yourself turning into a multitasking expert eventually.\n\nThankfully, the actors in the game do a great job of making the experience an entertaining one. There is a good amount of humour written into each broadcast, although I must admit I wasn't quite able to pay attention to all the dialogue, as I was too busy trying to switch to the right cameras whilst ensuring my electricity didn't get cut out. Luckily, the game does have an archive which allows you to playback the broadcasts. Without that, I'd probably be missing out on 70% of what was going on.\n\nThere is also a text narrative, choices matter portion in between news segments. As of now, it feels a little out of place and incomplete, but then again, this is an Early Access review.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that at the time of writing this review, there isn't really any \"propaganda\" aspect to the game yet.\n\nPerformance-wise, the game runs pretty smoothly. I did encounter occasional crashes if I looked left or right and back and forth too quickly, but other than that, the game is pretty much bug-free. Also, this game has my RTX 2070 Super running at rather high temps for some reason. Rather surprising for a game that doesn't appear to have particularly high-end graphics.\n\nAnyway, I'll be looking forward to see what comes next for this game. Definitely worth the buy despite being Early Access.\n- the game itself is pretty ok and fun for what it is, and runs great on deck. but man, F**K THE ALWAYS-ONLINE-DRM WHICH AT TIMES TAKES AGES TO CONNECT, GETTING THE GAME STUCK IN THE MENU WITH NOTHING TO DO!!\n\n>> Update after 20h played:\nI really enjoy playing the game. It is good, it is fun and runs great on the Steam Deck, which is especially important to me, as I tend to travel a lot as part of my job.\n\nThat being said, however, is core of the issue: The Always-On-DRM actually prevents me from playing this game on the go. Having this sort of DRM is, in my opinion, only predatory and inexcusable in any way. I get that the online-components of the game will not work when I am on the move, but I am mainly interested in the single player experience, from which I am also locked out. I am even locked out of the main menu without a stable internet collection, which is just ridiculous.\n- First of all, I really like the Game, it's Gameplay is wonderful and i really enjoy the parkour to combat mix in it. Although i noticed a lot of bugs especially in COOP i still enjoy logging on the game.\n\nThe Story is good but doesn't need a upgrade in my opinion. I like that certain map changes and Story decisions are dependant on some side quests and on each other.\n\nNow to the sad part:\n\nTencent recently bought Techland which was controversial at first, but then DL points were added which made a lot of people mad at Tencent and partially Techland, understandably.\nThey Including me don't want the game to die out because a greedy company wants to make some quick buck.\n\nAlthough i have to say myself, other Tencent bought games still are quite enjoyable.\n\nI just hope that Techland does the right thing in future and makes the current state of DL points less predatory and more Cosmetic based pure.\n\nIn it current state we still have no knifes without Bundles, but that was before Tencent so the blame for that goes to Techland, but i am excited for future updates and playing Dying light 2, even without buying DL points :)\n\nI'll give this game a solid 7/10 for the bugs, microtransactions but also because it has good gameplay and community reach\n\n(I have edited my original negative review about the pure rant about DL points because i also wanted to consider current gameplay and more)\n- Hi dev, if you were wondering whether anyone would actually use your HDR feature, I am. thanks\n- I played this game because I had a very strained relationship with my mother somewhere along my teenage years and in the end it came to be that we never saw each other anymore, nor had anymore contact as well. I decided to give this game a try because I wanted to feel what was like to have that bubbly bond between a mother and son again, back when I was younger. \n\nWell, it gave those feelings back to me, and it gave it like a sucker punch to the guts. \n\nI still listen to the OST from time to time and it still reminds me of times of childhood back before when everything became so terrifying.\n\nGive your mother a hug or a call at least if you can before you can never anymore.\n- Alpha, Beta, Finished Product... I hear lots of Blah blah blahs complaining about this game not being out of Alpha after years and years, but it isn't like we've been paying a monthly fee for it.  I paid one time to support this game and I've got years of play out of a product that I enjoy.  There aren't too many games that scratch an itch like this game for me... Open World, completely editable/buildable environment and zombies!  One of my biggest issues with a game that I like is that after I buy it, they release a few DLCs and then move on to their next product.  Alpha, Beta, Finished or Not... the developers have given me years of standing by their product and many updates with new content and mechanics.  For that alone, I love their game!\n\nGraphics: 3 outta 5 graphics, she looks a little dated but they keep updating it... It looks better than it originally did.  There's growth\nReplayability: 5 outta 5\nGameplay:3 outta 5... sometimes she's a little clunky\n\nI definitely still believe that this game is worth buying and that they devs and their product is worth supporting.  Hopefully this is helpful to someone.\n- Oh boy. This is a beautiful game. There's unlockable items, a hidden boss, lots of enemies, and characters that change your play styles. Numerous ways to make the game accessible for you!\n\nBut is the game fun? I'd say no, the game was just ok. I wasn't really solving puzzles so much dealing with a RNG generator. Ironically the bosses felt slower and more boring than the levels, they are a battle of patience, wait until the potions fall - hit them 3 or 4 times - repeat.\n\nWould I revisit this game after some patches or dlc? No, probably not. Unfortunately I think this game has some base design problems and not content or quality problems.\n- No matter what the reviews say, this game is pretty excellent.\nGameplay wise its pretty good, the match 3 systems are fun and almost exciting to play at times.\nTheres no sex, which isn't a bad thing as if thats what you're looking for just search for it online lol\nThe stories are good and the designs are pretty, sure it's short but it fits the pricepoint.\n\nThe developers have announced that they've gone bankrupt which is a shame but what can you do.\n\nOverall 8/10\n- Do yourself a favor if you get eye-strain or nauseated from the forced motion blur and/or the chromatic aberration and go to %appdata%/Local/FinchGame/Saved/Config/WindowsNoEditor and open the \"Engine.ini\" file and copy in the following:\n\n[/Script/Engine.RendererSettings]\nr.SceneColorFringe.Max=0\nr.DefaultFeature.MotionBlur=0\n\nThis will disable both effects which in my case completely removed any strain I was having.\n- Love Anemone\nLove Cal\nLove Tangent\nLove Dys\nLove Marz\nLove Tammy\nLove Sym\nLove Nomi\nLove Rex\nWe don't talk about Vace\n- Stephen's Sausage Roll is a game that the developer doesn't want normal people to buy, it seems. The description is literally, \"A simple 3d puzzle game.\", there is one video that shows you nothing about the game, and it's priced at $32 CND.\n\nFortunately, I'm here to tell you to get off your ass and to buy this wonderful game. The graphics are alright, the music is OK, but the puzzles are sublime.\n\nIn each level, the goal is the same: cook all the sausages and exit the level by standing on the exit level sign in the right orientation. You cook sausages by pushing them over a grill. Like in sokoban games, you can't pull the sausage (yet...), only push it. Another huge wrinkle is that sides of the sausage can only touch the grill once. If you touch a cooked side of a sausage to the grill, it will be burned and you fail the level. This little wrinkle will make you pull your hair out in some levels as you try and figure out how the hell you are going to maneuver the sausages around so they get cooked properly. A neat thing about the game is that if you fail, you can still continue playing the level, which might help you figure out how to play it.\n\nYou'll have a section (part of an island) that has a number of puzzles for you to solve in any order, so if you get stuck, you can try another one (until you get to the last puzzle of the section). Once you complete a section, a new section will open up with more puzzles.\n\nYour little guy has tank controls, which you will find extremely useful, as turning to the left or right near a sausage will push it in different directions. A nice detail is that the all of the puzzles make up the island section. When you activate a puzzle, the rest of the island drops away into the sea, leaving you on a tiny puzzle island.\n\nEach section introduces new mechanics into the game. First you'll just be pushing the sausages, but then you'll be stacking them, skewering them (you would think this would make things easier, but no! You can't turn when you have a skewered sausage!), walking on them...\n\nI would say that these levels are on the level of Snakebird, though I found many of them easier than Snakebird's puzzles (maybe I'm better at sokoban games than I know?). These are the kind of puzzles that you walk away from frustrated, but come back to a few hours later with the solution. This is the game where there are so many ah-ha! moments that make you feel smart. You have no idea what to do at first, but eventually you get better and better. You might not see solutions at first, but you begin to see where you need to go to solve the puzzle, and then work backwards from there. It's wonderful!\n\nIf you're having trouble, there's a community guide that has all the solutions, which is super helpful (though not as much when I was playing because it wasn't complete!).\n\nIt might be expensive, but I took 36 hours to solve all the puzzles and it was worth every penny.\n- Early review right now after a quick hour of play.\n\nLater Alligator (and I swear I'm not biased towards this game at all) is a gorgeously 2d-animated, primarily point-and-click, cartoony romp through Alligator New York City. Everyone's alligators. The gameplay itself is simplistic; unlike normal point-and-click games of this style that you might have come to expect, there's no picking up items, there's no real big decision making. It crosses over more with Professor Layton-style gameplay, wandering around the city and picking up little collectibles by clicking on various pieces of the environment.\n\nScattered in between these are a plentiful trove of minigames in all sorts of styles. As far as I can tell, they begin to increase in complexity the further you go through (for reference, the first minigame is pretty much not fail-able; you're asked to track a Queen in 3 Card Monte, however the hapless alligator running the game barely moves the cards and flails on the two that *aren't* the queen.)\n\nHowever, it seems that the gameplay and the minigames are meant more as a vehicle for the whimsical comedy of the writing and the eclectic cast of characters present throughout the city. Each character is quirky and fun in their own way, with their own little story. And that's the real draw of this game. \n\nSo this game so far doesn't particularly lend itself to anyone looking to challenge themselves. But if you just want some good feelings, a laugh, and a spot of relaxation, Later Alligator delivers in spades.\n- 3 things:\n\n-Flatten land\n\n-Click citadel to get warriors\n\n-Click warriors at their warriors\n\nGood job, you've just mastered the entire game.\n\nThe game includes such crazy moments as:\n\n-Flattening land\n\n-Seeing the enemy flatten land\n\n-flattening your land faster\n\n-Clicking trees and rocks since your workers can't do shit\n\n-Clicking your warriors into their town\n\n-Watching your warriors fight their warriors\n\n-Accidentliy Alt+Tabing and having the game get stuck in windowed mode\n\n10/10 Would trust Peter Moloneux and be dissapointed again... apparently.\n\nProtip, send this to someone that loves you and watch them try to pretend that they enjoy it.\n- In my personal opinion,Total War Warhammer 3 is better than its predecessor in every way.\n\nFactions:\nThey did an excellent job t fine tuning the older factions to the point where every faction now feels fully fleshed out and playable. The starting units are fun and the starting areas are usually in a better position. Sure, some factions start off in a really awkward ass places with really strong armies surrounding them, but overall, everything feels much more thought out.\n\nThe new factions they added to this game are fun altho for someone who might be just getting into the game, id recommend going with someone like Grand Cathay and move on from there.\n\nMap:\nThe world map is huge and i love it. The battle fields you fight in are detailed and look absolutely stunning. Fights look like movies sometimes so grab some popcorn and watch your armies die since you were munching on popcorn and not moving your units.\n\nRTS:\nthe RTS side of this game is what got the biggest improvement in my opinion. Everything is so much more clear and the battles just look insanely good. The game feels a bit more fast phase which i don't mind at all since WH2 felt like a battle of attrition sometimes and missile infantry seemed really bad.\n\nOverall i can safely say this i my favorite game currently. The multiplayer is super fun but judging by the reviews some of you leave on this game, its safe to say you have no friends to play with. \n\nDLC might cost bit more than it used to but people will complain about anything if its not free.\n- I have always wanted to play Resdient Evil 4, and I wanted to play this game so badly.  I am giving a negative review simply because the games FPS on the PC are bad, that could be because of Windows 10 because I heared rumors that the game does not run well on it and such, so that could be the problem.   Another problem I faced is the lip sync is dealyed when it's on the cutscenes so that makes everything slow and such.  The gameplay from what I seen however is pretty great and I think Resdient Evil 4 is a great game, but this port is not, get it for the GC, Will, PS2, or any of the consloes that has this game.\n- Okay so first and foremost the reason why I'm giving this a thumbs up is simple. The game does what it set out to do perfectly. Because of that I have no complaints about it's style.\n\nHOWEVER.\n\nI personally do not like the game. It is my own personal hangup. But I can understand why other people will enjoy it.\n\nThe game is fast paced, level by level FPS with challenges. Almost every single one of them is timed if not all of them are timed. It's similar to Doom or Killing Floor. Only there are no cusomizations implemented at time of play. \n\nThe game is challenging and offers you many different faucets on those challenges. It has different gun types for different enemies, different strategies and all of them complicated and challenging. But that's the point right?\n\nRegardless, the game was pretty fun and if you're looking for a level by level challenge system set to a similar style of Doom then you might just enjoy this game.\n\nIf this wasn't enough for you then please check out the video on my YouTube Channel for a more precise in depth explanation (link below).\n\nThanks for reading and I hope I helped some of you out there to spend your money wisely.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXiok7bhPdY\n- I knew Journey is a great game,maybe one of the best video games in history,but...\n\nI didn't know why so many people moved by such a simple gameplay.\nI didn't know why people had a Journey-Fever,even players just bought PS3 only for this game.\nI didn't know how close a relationship could be in 100mins only.\nI didn't know how bad i wished to go back to the peak and stay with my friend i'll never meet again.\n\nNow I Know.\n\n“It is better to walk with a friend in the dark than alone in the light” – Helen Keller\n\nIt was an interesting experience for me, I had never played this game nor heard of it until recently. I went and looked at the store page, My Brother/Friend Ethan-Winters Just Told Me this game in the steam store now, so went ahead and bought it. After buying it, went and started up the game some day later. Went into the game, saw another model character that looks like mine, I thought it was an AI because I had thought it was a single player game. So I decided to play along with it, we went through the story, it progressed quite fast, mainly because we both did not really bother to check out other things. The more I played, the more I realized that the guy I was playing with was most definitely not an AI, it was a genuine player. As we went through the story, our cooperation got smoother, we no longer have a solo player attitude, we would signal to each other, wait for each other and walked, fly with each other. It was smoothing, relaxing, a truly unique experience. Even with the setbacks we had throughout our progression, we never gave up, we stuck together from the desert till the end, when one of us screwed up, we patiently waited for the other, chiming to the person where we are. I remember at the end, when i screwed up a jump and did not see the other player, I was genuinely scared, sad, I frantically searched for the person but to no avail. I was distraught, sad and disappointed but I continued onward. When I went up, there he was, chiming for me, assuring me that he had not left yet. I felt happy, comforted when I saw the person waiting for me and together we finished the story. I am not one to do reviews, but it was such a unique experience among my years of gaming that I had to share it. Thank you, punks for the experience, truly thank you. And thank you, for bothering to read my review.\n\ni'll never forget our journey kind stranger.\n\nThis wasn't a game, it was an experience. I highly recommend you do this.\n- [h1]One of the few multiplayer games that reminds me that people can be amazing[/h1]\n\nI've been playing games for a long time, I've seen some sh*t. I've seen people crumble, I've lost friends, I've watched people eat each other even when they are winning. When people are supposed to be working together and yet they would rather treat their ally like trash because they refuse to take the blame for their own wrongdoing.\n\nSquad is a game in which I have seen true potential. A group of 40 individuals work together to plan, execute, and accomplish masterful plans to outsmart their enemy. I've seen teams rally from the depths of defeat and flip unwinable games into incredible victories. Heros emerging from the storm of mortars landing upon their bunker, to squad leaders risking their own lives to save those of their squad.\n\nSquad is not a game for the light hearted. To enjoy squad to the fulllest, you must communicate, work together, and form a bond with the soldiers at your side. You are a team, you are a unit, and you will never win alone. Be it a medic patching the wounds of your comrades, a logistics driver supplying your team with the supplies they need at the front line, or a squad leader putting the responsibility of 8 individuals on your shoulders, each person is a vital component of the team.\n\nFor this reason, Squad has now become my most played game on steam. The depth, the people, the comraderie, it's an amazing experience that no other game captures. I encourage you all to try it out on a free weekend as I originally did, I have been playing it ever since.\n\nI'll see you on the front line.\n- This game vs. HOI3:\n---------------------\n\nAdvantages:\n\n1.) The production system is more interesting and engaging, and far more balanced than the old IC system of HOI3. \n2.) The unit creation system is far more in depth and interesting, featuring many different brigade types and support companies, allowing you to change your divisions however you would like. \n3.) This game is far more stable than HOI3.\n4.) This game is updated regularly and has bugfixes regularly too, with content being added free along with every DLC. \n5.) The modding community of HOI4 is far larger with excellent mods such as Kaiserreich, Millenium Dawn, Red World, and Endseig.\n6.) HOI4 muliplayer is actually playable without making you want to shoot yourself.\n7.) China is no longer something Japan can take within 2 months.\n8.) An actual peace conference system and ideologies that actually impact the game.\n9.) Far easier to get into than HOI3.\n10.) Less railroading and the AI wont spaz if you do something ahistorical.\n11.) Planes are no longer as cancer as they used to be.\n12.) Far less micromanagement if you choose not to want to micro.\n13.) A better tutorial (still not a great one though.)\n\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n1.) The research system is bare bones in comparison to HOI3.\n2.) The War in the Pacific is basically nonexistant and naval warfare is awful (to be improved with next patch, being released eventually:tm:)\n3.) People dont really join the war in HOI4 unless theyre directly attacked, making continents like South America completely useless due to the fact that none of the countries there ever do anything but still build up their military, contributing lag.\n4.) Due to the game's engine, it can only use a single one of your processing cores, meaning regardless of your computer quality the game will run kinda slowly.\n5.) Speaking of slowly, the game is poorly optimized and frame loss is extremely common, especially 1942 onwards, when majors can have upwards of 300+ divisions. \n6.) The AI is often braindead, doing hilariously incompetent things such as charging endlessly into your lines, removing all its troops from your front, leaving major areas completely undefended, and completely ignoring the aerial aspect of the war.\n7.) Specific AI are even more braindead than the rest, specifically island nations, or nations that otherwise need to use navies and airforces more. Yes, the Japanese, American, and British AI are some of the worst in the game. In a WW2 game. \n8.) Your allies are completely useless and often you will find yourself doing all the fighting yourself, or even being hindered by your own allies. Playing as Germany the Italians likely wont place a single division in North Africa. In D-Day, you will either be the only one contributing anything or your allies will contribute so much that the supply is ruined and your troops all die of attrition. As the USSR you will recieve 0 lend lease, and as China you will get absolutely no support from the west. \n9.) HOI3 is a lot cheaper than HOI4\n\n\nOther things which I feel are worth mentioning but arent really advantages or disadvantages:\n\n1.) HOI4 contains a lot more alt-history options, which while not for everyone, are fun to try out. \n2.) The focus-tree system is something completely different from anything in HOI3.\n3.) The game has a less in-depth OOB(Order of Battle), which while to some people is nice because theyre bad with OOB, others dislike. Specifically this game lacks corps. \n4.) The battle-planning system of HOI4, while easier to use than the one in HOI3, is still flawwed. In HOI3 it did absolutely nothing, but in this game it is a core part of playing. Unless you want to mircomanage every single division, like you did in HOI3, you will use this system. \n5.) While simpler, the game still possesses a learning curve.\n\n------------------------\n\nOverall: \n\nHOI4 is a far less grounded and historical experience than HOI3. Is this a good or bad thing? That depends on your perspective. HOI4 obviously has significant advantages over HOI3 in certain areas but many consider HOI3 to be an overall better game. Personally I recommend HOI3 if you want a more micro-intensive, historical experience, and HOI4 if you want to just sit back and relax for a couple hours murdering millions of people. \n\nPersonally I would suggest either game, but thats just me.\n- Yes, the Origin client is somewhere between annoying and broken, depending on your hardware. And yes, Dragon Age Keep is still a big jumble of poorly explained choices that affect your game in a thousand little ways if you choose to use it. And yeah, none of the old technical issues really got fixed before coming to steam - this isn't a remaster - so shiny hair and lips for everyone.\n\nBut it's nice to be able to take a walk in Thedas again, and sink into the story, and admire what is probably the last real Bioware game before EA completely turned them into another ouroboros of live service bullshit. \n\nGet it on sale, for the nostalgia if nothing else.\n- You play as a girl dashing through enemies by pressing 2 buttons. That's literally it. Each stage is the length of a song and as you play more you'll unlock more songs. \n\n\nI highly recommend this game if you're a 5 year old who can be easily entertained.\n- I fucking love this game (and the original Guacamelee as well). It's excellent, challenging platforming with a hilarious sense of humor. I'm an archaeologist who works in Mexico and this game is littered with funny and well-researched nods to Mexican history and pre-history. I imagine that matters less to the non-archaeologists out there, but the fact that they took the time to research all their jokes speaks to the care that went into this game.\n- Fez is Phil Fish's stupendous indie tour-de-force, focussing on a little dude who learns to conquer the world of 3D! \n\nFez is incredibly addictive and pleasant to play. As Phil himself states in Indie Game: The Movie, it's a stop and smell the flowers kind of game. I spent 15 hours fully completing this game and loved every minute of it. Genuinely one of my favourite games ever. \n\nThere's puzzling, platforming and cute quirks everywhere. A wonderful and fun game for everyone. Wanna enjoy the experience even more? Watch Indie Game The Movie before playing and appreciate the amount of time and effort put into this wonderful creation.\n\n-Nilesy\n- Just finished it. Having trouble putting words together.\n\nI went on a road trip around the US last year, and on my way down the west coast was surprised by how many giant factories passed by, puffing smoke into the air. One even had Google reviews, where it became clear that the town residents who worked there posted good reviews, and everyone else wanted the factory gone.\n\nThose did not compare to the oil refineries in Louisiana, one of which I had to pull off of the highway to properly behold. Certainly I'd seen images of them, but in real life their scale is hard to believe. And they're so bright, both because of innumerable light bulbs and the infamous refinery flame spouts. Even going through the pictures I took while worried the refinery security was going to attack, the size of these things accurately portrayed in none of them. I'd already played the NORCO demo by this point, and had it in my mind throughout my time in the area. There was even an encounter with an old man working at a convenience store somewhere around 1-2am who asked me if I believed in God with a crazed look in his eye, something I would not know was reality foreshadowing this game until the past week.\n\nSo my impression here, forming as I type this, is as follows: \n\nThe surreal imagery and sublime writing in NORCO combine to seem more accurate to my brief experience in the places resembling the real life Norco than any photo or video I've seen.\n\nA lot more can be said about this game, but I'm currently trying to untie my thoughts. So maybe later. For now, just know that I'd thoroughly recommend this game.\n- [h1]\"Lost in Play\" is an enchanting and nostalgic game that provides players with a whimsical journey into the world of childhood imagination.

[/b][/i]👑✨\n- Playerunknowns Battlegrounds\n\n\nIn my opinion hands down the best Battle Royale game released.\n\n\n+Built on a very flexible engine that is built to handle games of the FPS genre\n\n+Core mechanics of the game are solid and function with little to no bugs (In my experience, I've personally only encountered 2 bugs)\n\n+Vehicles that have good physics and good controls to them\n\n+The game in most aspects visually looks great\n\n+Plenty of weaponry (For release)\n\n+Gun mechanics themselves feel very solid and fluid, weapons have recoil to them and for me feel \"weighted\" \n\n+Nice animations for all weapons currently in game\n\n+The map size in my opinion is perfect. Large enough that you aren't always on top of another player (Unless you purposely land in an area with others), vehicles are useful, while also being small enough that generally it's not a painful chore to run somewhere \n\n++SPECTATOR MODE IN TEAMS (No more sitting staring at a death screen for 20 minutes waiting for your teammates, while also making your teammates feel guilty for \"leaving you behind\" ) \n\n\n\n-Server stability (There are semi frequent heavy lag spikes that can affect the entire server, from what I heard this wasn't as bad in the closed beta, hopefully this will be resolved soon) \n\n-Performance/Optimization is quite bad (For many, many people) in this, IF you don't apply some commands/launch parameters to the game. (I personally went from 25-40 fps on medium and very low, to 55-65 by inputting a simple launch parameter, this command/launch parameter \"fix\" does NOT work for everyone) \n\n\nAside from those 2 negatives I cannot think of anything else that's bad enough to be worth mentioning. \n\n\n\nOverall this game is great, even if doing solos, but is even more fun when playing with friends, I would entirely recommend it to a friend, so long as their PC is capable of handling it, or if the launch parameter works for them\n\n\n\n\nSystem specs the game was played on:\n\nIntel Core i7 6700 HQ Skylake 3.6 ghz\n\nNvidia GTX 960m 2GB \n\n16gb's DDR4 2133mhz\n\nWindows 10 \n\n(System was an ASUS ROG gaming laptop) \n\n\n\nEDIT: For those who may be looking for the launch parameter me and friends used:\n\n\nNavigate to the game in your library\n\nRight click and go to properties, click \"Set Launch Options\" and enter the following command\n\n\n\n-USEALLAVAILABLECORES -malloc=system -sm4\n- Before I continue writing my review on this game, I got to say that the PC port of Valkyria Chronicles is one of the best, if not, [u]the[/u] best port. The game was originally exclusive for the PlayStation 3 back in 2008. The game was well received, but garnered low sales that would put the sequels Valkyria Chronicles 2 and 3 on the PSP. I actually never heard of this game before until a few week prior to the PC release on November 2014. That said, I will have to give a standing ovation to Sega for putting an effort to make the PC port well optimized in 1080p (or more) at 60 FPS (or more). Sega has my attention and I will present this review.\n \nValkyria Chronicles focuses on Welkin Gunther, a son of a legendary general who fought in the First Europan War, leads a platoon of some adults and teenage volunteers to defend their country against the invading forces of the Imperial Alliance. The game presents a mix of tactical strategy and third-person action that is very unique in the strategy game genre. Does this game deserve your attention? \n\nThe story takes place in a “fictional” European continent where the Second Europan War was fought primarily between the Atlantic Federation (think of all of the European countries, in a geographical sense) versus the Imperial Alliance (Russia, in a geographic sense). Gallia is a “neutral” country where it contains a unique resource known as Ragnite. Thus, the Imperial Alliance invade Gallia to get Ragnite to fuel up their war resources. One of the greatest parts about the game is how well the developers use analogies from World War II into the game and its execution is well-received. The analogies ranged from weapon designs (like the Gallian Scout weapons that look like the Soviet SVT-40 to the Imperial weaponry comparison to the real-life MP40 and STG44, and plenty others). The analogy extends to vehicles and geopolitical conflicts. \n\nThe character developments in the game are highly impressive, particularly with the relationship between Welkin (protagonist) and Alicia Melchiott (deuteragonist). The themes in Valkyria Chronicles consist a good mix of “light” moments (like hope as an example) and “semi-grotesque” themes of war (such as discrimination/racism, personal ambition over soldiers’ lives, and others themes that will unravel later on). Some reviewers criticized the game as being not serious on the themes about war. Honestly, I don’t think that the game is supposed to be depressing and a good mix between “light” and “dark” is best suited for the game. The story starts really slow in the beginning and actually begin to progress as you reach a certain point in the story. The plot is pretty good in most area while few scenes are a bit “awkward” in terms of sudden shifts between a sad event to a “positive motivation”. \n\nThe gameplay in Valkyria Chronicles is turn-based, but it is very unique because once you click on a character to choose, you can actually control the character to move to any location in third-person you like as long you have enough Action Points (basically, the movement bar). Experience points and money are earned by Ranks (like A, B, C, and D) by completing an objective within a certain number of turns (Example: Getting a ‘A’ rank within 3 turns or less to get the maximum amount of exp and money). However, it is possible that you can actually kill all of the enemies on the map, complete the objective, and still get an ‘A’ rank in the majority of missions (except for a few of them). \n\nWith the exp and money, you train your soldiers based on classes Scout, Shocktrooper, Lancer (Anti-Tank/Explosives), Engineers, and Sniper rather than individuals. The money are used up to upgrade weapons, buy tank parts, and purchasing “reports” from a reporter in certain chapters in the story. The game would last you a good 30-50 hours if you play the game in a smart, tactical manner or have an “OCD” on getting an “A” rank on every single mission in the story or a mix of both (like I did). \n\nThe game does have some faults, particularly when it comes to classes. Reviewers argued that Scouts are too overpowered, but in my view, it is best to say that scouts are too reliable since they have the most movement bar and top-tier weapons like the ZM Kar 8 (the game's version of Soviet PTRS-41 that can obliterate any enemy, even medium and heavy tanks if you shoot it in the back). Engineers are useless in the game since you won’t repair your tank very often (depending on your play style) and Scouts are the better alternative. There are some bugs in the game that is related to the monitor refresh rate (if you play it on a 144 Hz monitor like I did) in certain missions in the story. PC controls are a bit awkward when you control the tank. There are a few moments in the story that has some poor “transitions” (an example would be that an upsetting moment happened in the story and all of a sudden, some of the major characters wanted a medal for their part on a major battle in the next cutscene as if that upsetting moment never happen or affected them). \n\nThe game is often compared to XCOM when it comes to gameplay. This may be true, but Valkyria Chronicles is very unique since you can actually control the character in third person instead of the computer doing it for you when you command the character to move from Point A to B, in bird’s eye view. The game engine is very aesthetic and presents the story very well. I’m glad the Sega released Valkyria Chronicles to the PC and I am very pleased to hear that a (possible) new Valkyria Chronicles game is being trademarked (and hopefully in development) thanks to the PC sales. The default price of $20 is a good deal, -50% off is a great deal, -75% is a perfect steal. Valkyria Chronicles is one of my top games for 2014 due to its unique strategy gameplay and superb PC port optimization. I am looking forward for the new game that is being trademarked (or possible PC ports or revamp for VC2 and 3). This game has my highest recommendation for any strategy gamer who want to find something original, unique, and beautiful.\n- Ok to make it short.\n\n- Poor graphics (like 10 years old PC game)\nBUT nothing more to complain about.\n\n- great atmosphere, great story, very good fighting mechanics. Of course great price.\n\nIf you have nothing against japan style - just play the game. One of funniest games in some years for me.\n\n【グループB】\n- As a cybersecurity professional , I would classify this game as malware, or at the least adware.\nWhy? It opens up a number, at least 10 when I checked, of connections to various points on the internet which have no purpose in running the game. They are only there so the vendor can spam you with advertising, track you, or for other unspecified activities. \nAs such, I can NOT recommend this game. \n\nTo verify, I disconnected my computer from the internet. The game ran fine without the advertising and tracking. \nThen I connected back to the internet, and launched the game. The game opened at least 10 connections(!).\nThen, while still connected to the internet, I blocked the game's network-connecting executables in the firewall. In such a case, the game behaves differently, apparently it sees there is an active connection so it runs for a while, then when it cannot make it's for-bad-purposes network connections, it terminates and you can't play. \nThis is bad behavior that I would only expect from spyware and malware. I hope the vendor fixes it so the software runs in the manner they declare - it is supposed to not require network connectivity after the initial run as they describe in the System Requirements. \nSteam should be reigning in this behavior as well.\n- Stephen's Sausage Roll is a game that the developer doesn't want normal people to buy, it seems. The description is literally, \"A simple 3d puzzle game.\", there is one video that shows you nothing about the game, and it's priced at $32 CND.\n\nFortunately, I'm here to tell you to get off your ass and to buy this wonderful game. The graphics are alright, the music is OK, but the puzzles are sublime.\n\nIn each level, the goal is the same: cook all the sausages and exit the level by standing on the exit level sign in the right orientation. You cook sausages by pushing them over a grill. Like in sokoban games, you can't pull the sausage (yet...), only push it. Another huge wrinkle is that sides of the sausage can only touch the grill once. If you touch a cooked side of a sausage to the grill, it will be burned and you fail the level. This little wrinkle will make you pull your hair out in some levels as you try and figure out how the hell you are going to maneuver the sausages around so they get cooked properly. A neat thing about the game is that if you fail, you can still continue playing the level, which might help you figure out how to play it.\n\nYou'll have a section (part of an island) that has a number of puzzles for you to solve in any order, so if you get stuck, you can try another one (until you get to the last puzzle of the section). Once you complete a section, a new section will open up with more puzzles.\n\nYour little guy has tank controls, which you will find extremely useful, as turning to the left or right near a sausage will push it in different directions. A nice detail is that the all of the puzzles make up the island section. When you activate a puzzle, the rest of the island drops away into the sea, leaving you on a tiny puzzle island.\n\nEach section introduces new mechanics into the game. First you'll just be pushing the sausages, but then you'll be stacking them, skewering them (you would think this would make things easier, but no! You can't turn when you have a skewered sausage!), walking on them...\n\nI would say that these levels are on the level of Snakebird, though I found many of them easier than Snakebird's puzzles (maybe I'm better at sokoban games than I know?). These are the kind of puzzles that you walk away from frustrated, but come back to a few hours later with the solution. This is the game where there are so many ah-ha! moments that make you feel smart. You have no idea what to do at first, but eventually you get better and better. You might not see solutions at first, but you begin to see where you need to go to solve the puzzle, and then work backwards from there. It's wonderful!\n\nIf you're having trouble, there's a community guide that has all the solutions, which is super helpful (though not as much when I was playing because it wasn't complete!).\n\nIt might be expensive, but I took 36 hours to solve all the puzzles and it was worth every penny.\n- Before I start this review, I want to make something clear. This comes from a place not of hatred, but of love. Destiny is a game near and dear to my heart and it angers me to see the way Bungie has handled it. I know they can do better.\nI've played the Destiny series since year 1, Destiny 1. I've been through its highs, its lows, and everything inbetween this game I love. I've seen content droughts, content surges, content drops and flops. I've seen this game rise... and fall.\nIt's time I faced facts, I stop huffing Copium, and be truthful; despite being with this game for years, I genuinely can't recommend it to anybody. Not in the state the game is right now. This isn't just another user complaining about a there not being new content to play constantly without any droughts, but as a player genuinely concerned for the direction Bungie is taking the game, the way the past and recent DLC have been handled, how they've monetized this game, and how they've treated their veteran playerbase.\nI bought the $100 Special Edition back when this game first released. All that content I bought with my hard earned money. Within a year $100 worth of content turned free to play. $100 for me turned into $0 for the average player within one year. I received no compensation for buying the game so early except an Emblem. An emblem. Not a potential for a free season pass when the seasons first started, no refund for my money, nothing. Where is this content now? Gone. Not a piece of it is still in the game. My compensation for this content leaving? Nothing still.\nForsaken, the best DLC they've released for this game. The DLC that brought D2 from being a shitshow to being a great, relevant game with a good story tacked on it? Wiped from this game's code.\nThe game may be \"Free to play\" but you'll sink hundreds of dollars for DLC, seasonal passes, and now separate dungeon passes worth as much as your average season pass. It's too much money to ask for people that Bungie can and will wipe from the game's code in a few months time.\nYes, the content they do bring is fun, but drip-feeding us the same content for months without any relevant changes is just not a fun game to play. What is there to do anyways? We have:\nRaids, high quality but the same ones every time\nStrikes, fun but repetitive after years of getting so little new ones\nDungeons, similar problems to the above, fun but repetitive from lack of variety\nSeasonal content, not worth doing anything but the current season unless you're trying to follow up with the game story\nCrucible with a shitty tryhard meta and hardly any new maps\nGambit, a gamemode they've basically given up on with maps they've removed from the pool\nSeasonal events, fun but the same damn thing every season\nNone of these feel fresh after years and years of doing the same ones and watching old favorites get sunset from the game.\nAnd it's not like Bungie can't look back at D1 for inspiration; Sparrow Racing League is something players have been clamoring for, it'd be something fresh that Bungie can use to entice players to stay in the game. Bungie has gone on record stating that \"by the time they've designed an SRL map for Destiny 2, they could have made several strikes maps\" which to me states that A: they aren't willing to put in the effort for player experience and B: aren't willing to make several strike maps worth of content at once.\nAnd getting new players into Destiny? The most painful experience I've tried to do. This game's onboarding experience is horrible, mismanaged, and held back by half the content being locked behind a paywall. From friends I've tried to get into the game, the new player experience is:\nOverwhelming\nConfusing\nNo sense of clear direction\nAll the cool stuff is locked behind paid dlc\nWhy was I put into this random mission when I booted up the game (seasonal mission you start with at every season)\nAny many more comments that made them not want to play the game.\n\nI know this review was basically a rant about how I feel this game is going with no clear rime or reason, jumping from topic to topic, but I just want to see this game thrive the way I know it can. Because Bungie has shown to be a competent company with quality products, but I'm just not seeing that right now.\nAnd i also want compensation for the $100 I watched vanish in the span of a year.\n- Started strong, ended annoyingly.\n\nMoral of the story? People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.\n\nIt paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that \"routine\" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.\n\nI liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters. But it all fell apart and tries to teach a very vapid moral that someone in their early 20's who has never had a meaningful relationship would idealize.\n\nAt least it was short.\n\n- oh good god how do i remove things from my library\n- I really wanted to like it, but i can't, in good faith, recommend A Space for the Unbound to anyone. It's a crying shame, because i deeply respect the intention behind the project. I love the whimsical, yet somewhat grounded premise: anyone who likes Makoto Shinkai movies will feel right at home. The intrigue, even though the plot twists are fairly obvious, still creates an unsettling feeling of uncertainty and dread that clashes (in a good way) with cheerful, bright colors of youth. A Space for the Unbound is mainly a point-and-click quest, but the developers still tried to spice the gameplay up a little with mini-games and little one-off mechanics that successfully break up the monotony.\n\nAnd yet... For every memorable, emotional peak A Space for the Unbound presents an hour of pure, unadulterated filler. Almost every \"puzzle\" is a multi-step fetch quest that requires you to backtrack multiple times with no other reason than to pad the length of the gameplay sections. It also indulges in \"gotcha\" moments, where the game deliberately fools you into the wrong solution, while the right one, of course, requires you to back track somewhere. Yes, the hometown of our main heroes is not that big, but that's hardly an excuse. Even more so in numerous dream sequences, where you are often times forced to go back and forth between someone's mind and reality to collect key items. Spacedives represent a wonderful opportunity to do something different, but A Space for the Unbound rarely delivers on that front.\n\nMost people praise the game for the story, the characters and the fact that it was made in Indonesia -- an under-represented region when it comes to games. But neither of those three have any solid writing to stand on their own. Sure, Atma and Raya can be sweet, but developers never allow their relationship to truly blossom. There's almost no banter, she's not even a constant presence in the story. Raya is important to the world of A Space for the Unbound, but doesn't really feel important to the player. Yes, the game tries really hard to tug at your heartstrings, but more often than not does so in a terribly hamfisted manner. It's supposed to be so profound and melodramatic that, at a certain point, it becomes difficult to take the game seriously.\n\nOh, and speaking of representing the community, A Space for the Unbound doesn't do a good job. The town itself is cute and full of life, there's no argument about that, but all of its inhabintants are either nameless mannequins with a so-so pixel-art, or just item bots. You speak to them once or twice, they give you what you need to advance the plot, and that's it. The fact that the game forces you to run laps around the town on an endless search for items doesn't make it any more charming or cozy. While, on the other hand, the authors only briefly touch on real societal issues, so as not to spoil the whimsy. In short, it's a huge nothingburger of a letdown, despite the fact that the whole setting is clearly supposed to be warm and nostalgic.\n\nYes, you can excuse some of those flaws by the main plot twist, which i will not spoild. But while it does make certain things more clear in hindsight, again, it does not portray the story in a good light. A Space for the Unbound really wants to be a Makoto Shinkai movie by way of Night in the Woods, but falls tragically short wherever you look. However, despite my criticisms, i hope Mojiken will not stop making games. It is very clear that the devs have tremendous passion and some talent on display -- it just needs refinement.\n- An excellent maximalist mashup of Slay The Spire with some Tower Defence and CCG Mechanics. Not as tight and elegantly designed as StS, but with a lot more variety in card design leads to a lot more varied and wild interactions and deck composition. Compulsive and mechanically satisfying, Monster Train embraces excess in a satisfying way, even if the whole package is wrapped up in a slightly odd aesthetic package of half remembered hearthstone knock offs. (The soundtrack, incidentally, slaps)\n- [i]While the artwork and combat remain enjoyable, the story, writing, and pacing were a major letdown.[/i]  \n\n***\nMINOR SPOILERS BELOW. If you're going to play the game, play before reading.\n***\n\n[b]The mature storylines, hard-hitting decisions, beautiful worldbuilding, and tight writing that made the first two so immersive is not present in this game.[/b] (You'll notice immediately that the writing for the caravan in the capital is [i]particular[/i] trite, awkward to read, and uninteresting.)\n\nUnfortunately, it's not just the writing that's weak. [i]The pacing is off.[/i] Antecedents are confusing, characters you'd expect to speak don't, events that should have been foreshadowed come out of nowhere. More frustrating are the serious character continuity \"errors,\" and arcs that disappear, change, or go nowhere. [i]In short, the events, decisions, and conflict from the previous games do not appear or resolve in a way that was suggested by the previous two[/i].\n\n\nHere's one example. In Banner Saga 2, Fosolt is unexpectedly rescued by Bolverk. [i]\"I have a message for Alette from the dead varl king,\" [/i]he said. That's pretty intriuging! Maybe there's a mystery, an oracle, an item, or just cool information about the Varl and their strange king? Maybe there'll finally be context about the bridge decision!\n\n[i]No! He has nothing interesting to say or add, and then his storyline just gets dropped and forgotten.[/i]\n\nWell, Bolverk's been possessed by Bellower! Gosh, who knows what Bellower will say? In fact, I can't wait to find out what happens to Bellower's body! \n\nWell, actually, Bolver's [i]not[/i] possessed, not really, certainly not like it was implied last game, and Bellower's body -- [i]a primary focus of the first two games[/i] -- isn't mentioned [i]once[/i]\n\nOr how about how they casually mention that Eyvyn is not only the [i]head[/i] of the Valka order, but also that he's had periodic bursts of hereditary madness all along? That's... odd. And it's not presented as an well-thought out [i]reveal[/i] or anything. It's presented matter-of-factly, like they were trying to ret-con in a less interesting story, or were tone deaf.\n\nYou'll notice that all the characters are underutilized and have unfulfilled storylines/tensions. Hakon has hard choices to make; Canary's a little crazy; Yrsa is mysterious; Gil's in love with Alette, etc. Will these build into choices? Reveals? Dependent endings based on choices? Will there be discussions referencing the past? Reflections on travels? Hints of despair?\n\nNo. In mine, Gil was [i]murdered[/i] and no one even bothered to reference it. Canary's situation never comes to a head. You never have to choose between Varls and Humans. Murdering people doesn't make people threaten to leave. Ubin returns randomly as an uber Varl and he's... learned the horseborne's language? Travelled the southlands? In like, a month? In a way that doesn't advance the plot? It's just... weakly done.\n\n\nThere are [i]so many[/i] examples like this, where the stories don't quite fit correctly, where what you picked up on in the early games about the [i]mysteries[/i] and the [i]world[/i] and what made it a [i]vibrant[/i] place were forgotten about by the writers. [b]The result is that it the game plays out in unsatisfying ways, in tenseless scenarios made vapid by watered-down morality, an inability to leverage the situation in fun ways, and low-quality writing, paucity of choice-making, a lack of exploration, lack of plot twists, simplified overworld mechanics -- all culminating in an almost staggeringly one-dimensional and shallow ending.[/b]\n\nThe Banner Saga series was always an experience that was greater than the sum of its part. An [i]experience[/i]. Of being [i]riveted[/i] to the computer, checking the map, worrying over supplies, guessing at mysteries, having my breath taken away at each hill. Unfortunately, that's not the case in this game. \n\n\nGameplay-wise, it's also a bit of a letdown. Combat is fun-ish, but you can make invincible character combinations and the mechanics don't even try to deal with this. There's an interesting new reinforcement mechanic that's not used heavily, and never pushes you like you think the end of the world would. You never really have to split up your forces. There's no novelty. Like maybe using a hero in a battle makes them fatigued, so you have to switch them up? Maybe you can station them different places, making them unusable for combat? Maybe you need to choose eight for a secret mission caravan? Maybe dream sequences? No, nothing like that. \n\nThe overworld gameplay had some changes that never really felt significant. Moreover, quite a bit felt taken away. You can't rest, do training missions, no longer weigh food vs upgrades. One example of all thise tone deafness was Iver's march through the destroyed world was consistently at \"Great Morale!\"\n\nThere didn't seem to be many flavor choices (\"Do we hang the criminals or let them join us?\"), including much less on social themes (\"Should women fight, if it disturbs the traditionally-minded men?\" \"One clan's rowdy, what do we do?\" \"They threaten to leave if so and so isn't banished\"), and less delayed results and fewer significant decisions, including among the game's built-up tensions among the factions. \n\n\nThere's also some cases of development [i]feeling[/i] cheap. Remember opening Banner Saga 2, and feeling that it was [i]fresh[/i], and [i]upgraded[/i]? There's little to make you feel that way here. The artwork is okay, but the environments feel more generic, with less variety, and the surreal landscapes in the darkness aren't especially interesting to look at for long periods of time. Iver is voiced by Bolverk's voice actor, and they sound exactly the same. The new title system is a fun idea, but is visually integrated into the game's menu system with the finesse of a cheap mod. \n\nThere's a moment in the game where the screen goes black for scrolling text and voiceover narration explaining the upcoming mechanic. Um, a character can't explain that? It was similar how the many two second animations are used, not to supplement the story, but to [i]replace[/i] written portions, making you feel unsure about what's going on. And finally, the game's pretty short, without fun combat challenges or interesting newgame+ challenges. \n\n\nWhat's [i]particularly[/i] frustrating is that the game's release date was moved forward four months. I don't know the story why, but I do know that a few more months of polish and story embellishment might have delivered the beautiful, grippingly interactive story we were hoping for. Because this is a watered down version of the previous two in just about every way.\n\nThis negative review is for whatever processes lead to this mediocre finale.\n\n---\n\n[i]Here's a plot that would have made more sense. Zephyr arrives and speaks to you secretly. There's a god that's still alive! Neat, now we'll finally get more story on that. Yay, fun caravan mode, now we need to take longships somewhere interesting!\n\nBut uh-oh! There's a Sundr villain going there as well, with an army of dredge! But at least now we'll finally get more story about the Sundr! \n\nThe god reveals something interesting, talks about Juno, the sun, gives a means to protect the city and help Iver. But when you return to the city, now the king and rugga and the factions have devolved into fighting based on your choices. How are you going to handle this? Which of many possibilities will ascend to the throne? How will you defend the city? And what mystery lies beneath the mountain of the city...\n\nFor Iver's caravan, there should be pockets of dredge villages kept alive by Spellsingers. Now you need to decide to plunder them or not! More stuff to do! Maybe go to the remains of the Varl capital first? Fight warped Valka? Realize deceptions, machinations, corruption, hear stories? Find new characters, have old ones die?\n\nInstead there... wasn't a plot?[/i]\n- I was hoping for a good game but I can't believe the positive reviews. Really annoying on a personal level. If you like your hand held and revel in 3rd person view then enjoy, but I think it's terrible. I was on the mountain jumping across a platform. \"Press ENTER\" to 'grab' it suggests. I press ENTER and what do you know? Nothing happens. Well, you die continually because what it tells you to do (zzzzz) doesn't work. Ah, maybe this is part of the 'difficulty'...hahahaha.\n\nNot a patch on any Far Cry or GTA even though these are full of directions. First Tomb Raider I've bought and definitely the last. What is it with games these days telling you what to do every step of the way: Do this...do that....go here....find item...take item...drop item...fire now.....pull lever...talk....rest....jump.... quit game and uninstall, ya that's the best option. As this game is created for a dumbed-down society or tailored for intellectually challenged meercats, some of us can see where the industry is heading. What happened to thinking for yourself???\n\nI don't need to progess far in this game because the first 10 minutes says enough. Do this, do that, blah blah blah...\n- \"The good things, the happy things, all of it changes. Nothing can stay the same forever. Still...can you find it in your heart to still love this place?\" (paraphrase)\n\nClannad . . .\n\nOH Clannad . . .\n\nI remember watching the anime in high school, and absolutely falling in love with it. Upon realizing the REAL story was told in a visual novel...I HAD to get my hands on it. I almost died of a joy-induced heart attack when a legitimate English version of the game was released on Steam.\n\nThis game bro. This f***** game. When I was a senior in high school back in the day, this game was my refuge. I was mostly friends with older kids back then, so by the time I was a senior I didn't really have anybody to chill with cuz all my friends already graduated. Its kinda hard for me to make new friends, then and now if I'm being honest. I related to Nagisa a lot for that reason. \n\nI mostly related to Tomoya and Sunohara tho. One of my best friends growing up really reminded me of Sunohara no cap lol. Type of dude who was the comic relief/brunt of everyone's s*** talking but w/ a mutual understanding its done in jest and love. And when things ever got serious we always had each others' backs, and even tho he's a goofball and kind of a meme, he's seriously loyal and a true ride or die.\n\nMany times when Tomoya was expressing himself in this game, I had to almost pinch my face and remind myself I'm not the one thinking these thoughts: I'm playing a VN lol. That's how much I seriously related to Tomoya. In so many aspects and ways that would make my review even longer than it is now if I were to attempt to explain why I relate to Tomoya so much. Yeah, sure that could just be shrewd character design from Maeda Jun's part, but it was almost uncanny how many of the things Tomoya went thru when he was younger/issues with his father/intimacy issues he develops later on in adulthood etc. almost perfectly mirrored what I was struggling with irl. It gave me something to relate to. It expressed emotions I was having trouble even admitting were present in my own self. Maybe that's the real reason I love Clannad so much, and maybe because of that I sit here biased with rose-colored nostalgia goggles. But even if I type this review with a tinge of rose-coloring obstructing my critical eyes, I can say with confidence that Clannad is more than a game. More than an anime. \n\nClannad is an experience. An experience I wish I could forget all about...just so I could experience it anew all over again. Whether you experience Clannad thru the anime, VN, movie, whatever...Clannad is an experience in a league of its own in my book. And the best way to have your Clannad experience is by playing this masterpiece of a Visual Novel. Hands down. \n\nHonestly, I'd ideally have all Clannad virgins go straight to the VN and play it to completion but that's just not a realistic request as this game takes the average player 80+ hours to complete just the main story apart from optional achievements haha. If you're a fan of the anime...why haven't you played the VN yet!? Lol. If you've never seen the anime or movie I'd STILL recommend playing this game. Just keep in mind to use a guide (just trust me on that. please) and be willing for it to be a bit boring at first. If you stick with it, believe me...it's not gonna stay boring for long.\n\nIf you liked the anime but hated the anime ending, PLAY THE VN. No spoilers, but trust me when I say the VN ending is the true conclusion of the Clannad experience. You'll find out what I mean if you stick with the VISUAL NOVEL to the end.\n\nI didn't go to my senior prom. I spent it playing this game. And I don't regret that decision one bit to this day. I experienced this game, standing in similar shoes as Tomoya at that time irl: rebellious kid about to graduate high school with no real goals or aspirations, struggling to find it hard to \"love this place\" or truly find something passionate to live for. I didn't want to go to college. There was nothing I wanted to do there. Most of the people in my grade back then thought I was quiet and lonely freshman-sophomore, then bad news junior-senior when I started acting out. I was just, lost. \n\nExperiencing Clannad helped me find what I was truly passionate about in life. Family. Friendship (as corny as that may sound). Being able to step up for what only YOU can protect when life is calling you to maturity.\n\nClannad helped me see that even though things can get dark... even though tragedies will happen regardless of our efforts to keep them from happening... even though things can never, and will never, ever stay the same in this life...and even if you lose your way eventually... and sadly reach such a lost and depressed state in life, that you mistakenly conclude for a short while you'd rather sever all your connections and ties with the world and everybody in it... in an effort to try to prevent experiencing even more pain... \n\nThat \"loving this place,\" loving this world, loving people, and forming deep, lifelong and lasting connections with this world and its people, NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS, is ALWAYS, ALWAYS, worth it in the end. Especially when it matters the most.\n\nNow I'm not gonna front: Clannad isn't for everybody. Some people just can't get into the moe art style. Some people may find it a bit too melodramatic at times. Some people may find some of the comedy or bits of the story weird, or just not their cup of tea. Some people may find it hard to relate to all of the characters, and for some people it won't have a Cindarella's slipper level of relatability like it did for me. For those people who are kinda feelin \"ehh idk if i'll really like this game\" I'd say it'd be smart to watch the anime first. But if you're feeling good about it and wanna experience Clannad the BEST way: cop this VN. Just wait for the good bits to slowly boil. Patience is a virtue :) And save yourself hours of rage by using a guide from the beginning until the after-story credits roll. With Clannad I'd say its almost always recommended to use a guide.\n\nAnd if you love the anime and haven't played the VN... you're weirdo number 1, 2, 3, 4 and even 5. Haha I'm playin but srsly get the VN already you owe it to yourself to experience the VN. Knowing what happens in the story and getting some events \"spoiled\" doesn't detract from the VN experience. That I promise you. As someone who watched the anime before playing the VN, who's now such an obvious fanboy of the Clannad VN as demonstrated by my wall of text of a review (lol), trust me: I'd bet money you'll love this game just as much as I do.  \n\nTo Maeda Jun, and all of the brilliant writers of this quintessential, modern classic of a story: thank you. Thank you for gifting all of us the experience that is Clannad. Because of your labours, you've helped a wayward knucklehead like me finally be able to declare this in spirit and in truth:\n\n\"I love this place.\"\n\nLong live Kazamatsuri!\n- I have never cried so damn much at a game\n- Earlier this week I did the impossible - I came out to a family member. One of my two sisters, in specific.\n\nI was nervous but relieved to know she accepted and supported me - and thought, you know, perhaps we should call and talk about some things. We had that call this Wednesday and I expressed a lot of my resentment towards my family - being stuck at home with some of my family, more specifically my [spoiler]mom[/spoiler], has completely wrecked my mental health. I'm still closeted from them and I live with each passing day, worried [spoiler]she'd[/spoiler] reject me - for being non-binary, for dating a trans person, for disappointing [spoiler]her[/spoiler].\n\nMy sister told me that [spoiler] my mom [/spoiler] only hears what [spoiler]she[/spoiler] wants to hear, that [spoiler]she[/spoiler] only thinks about what [spoiler]she[/spoiler] wants to see in [spoiler]her[/spoiler] kids despite often saying otherwise. From her experience, [spoiler]mom[/spoiler] seemed to be a very not open and is often a close-minded individual. \nComing into If Found..., I had only broke down early Thursday morning as my many months of frustrations and anxieties finally given the voice it needed.\n\nIf you've played the game it'd make sense if I told you that Kasio's experience with her parents in If Found... hurt reading for me - it genuinely hurt. Seeing her mom's first letter and annotating it with \"She's trying. But she has all these ideas of how I should be.\" and \"She didn't even consider she might need to apologize too.\" was something I sat at for a long time, probably longer than any other part of her journal that I was erasing through at a normal pace.\n\nMoments like that made me realize that this game is something I never knew I needed - a realization that hey, think about the move out you're doing in a month as rebuilding - as leaving the past behind. That there isn't anything wrong with that, and that you can really be yourself once we're out there, together. That family doesn't have to be bound by blood and it's really about the people who's there for you, even at your absolute worst. That I don't need to seek acceptance through others - but rather be more accepting of myself.\n\n[spoiler]\"I find I care less and less what other people think of me, and more for my own opinion. And these days I'm so much more comfortable in my own skin.\"[/spoiler]\n\nThere's people I can think of who need to read and see this.\n\nIf Found... left me with hope - and it's leaving me with a lot to think about. Thank you so much for this game, DREAMFEEL. I wish I could articulate this game better like other people have - but it's been a lot lately and I need to rest - if you're coming across this review/text you should without a doubt play it, especially if you've felt similarly trapped like both me and Kasio did.\n\nP.S. - If you find the eraser mechanic to be a little strenuous you can increase the size of the eraser in the options!\n- Black Mesa is a fantastic remake of the Original Valve classic and one of the greatest of all time video games, Half-Life.  This sci-fi classic FPS has you take on what might seem like a hum-drum day in the life of an experimental physicist, but things go quite off rails when experimenting with a strange material sample from an even stranger dude in a suit. \n\nAfter a while (and shooting a lot of aliens and bashing their heads in with a crowbar) you'll save the world... but now Black Mesa lets you do this with dramatically updated graphics, 4K support and a plethora of visual tweaks so you can rest assured this will run great on any gaming rig. \n\nA must have for big fans of Half-Life or gamers who are new to the scene and never got to play the original.   When on sale, of course!\n- I am a day one player who quit the game within a few days. After coming back after almost 2 years, I am shocked and surprised. The overall improvement is great, quests are not bothering you. Story and atmosphere is hooking you up and the overall experience is good. Leveling up is easy and also you are not struggling as in most MMOs.\n\nDespite the past of the game, I think it is worth trying.\n- This game is basically awesome, under 3 conditions:\n\n1- You get rid of all on-screen icons (i.e. incoming attacks, ennemy spotting)\n2- Do not care about secondary missions only here to further lenghten the game's lifespan\n3- Play the game as you would if  YOU were in charge\n\nBasically, nevermind the Ubisoft micro transactions' system and other abhorrent company induced  greed-leaned system to get stuff faster and more easily by robbing you out of your hard-earned cash...you can finish the game without spending a single dime in the store, it's all pay to win...\nThe open-world aspect is very satisfying and rewarding, in terms of progression, don't fall for the micro transaction system\nCombat is easy even in the highest difficulty setting, but makes you think you are badass when you slash through waves of ennemies, whose AI is rather basic, with your arsenal of rockets, LMGs and explosives but it is satisfying as fuck!\n\nImagine strapping C4 to your plane, jump out of it, have it crashing down an ennemy outpost meanwhile you are parachuting down and throwing hand grenades their way, land on a roof and eliminate the remaining ennemies with fire ammo shotgun and a motherfucking M60 with armor-piercing bullets while throwing dynamites and there you have it...FarCry5 in a nutshell\n\nOh and don't forget about the flame-thrower lol, who doesn't love a flame-thrower scorching ennemies to their own demise eh?\n\nFarCry5 got it all, extreme freedom of how you wanna handle a situation (stealthily or all guns blazing) while being challenging enough in the highest difficulty setting!\nP.S. don't forget to turn off all the on-screen icons, really ruins it for hardcore FPS fans by making it extremely easy, please hear me out, you don't need these!\n- The fact that you can't pause the game during cutscenes and conversations, is very frustrating. The cinematics are long (and sometimes exhausting). If your baby wakes up, If your phone rings, if someone's at the door, if you need to take a pan out of the oven... you can't pause the game! What's the deal with that? Put a pause feature! We have the technology!\n- This game is more than just a driving simulator. It's a landscape experience.\n\nScreenshots won't reveal the full beauty of this game, cause they don't show how daytime and weather change while you drive, how the first sunbeams flash through trees and hills as you leave the night behind, how massive forests reveal as you climb mountain roads and cut through curvy canyons, or the mad contrast of Las Vegas' vibrant colors vs the lonely Route-66-style desert roads... these moments are gold, and define the atmosphere of a game that can be as relaxing or challenging as you want, based on the truck and cargo that you pick – but it will always be a beautiful trip.\n\nAlso, THIS is the game that TRULY deserves the Labor of Love award. In a year that has been most difficult for everyone, SCS managed to add more than ever: 2 map expansion DLCs, 3 completely new trucks brands (for FREE!), completely rework the lighting system (after complely overhauling the audio engine)... They just make the game better. Every year. For free.\n\nFor years now, SCS keep improving and remain honest, loyal and supportive to their customers and games. What more can you ask.\n\n(P.S. They just revealed plans for official co-op multiplayer.)\n- If you are looking for a review for this game this aint it, but if you want a fire brownie recipe then you are at the right place\n\nIngredients:\n185g unsalted butter\n185g best dark chocolate\n85g plain flour\n40g cocoa powder\n50g white chocolate\n50g milk chocolate\n3 large eggs\n275g golden caster sugar\n\nMethod:\nSTEP 1\nCut 185g unsalted butter into small cubes and tip into a medium bowl. Break 185g dark chocolate into small pieces and drop into the bowl.\n\nSTEP 2\nFill a small saucepan about a quarter full with hot water, then sit the bowl on top so it rests on the rim of the pan, not touching the water. Put over a low heat until the butter and chocolate have melted, stirring occasionally to mix them.\n\nSTEP 3\nRemove the bowl from the pan. Alternatively, cover the bowl loosely with cling film and put in the microwave for 2 minutes on High. Leave the melted mixture to cool to room temperature.\n\nSTEP 4\nWhile you wait for the chocolate to cool, position a shelf in the middle of your oven and turn the oven on to 180C/160C fan/gas 4.\n\nSTEP 5\nUsing a shallow 20cm square tin, cut out a square of non-stick baking parchment to line the base. Tip 85g plain flour and 40g cocoa powder into a sieve held over a medium bowl. Tap and shake the sieve so they run through together and you get rid of any lumps.\n\nSTEP 6\nChop 50g white chocolate and 50g milk chocolate into chunks on a board.\n\nSTEP 7\nBreak 3 large eggs into a large bowl and tip in 275g golden caster sugar. With an electric mixer on maximum speed, whisk the eggs and sugar. They will look thick and creamy, like a milk shake. This can take 3-8 minutes, depending on how powerful your mixer is. You’ll know it’s ready when the mixture becomes really pale and about double its original volume. Another check is to turn off the mixer, lift out the beaters and wiggle them from side to side. If the mixture that runs off the beaters leaves a trail on the surface of the mixture in the bowl for a second or two, you’re there.\n\nSTEP 8\nPour the cooled chocolate mixture over the eggy mousse, then gently fold together with a rubber spatula. Plunge the spatula in at one side, take it underneath and bring it up the opposite side and in again at the middle. Continue going under and over in a figure of eight, moving the bowl round after each folding so you can get at it from all sides, until the two mixtures are one and the colour is a mottled dark brown. The idea is to marry them without knocking out the air, so be as gentle and slow as you like.\n\nSTEP 9\nHold the sieve over the bowl of eggy chocolate mixture and resift the cocoa and flour mixture, shaking the sieve from side to side, to cover the top evenly.\n\nSTEP 10\nGently fold in this powder using the same figure of eight action as before. The mixture will look dry and dusty at first, and a bit unpromising, but if you keep going very gently and patiently, it will end up looking gungy and fudgy. Stop just before you feel you should, as you don’t want to overdo this mixing.\n\nSTEP 11\nFinally, stir in the white and milk chocolate chunks until they’re dotted throughout.\n\nSTEP 12\nPour the mixture into the prepared tin, scraping every bit out of the bowl with the spatula. Gently ease the mixture into the corners of the tin and paddle the spatula from side to side across the top to level it.\n\nSTEP 13\nPut in the oven and set your timer for 25 mins. When the buzzer goes, open the oven, pull the shelf out a bit and gently shake the tin. If the brownie wobbles in the middle, it’s not quite done, so slide it back in and bake for another 5 minutes until the top has a shiny, papery crust and the sides are just beginning to come away from the tin. Take out of the oven.\n\nSTEP 14\nLeave the whole thing in the tin until completely cold, then, if you’re using the brownie tin, lift up the protruding rim slightly and slide the uncut brownie out on its base. If you’re using a normal tin, lift out the brownie with the foil. Cut into quarters, then cut each quarter into four squares and finally into triangles.\n\nSTEP 15\nThey’ll keep in an airtight container for a good two weeks and in the freezer for up to a month.\n\n:Mic drop:\n- It has poor simulation of hand skeleton, so you can't use all fingers, benefits of Index Knuckles controller or VR gloves, etc. And, scenario doesn't allow you to do anything, actually, except one straightforward way. Some things are elaborated, but mostly it isn't worth time or money. But I'm rating it as professional developer for VR, sexual content itself is not matter nor interested for me. My advice for game developer is to add more hand tracking features and more scenarios - in this case it can be something better.\n- Always have to be online, even to play single player. Why?\n\nThis would be a perfect Steam Deck game, but they fucked it up.\n\nUPDATE OCT 20th: So they added off-line mode just for Steam Deck, which is great, but not allowing off-line mode on your PC is strange. Hopefully they update it again.\n- This game can be really fun with friends and the cosmetics are pretty cool.\n- First I thought this game is WAY TOO COMPLICATED.\nNow I still think the game is very complex for beginners. And I'm still a newbie.\nI had to watch several youtube videos to get the hang of it.\n\nBesides that, the game is really awesome!\n- [h1]An old classic that's fresher than lots of today's titles.[/h1]\n\n[i]Day of the Tentacle[/i] first launched in 1993. I remember, because I was a teenager then and couldn't play it as my PC didn't meet the minimum requirements! This was actually the sequel to an earlier game, [i]Maniac Mansion[/i], which was released in 1987. I played [i]Maniac Mansion[/i] a few years after it came out, but did not complete it as the game's movement and controls were just too dated and clunky for me (even back then) to be bothered with. \n\nPlaying [i]Maniac Mansion[/i] is not at all necessary in order to enjoy [i]Day of the Tentacle[/i], though those who have will definitely find greater connection to the game's characters, especially the Edison family.\n\n23 years later, [i]Day of the Tentacle Remastered[/i] is essentially the same as it was before, but with sleeker graphics and a more modernised interface. While the story hasn't changed, it surprisingly (or not) hasn't aged one bit either - tentacle mutates and seeks to conquer the world, and only you (and your friends) can stop him! Though straightforward, the game's charm is in its various amusing time travel locations and the weird and wonderful characters you meet along the way. This is a prime example of where [i]\"it's all about the journey, not the destination.\"[/i]\n\n\n[h1]Yays![/h1]\n\n+ Vibrant, colourful, hi-res cartoon-style graphics.\n+ Well-designed rooms, locations and scenery.\n+ Fully voiced, with good voice acting for the most part. (The guy who plays Dr Fred is awesome.)\n+ Interesting, memorable characters.\n+ Fun, amusing story.\n+ Wacky humour.\n+ Clear goals.\n+ Cool easter eggs. (Under \"achievements\".)\n+ Contains a free game ([i]Maniac Mansion[/i])!\n+ Puzzles are mostly enjoyable and require some creative thinking.\n+ Many gameplay hours.\n+ Trading cards.\n\n[h1]Nays.[/h1]\n\n- [url=steamcommunity.com/app/388210/discussions/0/392184522713202518/]Audio starts stuttering[/url] after a while, due to memory problems.\n- Achievements remain hidden, even after the game is completed, so you can't see what you're missing.\n- Some puzzles have illogical or nonsensical solutions.\n- Bugs: e.g. When looking at one of the items, Laverne's voice sounds when Bernard speaks.\n- No mouse command to fast-forward dialogue; instead, you have to press \".\" which is really inconvenient, especially when the whole point of a point-n-click game is to [i]not[/i] have to use your keyboard!\n- Some counter-intuitive puzzle set-ups: E.g. For the videotape puzzle, a button which looks like the \"STOP\" button, is actually the \"RECORD\" button. Anyone who's ever used a VCR or tape recorder would know that the square symbol denotes \"STOP\", while the round button denotes \"RECORD\". \n- Hoagie's periodic belches sound absolutely disgusting!\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nThis was a hugely enjoyable experience from start to finish. Though the nostalgia factor played a part in my case, even if you've never heard of the [i]Maniac Mansion[/i] series, as long as you count yourself a point-n-click adventure game fan, this is a must-play because it just gets so many things right. Add to that the timeless plot and wacky characters, and you have yourself a game that will play just as fresh & new decades down the road.\n\n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [td][u]Disclaimer:[/u] [i]Game played for free, with many thanks to my dear friend [url=steamcommunity.com/id/kflorence]KFlo[/url]. :)[/i][/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n- Okay this is a weird situation. I personally don't like this game all that much, but I do still recommend it nonetheless. That's because despite me not being personally huge on it, I can't deny that it is a very well-crafted game that definitely will give people the experience they want if this is the type of game they're looking for. I, turns out, am not part of the crowd that is targeted for said experience. I just found the whole trial and error stealth RTS style of this game to just not be my cup of tea, but again I can't deny its very well-crafted. I also think the art style and voice acting and story are all very well done as well. So yeah, if you're fond of games of this type, then go for it. I'm sure you won't be disappointed. I, for one, don't think I'm entirely sold on it though.\n- I am a 43 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he helped me. Loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.\nThank you <3\n- The game is very good, it's fun and had everything to be a great success, but unfortunately because the anti-piracy, the game doesn't work well, even above 100 fps it feels lag, the game stutters, a strange gameplay.\n\nJust REMOVE DENUVO and the game will have the deserved success.\n\nUnfortunately, they still haven't realized that those who pirate, don't spend money with or without protection, and those who pay like us, have a game with problems.\n\nA good game doesn't need protection to sell, just be good, simple as that.\n- A solid \"Get Va11HallA instead, unless this is on sale. Otherwise, maybe.\".\n\nCoffee Talk: Fantasy Coffee-brewing Action, is a day-by-day visual novel with slight coffee-brewing mechanics on the side. Its storyline is broken up into several days, of which customers visit your coffee shop and talk. The first few days are rather short: no longer than a few minutes, but as the story advances the days become more packed with story. The game as a whole is rather short, less than 3 hours to complete the main storyline. Overall, generally a well rounded game, but not $15. On the other hand, it compares rather poorly to Va11halla, a game with a nigh identical format, but has more characters, story, and charm. If you liked Va11halla, and really can't wait for N1RVAnnA, then get it on sale. Otherwise, just get Va11halla. But I'm still recommending it because steam doesn't allow maybes, and there's very little competition for this niche of VN.\n- Simply fantastic. Probably the best TRUE RPG I've ever played. Your choices matter, dialogue options matter, the order in which you do things matter, even such small things such as the items you hold in your hand matter. Every build is viable, go heavy in Physical stats and you'll have difficulty solving things Logically, but maybe you can brute force your way through something. Go heavy in Logic and you'll be weak in a one-to-one fight, but maybe you'll be so fast to figure things out that it'll never come to that. You'll see things that the dim-witted brute with high Physical didn't. Failure is encouraged, there are many routes in the game you cannot open without failing something else first.\n\nA true combat system does not exist. At all. Physical altercations are decided through dice rolls based on how you've built your character. And virtually all of them are optional. I like this decision a lot. I've always found it immersion-breaking in RPGs when you're just running around the countryside, killing every bandit or animal that comes your way. This one keeps fights realistic with REAL consequences depending how things go.\n\nBarring having to restart my game once due to a bug (quicksave often, autosaves are few), the game had no major technical issues. There was a single point in the game where a vital skill check required a specific skill to be built, and I'm not sure if there were any alternate routes. I couldn't find any, just had to savescum the check. Aside from that, you have options as to how to approach everything. I'm not sure if that was an oversight or if I just missed something.\n\nCan't go into the story much without spoilers (and you DON'T want it spoiled, it's great.) But it's very well-written and even hilarious at some points. But don't be fooled, it's not a comedy game. It tackles very serious topics such as Fascism, Communism, Mental Illness, Addiction, and many other things.\n\nOverall an amazing RPG experience that I cannot recommend enough. Will definitely play through this several times to see how things go with different builds. Highly suggest you purchase this if you have any interest.\n- I shall start by saying that if you are deciding to buy this game then don't let the negative reviews sway you. In general, Fallout 4 is an amazing game and can be incredibly fun.\n\nPros: \n-Very immersive and will drain so many hours, days, weeks and months from your life.\n-Far Harbour, Automotron and (first half of) NukaWorld DLC have really good stories, quests and environments.\n-Mostly fluid combat system. Everything depends on how you want to play the game.\n\nCons: \n-WIll drain so much of your life away (might've forgotten my gf's birthday ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ )\n-Main story was incredibly lackluster compared to previous Fallout games\n-Giving you the option to be literally any kind of character you want to be....except you're always tied to being a parent.\n-a few repitive quests. (although gives you opportunities to approach these quests, areas and enemies differently\n\nAll in all, If you're a Fallout fan because of previous stories then you might not feel fulfilled playing this game, however if you love character creations, lore and immersive environments with untold stories then I completely recommend this game to you.\n- [h1]A game meant to bring back memories that is similar to Super Mario World on the SNES and it does this with relatively few gameplay and gimmick elements.

It is up to us to bring the troll to his senses and save Christmas for everyone.\n\nTLoS brings players to one world and six levels of great platforming that are reminiscent of Super Mario World (SNES) but simplified. There are only six levels total, one of which is a castle, before the final battle with the troll. The only difference is that we will be collecting chocolate cookies rather than the traditional yellow coins. We also lose part of our cloak when we are injured, so it's not uncommon for you to find yourself jumping through the levels wearing nothing but red boxer shorts. For instance, red blocks can give you a new coat, which means extra life, or Santa socks and hats, which give a power-up or simply chocolate cookies. The power-up allows you to throw stones as if you had collected the Fire Flower from Super Mario, and that's about it. TLoS also offers a 2-4 co-op player mode, in which players will be able to work together to complete this short and family-friendly adventure.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3009359595\n\nSimilar to Super Mario World, you walk to a level to choose them in the Overworld. Once we reach a certain level, we are allowed to walk, leap, and even sprint. Additionally, there are other indications on the screen that show you how many cookies you have already gathered and how much time is remaining to finish the level. We get an extra life when 100 cookies are collected. We can activate a checkpoint about halfway through the level to pick up exactly where the checkpoint was reached, instead of having to do the entire level all over again. The game also features side-scrolling and underwater levels. The only problem is that if you quit at level three, close the game and start again, you have to start from level one, so you have to play the game in one go. This means that there are no save points or \"save states\". Considering the length of the game, this is not a big deal, but it's still \"annoying\".\n\n[h3] My Specs [/h3]\n\n[code]CPU: i9 9900k\nGPU: RTX 2080 Ti\nRAM: DDR4 32 GB RAM\nOS: Win10\nResolution: 1440p @144hz\n[/code]\n\n[h3] Conclusion [/h3]\n\nWe are all hoping that Nintendo will release their IPs on Steam so that we can play with them one more time. We may all agree, based on experience, that this is probably never going to happen, but Indie developers are there to make it happen. To avoid the tedious teachings at school, you used to be able to play these types of games in class on the usual Flash Player websites, and now you can play them on Steam. Though it's not a masterpiece, it's extremely minimalistic, and it's unquestionably too short, the 20 minutes I spent playing it were nevertheless a lot of fun, especially because the platforming is accurate and not wonky at all. Just remember, it's very minimalistic and may be too minimalistic for some, but if that doesn't bother you, feel free to go ahead and try it out.\n\nIt would be my personal highlight if there were additional levels, more secret exits, more power-up alternatives, and more hours of overall playtime.\n\n[h2] Final Verdict: 8/10 A typical gas station snack that turns out to be a surprisingly good one.🎅 [/h2]\n- [h1]Technology[/h1]\nThe game is (was?) awfully poorly optimized.\nI don't think this game looks good enough for the hardware it requires. Some old RTS games looked similar to this title but required much less to run (I am referencing how the technology is better but the \"PC to FPS\" ratio has gone downhills).\n\nI understand that calculating AI choices and the simulation take a lot of resources, but this is not a game with a few thousand AI players like e.g. EU4 is. This is a relatively small map with just some AI players. This game also does not look that much better than some other RTS/TBS titles and I had FPS issues even with the lowest settings.\n\nI first ran this title with R9 280, so a quite old GPU, but that GPU was fully capable of running many decently modern games. This is IMO unacceptable, the developer can't optimize the game, and releases poorly coded product. I tested different graphic settings and noticed nearly no differences in the framerate.\n\nI then upgraded my PC to the top AM4 CPU and a very new GPU card (6600XT, overclocked) and the game ran fine on the highest settings, but I would not call it super smooth. All the other games run perfectly.\nElden Ring, Baldurs Gate 3, Cyberpunk (absolutely 0 issues in Cyberpunk). I would say CA messed up their game and didn't care to optimize it.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThe game is rather decent, it's enjoyable and has a connection to the lore of Warhammer.\nYou can't say a bad word about the general RTS mechanics, the battles and whatever. Just a normal RTS...\n\nIt just isn't the greatest RTS/TBS. Compared to Heroes of Might and Magic 3, or titles like let's say Cossacks, Age of Empires, or maybe Supreme Commander... It is unique in the Total War way, but given the amount of games in the series, it's ... not unique really (I have seen everything this game offers in different titles over the years).\n\nJust a giant simulation with a surprising lack of mechanics for an RTS game (as in economic aspect, diplomacy, map tactics. I think Europa Universalis IV is a good example of a really advanced tactics model in an RTS/TBS game and Civ 6 would be a great example of map design/economics). I personally don't like the maps for real-time battles. These maps seem quite crude and the skirmishes are badly designed.\n\nIn order to inflict maximum casualties you would need to kill every single unit. It should be enough that you break the enemy and automatically win. It's also quite unbalanced. Depending on what you kill first the results can wildly vary (including the AI acting much differently every time and the proposed outcomes of auto-resolved battles are just unhinged).\n\n I probably would like this game more without the \"real-time\" battles, but I assume it's the \"Total War\" way. To me it's time intensive and just not interesting. I liked Warhammer 40k's battles much more. They felt more tactical. Placement of units in this game does matter, but I had more fun playing The Battle for Middle Earth 15 years ago than this. I think the units panic too quickly and the characters don't matter enough.\n\nIt's the closest to the HoMM in terms of map and characters, however it lacks many things that made HoMM great (like tailored character development with meaningful spells and ability to recruit units, find artifacts on the map etc). The cities feel kind of empty, the mechanics are rather poorly described/introduced and just weird for an RTS (for my liking). \n\nI am not sure why there is so little care about the main characters. It would be very cool to build them up, be able to find artifacts on the map (besides the Sword of Khaine, that's just one item) and do something else than just advance some skills in the skill tree. Even if you invest your time in them then they can be sieged and just die.\n\nI also don't like some mechanics, for example the corruption, or slaves (they are not much intuitive. I think they should create clearer GUI and work on the general set of game rules, rather than make every faction different but also following totally different rules. Are we supposed to compete in a campaign and how if we follow different rules?). \nSome game prompts are meant to \"help\" learning the game, but they not always load up and they also don't explain small logos (traits) of the units, it's pretty useless. You need to use web browser anyway. Why to bother?\nIn that aspect - I think the designers totally messed up the UI/UX.\n\n21st August 2023 update: I played Baldur's Gate 3 and imagine they paid enough of work to actually make icons explain the traits of characters or items, amazing is it not? Seems to be lack of care. Every single icon in BG3 is fully explained. I could learn the game's rules and effectively build my characters.\n\n[h1]Genre[/h1]\nThe game is pretty fine, it gives some fun when playing it. Feels like Warhammer I guess? I personally am more of the 40k fan, but a game in the old universe is making lots of sense and the character design with world design are high quality.\n\n[h1] Summary (what made me dump this game also) [/h1]\nThe character design is quite impressive and it seems that they cared about the \"vibe\", but the game is just a money grab. why are there 3 game titles instead of one? What is the main improvement in between all of these titles?\nEach one of them has dozens of DLCs. An average person surely won't spend 300$ just to play more factions.\n\nWhat angered me so much I stopped playing after the purchase:\nThe publisher releases a paid product that claims to have free DLCs - some of them are, but the most important one isn't, and without it the game has got only 50% functionality and feels like a demo.\nRTS game without skirmish mode or some kind of \"do whatever\" mode is a meme. This isn't a DnD campaign board (and ironically such a campaign would allow for much more than selection of 5 heroes on one map lol), but an RTS in a specific universe.\n\nEvery normal RTS game has got a skirmish/free play mode (The Battle for the Middle-earth, Command and Conquer, Supreme Commander, Cossacks, Starcraft. Like every single RTS EVER) and this is especially filthy when you proclaim to release FREE functionality for the title, but then the player gets informed that they must buy TWO titles (WH1 and WH2) to get functionalities in the one they wanted to expand. Such a money grab, and even then the game is still locked behind micro-transactions/DLCs. I wanted to play a game, not donate to the \"poor\" publisher in 10 different ways. If the publisher wants money then they can sell better games.\n\nAwfully lot of DLCs, that don't add many things into the game. The base game doesn't feel like a game, but a rather Free to Play game account, that has 80% of content locked. Choosing from like 4 factions, especially in a game which varies so wildly depending on the faction (the factions aren't meant to be following any common rules it seems).\n\nWhat I also dislike is the publisher urging you to create an account to claim some of the \"free\" DLCs - the purpose is to collect data, and force you into their own website I assume (to raise statistics and show it to the management?). Why bother releasing game on Steam if you can't offer free DLCs to Steam users? I don't want your stupid 3rd party website.\n\nI don't recommend this game. I like Warhammer, but CA is a terrible company. I updated this review and in the meantime there have been at least a few different internet dramas with them involved.\n\nI would personally rather pay 70$ to a company that cares and provides a fun product (e.g. Lorian), than a DLC-locked tech demo... that \"stock\" Warhammer sure is.\n- Having currently 1340 hours of playtime and having reached the highest achievable rank (Grand Champion), I can't currently recommend others to follow what I've been doing.\n\nWhile I love the game for it's smooth gameplay and somewhat balanced roster of playable character, the company, Stunlock Studios, are simply not caring for this game the way it deserves. In the start of 2018 we got a roadmap of promised features. This roadmap has since been tossed aside, and the community mocked, as they left battlerite arena development for months to do a battleroyale gamemode, which then turned into a standalone game, which then flopped and as of now has around 1/10 of the active playerbase that Battlerite has.\n\nAs others have also said, the matchmaking is horrible, especially at higher ranks. This can probably be attributed to the low playercount. At the highest ranks, it would not be uncommon to have a queue of 10-15 minutes only to be matched against people at a significantly lower skill level, which then leaves everyone in the match unhappy. This is in Europe, which I believe is the region with the highest playercount.\n\nTo sum it up, I believe this was a game with great potential, which has been wasted by a company with 40 employees, somehow only doing updates like they were a company of 3 people.\n- If you're a STAR RAIDERS fan, look elsewhere, it's broken.\nFirst off, I  think they did a fantastic job on the Star Raiders port,\nthe controls are spot on, it works seamlessly with a controller,\nall the keyboard controls were mapped brilliantly, great job.\n\nBut....\n\nAlthough the NOVICE and PILOT missions work well, those who adorn the game will\nselect WARRIOR or COMMANDER and sadly, these higher levels are broken.\n\nOnce you get down to the remaining 8 enemies or so on the map, the difficulty ramps up to insanity.\nCome out of a warp, get plummeted by 3+ meteors in a row.\nPhotons gone.\nRinse and repeat until you just give up, it's relentless, and I've yet to be able to finish a game on COMMANDER\nlevel because of this.\n\nI've tried all the different speed modes, original, opengl and direct3d, nothing helps, it's broken.\n\nAnother minor gripe is that the \"Destroyed Engines\" mode is just the \"Damaged Engines\" and barely impacts\nyour speed.\n\nI really hope that this is patched, I'll gladly revise the review once it is.\n\nEverything else is great, the arcade ports are fine, the controls are practically 1:1 in the trackball games,\nthey all feel just like the arcade (unlike Atari Vault, cough cough).\n\nThe Jaguar games are a blast, T2K still rules. I would have loved to see AvP, perhaps a future DLC.\n\nBut the main reason I spent $40 was for Star Raiders, one of my all time favorite games, and in it's current\nstate, I feel like I've wasted my money, sadly I spent so much time troubleshooting it, my refund window is gone.\n\nI'd say wait for this on a heavy sale and if you're a die hard Star Raiders fan, don't do it until it's patched!\n\nAnd still no word from the developers on any patches.........you guys out there?!? \n\n- [i]\"The Display says 'Nothing'\"[/i]\n\"Nothing or 'Nothing'\"?\n[i]\"It's BLANK!\"[/i]\n\"'Blank' OK Great. What is on the Middle Right button?\"\n[i]\"NO!\"[/i]\n\"Middle Right!\"\n[i]\"NO!\"[/i]\n\"What you you mean No!? I HAVE THE MANUAL!\"\n\n[h1]**BOOOOOOOOM**[/h1]\n\n10/10\n- Finally a visual novel that allows me to pick my favourite man without it locking me out due to not completing every other route. Limbo here I come baby\n- Plays and looks just like the Park Ranger and Cruise Director HOG series, if you enjoyed those then you will likely enjoy this series. Game is composed of hidden object scenes and simple puzzle transitions that have a loose story to bridge the movement between them. The hidden object scenes follow an older couple as they take their grandchildren to a variety of European counties on their vacation, they sprinkle in a few interesting facts between each location. There are collectibles in each scene along with a raccoon. I overall enjoyed it for a laid back experience and the weirdly fun photostock based scenes. It took me about 2.5 hours to play through the game along with the bonus scenes/puzzles.\n- [b][i]Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout[/i][/b] is a 60 Player Battle Royal game of minigames to triumph over everybody for the sweet, GOLDEN CROWN\n[list]\n[*] Put in about 40 hours in combination on Beta 1 & 2\n[*] Won a ton and lost a ton\n[*] Enjoyed EVERY SECOND \n[/list]\n[b][u]PROS[/u][/b]\n[list]\n[*] Decent amount of minigames for launch, and even when you play the same ones they feel fun when different things happen\n[*] Games go fast if you're winning OR losing, you're able to play a lot and experience the game faster to get better\n[*] The BIG majority of the cosmetics in the game are NOT locked behind a paywall. Release has one $5 DLC for a hamburger, slurpee, and frie cosmetic but there are a TON of cosmetics to earn through the free battle pass they give you + the daily shop where you can buy cosmetics with earned in game currency\n[*] Customization for your character is extremely extensive and allows a lot of different combos\n[*] The game is literally just FUN, like play for hours with friends fun. There is NO stress\n[/list]\n[b][u]CONS[/u][/b]\n[list]\n[*] See-saw minigame is very advantaged to the players in the front due to how messed up the see saws behind you get clogged with players and being on sides for WAY too long\n[*] Grabbing is a bit weird and janky, sometimes its useful and sometimes it actually screws you over\n[*] Ragdoll physics sometimes cause you to roll a ton after falling (I like this feature a ton but others don't)\n[/list]\n\n[b] I definitely reccommend picking this game up. The Devs put a lot of time and effort into a game and for $20 it is actually steal. This game will provide hours of content, especially with them already announcing they will update with new cosmetics and mini-games as ready. Please give this game a shot :)\n- a very interesting FPS multiplayer and co-op, It would be better if it was still in development like early access because it needs some work. shorter spawn times, vehicles , larger and more varied maps, what this game has that no other FPS has is realistic weapons. you will not find another game that models modern military grade firearms more realisticily in terms of what they sound like ,recoil, look, feel ( to the extent that a pc game can offer) they are amazing and I would buy this game for 8 bucks just for that alone. But it does need work , this game could be a great title to rival Battlefield and COD franchises ( maybe not Advanced Warfare) it may not surpass those titles but it could give them a better run for the money.\n- nice game but pls improve ur anti cheat\n- F2P update: Hey it's free now! STDs are free - avoid it.\n\nIt was great at the start, I put many hours into it. \n\nAaaand now it's aggressively monetised, forces all this microtransaction garbage on you, battle pass rubbish, skins, emotes, crates, more than one premium currency.\n\nAND they have the gall to ask £26.99 RRP for this? $30 to have the privilege of paying more money.\n\nMake it free at this point, you want to be Fortnite so bad.\n\nYou either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.\n- Don't let the horror tag scare you off; there are no jump scares, no over-the-top gore (there is some, but it's all pixels), nothing that leads to nightmares (at least not for me); and there are good endings too.\n\nA good story that takes about 4 hours to complete (including multiple endings -- there's a chapter select option after you finish so you don't have to replay the whole game). Some puzzles, a lot of cutscenes (all skippable, but worth reading). There's a lot of humour to be found in here too!\n- To be honest, I could've typed this review up years ago when I got this, but I never knew how to make a review. But I'm here now, and I'm doing this... Okay, here we go...\nThe Good(AKA:Everything):\n-Cars go crunch here so you don't have to crash IRL(Though I know that won't stop all of you...).\n-Great cars and maps with nice little details.\n-An INCREDIBLE modding community. There's and ENDLESS supply of content coming out all the time from hard-working individuals, all so we can take your masterpieces and turn them into heaps of scrap.\nThe Bad(AKA:What bad?):\n-This is on me... but it can get a little boring, as your mostly just crashing cars. There are so challenges to do in game, and there are so many things you COULD do... but I guess I don't have the imagination to do that. Like I said, this is bad on me. No fault of the game.\n-Game is really graphics heavy, so a higher-end PC is recommended. Nothing too fancy, but RAM and GPU are hardest hit... maybe processor too...(I'm not that smart with tech...) But this isn't truly bad, as you probably already have good spec if you're looking to play a physics-heavy game.\n-Load times... They used to be bad, but they've gotten considerably better in recent updates. But... the more mods you get, the more it'll have to load. A good PC should be able to handle it, but just keep this in mind.(I have 100's of mods, and it's not too bad...)\nAnd well, that's it. Sorry this it so long... One of my first reviews, after all. But this game deserves to looked at in detail. If you play it once, you'll come back to it here and there to have more fun. So, in short, I HIGHLY recommend this game!\nIf you read this far, thank you so much! I tried my best here!\n\n- Someone has to be the first, I guess.\n\nI don't know, I just didn't really feel too hooked on the game's premise. I feel less like I'm solving a puzzle and more like I'm hitting a pinata for all the clues. Every replay, I'm just going to have to do something whacky in order to get a new clue as to what might further my cause. And that doesn't really make me feel like I'm a part of a story, as much as a I feel like I'm going through an eternally looping monday, getting increasingly distanced to the world around me as I finally end up throwing myself overboard, because 'why not?'.\n\nI won't refund it, because I think the devs have poured a lot of heart into this game and I do think they deserve the money, but I couldn't really find too much entertainment in the game.\n- (UPDATED AS OF 1/1/23 AT BOTTOM)\n\nGame doesn't load. Running steam/EA (Origin)/Fifa23.exe as admins doesn't work. Reinstalling EA Anticheat doesn't work. Allowing everything thru firewall and antivirus (even turning them off) doesn't work. Changing bios to secure boot didn't work. Reinstalling game doesn't work. Any and all combinations of the above does not work.\n\nRequested refund from Steam. I have played maybe 4-6 hours right when it came out before the small update they pushed stopped it being able to load. I tried reverting to that initial version, doesn't work. But because Steam said I played more than 2 hours they won't refund it, even though it doesn't work. They told me to talk to EA. Requested refund from EA. They said to talk to Steam.\n\nGame won't work. EA wont fix it. They steal your money. Filing a report with the Better Business Bureau AND a deceptive practices report with the State's AG office, against BOTH Steam and EA. F them both, thieving C's.\n\n\nUPDATE:\n\nFiled a BBB report on EA. They said they cannot offer resolution such as a refund since I purchased through Steam. When I ask for a refund through Steam they state even though the game no longer works, its past their refund window and they cannot refund. \n\nSo, filing a BBB report on Steam. If that fails to refund, then I am filing a Deceptive Practices report with my State's Attorney General's Office. I'll update further, potential class action lawsuit in the works.\n\nAlso Steam has an F rating on the BBB - I wonder why??\n\n\nUPDATE 2 (1/1/2023);\nFinally got the game to play, here is how (worked for me - may not for others)\n-Uninstall Fifa 23\n-Uninstall EA App\n-Uninstall EA Anticheat in Programs Folder \n-Delete all EA Folders in Programs Folder\n-Close Steam, right click, Properties, Compatibility Tab, Run As Administrator.\n-Used CCleaner to delete all temporary files and clean registry errors\n-Settings, Gaming, Xbox Control Bar, Turn the Slider Off\n-Restart\n-Install Origin App, login, close, set to run as administrator\n-Reinstall Fifa 23 through Steam\n-Set Fifa 23 to run as administrator in the steamapps folder.\n-Set EA Anticheat to run as administrator in both locations: Programs Folder (under EA) AND Programs(x86) Folder under Steam\n-Restart\nOpen Steam, Open Origin, Run Fifa through Steam - WORKED FINALLY\n\nNOTE: I have been running in secure boot mode this whole time, so if you arent set to secure boot, you will also have to set that.\n\nI still dont recommend this game. It took me 4 months to figure out how to run this POS with zero help from EA and Steam. They also dropped the price of this sh!t game to like 25$ after I paid 85$ for early access and couldnt play it for 4 months. Think they'll refund that extra 60$? Fk no. So done with EA, never buying again.\n- After the past few years of broken, buggy AAA games I've started to lose the passion I once had for the industry. This masterpiece came out of no where and completely reignited my love for gaming. PLEASE do not sleep on this game, it's such a breath of fresh air from the garbage you'd normally expect from modern day companies. Definitely taking a spot in my top 5 favorites and I haven't even scratched the surface of the game yet, it's just that good. Beautiful art style, crisp animations, a unique concept, FUN gameplay, its everything I've been wanting and more. Kudos to the devs for making this absolute banger <3\n- On January 9th,  without warning, explanation, or justification, and lacking all sense of logic, Capcom forcefully reset customizable ingame key-binds and removed the ability to rebind them. These new forced and [b][u]locked[/u][/b] key-binds are extremely biased in favor of [i]right-hand-dominant, able-handed[/i] persons and can not be remapped or swapped. However, as this function has been revoked from PC keyboard/mouse customers, it has been ADDED for console controllers. \n\nCapcom has yet to address or even acknowledge this change.\n\n[b]If you are left-handed, handicapped, or for other reasons require customizable mouse/keyboard functions, Capcom has forcefully revoked the ability for you to play this game anymore.[/b]\n- Game does not become better with release.\nDups AI still retarded, they literally wasting time instead of doing work.\n\nJust a quick example:\nDup can go to the left side of map dig !!ONE!! block, then go to right side of the map and harvest !!ONE!! plant, then go back to the left side of map and dig second block. It's unbelivable boring watching all these.\n\nAnd you still can't destroy ruins, OMG. You can lunch rocket but can't destroy some ruins.\n- I really liked the concept of this game of navigating through orbits to collect crates and then successfully landing on the exit.  However, there just isn't enough content to justify it being sold as a complete product, especially at its current price of $6.99.  You see everything there is in the first couple of levels.  No new mechanics are added to the game as you progress.  The developer admits that the game is too simple and the fix was to add artificial difficulty to make the game longer.  For instance, rather than have intuitive controls using toggles, it requires the player to activate thrusters with one hand and turn them off with another.  The level design stops adding anything new and just adds more tedious narrow paths that must be navigated rather than an actual challenge or puzzles.  Finally, the DLC appears to be “pay to win” rather than getting any new content, it just gives the player access to aircraft that should be included already in the game.  By level 9 it is near impossible to progress any further with the default ship as it cannot accelerate fast enough to get through the small orbit and requires purchasing the DLC to advance the level.\n- TLDR: Right now, since there are no \"NEUTRAL\" reviews on Steam, IN IT'S CURRENT STATE, its a no from me. If the bugs get ironed out, its a pretty good game. If it gets fixed, I'll likely change to a recommend.\n\nGot 2 copies as a Fig Backer to play with my brother. My single player experience (POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILERS):\n\nGOOD:\n--Love that the choices REALLY matter and there are a LOT of them in this game.\n--Many different ways to approach a situation and your reputation affects interactions. Your reputation MAY be good enough to talk yourself out of fights! Many opportunities for KISS ASS and HARD ASS and other Squad builds (Nerd stuff, Mechanics, etc.) to be useful throughout the game.\n--The fire modes have grown on me. Some weapons have their own perks which add a fire mode. Other fire modes are available via perks you can obtain in the perk tree. The Precision Strike you get once your strike meter is full is very powerful and can change a fight (can malfunction a robot with aimed shot or fire a huge burst to take out multiple hostiles).\n--You can build a new squad member at any time that will start at your current level. Messed up a squad member build? That's okay, just create a new one.\n--I like the PREPARE and AMBUSH abilities. PREPARE lets you save up to 2 AP for next turn. The AMBUSH ability allows your squad members to trade in some AP to fire on an enemy that enters their range during hostile turns.\n--I love the Animal Whisperer skill and animal companions. I like the variety of animals you can bring along with your squad.\n--Shift key to highlight stuff you can interact with. This takes away having to pixel hunt for obscured boxes and containers. When you get old and can't see as well you appreciate stuff like this.\n--I like that I only have to loot one body at the end of combat and I can easily cycle through and grab the loot from all the other lootable bodies in the area.\n--A high Luck attribute will occasionally result in more loot, and even free actions. Sometimes you'll get a free attack or a free movement from a lucky action.\n--I like the variety and usefulness of Utilities (+5% XP, +2 PER, +1 Weapon/Armor modding, etc.)\n--A lot of stuff that can be used for cover can also be shot and destroyed.\n--Humor can be a bit over-the-top, but I've chortled quite a few times.\n\nNOT SURE:\n--Can only charm a single animal per squad member with Animal Whisperer. You CAN get other special animal followers that don't count as the single. While disappointed, I can see why they limited it (more would be OP and they can start to get in the way during combat).\n--Enemies have a circular view area, which means even if you're trying to sneak past behind them, you can still be \"seen\" after a brief time.\n\nBAD/BUGS:\n--Cant team crouch. You have to manually go through all of your squad and crouch them 1 by 1, and it costs 2 AP to crouch in combat. You also cant move crouched as far as I know. You can't \"change stances\" (AKA crouch or stand up) while in cover, either. Save a game right before a fight with all your squad members crouched and ready to go? When combat locks up and you have to load the save, you have to re-crouch everybody.\n--Combat can lock up, causing you to have to reload a previous save (for me, twice per play session usually but sometimes twice for the same fight).\n--Attributes, Skills, Combat Buffs/Debuffs (and probably other stuff) need more tool tips.\n--Lost character progression.\n--Very laggy Dialogue Tree and later in the game the inventory gets laggy too.\n--Creating a Bookworm Squad Member with 1 STR creates a situation where your Squad Member is losing 3 CON (total hit points) every level up and will be erased like Marty McFly in B2TF.\n--Load screens are too long. 30+ seconds to load into different zones, over 1.5 minutes to load a game on SSD. From another review: \"while we wait, let us read the lore books we've collected.\"\n--Squad portraits don't stay in order.\n--When you have more than 6 Ranger recruits in the select character screen, the \"Companions\" section gets pushed off-screen, hiding their portraits, and making it very unintuitive to add them back into your squad (you have to use the keyboard). Need a scroll bar here.\n--Saves don't have specific names so can be easily overwritten. There is only 1 autosave by default, and later on the game autosaves right after a game changing decision, making you have to revert to a manual save (2 hours earlier for me) if you wanted to try different options. I recommend turning on timed saves as well as taking advantage of quicksaves (and of course saving often!)\n--FPS drops, sometimes so bad you have to reload.\n--Squad Members shooting through walls/floors/ceilings.\n--Radiation difficult to detect in some areas and no warning (other than your squad health draining) going from radiation level 2 to 3 for instance.\n--Combat messages briefly appear above your acting Squad Member's head and are easy to miss (like \"Out of Range\")\n--When getting shot at, the camera doesn't always auto focus on who is shooting you.\n--At least three bugged missions I can think of (but hey, one is an unlimited money glitch so more of a feature).\n--Character models and other things (switches) not loading properly leading to invisible characters you can interact with (or fight with, as it happens in combat sometimes too).\n--The game can become unresponsive when trying to move 2 Squad Members separately and interact with someone.\n--Explosive Barrels not actually exploding when shot (this seems to be related to being too far away from the barrel when sniping it, as if you get closer, they'll actually explode).\n--Cybernetic Implants are a good idea, but they take up your Utility Slot instead of giving you another slot dedicated to them so when you have the ability to finally use them, it feels more like a trade-off rather than an augmentation.\n--No Inventory filter for Utilities. Gotta scroll through your hundreds of items and the Utilities aren't even grouped together entirely in the inventory, they are scattered throughout.\n--When you open a door to a closed room, fog of war usually obscures what is in the room until you physically walk a squad member into the room.\n--Cannot have multiple types of the same animal in a Squad with multiple Animal Whisperers.\n--Don't try to loot two containers at once.\n--Some traps can't be disarmed.\n--Various graphic glitches like missing texture or dialogue bubbles that are blank or don't disappear.\n--Can't remove and reuse weapon mods.\n--Some equipped weapons will display inflated damage numbers (by 300% in some cases) until re-equipped. Not even sure how long it has been that way or if it was affecting my game.\n--If you misclick the filter categories in a vendor encounter on the World Map, it'll kick you out of the encounter to the radio and you can't get back to the random encounter at that time. I only mention this since I've done it so many times.\n--You can't pause the game which may or may not affect time sensitive quests. You can be detected and attacked in the menu (escape key) or in your inventory.\n--There is no way to have Special companions/followers that you get from Missions follow a different squad member. If you dump that Squad Member later, you lose the follower too (as far as I know).\n--Get radio signals with \"coordinates to follow\" yet I have no clue who from or what it opened up on the map (if anything).\n--Gaining access to certain parts of the Rangers HQ requires you to do something pretty awful.\n--I'm out of room....\n\nIt feels like I'm fighting against the game more than the Wasteland sometimes. I don't even want to try multiplayer until it gets fixed (and my brother doesn't either).\n\nIf you're a developer of this game, thank you for your time and effort! Polish it up and I'll be happy to change this to a recommend! Edited for clarity/additions and I cut a lot. Thank you for reading and thank you for the comments and awards! Have a great day and be kind to others.\n- Honestly this game feels like it was made for me.\nQuoting iron pineapple:\"this guy (the dev) just gets it\". And he really does! The level design is great and the areas are cool and unique and a real joy to explore! A really slick zelda-like souls-like-ish game. \nBut that's not all.\nThe gimmick of this game, and the thing that really sets it apart and makes it go above the rest, is the manual. The whole gimmick is that the game is written, mostly, in an unknown runic language, forcing the player to figure out game mechanics, progression and puzzles on their own. You have only one thing to help you: as you progress you collect pages of a manual, in the style of those old console games, which gives you again pseudo-cryptic hints, because it's also mostly in the other language.\nThe way the manual and the knowledge based progression flow into the design of the game is nothing short of genius. It's hard to gosh about just how amazing it is, because that would be spoiling it, but it's completely genius. \nGame's a masterpiece for me, a strange mesh of Hollow Knight  meets  Outer Wilds-based knowledge progression. \nDefinitely a must-buy, don't even worry about it going on a sale, it's an easy indie GOTY for me\n- OMG I LOVE THIS SO MUCH!\nFun to control, it runs fine on my potato Laptop\nIts colorful\nits fun\nits amazingly well animated\ni love the map, i love the bosses so far, i love everythign about this,\nlock on aiming with RB is awesome, special weapons, parries, and attacks you buy from the shop ^^ this is \nPURE GOLD\n- I remembered when I was 8, back then I used to play this on my PS3. It was one of the first RPG games i've ever played aside from Pokemon on GameBoy / Nintendo DS. This game made me feel like I'm in an another world back then. I had dreams of my companion and Drippy. It was such a nostalgic moment when I opened this game, and I was abit sad because I wished that I could turn back time and finish this game when I was a kid. I wasn't able to finish it at that time due to my brother taking away the PS3 overseas. Because now, after getting older, there are so many responsibilities that I must hold on to. Playing games like this during childhood truly changes the vibe of experiencing it. Now I only got a glimpse of it when I opened it for an hour or so. Maybe one day I'll finish this game, once I'm free from reality.\n- I've been waiting since the likes of Planescape Torment and Baldurs Gate 2 for a game to match their sheer perfection, many games came quite close, but Divinity Original Sin just manages to hit so many nails on the head its not funny. It looks great and still plays fine on my aging PC, it has a great storyline, it's two protagonists have some great interactions and dialogue. The voice acting is spot on and it has the most sublime OST.\n\nThe combat is turn-based but do not let this put you off, there are so many choices in combat with the interaction of spells with each other and the environment, that the game just begs you to experiment with different tactics.\n\nThis game just oozes pure class, it was a labour of love for Larian and it shows in every tiny detail of the game.\nIf you like RPG games (or even just pure quality games), you need to play this game, it is the benchmark I will use in comparing other games in future.\n\nWell done Larian.\n- I played the demo and instantly became enamored. The mix of Slay the Spire-style deck-building with elements of the ship combat from FTL: Faster Than Light is an absolutely fascinating mix, and the \"single-axis\" movement system adds a whole extra layer that I've never seen in anything except the Mega Man: Battle Network series.\n\nI bought the full game within the first hour of being available. After having played for nearly 4 hours at the time of writing, my opinion hasn't changed in the slightest. I already love what's available and so far I feel like I've barely scratched the surface.\n\nI can't wait to see what awaits in the future for this awesome title.\n\nEDIT: As a small addition, I will say: I beat my very first run, which is set to the lowest difficulty (Normal). I jumped up to Hard to try to unlock a new ship, and I haven't been able to beat a run since then. It's probably just that I'm bad, all things considered, but be aware that the changes made with difficulty increases are probably more impactful than they may seem.\n\nAlso I wanna say to the devs: thank you for launching the game with mod support and working on making it easier! But also please look into getting Steam Workshop support if you can!\n- This is half of a very good game. You might be impressed in the first 10 hours, but after that it becomes evident you are playing the skeleton of what could be a generational game. Here is some of the good and some of the bad.\n\nThe Good:\n-Graphics look great, even on lower settings\n-Decently varied battle maps\n-Sound design makes killing blows feel amazing\n-Decent variety of weapons\n\nThe Bad:\n-Extremely shallow \"campaign\"\n-Almost zero role playing elements. Every character behaves identically towards you. Even your own wife will try to introduce herself. Kill someone's father/brother/entire clan? They will never mention it and will behave towards you just like anyone else.\n-\"Realistic mode\" means all your enemies will be absolute tank meat sponges while you are made of glass.\n-After you get your first settlement the game becomes extremely tedious. You will play whack a mole with enemy armies who take almost no time to recuperate. Wipe out 3 enemy armies in a massive, \"war changing battle\"? Oops, looks like all of those armies are back to full strength in a matter of days.\n-Almost zero variation of playstyles. Sure you can be a trader or a rogue mercenary for the early game, but you will always end up cheesing the smithing economy mechanics to support the larger armies you need in the mid game\n\nThis is simply an unfinished game. The fact they have been selling it for $50 successfully for years is wild.\nWould have much rather paid $100 for a fully finished product.\n\nUnless they have a massive overhaul on the \"Official Release\" October 25th, I cannot recommend this game. Shame.\n- First off, the graphics pictured here are NOT what the game looks like. Even in Ultra mode it doesn't come close to looking this \"good.\" \n\nSecond, this game is best played with a controller. Not that I mind this, but after years of mouse + keyboard play it was difficult to get used to switching over.\n\nThird, it says you can alter the dungeon and create new paths and doorways and etc. I received an item that supposedly allowed me to do this but I couldn't get it to work.\n\nFinally, for the price of this game, it should be something spectacular. It wasn't. I've purchased $10 games on Steam that are much better than this. Wait for a big sale if you're interested in this game.\n- 🎃 Tя!cked not Tяeated 🎃 full price $29.99 you can only play a 10 min Light Version. I had hoped that was a joke? I tried Steam \"Offline\" mode still blocked me from Full Monty 18+ XP Room 👎🏻\n\nSteam Refunded 😩 see discussions click 💭 icon\n\n⚪️ $29.99 is greedy money grab for no sex play content.\n⚪️ We can't get anyone to answer back how we buy 18+ Version.\n⚪️ I can see from the Web Site they have a Mobile VR Truck just for Sensual VR and look to now be renting rooms in popular restaurants around Germany. \n\nI honestly believe until the DEV's of this game have fully exhausted it's Euro revenue stream from VR Room Rentals and VR Mobile Truck. They will not sell us the public it's 18+ XP Room from it's Web Site.  \n\nNote to Publisher: Anything less than changing this to a Free Demo from all the above I've stated.  Then you don't belong on steam store.\n- For the past 4 years I couldn't get myself to finish a single game without having to force myself to do it(and even then I failed). I couldn't enjoy SP games no matter how good the gameplay or the story was. I kept buying games hoping to find that one game that would do the trick. This was FF XV for me. Despite of all my friends advising me against buying it because it was just going to be another game that would sit around in my library, I decided to give it a try.\n\nIt actually felt like I went back in time to when I could play SP games for hours without getting bored after an hour or two.\n\nI admit I skipped most sidequests and I'll try going back to them sooner or later, although it may not be the best game out there in terms of content(you can finish the game on easy skipping most secondary quests in about 20-25 hours) or story development, playing through it felt like a new experience. In fact, even after finishing the game there's still plenty of things to do and in my opinion, even playing it through again just to spend more time with Noctis and his friends is worth it.\n\nThe story is not mindblowing, the combat system is really fun but far from flawless, most sidequests aren't well written but at its core, at least for me, FF XV has something to it that other games lack. I can't say it magically restored my old passion for gaming but it has given me a reason to at least try to get into it again.\n\nIf you haven't played it yet I sincerely envy you, I would love to experience it all over again from the start, it has been a memorable journey to say the least and I hope that you are willing to give it a try. ^^\n- I bought this game in order to review it, seeing as there were no current reviews for it. \nI thought I'd help the game out by maybe giving it that tiny bit of publicity it needed to get off the ground.\nIn doing so I have failed. As this game isn't worth reviewing, there is nothing to review. Well, I should say there is stuff to review but I feel as though the dev's didn't even attempt to make this a game that anyone would enjoy. Well actually I'll let them off of the target of \"enjoy\", I'd go further to say it doesn't even feel like they tried to make a game that someone who had nothing to do and was bored out of their mind would say maybe I'll play this for a bit\nI jumped straight in, ignored the help in menu and started playing. It took me at least 4-5 mins before I even had the slightest concept of what was going on and what I had to achieve. Once I did get the hang of it I still thought \"I must be missing something, I'm not really doing anything\" so I ventured to the help menu to find that nope, thats it buddy.\nThe controls are lacking, the soundtrack and the sound effects (which happen to be a melody playing) do not blend at all, (they play completely out of time on top of the soundtrack).\nYou can buy it and prove me wrong, go ahead. This is just my opinion.\n- buy it on sale. campaign was decent, however The Last Tiger mission was a standout. Multiplayer experience is ok overall, the hackers make it the worst bit. 6.5/10, if Dice fixes their servers and clears out the hackers then maybe it's worthy of an 8/10.\n- Just go play it. It's only $20, and you have a 2hr refund limit. You'll love it way before then.\n\n...still here? Quick review. Awesome platformer, hits all the marks in flying colors. Let's compare w Mario Maker, the most similar game to this one:\n\n[edit: Updated to compare to SMM2 instead of 1]\nWhat Mario Maker 2 Does Better\n- Mario\n- Different themes/gameplay physics across multiple mario games\n- Much larger playerbase\n\nWhat Levelhead Does Better\n- Oh my god the search functionality\n    - Search by creator, difficulty, tags, what's popular, etc.\n    - TL;DR you can find the awesome, and avoid the crap\n- Level discovery\n    - Can actively advertise my levels\n    - Get rewarded for playing people's levels\n- $20\n- Dying doesn't take 12 years to respawn\n- Fun, short campaign to slowly unlock more creative tools after seeing how they are used\n- Local Co-op (or online with Parsec)\n- Leaderboards (if you care, I personally don't)\n\nI cannot stress enough how AMAZING it is to not have to suffer through crap levels. The search functionality is soooo good; as a casual player, it is the sole reason I stopped playing Mario Maker 1. Mario Maker 2 is better, but it still falls terribly short. I think the best part is that Levelhead gives people control over the visibility of their levels, as well as incentives to play other peoples, and that is something that SMM2 unfortunately lacks.\n- I even set a calendar reminder so that I could get this on release. I wish I hadn't bothered. Going great guns until I got to the passage. Game over as I can't progress. Tried allsorts to drop the jammer but unable to do so. I guess it is a case of waiting for all the bugs to get resolved.\n- Impulse Control is a lazy, badly made ripoff of Angry Birds, with slightly less features and options, poorer physics, worse quality assets, and overall worse gameplay.  But to differentiate, they slapped a Facebook style personality quiz on the front, much like putting a hat on Frankensteins Monster works well as a disguise, you know.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, the game doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.\n\nThere's no options to change the resolution for the game or customise the graphics settings.  There's no way for gamers to ensure this is running at the native resolution of their displays... there's no guarantee this game will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.  There's no way for gamers to try improve the low quality graphics.\n\nThese technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.\n\nThe game is completely free.  This is noble a gesture that shows dedication to both gamers, and the gaming industry.  Nothing speaks more to a developers belief in themselves and their product than making their game available for everyone without remuneration.  It's a shame in this case that the implementation is below the minimum standards a dedicated PC game should offer to enthusiasts.  The quality here is simply too low for me to recommend, even for free.  I really feel like this should have been a mobile app, like the Angry Birds game this is a blatant ripoff of, but then it would have to compete with Angry Birds.  It certainly doesn't belong on PC.  Sometimes the only way to win is not to play.\n- I like this game because it is so relaxing. It has a great mix of monsters in it. You are not frighting monsters  all the time. I give this game a 5 star rating. I wish thee was a Dragon Quest Builder;s 3.\n- (This is a spoilerfree Review)\nI recommend not to search any character or even the name of the game to avoid spoilers.\n\nBasic:\nDanganronpa Trigger Happy Havoc is a murder-mystery game with a focus on deep Story.\nThere are 3 main games and 1 spin-off game. This is the First one to start with.\nYou can expect about 40 to 50 hours in this game (depending on how fast you can read and think)\nI recommend reading all dialogue and not skipping any cutscenes.\nThe overall gameplay is simple and hard at the same time, but I bet everybody could play it.\n\nStory: (Spoilerfree/no spoiler)\nThe game is about a bunch of Students who were being dragged into a Killing Game.\nThe only way to escape is by killing another Student and getting away with it.\nYou'll learn more about it while playing, there are a bunch of unsolved questions in the beginning.\n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay is mostly divided into 2 different Parts: typical visual novel gameplay\n(freetime use and social interaction) and the Class Trials. In these class trials\nyou have to solve some Minigames but mostly try to discover the Murderer (or imposter if you played Among us).\nThe class trials are definitely the best Part of the game and you can be hyped about each of them.\nBefore each class trial you have to do some Investigation about the Murder and during that time you can\ntheorize who it was and how they've done it.\n\nCharacters:\nThe characters in this Game are as different as they can be. I bet you'll have different favourite ones.\nAll I can say is that you'll learn to love each and everyone on their own way.\n\nBuy Recommendation:\nDo I recommend everybody to buy this Game? No. If you are getting bored because you mostly \nonly play Shooters and MOBA's, I dont think you will enjoy this Game even if I did. But to everybody else\nwho enjoys mystery games like Ace Attorney or even mystery/detective shows I highly recommend buying this game\nand try it out. You'll enjoy it!\n\nAs I said try to avoid any spoilers. So dont look in the Steam Workshops etc.\nThank you for reading!\n- This game is for sure not perfect, but worth buying for a specific type of gamer.\n\n[b]What is good in this game?[/b]\n- It has a pretty solid gun gameplay. The movement is quick and polished as well.\n- One level is on average 20 seconds. It's fun to improve your gameplay to get better times in the small levels. \n- It's really a blast getting a perfect run, killing enemies in bullet time or exploiting the enemies weakspots.\n- There is content for around 10-15 hours. Maybe more if you consider going for 100%.\n\n[b]Anyway there are also some flaws: [/b]\n- In Neon White or Ghostrunner the movement and pace through the levels often feels like a perfect choreographic \"dance\"\n- The levels and the areas in Warstride are verry tight. I often lost pace through \"stupid\" placed rocks or small doors.\n- There is not much to explore. The levels are verry linear. While in Neon White it was so much fun to explore shortcuts or other hidden possibilities to improve ur time there are no such mechanics in Warstride at all. I'd love to have some exploration at least in the \"long levels\".\n- It could get repetitive for some players as it's a core element to complete the levels on 5 different difficulties. \n\n[b]Conclusion: [/b]\nIf you like fast paced games like Ghostrunner, Neon White or Doom and you have no problem in repeating short levels several times and u don't except an extraordinary game u will have fun for several hours on a low price.\n\n- Absolutely dated graphics that make visibility in this game a total exercise for your eyes, enemies and teammates blend into the background and scenery constantly, friendly markers everywhere obstructing your vision, insanely fast TTK with frustrating bleed mechanics...\n\nAnd the list goes on, it's beyond me how this game is being called a better one than Battlefield, are we even playing the same game at all? This game made me go back playing Battlefield 3. If you want to play a better game than 2042, play any of the others. BF3, BF4, BF1 or even 5, but please, stop shilling games like this and trying to justify it with the price and how many worked on it, this game is not even close to being better than a battlefield game at all\n- Horrible FOV, glitchy looking graphics, everything is blurred even with motion blur off, absolutely no chance of that multiplayer mod, shoddy PC port... Pretty boring and clunky tbh. Don't buy this.\n- $15 during the autumn sale was a great price for a ton of fun and a game with some truly breathtaking visuals and effects, one of the best looking games I have ever seen. It is a worthy addition to the JC franchise. Combat is more of the same from JC2, there's tons of explosions, a big open world, great sound and music, and solid mission progression without having to grind which is becoming a thing of the past now with microtransactions in games. The game's biggest flaws are that dirt bike handling is the worst vehicle handling I have ever seen in any video game, some wingsuit missions are beyond frustrating, and it is Square so it of course isn't optimized very well unless you have a powerful setup. That and the ending is one big lazy cop out sucky easy boss fight.\n\nI was luckily able to bypass optimization issues with a powerful setup and minor tweaks. So don't risk it unless this is on sale, your pc is powerful, and also provided you don't mind a few crashes in a couple missions. Just remember that Square is #1 in continually barfing out horrible pc ports and they will never learn so even with a beast pc you are still taking a chance.\n\n7/10 because of a ton of glitches I didn't mention that would take way too long to write down, and because of Square continually sucking balls on making optimized pc games. In which they cannot do.\n- Please please please give this one a try, especially if you're a fan of existentialism, bittersweet stories, cyberpunk dystopias, gambling with your life every day, living life one step at a time, the small things that matter, cats and feeling like sh!t, but in a good way\n- I waited 12+ years for a proper sequel to A Crack in Time (yes i know the other games came out but tbh they didn't do much for me) for it only to come out for the PS5. Unfortunately, I wasn't getting a new console for just one game. \n\nNow, two years later I'm playing it on the PC.  While surreal, I am super glad they ported this series to a different platform, and the game was totally worth the wait.\n\nThe port by Nixxes ran very nice for me. I had a few hitches in the dimensional portal scenes, and one crash in a total of 12hrs of playtime. I do understand that some people are having issues and that does suck & does not disqualify their experiences, however, It is not even close to how bad TLOU Pt.1's port was.  \n\nIt's another Insomniac banger, and if you've played any of their games you already know whats up. I beat the game in 12 hrs on the 2nd to last difficulty grabbing whatever side content/collectibles I could before the story captivated me. As is tradition, there is a NG+ mode (haven't touched yet) and I look forward to trying it. I'll probably update the review at that point, but the games are always repayable due to their collect-a-thon nature, that and being so damn fun you have a dumb ear-to-ear smile for all of the playtime.  \n \nIf you enjoyed the Ratchet and Clank games in the past, its way more of that + the dimensional gimmick which is really well done and very neat tech wise. I love the new movement features and Rivet is a very good addition to the cast. I hope she stays relevant in the story in the future. Game feels super good to play as well, weapons are great as always. The writing is still funny and enjoyable. It's just a good time, and I highly recommend it, even at full price.\n\nLastly, I would like to direct a message to Sony/PS Studios/Insomniac Games:\nPLEASE PORT THE OTHER AND OLDER R&C GAMES PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE IPELASE PLs I WILL PAY $70\n- The fact that you can't pause the game during cutscenes and conversations, is very frustrating. The cinematics are long (and sometimes exhausting). If your baby wakes up, If your phone rings, if someone's at the door, if you need to take a pan out of the oven... you can't pause the game! What's the deal with that? Put a pause feature! We have the technology!\n- Absolutely amazing. PLEASE don't judge this game based on how it looks. You must try it yourself! I thought it would be terrible but a friend convinced me to try it, and I'm glad he did. I haven't had so much fun in a game in a long time.\n- I have always wanted to play Resdient Evil 4, and I wanted to play this game so badly.  I am giving a negative review simply because the games FPS on the PC are bad, that could be because of Windows 10 because I heared rumors that the game does not run well on it and such, so that could be the problem.   Another problem I faced is the lip sync is dealyed when it's on the cutscenes so that makes everything slow and such.  The gameplay from what I seen however is pretty great and I think Resdient Evil 4 is a great game, but this port is not, get it for the GC, Will, PS2, or any of the consloes that has this game.\n- A missed opportunity. But, if you liked the original, you'll like this one as well.\n\nGreat graphics and sound, just like its predecessor. Once again, bonus points for ultrawide support. No complaints about the presentation, but some of the characters definitely rub me the wrong way. YMMV in that department. \n\nI had read that the original writer passed away. I see this left the team with a difficult choice. To their credit, I could not tell the difference between the two. It emulates the same style and tone, and I imagine this is intentional to honor the spirit of the original author's intent. Unfortunately, I think the writing was the worst part of the original by far, and I see this as a missed opportunity to move on from that. \n\nAll of the supernatural elements in this story are but the thinnest of veils for what is ultimately a collection of modern day social media discourse. There is rampant virtue signaling, and every character speaks about the world around them as if they live inside Twitter. There are a scant few genuine moments, and I can appreciate the fact that the writer(s?) clearly feel a lot of angst about putting themselves out there and the creative process in general. There is a complete lack of subtlety in the writing regarding this, but I see it and I get it. \n\nIt feels a lot more disappointing than the first one, as we're familiar with much of the cast already, and there's not a lot of progress or poignancy in their respective narratives. I genuinely came away from this game feeling like I spent a few hours reading Twitter threads. It's nothing but surface level social commentary.\n\nGiven that the intent here was probably to honor the original writer, I'd still be in for a Coffee Talk 3 in the hopes that they show some growth and try something different. If that one also ends up being the same, I'd definitely call it quits. \n\nFWIW, this is certainly a worthy tribute for those who do not find fault with the original.\n- This game is adrenaline, speed and acid to the absolute maximum and it delivers - you'll be doing exactly what you see in the trailers in absolutely no time and feeling like a badass!\n\nWe have all the menu, leaderboards and replay system as in Devil Daggers along with a new clips section for highlights from runs. \nThe new scoring system is a HUGE improvement. In DD you had to survive as long as possible leading to it becoming repetitive as you grinded, here the score is based on how fast you can kill stuff and there is an ending to the run meaning you might survive to the end and kill the boss - but someone else could beat your score by killing stuff faster in the first min and then dying. \nThis adds loads more risk to the game as you WANT to take those risks to kill stuff faster.\n\nOnly let down is the controls, the simple control scheme worked in Devil daggers as there wasn't much going on but it REALLY hurts now theres so many new mechanics causing both a lot of unintended actions like with RMB is your laser and you can scatter this off the ground or like you see in the trailers shoot the gems for your homing daggers trouble is RMB is also grab meaning if you look at a gem and start to power your laser you simple pick up the gem and no laser huge momentum loss. Likewise spacebar is jump, dash, slide, fake and air slam this not only leads to awkward \"thats not what i wanted\" moments but also cramps my hand since you are constantly spamming for dash which is 2 presses...\n\nIf the controls dont bother you or get some love this game is easily a 10/10.\n- Hi dev, if you were wondering whether anyone would actually use your HDR feature, I am. thanks\n- An excellent maximalist mashup of Slay The Spire with some Tower Defence and CCG Mechanics. Not as tight and elegantly designed as StS, but with a lot more variety in card design leads to a lot more varied and wild interactions and deck composition. Compulsive and mechanically satisfying, Monster Train embraces excess in a satisfying way, even if the whole package is wrapped up in a slightly odd aesthetic package of half remembered hearthstone knock offs. (The soundtrack, incidentally, slaps)\n- An amazingly fun and short adventure from the creator of Rakuen. Mr. Saitou is a game based in the same universe as Rakuen, but follows the story a salaryman, Mr. Saitou. Mr. Saitou takes you on a journey that explores some serious undertones, but approaches the subjects with incredible sensitivity, respect and some very light and silly humor. There's tons of flavor text to be discovered, pop culture references to be recognized and if you've played Rakuen, familiar characters to meet. As you make your way through the story, there are lots of puzzles that are simplistic, but well thought out in a way that adds to the story.The game is made to be played in 1 sitting that may vary depending on how much you interact with the world. This game can also be played by many ages and is family friendly. You DO NOT have to play Rakuen first to enjoy this game or understand it, but it will definitely add a depth of sentimentality to the game, as there are some call backs. I would absolutely recommend this game to anyone and you may find yourself learning something about your own life during Mr. Saitou's journey.Have a long day!\n- First of all, I really like the Game, it's Gameplay is wonderful and i really enjoy the parkour to combat mix in it. Although i noticed a lot of bugs especially in COOP i still enjoy logging on the game.\n\nThe Story is good but doesn't need a upgrade in my opinion. I like that certain map changes and Story decisions are dependant on some side quests and on each other.\n\nNow to the sad part:\n\nTencent recently bought Techland which was controversial at first, but then DL points were added which made a lot of people mad at Tencent and partially Techland, understandably.\nThey Including me don't want the game to die out because a greedy company wants to make some quick buck.\n\nAlthough i have to say myself, other Tencent bought games still are quite enjoyable.\n\nI just hope that Techland does the right thing in future and makes the current state of DL points less predatory and more Cosmetic based pure.\n\nIn it current state we still have no knifes without Bundles, but that was before Tencent so the blame for that goes to Techland, but i am excited for future updates and playing Dying light 2, even without buying DL points :)\n\nI'll give this game a solid 7/10 for the bugs, microtransactions but also because it has good gameplay and community reach\n\n(I have edited my original negative review about the pure rant about DL points because i also wanted to consider current gameplay and more)\n- +Long (&quality) story mode\n\n-Sometimes utterly lost so I have to backtrack or look at playthroughs\n-No skill tree\n-Loading screens\n-Some game breaking bugs so I had to cheat to pass it (e.g. pistons in tunnel) \n-Repetitive: turn this wheel, kill this bunch of enemies to open the lock,...\n-Enemies become bullet sponges on higher difficulty modes\n-No Xen chapters, so quite a cliffhanger...\n\nIn short: it is a decent game because of the good story, but people that recommend it are probably just on a nostalgia trip.\n- This game can be great at times but extremely frustrating most of the time. 80% change to hit, miss every time. I can't keep playing a game with so much crappy coding.\n- An amazing game, you can go from doing great and having a full and maxed level crew, and end up fighting the wrong guy as they systematically destroy your ship systems leaving your weapons and shields off-line as your crew burns to death while suffocating. Very fun and has endless replayibility\n- !!!!READ TO THE BOTTOM OR SCROLL!!!!\n       !!!!69 FREE PACKS + MORE CARDS AND COSMETICS CODES!!\n                        \n I did this for the NEW community:)         \n !!MAKE SURE TO UPVOTE AND OR AWARD SO EVERYONE NEW CAN SEE!!\n\ni have played almost all the MTG online iterations, MTG 2012 2013 2014, DUEL, MTGO, Magic the Gathering Online \nTactics, and now Arena. \nMTG 2012-2014 were fun but they were limited to the cards released those years\nMagic the Gathering Online was cool, you could trade and sell cards, do actual cube and draft with bought packs, but the interface was dated even after the update..\nMagic duels was sold to us as the end all, going forward no new program just duels and they would add sets as they released..(It wasn't, they didn't)\n\nMTG Arena (this one) has done everything they said and they did not abandon it after a few years. It may have just arrived on steam but it has been a beta then stand alone client for years (i was accepted into the beta 3/2018 and beta wrapped up 9/25/2019 to give an idea) They are releasing sets and keeping in line with standard releases, they offer a ton of formats and you can earn your cards and decks. i have earned thousands of cards and hundreds and hundreds of packs for free, 1-2 packs per day is easy, and yes it takes time but each month the ladder resets and you work your way up in ranked or you can just play another format or unranked to earn gold/xp,coins which translate into packs, save your gold for drafts and open packs and pick cards or just buy a ton of packs and earn them for free with exp! Also every 6 packs you open you get a choose your own blank rare gold wild card, and every 30 packs a mythic wildcard , also you get blank commons and uncommons in packs and by playing.  and PS there is a ton of people playing all the time, you never have to wait long for a match or even a draft to kick off.\n\n(New Account info and Instructions)\nNew Accounts have to play and complete 5 mini matches to unlock 12 free cards and 5 free starter decks, then upon completion you will enter into the client and see color challenges..skip that, click on the mail icon (top right) to claim 21 free packs (as of writing) from different recent sets, then click the home button (top right) to get out of the color challenge screen to the actual deck builder and match entry\n\nHere is a list of codes that will give you a ton of packs, cards and cosmetics, the packs, also count toward your free rare and mythic wildcard count you get by opening every 6 packs. by opening these you should have enough to craft your own starter decks and even pick quite a few blank rare mythic and common uncommon wild cards ( i just tried to make a new account and i got 69 free packs total that translated to 18 common 25 uncommon 12 rare and 4 mythic wildcards and a ton of actual rares mythics and hundreds of other cards (your mileage may vary depending on how many wildcards you find in the packs as well) \n\n(enter these in the store, top right \"redeem code\" field) \nIM SURE THERE ARE MORE CODES OUT THERE THESE ARE THE ONES I KNOW WORK IN 2023\nFree Booster Pack Codes ( 48 packs from these code alone for a total of 69 with the free mail claims at time of writing)\nPlayBRO\nPlayDMUAlchemy\nPlayDMU\nplayHBG\nPlayAlchemyNewCapenna\nPlaySNC\nPlayNEOAlchemy\nPlayNEO\nPlayVOW\nPlayMID\nPlayDND\nPlayKaldheim\nPlayZendikar\nPLAYM21\nPlayIkoria\nPlayTheros\n\nEXP CODES:\nThreads\t1,000 XP\n\nCOSMETIC CODES:\nFNMATHOME\nInformationIsPower\nCrimeIsAnArtForm\nAlwaysFinishTheJob\nFunIsntFree\nReadTheFinePrint\n:updated:\n\n*REMEMBER TO UPVOTE THIS POST AND SHARE WITH OTHERS, MORE PLAYERS THE BETTER:)*\n- I love this game. I've clocked over 300 hours in it through Origin (on my ONE character xD ). It's an excellent game, even despite it being an \"open world faffaround simulator\" which was all the rage at the time.\n\nAnd finally on Steam!? Yay! Or yay..?\n\nBut, as we know, we can't have good things. Massive thumb down to the EA Origin \"integration\" in Steam. EA, how about just stop being such massive ducks?\n\nThis is the same \"we hate our customers\" behaviour expressed by d-bags like Ubisoft and Epic. Only that EA sort of makes it worse. They *know* how much people hate the unnecessary and malicious Uplay \"integration\" that Ubisoft have forced on us for several years. Seeing this, EA decides that doing the exact same thing, with their total-garbage Origin client made even worse, is surely the only way to harass the customers enough to be worthy of the EA brand. \n\nDO NOT BUY OR LINK your Steam account if you own the game on Origin from earlier. \nIf you buy a game on Steam, which you already own on Origin, it will overwrite your Origin game.\nIf you then refund the game on Steam, this will remove the game from Origin too (even if you already own it there!), and you'll spend hours in line to get a hold of customer support. Then you must chat with bots, or people who are so void of understanding (and likely not paid near enough to care) that they might as well be bots. And if you're lucky, you might, after going through 4 or 5 different \"agents\", finally get to talk to a person that comprehends English and is authorised to do anything beyond telling you \"they'll discuss it with their team\". Then you might get your game back. \nBut! You won't get back the GOTY. Because the Steam-Orgin-GOTY overwrites your Origin GOTY. And when refunding, via Steam, you're left with a dumb/lame/placeholder copy of the GOTY in your Origin library, which doesn't work, but somehow just lingers there. Then you need to get a Digital Deluxe Edition + all DLC to get back to where you were.\n\nThis [integration] is such a tremendous show of manure, that I'm actually left wondering if EA planned it. Did Andrew Wilson take one of his billions of pocked change and say \"hey, we should make an extra effort here, to make sure that this integration is as frustrating and poorly implemented as possible, but still functional, such that things are barely limping along but just barely, because nothing is as frustrating as something that just barely sorta works but only sorta, and only by the skin of its teeth. That'll teach those entitled peasants.\"\n\nSo yeah. Great game. Bad EA.\n\nUpdate! A new Origin experience: The EA App! An all new website, wrapped inside an all new Electron wrapper! For an all new Frustrating(TM) experience and much better hogging of your PC performance.\n- Lots of people parrot the \"tech demo\" or \"benchmark of the singularity\" lines without forming their own opinions.\n\nMe personally, as a fan of Supreme Commander, I enjoyed this game more then I thought I would. I only played the single player campaigns and haven't touched multiplayer. \n\nThe gameplay is exactly what it should be for this kind of game. When I first saw this game I didn't like how every unit was a hovering unit, but it makes sense with the class system the game has. Frigates are basically infantry, Cruisers are tanks, Dreadnauts are hero/high tier. The game borrows from Dawn of War with the territory control mechanic.\n- you're looking for a game review you've come to the wrong place. But if youre looking for a fantastic ravioli recipe you've come to the right place.\n\nIngredients\n- To Make the Dough\n375 grams (3 cups) plain flour\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n2 eggs\n1/4 cup (50 ml / 3½ tablespoons) olive oil\n1/2 cup (120 ml / 8 tablespoons) water\nExtra flour for dusting \n\n\n- To Make Cheese Filling\n15 ounces (425 grams) container Ricotta cheese\n5 ounces (142 g/about 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons) \"3 Cheese Italian Blend\" (Parmesan, Romano & Asiago)\nNote: grate these cheeses yourself and create your own custom blend.\n1/2 cup cheddar cheese\n2 eggs, lightly beaten\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/2 teaspoon pepper\n\n\n- Extras\nYour favorite sauce for the ravioli (i.e. marinara/ marijuana)\nParmesan cheese\nBasil\nFried vegetables\nShrimp\nFish slices\nChicken pieces \nMake the Ravioli filling.\n\n- In a small mixing bowl, add the ricotta and mash with a fork.\n- Add in the 3-cheese blend, Cheddar cheese, eggs, salt, and pepper.\n- Mix all ingredients thoroughly until you have a smooth, paste-like consistency.\n- Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. \n\nMake the Ravioli dough.\n\n- Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.\n- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.\n- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.\n- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.\n- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.\n- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).\n- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. \n\nFill the Ravioli shells.\n\n- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.\n- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.\n- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.\n- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.\n- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. \n\nForm the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.\n\n- Roll the dough into two sheets\n- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.\n- Fill with the ravioli mixture.\n- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.\n- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.\n\nCook the Ravioli.\n\n- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.\n- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.\n- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest \n- Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed plates\n\nServe it up.\nTop with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!\n- This game is like cocaine. \nI always tell myself just one more, then im done. I'll do homework. I'll sleep. I'll eat something. \nBut you know what? That last death was cheap, I'll do one more to make up for it. I just need 1000 gold for that upgrade, I'll just do one more to get it. Always just one more. \n\nThings I like:\n\n+Strong RPG Progression - Gold from your run can be spent on stats, equipment, abilities, etc. making multiple runs and longer runs more rewarding.\n\n+The game is witty and has flavor. -- there are various conditions your new characters can have such as being blind, gay or having a fear of chickens, amongst many, many others. Dying is in this sense, pretty fun. The writing has a lot of charm!\n\n+The controls are very tight -- this game has good controls. It's easy to do what you want, which is good because it's very tough and you will die a lot.\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n- The bosses in new game plus don't get harder -- As you progress into new game + or ++ or +++ and beyond, the bosses don't scale well, despite the general enemies leveling up to basically become bosses themselves. Not a huge deal, but it's the only negative I have.\n\nThen at some point you realize you've beaten the game, Thankfully there is a new game plus.\nMaybe just one more playthrough...\n- My previous review reflected the terrible state of the game as it was on launch day. After years of improvements, the game has had its map design & cover placement tweaked, pretty-boy playermodels have been dirtied up, cringy voicelines were adjusted & a bunch of new content has been added. A lot of my complaints were addressed and I recognize the amount of work the team has done to bring the game back. It finally feels content complete and has reached an acceptable level of quality that should've been there when it came out.\n\nHowever, I am still disappointed to say it falls very short of its predecessors in terms of gameplay, map design and atmosphere. I see no reason to play this instead of BF3/BF4. \n\nPlay the map Grand Bazaar in Battlefield 3. Look at all of the particle effects, post processing and detail that map has. It has such a thick rainy atmosphere. Play it through to the end and you'll see how players tear up the map and make it look destroyed. In BF4's Paracel Storm, the foliage will sway & the waves will rise as the strong winds of a storm approaches the map. Watch as a sandstorm creeps up in Gulf of Oman and eventually engulfs it in a torrent of chaos. These landscapes have so much drama that the ones in 2042 lack. Sure, there are sandstorms and tornadoes, but they still look so sterile compared to the previous games this title stands upon.\n\nConceptually, 2042's world is supposed to be on its knees. The growing reality of extreme climate, natural disasters becoming commonplace and the world powers fighting over the last resources Earth has to offer depicts a dire situation to immerse ourselves in. This makes me imagine maps where earthquakes adjust the layout of flags throughout the round, or tsunamis roll in and what once was a playable area is now flooded. Giant tornado events that tear down skyscrapers. Sandstorms that turn the widest of maps into a close-quarters brawl. \n\nThe maps in the game have some aspects of this concept but nowhere to the amount that it should. The technology is there. The previous games have had a genuinely impressive level of immersion and atmosphere. 2042 did not have this on launch and it still doesn't. This could have been the wild natural disaster Battlefield game where we see SHTF.\n\nI don't care that we have 128 player matches or goofy butt specialists to play as. They missed the mark with 2042 and no update can fix that, conceptually, it never was able to realize its potential.\n- Not For Broadcast is in the simplest of terms, a multi-tasking simulator.\n\nYou sit in a news control room and you have to keep track of multiple things: censoring curse words, switching between cameras, playing ads at the right time, ensuring your broadcast frequency isn't disrupted, as well as keeping an eye out for a bunch of other strange things that appear later in the game.\n\nThis isn't the easiest of games as it requires a good deal of attentiveness. The description isn't joking when they call this \"high-pressure\". You have to rely heavily on both audio and visual cues to make sure your broadcast doesn't get screwed up. As this is the news (and live), there is no rewind or undo button. If you mess up and want to get a good performance grade, you'll need to redo the entire news segment. \nIf you're a perfectionist like me, a 10 min segment can end up turning into an hour of trying to perfect that news segment. As such, I do hope an option to quick save, or at the very least, save and quit, can later be put into the game. It felt rather taxing having to keep an eye on so many things for so long. But as with any game, excellence isn't an art, it's a habit. You'll find yourself turning into a multitasking expert eventually.\n\nThankfully, the actors in the game do a great job of making the experience an entertaining one. There is a good amount of humour written into each broadcast, although I must admit I wasn't quite able to pay attention to all the dialogue, as I was too busy trying to switch to the right cameras whilst ensuring my electricity didn't get cut out. Luckily, the game does have an archive which allows you to playback the broadcasts. Without that, I'd probably be missing out on 70% of what was going on.\n\nThere is also a text narrative, choices matter portion in between news segments. As of now, it feels a little out of place and incomplete, but then again, this is an Early Access review.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that at the time of writing this review, there isn't really any \"propaganda\" aspect to the game yet.\n\nPerformance-wise, the game runs pretty smoothly. I did encounter occasional crashes if I looked left or right and back and forth too quickly, but other than that, the game is pretty much bug-free. Also, this game has my RTX 2070 Super running at rather high temps for some reason. Rather surprising for a game that doesn't appear to have particularly high-end graphics.\n\nAnyway, I'll be looking forward to see what comes next for this game. Definitely worth the buy despite being Early Access.\n- buy it on sale. campaign was decent, however The Last Tiger mission was a standout. Multiplayer experience is ok overall, the hackers make it the worst bit. 6.5/10, if Dice fixes their servers and clears out the hackers then maybe it's worthy of an 8/10.\n- I like to think of this game as what a Telltale game should have been.\nReal decisions that have real consequences. Allies who leave you due to the actions you take, betrayal due to dumb decisions. All of which only happen due to the choices you can make.\nBut instead of quicktime events, you play some games of Gwent.\nSome really difficult decisions as well, ones that i had to seriously stop and think about. A couple of stupidly easy ones as well, but i can forgive that.\nAlso some fantastic tongue in cheek references to other games/pop culture that i had some laugh out loud moments.\n\nYou also get to upgrade and customise your deck as you earn new cards along the way and they do that well. Save a <random character so as no spoiler> and convince him to journey with you? You know have access to his cool card (and trust me, there are some really cool cards). \nBut piss him off so he leaves, well his card is no longer available to you. I'm actually convinced ive missed a possible card or two due to some story decisions.\n\nIf there was one thing i think the game lacks, its risk.\nSome people have complained that its too easy, even on the hardest difficulty, which i think has some truth to it, but even that i dont think is the real problem.\nThe real problem is that if you lose a fight, it doesnt let you continue, you just retry till you win.\nSo if the game asks you, do you engage in a risky fight to save some of your trapped soldiers or do you leave them to their fate, you obviously would always choose the risky fight, as there is no punishment to losing the fight. You just keep retrying till you win.\nIt does take the weight away from a bunch of decisions and i also think it takes away that feeling if triumph you should get when you win the difficult fight and save the troops. You literally risked nothing.\nHowever, There are more than enough difficult decisions that have nothing to do with combat that you will still love this game.\nNot sure how they could fix this at this point, since the story is already fairly detailed with branching decisions.\nMaybe something to keep in mind for the next game. Give us fights that if we lose affect the story badly. Make it feel riskier for us to always choose the better path, so we are tempted to choose the easier one and therefore feel good when we succeed the  hard one, or feel the consequences when we fail the harder path.\n\nIs it worth the cost? I honestly think so, I haven't regret the money ive spent so far. Some people complaining its too short for what it costs (based on the 30 hour estimate, not them having actually played it), but for me its a really good quality 30 hours and i wish more games would take note.\nPeople complaining about 30 dollars for 30 hours are the reason Dragon Age Inquisition had 60 hours of useless grindy soul destroying fetch quests instead of being a streamlined, awesome game.\n- Do yourself a favor.  Go in as blind as possible.  Don't look at any guides.  The system of getting pages of the manual that you can't fully understand is a stroke of genius.\n\nAlso I haven't found a waterfall that *doesn't* have a secret behind it.\n\n**EDIT: Finished the game**\n\nI'll admit for many of the later \"post-game puzzles\" I looked at a guide for.  The in game language is very difficult to decipher blindly, and if you're not familiar with English you probably shouldn't even bother.  \n\nThe surprising thing about this game is you can pretty much do any puzzle at any given time once you get one or two specific items, but because of how the manual is handled, you'll never know how until you see the pages (or experiment a lot)\n\nI think the most amount of tries I've spent on a boss fight was 7-8, but nothing is stopping you from exploring more and finding stat boosts.\n- I appreciate the sincerity of Jusant. You can tell its creators have placed genuine care into their product, which has made the experience of playing it joyful and kind.\nThe visuals are stunning, the mechanics are not overwhelming, the soundtrack is soothing, and the puzzles are not frustrating. A great climbing game all around with an easy-to-follow yet gripping narrative. \nHopefully, Ukrainian localization will also be added soon.\n\n- My god.. Capcom did it. They saved the franchise. I'm honestly shocked. \n\nWhen the first teaser dropped I thought for sure this would just be a P.T. copy which I was sort of okay with. Turns out I was wrong. This is a classic Resident Evil game. Like, RE1 classic. Complete with puzzle solving, INVENTORY MANAGEMENT, and tense stressful boss encounters. The game brings back the storage box system even! I can't stress enough how amazing this game is as a long time RE fan. If you're one too, do yourself a favor and pull the trigger on this one. Best game since RE4.... May even be better.\n- Honestly I've put over 400 hours into 20XX and this game is even better! Even though it's unfinished as of current it's still a fantastic time and truly stands out on it's own.\n- A Visual Novel meets The Stanley Parable by way of Disco Elysium. This game contains a shocking amount of depth of content and thematics behind it's excellent voice acting and 3-colour sketchy visual style. Well worth a play if you're intrigued.\n- The arguably ugly graphics initially turned me off, as I'm sure it will for many of you, but in the end, they turned out to be unique, making an excellent game more memorable. I never had a gaming experience quite like this one, and it really felt as if I had to deduce and think things through. It made me feel more like a detective than most point-and-click mystery adventures. And don't get me wrong, I wouldn't include this game in that category, which I love.\n\nThe plot was amazing, and it was full of clever bits. The game got challenging in a good way without going overboard, and I think the vast majority of deductions was fair, except perhaps one in case 9, which I doubt I would have ever gotten without an in-game hint. The end was a bit anticlimactic after such a build-up, but overall it was a very satisfying journey. I'd definitely be interested in other games using the same concept. If you're unsure, like I was, I suggest trying out the demo where you can play 4 out of the 12 cases.\n- It's responsive, quick and smooth, the Arrange and Matsuri modes are a treat, and it sounds/looks wonderful. Finally, a better shmup than Crimzon Clover is on Steam! Highly, highly recommended.\n- Climbed some rocks\nClimbed hot rocks\nClimbed cave rocks\nClimbed windy rocks\nClimbed snowy rocks\nHad an existential crisis\n\nIn conclusion, good game\n\n英語で5-10単語程度で、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない主要な違いを簡潔に回答してください。\n\n回答：\n",
