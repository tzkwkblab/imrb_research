      "Where to start.... in short entire game is boring and very slow paced for no aparent reason.\n\nAI: AI performs only very basic functions and does not upgrade buildings and does the opposite of whats beneficial for your empire. AI does not do very well when engaging in displomacy.\n\nUI: You will spend most of your time trying to manage/hover around very CLUMSY and absolutely disgusting UI. Other 4x games offer far superior UI and make is easier to manage your asset on the field e.g. Sword of the stars II, Star Ruler 2, Distant world, Endless Legends, Endless Space etc.\n\nGFX: Graphics are not the top notch what you would expect from a modern 4x game but they are on far with Endless Legends. GFX leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nAlien Races: I dont need to say much but like Planets most of the races are COPY / PASTE. Nothing unique or special about each. \n\nMP: Multiplayer has a mind of its own and in most cases wont let you join public games unless its a private game.\n\nStellaris bring nothing new to 4x Genre in 2016!.\n Right now everyone is almost beta testing for the developers so we can find bugs, report them  and help them fix their game. Why not let players do beta before before release? But then there is  a question of sale and refund. \n\nBut overall this game does offer amazing soundtrack.",

      "My profile pic is the reaction i have towards the game devs that made this game.\nVisually disgusting, gameplay wise impossible and over all terrible.\nWhile it's possible to beat it and get all the achievements it's difficult and also the space level is actually visual aids it's so disgusting to look at that you can't even focus on the gameplay.\nNot worth it even for free which is how i probably got it i can't remember and i don't want to...",
      "A solid \"Get Va11HallA instead, unless this is on sale. Otherwise, maybe.\".\n\nCoffee Talk: Fantasy Coffee-brewing Action, is a day-by-day visual novel with slight coffee-brewing mechanics on the side. Its storyline is broken up into several days, of which customers visit your coffee shop and talk. The first few days are rather short: no longer than a few minutes, but as the story advances the days become more packed with story. The game as a whole is rather short, less than 3 hours to complete the main storyline. Overall, generally a well rounded game, but not $15. On the other hand, it compares rather poorly to Va11halla, a game with a nigh identical format, but has more characters, story, and charm. If you liked Va11halla, and really can't wait for N1RVAnnA, then get it on sale. Otherwise, just get Va11halla. But I'm still recommending it because steam doesn't allow maybes, and there's very little competition for this niche of VN.",
      "Don't buy this game if you are planning a full co-op playthrough with a friend.\n\nAt first we thought only story progress wasn't shared which was fine as we'd both get to experience the missions regardless. However it turns out that all unlocks tied to completing each area such as new guns, cars and basically all the things you'd want to progress in are locked for the person who isn't hosting. This means your partner is stuck with the level 1 unlocks from start to finish unless they go back and do everything in their game as well.\n\nCompletely pointless and took us until clearing one of the lieutenants for us to realise this, bought this a while back too so not gonna be able to get a refund. Worst implemented co-op I have seen in a long time.",

Chances are, this review will never convince someone to buy Garry's Mod. It'll just be lost in the 100,000 positive reviews out there. Well, here I go anyway.\n\n\"Where do I start?\" This is the question asked by anyone playing Gmod for their first time. It's also my question that I ask about this review I am writing. Hmm...\n\n_The gameplay...the gameplay...hmm... Well, there's singleplayer sandbox. You can do...uh, whatever you want really. Just addon a few addons, and you can be entertained for hours. Battle NPCs, make cool scenes for cool screenshots, explore maps, be a superhero (spiderman addon!), and much, much, much, much- you get my point, right? Almost all content is user-generated. Make your own content! Multiplayer. In Multiplayer Gmod you can roleplay. I'm talking normal RP (DarkRP), Military RP, Star Wars RP, etc, etc. In multiplayer Gmod, you can battle, prophunt (yay), hide 'n seek, and much, much, more.\n\n_Graphics? I'll rate the graphics...drumroll please... 7/10. This game is and older game. Came out in 2006. I guess the graphics are good for 2006, and people enjoy the game and don't complain much about the graphics, but I'm not gonna lie, they are outdated and look old. It's not 2006 anymore.\n\n_Hear the bullets flying. The zombies growling. The people chatting. The boxes jumping... The sound in this game is great! Every sound is loud and clear, and there are a varitey of sounds.\n\n_Play this game. Play it again. Play it some more. Play some now, and play some later. Play it over and over. Play it as long as you want.\n\n_My Personal opinion. Get this game. Now. Get Gmod on sale or not. I'm not gonna stop playing it for a while and I'm already at 50+ hours of playtime. I love this game! WAIT! Before you go and buy this, then you wonder why there are all the missing maps and errors in most games, get Counter Strike: Source, so ALL the textures are supported. You need it to play MOST multiplayer games.\n\n\nGameplay: 9/10\nGraphics: 7/10\nStory: N/A\nSound: 8/10\nReplayability: 10/10\n\nOverall 8.5\n\nEven though, this is one positive review on Garry's Mod, out of the thousands of positive reviews that have been submitted Garry's Mod, I hope this one convinces you to buy... Gmod\n\n-Star_Hawk_",
      "Ignore all the copers who think because they beat Celeste they're a platforming master. This game is a rage precision platformer, it's supposed to be hard, but the best part is that it doesn't even have to be. That's why there is AN OPTION TO SET THE DIFFICULTY IN THE SETTINGS, and if you somehow are too proud to just tone it down a bit to get a better experience and instead decide to blame the game and its developer, then why are you even playing video games in the first place. They're supposed to be fun. This game can be a rage platformer, but it can also be a casual one. It depends on what you want.Will you snail has a great soundtrack, great level design, and super interesting story and lore. Is the game too hard? Change the difficulty. Do you not care about the story? Ignore the optional dialogue. It's that easy. This game is really really good, and don't let anyone convince you otherwise, especially people who can't deal with the fact that the rage game is hard",
      "An amazingly fun and short adventure from the creator of Rakuen. Mr. Saitou is a game based in the same universe as Rakuen, but follows the story a salaryman, Mr. Saitou. Mr. Saitou takes you on a journey that explores some serious undertones, but approaches the subjects with incredible sensitivity, respect and some very light and silly humor. There's tons of flavor text to be discovered, pop culture references to be recognized and if you've played Rakuen, familiar characters to meet. As you make your way through the story, there are lots of puzzles that are simplistic, but well thought out in a way that adds to the story.The game is made to be played in 1 sitting that may vary depending on how much you interact with the world. This game can also be played by many ages and is family friendly. You DO NOT have to play Rakuen first to enjoy this game or understand it, but it will definitely add a depth of sentimentality to the game, as there are some call backs. I would absolutely recommend this game to anyone and you may find yourself learning something about your own life during Mr. Saitou's journey.Have a long day!",
      "I had to purchase Scarlet Hollow after witnessing the excitement of Episode 4 through my friends. I immediately binged the first three episodes the following day and found myself and in rather different spot compared to their playthrough. The choices you make in SH are actually impactful - which is (unfortunately) quite refreshing for the genre! I've since run through several different routes to explore more of the story (and collect those achievements!). While you have the ability to skip through previously seen text, lines within replayed conversations are shaped by your selected traits, choices, and previously selected dialogue; you won't be skipping that many lines before seeing new content. Similarly, characters may be painted in an entirely different light based on choices you've made. The cast and writing truly nails the small town feel of SH (gossip and all). \n\nMake sure you eat the takeaway container in the fridge. Thank me later.",
      "ORIGINAL REVIEW Posted: Nov 27, 2016:\nExtremely fun and addictive game! That IS if you practice and learn the way the game is supposed to be played.\n\nActually requires a lot of patience, aim control, learning of map locations, etc.\n\nEdit Dec 7, 2018: Stupid crazy full with hackers, now that it's F2P i feel like it's gonna get taken over by even more hackers... RIP 2012 CSGO.\n\nEDIT 2021/09/03: Some of you are morons here... Clearly a huge \"fan\" base of CSGO. I've gathered around 9,000+ hours in total (in my other account as well) No. I wasn't a \"Noob\" or had no skill. I was GE for a very long time.\n\nThis review is from 2018. After all the new updates came into place. I LOVED the game, It was my addiction. After those updates, everything went down hill. MORE toxicity, MORE blatant hackers, and I for one wasn't a big fan of the newest updates. So I decided to leave, updated this review with my most recent experience.\nReviews are meant to talk about your experience, Not to kiss ass and make things look good when they aren't.",
      "An instant classic.\n---\n\nThe original [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/kunovega/recommended/264200]One Finger Death Punch[/url] was an unexpected treat for me. The refined simplicity of just two buttons that require masterful timing to create a legitimate fighting experience laid out to a selection of music that reminds you of the classic Kung-fu movies of the 1970's but packaged with a carefree stickman aesthetic.\n\nOne Finger Death Punch 2 is a respectable sequel in most ways. The core gameplay is fundamentally the same while the visual indicators and special attack animations have been upgraded and made more fanciful. Other things are changed simply to give you a new experience.\n\nEvery aspect of the game is polished from the interesting tutorial to the many additional modes (survival, gauntlet, etc.) that exist beyond the (very long) main campaign. Once you get into the groove there's potentially dozens if not hundreds of hours of fun to squeeze from this.\n\nThis is a game that just has to be played to truly appreciate it as the feel of your interaction along with the music is what really defines the experience. Simply watching it or looking at the screenshots doesn't do it justice.\n\nThere are a couple of (minor) controversial changes that may not appeal to some fans:\n1. The music in 2 includes a more modernized remix compared to the more traditional music from 1. Personally I love the soundtracks from both, but there are people who have a preference.\n2. The upgrades to special attacks in 2 can be a bit of visual clutter at times. I like both styles, but there are people who prefer 1 over 2.\n3. There are some sequences (like the lightsword rounds) which did not return in 2, replaced instead by other weapons. While I think it would have been cute to include all of that along with the new stuff, it's not a deal breaker. It does however mean that both games retain a bit of unique flair and a reason for you to play and experience them both. 2 is overall an upgrade, but it's also not a 100% replacement.\n\nI would strongly suggest that if you've never played either game, you should begin with the first one. I think it's a better entry point to the series and might have a slightly broader appeal. (it's also slightly cheaper).\n\nThen if you find yourself enjoying it, come back and pick up 2 and you'll find yourself with some remixed music, fancy new special attack animations and a whole new adventure to work through.\n\nJust to be very clear: Both of these games are fantastic and deserve more praise than I can properly express and I'll very likely be putting 100's of hours into this just like I did the first one.\n---\n\nBottom line: Simple to learn, hard to master, and super satisfying fighting along with a great soundtrack.\n---\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38232109/]While you are here, would you consider following my curator page?[/url]\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/kunovega/recommended/]Want to read all of my reviews and not just the curated ones?[/url]",
      "[h1]Borderlands 2 - Excellent Story, Solid Gameplay, Great Characters and one of the very best Coop experiences around.[/h1]\n\n[table]\n  [tr]\n    [th][h1]|| 9.5 ||[/h1][/th]\n    [th]Score[/th]\n    [th]Comment[/th]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td]Graphics[/td]\n    [td]8[/td]\n    [td]Borderlands 2 has a visual style all its own, it may not initially impress some used to a \"next generation, high definition, ultra realistic landscape\", but it is nevertheless very appealing and detailed. Some of the landscapes and views around Pandora (the world on which the story takes place) are beautiful and each area has its own look and atmosphere. Characters and enemies are detailed and extremely varied in appearance. You can customise your characters appearance with a large selection of outfits and heads which you can collect throughout the game.[/td]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td]Audio[/td]\n    [td]10[/td]\n    [td]No real killer soundtrack here (apart from the the introduction video), just really good atmospheric music throughout. Where this game really shines is the voice acting for characters, enemies, audio logs and even weapons (yes some of them can talk!). The dialogue is often very funny, helping to explain and drive the story, fill in background and really adds the the immersion.[/td] \n [/tr]\n [tr]\n    [td]Gameplay[/td]\n    [td]9[/td]\n    [td]A mix of FPS and RPG, Borderlands 2 is a lot of fun to play. So many missions to complete, so many enemies to kill, so much loot to grab. You are given massive area's to explore all over the world of pandora filled with creatures, quests, secrets and homages to lots of popular culture. Controls are responsive, intuitive and the game mechanics (even at higher difficulties) feel fair and well thought through. As you progress through the game you will earn xp and levels which allow you to customise your characters skills giving a large variety of gameplay styles.[/td]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td]Story[/td]\n    [td]9[/td]\n    [td]The story in Borderlands 2 is rich and engaging. The action is character driven, and while the main story is fairly linear, the open world nature of the game allows you to take a break from the main story arc and explorer the hundreds of characters and side missions that can be found all over Pandora. It also has one of the most badass, charasmatic and handsome villians of all time... [/td]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td]Replayability[/td]\n    [td]9[/td]\n    [td]So many reasons to replay this game. Firstly the story can be completed at least 3 times with the same character at increasing difficulty and xp levels (normal, true vault hunter and ultimate vault hunter) with progressively better rewards. There is so much detail in the story and so many optional missions that each play through feels different. Next you have at least 4 (more with DLC) characters each with their own skills, playstyle and story to explore. Finally you have tons of loot in the form of Guns, Shields, Grenades, Relics and Class Mods you can collect for your character. These increase in rarity from white (basic) to orange (legendary) generally the rarer the weapon the more damage it will do and many will have additional unique abilities (red text). [/td]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td]Multiplayer[/td]\n    [td]10[/td]\n    [td]For me, this game remains simply the best cooperative multiplayer experiences you can have. Your character's skills really augment and compliment each other when playing as a team. Enemy and mission difficulty automatically adjusts to the amount of players, requiring real teamwork and synergy to avoid dying at higher levels. The multiplayer allows you to connect (drop in and out midgame) to your steam friends games or to public games, connections for the most part feel quick and responsive even with 4 players and with only a small delay on audio communication. [/td]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td][h1]Overall[/h1][/td]\n    [td]9.5[/td]\n    [td]I can't recommend this game enough, while a minority of missions feel like you are just a glorified delivery boy, most are creative, funny and packed full of classic moments and great characters. So much fun to pick up and play with friends. - I haven't really mentioned the DLC (of which there is a lot) in this review but the main ones (Mr Torgue's, Captain Scarlett and especially Tiny Tina's) are all well worth getting (these are included in the Game of the Year edition), great fun to play and add loads more content to the game. To progress to the highest level in the game (level 72 +overpower levels) you will also need the ultimate vault hunter pack 2 so I would recommend that if you reach the end and still want more.

I do like that you can teleport to quest givers and mobs instead of the usual auto or manual run. Aside from that there isn't anything modern here.",

      "Fun Tower-Defense style indie game. Definitely one where your skill improves every time you die. And you will die, repeatedly. :P Expect to try out many monster combinations per floor before you find something that can delay the hordes of adventurers long enough to set up the floor beneath!

      "This game surprised me in how good it was. I had heard about it, like everyone, and also like a lot of people I had dismissed it as a watered-down Dark Souls clone with a Star Wars skin, and let it collect dust in my Steam collection.\n\nI was wrong. The game's combat is tight and polished, just the right difficulty on Normal. The movement, the general game feel, is superb. The game has a competent story with excellent characterizations, character arcs, dialogue, exposition, world-building, and pacing.  The music feels like top-shelf Star Wars without being a lazy copypasta of John Williams's score (though you'll hear sprinklings of familiar motifs throughout, of course). \n\nThere are collectibles (they are all cosmetics), but it's a tasteful, reasonable amount of them, and they are distributed in a way that feels fun instead of like a chore, and you're never pressured into collecting them with menus or reminders; they are entirely optional in both a technical and a psychological sense. I actually found it fun to collect new appearances in order to play dress-up \"Fashion Souls\". \n\nThere are bosses, and they are challenging but not frustrating. Definitely easier than Dark Souls's harder bosses like Ornstein or Artorias, but still tricky enough that it feels rewarding to overcome them.\n\nIf I had to describe this game in two words, it would be \"just right\". There is just the right amount of each little element that it feels fun, never tedious, never like a grind. I'm a jaded old man who has seen it all and who is not easy to entertain, and I found this game extremely refreshing. If you read this review during the sale where it's only 3.99 USD, get it immediately.",
      "PC version doesn't have rebindable controls for controller for some reason\n\nupdate: i have finished the game, still no rebindable controls, i can give a real review now. i wouldn't rate it negative but i wouldn't rate it positive either. this is a \"eh\" review.\n\nthe game is two games at once and neither of them are great.\n\n the roguelike part is like 20% of the game and is very simple and shallow, there's like 5 weapons and they all play the same, its also super easy. its ok but its not as good as a real roguelike.\n\n the cult building part is 80% of the game and is a bit more fun but past the earlygame its a bit eh too. choosing what you get doesn't really matter since you'll unlock everything pretty fast, and the doctrines 90% of the time are a choice between 2 useless things and 10% of the time a choice between a busted thing and a useless thing. the randomly generated quests the followers give you are just chores like revisiting old dungeons you already completed and the reward is pretty much nothing. its ok but its not as good as a real colony builder.\n\nnone of the systems in either part of the game are particularly deep.\n\nas of the time of this review, the game is still quite glitchy, though being patched by the devs.\n\nthe game is about 15 hours with side content and 18 hours for a completionist run. no real replayability \n\ni'd just recommend you get a full on action roguelike if you want to play a roguelike, or a full on colony builder if you want to play a colony builder. this game does both but is not great at either of them. \n\n game is very cute tho and the soundtrack is great. like 5/10",
      "WTF, this isn’t gaming! Where are my lootboxes and micro transactions?!\n\nMy main thought after I beat GRIS was, \"I don't really understand anything that just happened, but it sure was pretty.\"\n\nI was absolutely amazed how a game with zero actual dialogue could move me to tears, just on strenght of its visuals and music. In general, the whole theme of dealing with grief/depression spoke to me in a way that I didn't expect.  It's one of those games you play to \"feel\" more than for the gameplay itself.\n\nI have PTSD from dealing with my wife getting a boyfriend, and this game made me cry several times while playing it. Especially during the scene where you're swimming away from the eel. That symbolism to me perfectly captures the feeling of trauma recovery. I'd spent time finding the little lights throughout that section of the game and activating the turtle which ultimately saved me from my own darkness and helplessness.\n\nIt felt like hope. It was such a good representation of how the coping skills I'd learned and the hard work I'd put in were finally seeming to pay off. It's when you're at your weakest that you learn how strong you actually are. I cried like a baby during and after that scene. It made me realize how much I've actually overcome, and how grateful I am to be free.\n\nGris truly is a beautiful game and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a slow paced experience. The only bit of criticism I have for the game is it certainly gives \"not like the other girls\" vibes at times, but I think this is quite easy to get over.\n\nIn conclusion: the visuals are stunning,  the music is beautiful and knows exactly when to kick in, the platforming elements are fantastic, and it’s story and themes are spectacular without a single word. Truly a must-play.\n\n10/10",
      "This is a review about the port, not the game. The game itself is fantastic. I reference Moguri Mod throughout the review - this is a fan made mod that aims to improve the visual quality of the port.\n\nThe port is a lazy outdated mess:\n- It's lacking visual FX present in the original, such as the mist in the overworld of the Mist Continent. [b]This was fixed in a patch.[/b]\n- There is no way to restore the original font. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- Dialogue is rendered at a static pace, unlike the original. In the original game, lines of dialogue would show up on screen depending on how fast the character was talking. In this port, there is no distinction. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- There are multiple problems with the battle UI:\n-- It takes 40% of the screen. Square Enix patched this in the console versions, but the PC version was never patched. [b]This patch was released on PC in an update on the 6th of August 2020.[/b]\n-- It's rendered at what feels like 15fps, making navigation feel extremely clunky. In the original game, all menus were rendered at either 30fps interpolated or 60fps (don't know which one exactly), which made the browsing very fluid. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- All menus are clunky to browse because of the crippling low framerate. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- It's missing sound effects from the original. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- Despite porting the game to Unity, Square couldn't be bothered to re-write the animation code to speed up battle animations independently of buff/debuff tick timers, arguably the original game's biggest problem. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- The music in this port is a lower sample version of the original. [u]This is fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- The backgrounds clash horribly with the new character models. [u]This is fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n\nThe ONLY positive of this version is that you can skip the introduction to every battle. Except not really, because the option doesn't work half the time.\n\nThanks to the Moguri Mod, it is arguable that this version comes close to the original. Regardless of my opinion though, I'm not about to praise Square Enix for a port that the fans patched up. Moguri Mod is the only reason to buy this game on Steam.",
      "In all honesty, I became a little bored in the middle of playing it. It wasn't until I was almost through with the story that I realized why it had gotten such high ratings. You have no idea how hard it hit me when I realized why he was at the hospital [him being at the hospital is not a spoiler btw], and how relieved I was when he had at last found peace. It was in that moment that I had no regrets in purchasing it and how it was worth my time. Despite how brief the game was, I'm gonna remember it for a while. \n\n",

Sound design is good too.\n\n[b] Gameplay and progression: [/b]\nDrop into a planet, kill monsters, get money, buy items. Rinse and repeat until you become powerful to one shot God himself. Fast paced with constant running, jumping, sliding and juggling between primary weapon, secondary weapon, abilities and equipment. In each run the difficulty increases over time, which is an innovative approach to deal with difficulty. The roster is filled with unique characters who each have their own gameplay mechanics, making the game feel completely different. \nMost items can be obtained by completing specific challenges. You can also unlock game modifiers to make the game easier or more difficult to your liking. The challenges are one-of-a-kind, and the rewards are meaningful enough to keep players interested.\n\n[b] Game time: [/b]\nThere is no limit. It stops being fun when you decide so.\n\n[b] Online: [/b]\nThere is co-op to enjoy with friends and difficulty scales with the number of players. And if you have no friends, rest assured because all achievements are attainable through single player.\n\n[b] Bugs: [/b]\nNo bugs or technical issues.\n\n[b] PC Requirement: [/b] \nWithout a decently powerful PC the game faces severe lags and occasional crashes in long runs where you loop multiple times and a million things are happening in the background. Lowering graphical settings can help to an extent.\n\n[b] DLC: [/b]\nSurvivors of the Void DLC adds excellent new characters, stages, items,  enemies and alternate endings.\n\n[b] Price: [/b]\nWorth every penny.\n\n[b] My only problem with the game is it doesn’t have a save system. Once you start a run, you will have to see it through to the end. I want to be able to stop at any stage and continue from there later on. I don’t always have hours required to do multiple loops in one sitting. Although there is a mod for saving, I would love a native option. [/b]\n\n[b] Rating: [/b] \nThe Devs are continuously supporting and updating the game which is commendable. The community is very active and you can add tons of community made [b] mods [/b] to breathe new life into your game. \nI highly recommend it. [b] 10/10 [/b]",
      "Based on the generic, cartoonish-sounding name and (at first glance) Hearthstone-looking graphics, I initially ignored Monster Train. But I later read some praise for it that made me think it might be worth a look. Especially since it turned out that I already owned it from a bundle or something. \n\nAnd what I discovered was a compelling mix of the best elements of Slay the Spire and My Life as a Darklord. A run generally takes less than an hour, and with so many possible combinations there's always something new to explore and try to exploit.",
      "To be completely honest, throughout my entire playthrough, I was thinking on giving this game a \"Not Recommended\" but it really wouldn't have deserved it. This game is at the same time both very difficult to recommend as to not recommend. It is really a beatiful and extremely original game, with a pretty well told interesting story. However, the problem it has is that it doesn't really work as a puzzle game. Puzzle solutions don't make logical sense most of the time and you end up brute forcing your way through most of the game. This means trying every posibility until something works and moves the story foward, and this is just not good puzzle design. This also distracts you from the story being told, which is in itself not so easy to understand, it requirers you to be paying attention to details, so your brain has to be constantly switching between \"puzzle mode\" and \"story mode\". Anyway, you can tell a lot of love was put into this game, and that is why I ultimately recommend it.\n7.5/10-",
      "Read all the 10 negative reviews for the game, and not a single positive review is present. All the reviews are fairly accurate to what the game presents to its players. A tacky First-Person Shooter with bad FPS rates, mediocre animations and effects, as well as a cursor that is not even aligned to the target pointer. No comment on the goal, as it is either self-explanatory, or the audio and Sound effects, as it was nothing note-worthy.\n\nIn short, not a single pro is evident in this game, or in my experience during playing. By the end of it, I simply ran Tales of Destruction for the Trading Cards, then uninstalled, and proceeded to Hide from library.\n\nTales of Destruction is not worth a single cent, nor is it worth playing.",
      "Took me a while to play this because there were some critical bugs during release day, but the devs worked hard to fix everything up.\n\nNow, this is the premium version of Mad Father which is not just a straight re-release of the free version, but an upgraded one (in many ways, I'm told). Better graphics, better level design, better everything. It's a really tight experience without any filler and with an interesting story, so any fans of RPGMaker-type horror games will find this a highly enjoyable experience.\n\nYou can also increase the game's window size, so don't worry if you're running a high-resolution display. This is a feature that is not exactly common for these types of games, but this game has got you covered.\n\nI'm looking forward to future games from the dev!",
      "And that's it, after 278 hours of play, the adventure is over... \nThis type of game that you wish you could forget so you could rediscover it like the 1st time, where you discover everything, a bit like a child\nIt's a game made with passion for video games, to tell a story, to make the player laugh too, and to make him a little melancholic or horrified or even sickened sometimes\n\n[u]Divinity OS 2 will have marked my young adult life[/u], like Sonic and megadrive games, Pokémon, FFTactics, Zelda and gameboy / gamecube games, Warcraft3 (TT), or Mass Effect and other PC games did in my childhood and adolescence (I surely forget so much excellent games)\n\nIt's a 20/20 for me.

      "Overall the concept and idea of the game is good and I would recommend it. It is worth the price for the amount of fun time you can have with it.\n\nPositives:\n+ Initially the game gives you some good frights and tension\n+ Variety of characters, ethnics and aesthetics to pick and chose from\n+ Variety of skills and abilities that are mostly unique and some have good synergy\n+ Variety of maps\n+ DLC costs are fair\n+ Skin costs are fair\n+ One of very few companies who communicates with the community\n+ A lot of good license characters available\n+ The game has a tutorial that explains the basics\n+ Various ways to play the game (stealth / agressive)\n\nNegatives:\n- A few bugs here and there\n- Some really annoying perks / addons on killers / survivors like 1 shot long range axes (to name an example), keys and moris (to name a few more)\n- Toxic community - Not everyone is toxic but a large portion of players are but lets be real you get that in every game these days\n- Matchmaking is pretty bad (but DBD is trying to fix this)\n- Sometimes unfair hit detection - Some hits look like you are being smacked way out of range or as a killer you see the grab animation on a survivor and then it just cancels out\n- Steep learning curve / unforgiving gameplay.

      "EDIT:\nRobot Entertainment has decided to dump Gameforge as the EU publisher and publish the game themselves. I would like to applaud their decision. Better late (in this case quite late) than never. However, I will not change this review to recommended for the simple fact that they shouldn't have selected that publisher in the first place. This is what ultimately ruined the EU version of the game, and it should be a good example to any other developers who consider Gameforge as their publisher (although more are more developers are duming Gameforge nowadays). I am not going to edit any of the details below since I haven't played the game after I wrote the original review, but I will most certainly consider returning to the game after the migration of the servers is complete.\n\nHere's the original review:\nPart 1:\nHow To Kill A Potentially Good Game (For Dummies):\n- Make a potentially good game.\n- Give the publishing rights to Gameforge.\n- Done!\n\nI mean, let's take a look at some of the games that Gameforge ruined:\n- Aion EU (utterly dead)\n- Tera EU (completely dead)\n- Soldier Front 2 EU (a.k.a. \"S.K.I.L.L., although the only skill you need for that game is a wallet)\n- Raiderz EU (shut down)\n- Mythos (shut down)\n- Katsuro: Path of Honor (shut down)\n- Hellbreed (shut down)\n... the list goes on ...\n\nWhy would ANYONE in their right mind allow Gameforge to publish their game?! Gameforge is known as the WORST European publisher. No one does business with them anymore and they're close to filing for bankruptcy. They already closed their location in Berlin. Why would you do that, Robot Entertainment?\n\nIt could have been a great game...\n\nPart 2:\nSince some lovely folks commented that they would REALLY (real-time executive realness) want me to review the game itself, and not its publisher, here you go:\n\nPros:\n- Great voice acting. The way they went with it (overly sarcastic) could have ended up being cringy, like the one in Wildstar, but instead, they did a good job with it.\n- Good animations. The game feels like it's polished and well executed.\n- Short queues and loading screens.\n- Interesting tower defence gameplay (as far as the Survival mode goes).\n- Character development and a crafting system.\n- Runs great on a high-end laptop.\n\nCons:\n- Poorly optimized for computers that are supposed to be able to run the game on its minimal settings.\n- Gets quite repetitive quite fast.\n- Grinding for materials can be tedious.\n- The Siege mode needs a lot of work. It is nowhere near as polished as the Survival mode.\n- The Survival mode can be too short at the early levels.\n- The developer decided to give the game to the worst publisher in Europe, and probably even the world. I mean, even EA isn't that bad anymore. I guess Gameforge could compete against Webzen for the first place.\n- You are able to buy almost everything with real cash, and if you don't want to, you better prepare for a long grind.\n- Did I mention how stupid the decision to give the publishing rights to Gameforge was? I think I did, but oh well...\n- The game is basically a cash shop oriented version of OMD! 2.\n\nThere you go! You're welcome.\n\nP.S.: Needless to say, I won't be spending a dime on this game, as long as Failforge gets a cut. I encourage everyone to do the same. Robot Entertainment might get their heads out of their... (you got the point) and change the publisher before it's too late for the game.",
      "A Short Hike is a relaxing, casual game about exploring an expansive, mountainous island park and eventually making your way to its summit so you can get cell phone reception.\n\nYou play as Claire, a bird who can climb, glide, and flap to great heights using a stamina system based upon how many golden and silver feathers you’ve collected. Along the path to the mountaintop you’ll encounter Animal Crossing-style characters who are friendly, punny, and usually have some minor task for you to solve, ranging from finding lost items to making deliveries.\n\nHelping residents of the island is completely optional, as is just about every activity in the game other than locating a few feathers and reaching the summit; as a result, length can range from an hour if you don’t stop to smell the roses to a few hours if you decide to make friends with everyone and see all the park has to offer.\n\nActivities include filling out a fishing journal by trading in your catches, digging in suspicious spots, solving treasure map clues, parkour racing, and opening up shortcuts by breaking blocked entrances and watering bouncy flowers. \n\nA Short Hike has a charming aesthetic and a lovely, peaceful soundtrack. I felt driven to see everything the game had to offer despite not being forced into any of it and never lost interest until I did so. It’s a beautiful little world that will make fans of Animal Crossing feel right at home.",
      "Only one word to describe this game\n\nOutdated.\n\nThere is no real point to get this game unless you want a slightly better looking UI and atmosphere. L4D2 already contains the campaigns from L4D1 and is where the entire Left 4 Dead community is. Only a small playerbase still plays l4d1, mostly out of nostalgia. But there is quite literally no reason to get the game.\n\nYou can grab it if you are into achievements, but only do so when it goes on sale, i grabbed it for a couple penny, still a bad idea.",
      "[I received this product for free from a giveaway]. Only played for a short time, but sheesh, it's a bit of a mess both visually and gameplay wise. There's not much I can really say that would differ from what's shown in the trailer (rather crude MS-paint looking drawings with a few short looping backgrounds). You jump when moving right or left, flappy-bird esque, you dodge stuff going across the screen and from the top, which is a bit boring to me, but some may enjoy it more. You also have to go out of the screen to dodge sometimes, but also if you go too far out (who knows how far) you'll die as well. It might be an okay time waster for free (like old flash games), but I wouldn't recommend spending your money on this.",

We may forget Kaniza’s name, but we won’t forget yours. And thank you for being one of the funniest character in the game.",
      "Is Duskers a fun game? Yes. Would I recommend it? No, because of one simple reason:\n\nA lack of content with no mod support.\n\nDuskers is a little like No Man's Sky in the sense that the first few hours are filled with fun and wonder, but everything afterwards becomes a disappointment because the game turns out to be far more shallow than it initially seemed. As a player, I yearned to explore more of the randomly generated galaxy in Duskers because I wanted to see what other horrors, mods, and derelict types I would encounter in the empty universe - but in the end, it turned out that there was really very little else to see besides what you find in the first couple of hours. \n\nHere's a quick rundown of where the content was most lacking:\n\n--Enemy types: there's only 4 different enemies. FOUR. They also behave pretty much identically with the exception of the last one.  This was definitely the biggest interest-killer for me. \n\n--Derelict types end up mattering very little. Government A? Salvage C? Military B? It really doesn't change the layout in a particularly noticeable fashion, with the only differences being 1-2 extra ship defense turrets or something like that. \n\nI really, really wanted to give Duskers a thumbs up - I loved the aesthetic, I loved the atmosphere, and I loved the unique command line interface - but unfortunately, after a few hours, I came to realize that there's really just not enough actual content here, and that's heartbreaking for fans of this niche genre like myself.\n\n",
      "The Steam trailer really doesn't do this game justice.\n\nIts extremely early access right now, and the gameplay itself is nothing too spectacular (yet), but the super dynamic proximity chat is what really makes this game for me.\nHearing the muffled screams of someone getting choked out by a bug, followed shortly after by the panicked wails of another crewmember running for the life, is likely one of the funniest things I have ever experienced in a video game.\nIt truly is such a simple, yet infinitely expandable mechanic that I am really exited to see build upon in the future.\n\nPERSONAL IDEA IF THE DEVS READ THIS REVIEW:\nA monster that picks a target to stalk and follow silently. While stalking, the monster records whatever its target says, then, after it has stalked enough and kills it target, it turns from a hunter to an ambush predator.

      "As a current spec op who has seen conflict in China, North Korea and Dust II, it's clear to me this game is barely mil-sim YET much more than another arcade type shooter ala COD. Within the weapon systems selection, well I'd say its pretty sparse as are the clothing options but where this game shines is in the finite number of deaths one can suddenly have, somewhat similar to the amount of coronary artery blockages the average American can withstand before succumbing to a cheeto dust infused death ride to St. Michaels gate.\n\nGraphically it is fine, runs well on my beastly PC (which is to be expected given the salary i earn putting my life on the line daily), seems to have very few glitches/bugs.\n\nThe sounds are way off though and needs a revamp on what actually body dismemberment should actually be like.\n\nUltimately what makes this game worth it is the player based, often I find myself among enthusiastic Aussies calling me the roo rider and exclaiming how fast my fast twitch reflexes are.\n\n8.3/10",

      "Tentative review of game in progress, but so far it is amazing and I had to leave a review in support of it.  As far as the game itself goes, I'm giving it a 9/10.  As far as the port goes, the lack of keyboard input prompts seems frustrating when they already have the ability to change between xbox and ps4 buttons, but I use a controller and expect most will for this, but it's worth mentioning in the sake of fairness and accuracy.  There is a certain graphics setting called \"effects\" with high and low.  High is causing major fps drops under certain conditions even on a pc with an rtx 3080 and a 5800x cpu.  Devs have acknowledged it and are working on improving it.  Other than these issues though, no problems at all.  Online play has been smooth and i haven't experienced any disconnects.  The game itself has only crashed once in 93 hours, but that was also during excessive alt tabbing while the game was in true fullscreen mode, and it crashed on an alt-tab itself, so I'm not really blaming the game on that one given it was the only time.  Again, overall the game is playing great and I have no problems with it on a functional level as well as an entertainment level, I just want to be as fair and accurate as I can, and these were really the only problems I could find with it.",

      "Yeah sooooo I went 1k words past the max...had to pare this down...it's ok...I'm mentally stable...\n\nCrossCode is a top-notch indie in its genre. I'd mention it in the same breath as Celeste, Hades, and Outer Wilds. (guess I just did.) If you can at least enjoy both puzzles and real-time combat, this game is for you; it's not as much of a JRPG as it might look. The only real flaw I care to levy is that it isn’t incredible out of the gate; it’s merely good, and gets much better. I was going to summarize my reactions and add a \"what is the premise/gameplay loop\" section and have longer sections but I had to cut it all out so have _/5 ratings on the section titles instead. It's fine. I'm fine. Everything is fine.\n\nOk, review time.\n\nSTORY 4/5 NEATO\n\nThe story is great, and not quite what you might expect. It starts pretty light and cozy, with solid (and often meta) humor interspersed with cryptic moments. I like how casually the in-universe MMO is treated by the players. I enjoyed all the characters, including our mostly-mute but personable Lea. Once it ramps up, the story takes some exciting turns, too; the devs really know how to do drama without doing overdrama. I didn't relate too much to the story but I think it was told quite well. I like the portrayal of the antagonists for the most part, though I wish I could have felt their presence more often. The lore is also fascinating, if occasionally hard to grasp because the line between real and virtual is very thin due to the game’s particular premise. (The difference between real people and NPCs is sometimes unclear, for instance.) The ending was good, but I think the DLC epilogue wraps the game up far better.\n\nCOMBAT 5/5 WOWIE\n\nWhen you start out, combat feels almost hack-n-slashy. You can spam melee attacks and bullets for days, but you also have a charged projectile, a dodge-dash, and a shield. The elemental modes are absolutely the highlight due to the way enemies work, and the sort of limiter gauge they have forces strategy. Special moves are stylish and borderline absurd at higher levels. A huge skill tree controls them and much more; unlike some skill trees, this one requires choices, which is always a good sign. Oh and consumables are your main source of healing and buffs, and they aren't overpowered! Balancing win.\n\nThe enemies are really what make the combat fantastic. Almost every enemy has at least one gimmick and one visible weakness. The stun gauge mechanic is vital to all battles, forcing you to exploit those weaknesses to stun enemies and give you time to use your extra-long special moves. Bosses love to give you iterative micro-puzzles to fill their stun gauges, while minibosses are comfortably in-between. Bosses commonly have armor or invulnerability when not stunned, forcing even overleveled players to figure out the micro-puzzles to hit hard. (More great balancing.) Most weaknesses involve the element system, eventually encouraging you to swap elements multiple times mid-fight. The micro-puzzles will build on what you’ve been learning in a dungeon if it’s a dungeon fight. I'll mention that some normal enemies do feel like damage sponges at first, but you'll get used to this; the simple enemy design in the early game makes it seem worse than it is imo.\n\nPUZZLES 5/5 FUN COOL\n\nFor puzzles you've got your common environmental \"platforming\" puzzles, your specialized quest puzzles, your dynamic mini-puzzles in battles, and your iterative puzzling gauntlets in dungeons. Also almost everything is secretly part puzzle? Like, everything. They're an invasive species. They draw most of their complexity from the element system too. Each element has its own effects on certain objects and structures, and mainly you use charge shots to interact, though each attack has its own uses. Not much to say here; they're great puzzles. A couple may stump you for a while, but that's impossible to avoid, and I think CrossCode strikes a perfect challenge balance.\n\nQUESTS 5/5 WHEEEEEE\n\nWhile some quests conform to the typical hunting/gathering quests of MMOs, most boast some entirely unique content. Challenges range from unique bosses to puzzles to platforming to other familiar gimmicks that are secretly also puzzles. I won't spoil them. Quests generally use mechanics you have seen already in new, often very different, scenarios. NPCs are mostly there to be amusing or set up the gameplay, and that didn't bother me tbh.\n\nITEM MANAGEMENT 5/5 AAAAA\n\nItem and equipment acquisition? Engaging? WTF? Technically you get them like you do in any RPG. But, rare plants have high rare item drop rates, so if you know the platforming puzzle to reach em you don't have to waste much time. Enemies' drop rates rise with a high Combat Rank, which you get by killing many enemies in a row before the post-fight cooldown period ends and you get to heal to full and level up. This is tough until you're very comfortable with the area. Once you are, it's a whole new way of battling, using area knowledge to string together sequential fights. And what does the game do but give you a piece of upgradable equipment that grants the Combat Rating bonus to plants too?\n\nI actually cared about the equipment in the game too! *kisses Life Fiber Uniform* (yes they really make this reference) Equipment also matters more than level so the devs can control your power level better. Most times you can buy some basic equipment to explore, then return with items to trade to NPCs for stronger gear. Stronger gear has unique traits and you might prefer one over another, so it's nice that with trading you get to focus your resources on what you want. Sometimes you can trade some enemy drops for other ones, as I recall, which is a nice...uh, trade-off to get to make.\n\nQUALITY OF LIFE 5/5 HELP\n\nCONVENIENCE REIGNS in CrossCode. Text log like in visual novels? Check. Encyclopedia of story recaps, character summaries, CrossWorlds lore & terminology, etc.? Check. Enemy index? Check. Item drop rates? Check. Available trades? You beck. This is EXTREMELY helpful for an RPG, which otherwise would require a guide or plain luck to find rare item drops. Oh yeah also there's UI? I forgot about it cuz it's really good. Also the keyboard controls for swapping elements are a bit janky but I managed.\n\nAesthetics 3/5-5/5 SUBJECTIVITY WOOOOOO\n\nYeah if ya like what you see in the trailers and screenshots, that oughta be enough. I thought the art was average-good in the beginning, but like everything else the art improves as you go. They must’ve gone back and worked on old stuff, but not too much. The music is great. No complaints there. My one objective critique is, Lea has no depth perception -- the art makes similar-height platforms look identical. I ran into so many walls and stared at so many small flat gaps I thought I couldn't cross. I'm not a fool! It's the game's fault! But actually this time!\n\nA NEW HOME DLC 6/5 WTF OMG\n\nThe paid DLC is The Culmination of CrossCode. The epilogue is complex and fascinating and rewarding. The dungeon is an incredible all-elements send-off. I adore the new quests. And the art?? The environments, the enemies, the NPC portraits are all so pretty. Don't be fooled by the letters \"DLC\": this is not Discretionary Leisure Content. If you liked the base game, this is...Deluxe...eLite...C-content??? look these are not great letters to work with ok\n\nCONCDLUDSIONO\n\nWhat else to say? CrossCode good. Buy it. Do the thing. Also, look out for Project Terra, Radical Fish's next project. It translates their current style into a 3D environment with dynamic lighting. It’s pretty & it reduces that height perspective issue. There isn’t much info about it out yet, but keep your eyes out! (figuratively pls) I'm excited for what they'll come up with.\n\nHOLY **** I MADE IT AND WITH CHARACTERS TO SPARE YESSSS — ohnowai",
      "When I show new games to one of my friends she always asks if it is possible to pee in the game and sadly I usually must tell her that it isnt possible because there is so few games where this special detail is being paid attention to. But this here my dude! I tried to show her the game yesterday so I got her setup on the valve index and start the game all good, but we couldn’t move at all... We tried everything! We tried physically move in our vr room to see the boards that had text written on them because we spawned behind them which I found a little weird as well. On the board it said eat the hamburger to start the game or eat the poo to guit. I saw a box on the street and I remembered by seeing the trailer there was a box where inside there was a burger so immediately we worked hard to try and reach the burger so we could start the game. It was too far away for us to try and actually in real life walk to it so we had to just accept defeat. She didn’t get to see her first vr game where it would be possible to urinate. I saw a update post a few minutes ago where you were saying something about movemnet in the game that you have to grip and throw arms around or something? This I guess we didn’t try since usually moving is one of the triggers to teleport or just the stick like in any controller. Today we will try again and hopefully succeed in our task to urinate in a vr game! You could be making history today my friend. And for all the bad reviews for this game I want to just say a couple things: cmon dude. Its one guy whos making this game! It is cheap and early access... those already tell you a lot about the game and you should not expect a triple a title and the experience of the century. I went through a video game making school or whatever which took 3 years so it was not 2 weeks online course I just quit after the first week so I actually know a lot what it takes to make games and with this I can tell there has been some hours used to it, but again it’s only one dude. My game didn’t work either, but it might have been because we didn’t know how to play. I’m not complaining for 4 dollars, I’m not a hobo ;)\n\nEDIT: And there it is! A day after my review and a 170mb update with new features and a fix for not been able to play at all :) I wasn't able to walk earlier either, but I suppose yo may not be able to in the \"mainmenu\". Gotta go try the update once my friend visits again!",
      "Early Access Review:\nPros: \n- Hilarious flavor text in the form of Books and Proverbs. Seriously, someone took a lot of time creating all that.\n- Really enjoyable music\n- Beautiful pixel art\n- Engaging and interesting story\n- Overall very fun introduction to a huge world\n- Highly responsive dev team that's not only advacing on completion of the game but actively listens to their already large community of players\n- There's a lot of secrets and things to do that you might run out of time to do before the end of the year deadline. You may find yourself needing to play the early access a few times to find everything.\n\nCons:\n- This is early access folks, there's going to be a few bugs here and there\n- The early access content ramps up really fast and gets very interesting and then ends with you really wanting to know what's next. This is really only a con because I'm really impatient and want the full game asap. ;)",
      "So this game was very fun to play with my friend... that is until it began to stop working on starting the game i have looked at the ubisoft forums and guess what many other people have had this problem starting from the games release and ubisoft has done nothing to fix this problem. i got off easy i paid $20 for this game on sale the people who payed $60+ not so lucky so dont risk it and DONT by this ubishit game",
      "Homeworld is typically known as the very first 3D RTS -- despite this distinguishing trait, it's not very popular. It's rather obscure, which I find odd for a game that was made with so much love and detail. The story of the two Homeworld campaigns is very nice, the aesthetic of the game is excellent in my opinion, but when it comes to the multiplayer, in vanilla 2.1 Homeworld, the current version, you will face severe balancing issues between the races.\nFortunately, the community has come up with a solution, one that took a lot of time and effort to be. Thanks to them, the multiplayer is now playable with the patch that they made -- the 2.3 players patch. It's still being updated and is worked on by people who understand the overall concept of the game and the genre it belongs to.\nIt's available to everyone in the workshop and is in my opinion (and a lot of others's) the best way to experience both multiplayer and the game itself.",

And much like SOTC This game is a visual delight not all the visual feel pointless or feel to in your face no all of it is PURE atmosphere and really enhances the experience when exploring the many levels in the game. The game's ability to tell a very deep story visually without any dialog or exposition to undermine the player is absolutely brilliant. the game be very diffult the first time playing but feels rewarding after you level up Ori as you continue to fight bad guys.\n\n My rating is 10/10\n A stunning game with a compelling storyline that worth every penny",
      "[h1]Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Save scumming is a game-play mechanic and the game is balanced around the player being able to quick-save and reload whenever they want.\n[*] The game seems highly objective oriented, and I wish there was more optional treasures to collect, as I am a pirate.\n[*] While many guard situations appear to have a clear solution,  you can always just brute-force your way through or take another less contrived route, so the game doesn't devolve into a stealth puzzle game.\n[*] Post-game summary shows your route and enemy eliminations at hyper speed, and is always a fun watch at the end of a level.\n[/list]\nI really enjoy finally having a top-down style stealth game. Games such as Hard West and Divinity: Original Sin 2 also featured stealth elements but they were sorely lacking in favor of the turn based combat of the game.

      "[i]While the artwork and combat remain enjoyable, the story, writing, and pacing were a major letdown.[/i]  \n\n***\nMINOR SPOILERS BELOW. If you're going to play the game, play before reading.\n***\n\n[b]The mature storylines, hard-hitting decisions, beautiful worldbuilding, and tight writing that made the first two so immersive is not present in this game.[/b] (You'll notice immediately that the writing for the caravan in the capital is [i]particular[/i] trite, awkward to read, and uninteresting.)\n\nUnfortunately, it's not just the writing that's weak. [i]The pacing is off.[/i] Antecedents are confusing, characters you'd expect to speak don't, events that should have been foreshadowed come out of nowhere. More frustrating are the serious character continuity \"errors,\" and arcs that disappear, change, or go nowhere. [i]In short, the events, decisions, and conflict from the previous games do not appear or resolve in a way that was suggested by the previous two[/i].\n\n\nHere's one example. In Banner Saga 2, Fosolt is unexpectedly rescued by Bolverk. [i]\"I have a message for Alette from the dead varl king,\" [/i]he said. That's pretty intriuging! Maybe there's a mystery, an oracle, an item, or just cool information about the Varl and their strange king? Maybe there'll finally be context about the bridge decision!\n\n[i]No! He has nothing interesting to say or add, and then his storyline just gets dropped and forgotten.[/i]\n\nWell, Bolverk's been possessed by Bellower! Gosh, who knows what Bellower will say? In fact, I can't wait to find out what happens to Bellower's body! \n\nWell, actually, Bolver's [i]not[/i] possessed, not really, certainly not like it was implied last game, and Bellower's body -- [i]a primary focus of the first two games[/i] -- isn't mentioned [i]once[/i]\n\nOr how about how they casually mention that Eyvyn is not only the [i]head[/i] of the Valka order, but also that he's had periodic bursts of hereditary madness all along? That's... odd. And it's not presented as an well-thought out [i]reveal[/i] or anything. It's presented matter-of-factly, like they were trying to ret-con in a less interesting story, or were tone deaf.\n\nYou'll notice that all the characters are underutilized and have unfulfilled storylines/tensions. Hakon has hard choices to make; Canary's a little crazy; Yrsa is mysterious; Gil's in love with Alette, etc. Will these build into choices? Reveals? Dependent endings based on choices? Will there be discussions referencing the past? Reflections on travels? Hints of despair?\n\nNo. In mine, Gil was [i]murdered[/i] and no one even bothered to reference it. Canary's situation never comes to a head. You never have to choose between Varls and Humans. Murdering people doesn't make people threaten to leave. Ubin returns randomly as an uber Varl and he's... learned the horseborne's language? Travelled the southlands? In like, a month? In a way that doesn't advance the plot? It's just... weakly done.\n\n\nThere are [i]so many[/i] examples like this, where the stories don't quite fit correctly, where what you picked up on in the early games about the [i]mysteries[/i] and the [i]world[/i] and what made it a [i]vibrant[/i] place were forgotten about by the writers. [b]The result is that it the game plays out in unsatisfying ways, in tenseless scenarios made vapid by watered-down morality, an inability to leverage the situation in fun ways, and low-quality writing, paucity of choice-making, a lack of exploration, lack of plot twists, simplified overworld mechanics -- all culminating in an almost staggeringly one-dimensional and shallow ending.[/b]\n\nThe Banner Saga series was always an experience that was greater than the sum of its part. An [i]experience[/i]. Of being [i]riveted[/i] to the computer, checking the map, worrying over supplies, guessing at mysteries, having my breath taken away at each hill. Unfortunately, that's not the case in this game. \n\n\nGameplay-wise, it's also a bit of a letdown. Combat is fun-ish, but you can make invincible character combinations and the mechanics don't even try to deal with this. There's an interesting new reinforcement mechanic that's not used heavily, and never pushes you like you think the end of the world would. You never really have to split up your forces. There's no novelty. Like maybe using a hero in a battle makes them fatigued, so you have to switch them up? Maybe you can station them different places, making them unusable for combat? Maybe you need to choose eight for a secret mission caravan? Maybe dream sequences? No, nothing like that. \n\nThe overworld gameplay had some changes that never really felt significant. Moreover, quite a bit felt taken away. You can't rest, do training missions, no longer weigh food vs upgrades. One example of all thise tone deafness was Iver's march through the destroyed world was consistently at \"Great Morale!\"\n\nThere didn't seem to be many flavor choices (\"Do we hang the criminals or let them join us?\"), including much less on social themes (\"Should women fight, if it disturbs the traditionally-minded men?\" \"One clan's rowdy, what do we do?\" \"They threaten to leave if so and so isn't banished\"), and less delayed results and fewer significant decisions, including among the game's built-up tensions among the factions. \n\n\nThere's also some cases of development [i]feeling[/i] cheap. Remember opening Banner Saga 2, and feeling that it was [i]fresh[/i], and [i]upgraded[/i]? There's little to make you feel that way here. The artwork is okay, but the environments feel more generic, with less variety, and the surreal landscapes in the darkness aren't especially interesting to look at for long periods of time. Iver is voiced by Bolverk's voice actor, and they sound exactly the same. The new title system is a fun idea, but is visually integrated into the game's menu system with the finesse of a cheap mod. \n\nThere's a moment in the game where the screen goes black for scrolling text and voiceover narration explaining the upcoming mechanic. Um, a character can't explain that? It was similar how the many two second animations are used, not to supplement the story, but to [i]replace[/i] written portions, making you feel unsure about what's going on. And finally, the game's pretty short, without fun combat challenges or interesting newgame+ challenges. \n\n\nWhat's [i]particularly[/i] frustrating is that the game's release date was moved forward four months. I don't know the story why, but I do know that a few more months of polish and story embellishment might have delivered the beautiful, grippingly interactive story we were hoping for. Because this is a watered down version of the previous two in just about every way.\n\nThis negative review is for whatever processes lead to this mediocre finale.\n\n---\n\n[i]Here's a plot that would have made more sense. Zephyr arrives and speaks to you secretly. There's a god that's still alive! Neat, now we'll finally get more story on that. Yay, fun caravan mode, now we need to take longships somewhere interesting!\n\nBut uh-oh! There's a Sundr villain going there as well, with an army of dredge! But at least now we'll finally get more story about the Sundr! \n\nThe god reveals something interesting, talks about Juno, the sun, gives a means to protect the city and help Iver. But when you return to the city, now the king and rugga and the factions have devolved into fighting based on your choices. How are you going to handle this? Which of many possibilities will ascend to the throne? How will you defend the city? And what mystery lies beneath the mountain of the city...\n\nFor Iver's caravan, there should be pockets of dredge villages kept alive by Spellsingers. Now you need to decide to plunder them or not! More stuff to do! Maybe go to the remains of the Varl capital first? Fight warped Valka? Realize deceptions, machinations, corruption, hear stories? Find new characters, have old ones die?\n\nInstead there... wasn't a plot?[/i]",

      "Know your History: \n\nMany of you will already know this, but this game has ties much deeper than you think. It's no secret that Bethesda's Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim had extended it's life through an extensive modding community. For decades, literally, ENBs, shaders, textures, companions, and even story-lines added THOUSANDS of hours to an already sizable game. One story-line mod was called \"The Forgotten City\".  Over the next few years since it's release, the mod had acquired awards such as the 2016 Australian Writers' Guild Award, Zero Period Top 5 Quest Mods of 2015, and others. It was an astounding mod that threw the dragon born into a deeply profound, well written, and engaging story. It was a staple for my personal mod list for years. I've played the Skyrim version countless times, but as soon as I saw this release I immediately bought this and booted it up. \nObviously this is nothing like the mod, both visually or engine wise, but the spirit of the game is still there. It's more defined, expanded, and developed. It deserves every award and accolade it's received. When I walked into the opening scene and fell down the tunnel I couldn't help but shake my head and smile as a wave of nostalgia mixed with new expectations flooded my mind:\n\n\"My god, they've done it.\" \n\nHere's to you, Modern Storyteller, all the best and more to come!",

After all, it has to be ready for take-off in order for children everywhere to receive their presents on schedule. But a wicked troll blasts us out of the sky just as the test drive is about to end. He went over the line and wants to ruin Christmas for everyone on Earth. It is up to us to bring the troll to his senses and save Christmas for everyone.\n\nTLoS brings players to one world and six levels of great platforming that are reminiscent of Super Mario World (SNES) but simplified. There are only six levels total, one of which is a castle, before the final battle with the troll. The only difference is that we will be collecting chocolate cookies rather than the traditional yellow coins. We also lose part of our cloak when we are injured, so it's not uncommon for you to find yourself jumping through the levels wearing nothing but red boxer shorts. For instance, red blocks can give you a new coat, which means extra life, or Santa socks and hats, which give a power-up or simply chocolate cookies. The power-up allows you to throw stones as if you had collected the Fire Flower from Super Mario, and that's about it. TLoS also offers a 2-4 co-op player mode, in which players will be able to work together to complete this short and family-friendly adventure.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3009359595\n\nSimilar to Super Mario World, you walk to a level to choose them in the Overworld. Once we reach a certain level, we are allowed to walk, leap, and even sprint. Additionally, there are other indications on the screen that show you how many cookies you have already gathered and how much time is remaining to finish the level. We get an extra life when 100 cookies are collected. We can activate a checkpoint about halfway through the level to pick up exactly where the checkpoint was reached, instead of having to do the entire level all over again. The game also features side-scrolling and underwater levels. The only problem is that if you quit at level three, close the game and start again, you have to start from level one, so you have to play the game in one go. This means that there are no save points or \"save states\". Considering the length of the game, this is not a big deal, but it's still \"annoying\".\n\n[h3] My Specs [/h3]\n\n[code]CPU: i9 9900k\nGPU: RTX 2080 Ti\nRAM: DDR4 32 GB RAM\nOS: Win10\nResolution: 1440p @144hz\n[/code]\n\n[h3] Conclusion [/h3]\n\nWe are all hoping that Nintendo will release their IPs on Steam so that we can play with them one more time. We may all agree, based on experience, that this is probably never going to happen, but Indie developers are there to make it happen. To avoid the tedious teachings at school, you used to be able to play these types of games in class on the usual Flash Player websites, and now you can play them on Steam. Though it's not a masterpiece, it's extremely minimalistic, and it's unquestionably too short, the 20 minutes I spent playing it were nevertheless a lot of fun, especially because the platforming is accurate and not wonky at all. Just remember, it's very minimalistic and may be too minimalistic for some, but if that doesn't bother you, feel free to go ahead and try it out.\n\nIt would be my personal highlight if there were additional levels, more secret exits, more power-up alternatives, and more hours of overall playtime.\n\n[h2] Final Verdict: 8/10 A typical gas station snack that turns out to be a surprisingly good one.🎅 [/h2]",
      "After sailing around for an hour or so, killing some huge crabs and collecting some reports from new islands I had discovered, I was running low on fuel and supplies. The game reminded me of this with a prompt titled \"Desperate Measures,\" so I was left with little choices on the matter.\n\n I tried to use my last two boxes of supplies in a vain attempt to desperately scrape together some fuel so I could reach the port of Fallen London -- I failed. Now I was faced with the problem of starvation, on top of the whole fuel fiasco. \n\n  Fear was setting in, as was hunger, fuel was low, as was hope, so I decided to beseech the gods of the Unter-Zee for help, and help they did. I was, for lack of a better word, teleported to some kind of temple dedicated to the gods, and that was where things went from bad to worse. \n  \n   This temple couldn't be further away from Fallen London, and therefore aid, than I could have gotten on my own. So I decided to beseech the gods again, this time my pleading went unanswered, a cruel cold-shoulder delivered to an ingrateful neophyte. The only purpose my inane begging to a higher power served was to unsettle my crew and drive us all to the brink of sanity.\n\nSo I abandoned ship and we all died, lol. 11/10.",
      "Absolutely dated graphics that make visibility in this game a total exercise for your eyes, enemies and teammates blend into the background and scenery constantly, friendly markers everywhere obstructing your vision, insanely fast TTK with frustrating bleed mechanics...\n\nAnd the list goes on, it's beyond me how this game is being called a better one than Battlefield, are we even playing the same game at all? This game made me go back playing Battlefield 3. If you want to play a better game than 2042, play any of the others. BF3, BF4, BF1 or even 5, but please, stop shilling games like this and trying to justify it with the price and how many worked on it, this game is not even close to being better than a battlefield game at all",
      "Wow! Let me start by saying that for the last year, I worked in what could be called a high tech arcade. We featured a number of VR stations there, and I watched people playing Beast Pets that entire time. I ended up leaving the arcade before being able to try the game (the stations were only on when customers came in, which is when I left for the day), but since I had watched enough people try it, I felt like I had a pretty good grasp of the gameplay -- cute and light. When I saw it hit the Steam store, I was curious to finally play it. I'm more of an FPS/RPG kind of gamer, so I wasn't sure how much I'd be playing it. Well...it's really fun!! There's an immersive aspect to interacting with little AI's in VR that completely changes the experience. For example, while playing Skyrim, you get to have little companions. You interact with them a bit, they follow you around, and that's basically it. But when you're in VR, it actually feels the same as when I'm playing with my puppies. These little guys can fetch, follow a laser, and interact with the environment. There are places for you to explore, and each location offers something unique for the dragons (and you) to play with. And speaking of the environments, they're really pretty! The art style is low-poly, and it works perfectly to create ambiance while allowing you to interact with your new pets. The creators came up with some really clever conventions for interaction that make the experience smooth and hassle-free. This game is great for everyone, and I promise you it's absolutely worth your time.",
      "lmao they made tetris into a full blown religious experience",
      "Oh boy. This is a beautiful game. There's unlockable items, a hidden boss, lots of enemies, and characters that change your play styles. Numerous ways to make the game accessible for you!\n\nBut is the game fun? I'd say no, the game was just ok. I wasn't really solving puzzles so much dealing with a RNG generator. Ironically the bosses felt slower and more boring than the levels, they are a battle of patience, wait until the potions fall - hit them 3 or 4 times - repeat.\n\nWould I revisit this game after some patches or dlc? No, probably not. Unfortunately I think this game has some base design problems and not content or quality problems.",
      "It's horrible. It's annoying to play, it freaks you out, it insults you relentlessly. Yeah, of course I'm recommending it, why do you ask?\n\nWill You Snail is what it says it is. A platformer with traps popping on your predicted path with some meta plot and an evil AI commenting on your actions, mostly with clever insults. But it's also a little more than that, mainly due to the quality of its elements - so the game becomes more than the sum of its parts.\n\nYou're probably wondering about the difficulty. Well, good news: there are four settings, and by default they change depending on your performance. You struggle with the level too much? It's lowered. You beat it on the first few tries? It goes up. All with a (not) nice comment from Squid, the antagonist. I personally found the design annoying rather than actually challenging, but I'm quite sure that's intentional. The game's got it all: conveyor belts (that randomly change direction), underwater currents, perfectly timed spikes falling on your head, blocks that cave in on you after you break them. PhD in twatologist design. Due to the ever-shifting nature of the levels, I wouldn't even call this game a precision platformer - it's not about learning the level, but about adaptation. Luckily, the platforming segments are only one part of the game and there's some downtime between them, with optional (but fun) puzzles.\n\nOh, and for reference: I played mostly on difficulty 3 out of 4, sometimes dropping to 2 and rose to 4 towards the end. I found it roughly as difficult as Ori and the Blind Forest's latter sections, harder than Celeste ignoring strawberries, and easier than Garlic.\n\nLet's talk about Squid, the antagonist. The misanthropic, fatalistic, super-intelligent AI trope is pretty old at this point - but Squid is a very good refinement of that trope. It feels like he's really insulting you - the player - not the player character, like GLaDOS did. Mainly because he really reacts to the exact things that you do. You died just before the end? He'll point that out. You keep dying in one spot? He'll let you have it. You died to a spike? Comments about hitting your head incoming. Ran into a bomb? He'll tell you not to collect them. And so on. There so many lines, I never, ever, not once ran into a duplicate. That really makes him feel like a living, breathing person, not an NPC. I mean, he's not living and breathing... you know what I mean.\n\nOn that topic: if you've watched the trailer, you've probably noticed that Squid speaks with a non-native accent. That's because he's voiced by the dev, who's German; and indeed the general writing has this sardonic, matter-of-fact yet earnest quality that will be familiar to you if you know the German style of communication. No, no angry screaming, that's not how Germans talk. Stop watching WW2 speeches and watch some Staplerfahrer Klaus instead.\n\nAnd finally, there's the story. It's a bit meta, no surprises there. I won't write too much about it because I don't want to spoil it. Let's just say that it leaves many things out, but gives you just enough info to fill in the blanks. It's rather suspenseful; more importantly, it slowly builds up to... cosmic horror? Existential terror? Perhaps both. Also, it has a very clear message, delivered quite convincingly. Up to you to decide what to do with it.\n\nOverall, Will You Snail is pretty good. I don't think it's as flawless as many reviews make it out to be; the annoying design is still annoying in the end, even if it's thematically correct. Also, the music relies a little too much on the central leitmotif of the game, and it simply doesn't have the grace and variety to pull it off like Toby Fox did with UNDERTALE's soundtrack. Still; those little things aren't enough to wear down the emotional feast presented by this game. I'd say \"Guten appetit\" to this fine escargot meal, but in this case, we are the snails. Enjoy!\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42922988]Curator page[/url]",
      "After completing every ending, completing the map, and 98%-ing my save file (I'm not going to hunt down whatever miniscule thing is left), I can sum up all my thoughts on the game with one word: Disappointing.\n\nTo go more indepth, as a standalone game, Blasphemous 2 was alright at most. But compared to the first it feels bland and boring in a number of ways. The few NPCs you see are forgettable, the bosses are forgettable, every enemy feels the exact same. \n\nThe executions, which felt like such a large part of the charm of Blasphemous 1's combat, are practically gone- not only do they happen much less often but there's almost no uniqueness to them, with nearly every enemy having the same animation. While in B1 there were 16 different executions (18/19 if you count certain bosses), B2 has.. 4 or 5 different executions? \n\nIt feels like they give no depth to anyone you meet, friend or foe, nearly all of them being left a complete mystery with not even a single sentence talking about who or what they are. Even the Penitent One feels bland, having gone from a brutal, unstoppable force hell-bent on reaching his goal no matter what, to some unremarkable silent protagonist who kills some things.\n\nThe world and its areas felt boring, less like an actual world and more like a jumble of random locations stacked like tetris blocks. The way the enemies were tossed into them makes them feel like they were all pre-made assets and they had to think of where they fit best, and the result was almost none of them fitting in with where you see them.\n\nEverything felt far too easy, far beyond the point of getting used to the gameplay and learning from the first game. Bosses especially were disappointing, all having too little health, and it felt like only a single boss in the entire game had more than three attacks. \n\nThe rewards for quests and secrets were unfulfilling and unsatisfying, whether it was giving a character an item that was obviously meant for them or slowly searching across every little corner of the whole map for tiny secrets you missed. \n\nThe endings especially were a huge disappointment, and they made it feel like everything leading up to them was entirely a waste of time and effort and took away what little enjoyment was left.\n\nEverything about Blasphemous 1 that made it unique- the worldbuilding, the gameplay, the artstyle and animations- feels like it's all been stripped away and we were left with this generic metroidvania that only vaguely resembles its predecessor.\n\nI [b]loved[/b] Blasphemous, it was and still is one of my all time favourite games, but I really can't say I liked Blasphemous 2. If you loved Blasphemous 1 I would honestly advise against playing this, the whole experience is such a letdown that it's hard to not have the first game spoiled simply by what comes after it. If you don't care, or you haven't played the first yet, then at the very least wait until there's a good sale before trying.",

Rowling, at a time far before Harry & friends were even born. You’ll play as a fifth year student in the titular magics academy, admitted this late because of unspecified ‘special circumstances’. The virtual rendition of Rowling’s works is nothing short of exceptional, with not only Hogwarts itself, but also its environs (like the town of Hogsmeade or the dangerous Forbidden Forest), all recreated faithfully and down to the most minute details. Of course, some things will differ from movies and books, with the game being set in the 1800s. \n\nThe main story follows the classic ‘manifest destiny’ archetype, where your custom-made character will discover hidden potential that ties them to a greater purpose. Despite some genuinely memorable characters and some interesting side- and main-quests, the overall narrative can’t help but fall a little flat and stale, especially towards the ending phases. Nonetheless, many enjoyable adventures await you. Notably, there are no romance or love/hate dichotomies in the relationships you have with side-characters, as your choices will always end up in pretty much the same results during questlines.\n\n[h3]Exploration, Collectibles & Secrets[/h3]\nThe world is vast and visually magnificent, peppered to no-end with points of interest that often hold collectibles, currency or other utilities. Initially on foot, and later on with the iconic enchanted brooms and even flying magical creatures, you’ll be able to explore at leisure and clear the enormous amount of side-activities. A good portion of these, however, will prove inaccessible until you gain the right spells or abilities, in a sort-of ‘metroidvania’ fashion that promotes meaningful backtracking. Fast travel and an item-highlighting spell prove invaluable in saving time while exploring. Collectibles are mostly cosmetic, enabling the customization of both your wizard and your own private room once you unlock it, to suit various styles. \n\nMost dungeons and locations have additional puzzles or hidden paths that often lead to collectibles or extra resources; exploration feels rewarding, with a genuine sense of mystery surrounding each new point of interest you’ll find. Despite that, most dungeons and locations play out in the same way, and become repetitive in the long haul.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2933385898\n\n[h3]Combat System & Bosses[/h3]\nMagical battles use spells as sole means of offense and defense. Usually against multiple enemies at once, sometimes supported by allied NPCs, you’ll have to time your protection spell right in order to deflect incoming attacks, or dodge-roll away in case of unblockable ones. Enemies are varied and range from magical creatures to dark wizards and goblin soldiers, to name a few. Some of them may be weak to specific charms, others have shields you can break by using specific spell categories (damage, utility, movement) or other special abilities, like immunity to certain effects. \n\nCombat feels engaging, well-paced and is more than a little gory for this universe’s standards, death will be far more common than in the movies or books. The way you can combine spell effects to your advantage and use the environment further adds to the base system, while the amount of passive upgrades with item traits and spell-related talents you can gain progressively add another layer of depth. In late-game however you’ll become overpowered between potions, passive traits, talents and endgame spells - so much that supposedly fearsome dark wizards will prove little more than a nuisance due to power creep.\n\n[h3]Quests, Minigames & Challenges[/h3]\nQuests usually involve retrieving something, talking to a specific NPC, solving a treasure hunt based on visual clues, getting the solution to logic-based puzzles and more, depending on the case. While some side-quests are unique and memorable, most will be fetch chores or dry open-world shenanigans that you’ll have to repeat over and over in the same fashion. Less, but more meaningful and unique quests would have been better than this bloat, for sure. \n\nChallenges are paramount in unlocking unique bonuses like increased inventory capacity, many cosmetics, and even unique passive upgrades to equip in gear pieces. They often require you to slay X of a specific enemy, finish X of the same activity, and such “long-term” goals. Some of them are a massive grind and will only give you the 25th pair of gloves you don’t need, or other cosmetics that aren’t worth the effort.",
      "I'm 17 years old. I'm sitting in front of my Pentium II PC and I've just finished installing Baldur's Gate. I've crafted my perfect character, and I'm now adventuring through a gorgeous world. I've fallen headfirst into the game reading novels worth of text and not noticing as hours melt away.\n\nIt's 17 years later. I'm 34 years old. I'm doing it all over again and it's like I'm travelling through time.\n\nEvery aspect of this game is perfect. I wouldn't change it even if I could. I find myself wondering how in-game mechanics work and I'm tempted to alt+tab and google what spell is best. Instead I just keep playing and figure it out myself. I can't even *remember* the last time I didn't look up this sort of info in a game. Who cares if this sword does a little more damage than that spear? My character likes that spear and he looks awesome wielding it.\n\nThis is the first Kickstarter decision I've made that I am completely happy with. Thanks Obsidian for taking me back in time and reminding me that you don't need gamefaqs to enjoy a game.",

      "[h1] Look at my hours real quick. That's about. 4 hours? [/h1]\n\nFallout 76 is boring. There's no other way to put it. The Core objective of Fallout 76 was to gear the Fallout 4 engine for multiplayer. They succeeded! The art is visually amazing, even down to the 2D art shown all over this store page, so what's wrong?\n\nConsider who's still playing this game. Who's desperate enough to play this game? Well, It's not a lot of people. And they aren't very good people. It's just people. Existing. I had 0 conversations during my 4 hours. \n\nLets talk playing. The game is boring. Since I just mentioned the objective, lets talk about the NPC's ETC. [b] I got this game for free, I cannot emphasize how little this game means to me. It's terrible. [/b] The NPC's & story were not part of core development therefore the game suffers. You get stuck doing some quests you don't care about and play a game you'd rather not play. The NPC's are essential as expected so, you cannot kill them either. \n\nMicrotransactions Via Atomic Shop & Premium plague the game [i] but lets talk about more! [/i] There's free events like a crate dropping & player trading outposts. Wanna know what's wrong here? The game boils down to, find a player trading outpost and buy sh*t, or just dropping crates? well the crates are full of nothing. the games gear-towards premium really gives you nothing in terms of loot so you're playing what is a hollow, unfinished, boring, game. Even in 2021! \n\nCreatures & enemies are cool however there's a big issue of the game not being cool. You may say its worth it to play just to engage the wild-life but even they feel soul-less and void of life. I don't know how you make a game so devoid of soul really. I've met mannequins with more personality than anything I met in Fallout 76. \n\nThe world isn't interesting, it's a barren void forestry area. Sometimes you get a tiny bit of quest, however aside from this game being a complete and utter lore-destroyer for those interested, what it does leave is not good enough to compensate for all of the cons. Honestly, if this was a mod for 4, I'd feel better. But even when getting this for free, I feel scammed.\n\n[b] I'll end this by repeating my hours. 4. At no point was I excited. Enthralled. Interested. I sat for 4 hours, wanting to tear my hair out and scream, because I was so bored. I had tests in school, more interesting than this. The entire 4 hours I spent playing, I wish I had played anything else, & I got this for free! I genuinely wish you the best of help if you end up buying this game. It's horrific. [/b]",
      "I have never cried so damn much at a game",
      "I play 100+ puzzle games every year and this is likely my favourite release of 2020.\n\nDraknek and his team have truly advanced the state of the art in how the game's world is put together and how exploration and puzzle-solving are interconnected. There is no other puzzle game that does quite what this one does in terms of the interaction between mechanics design, navigation, and secret-finding. It's not just a game about pushing and rolling cylinders around, it's a game about really interesting cause-and-effect relationships between the cylinders, the spaces they're placed in, and the places that you wanna get to but can't.\n\nIf you're a serious puzzle gamer, don't be put off by the game's pastel appearance and the choice of marketing and press quotes that emphasize the soothing or cozy nature of the gameplay. The game's content, including the low-difficulty puzzles, are still very interesting even if you're an experienced puzzle-solver. \n\nThe approachability of the game is achieved by having an \"easy path\" through most of the areas. In this case, easy does not mean \"uninteresting\", but instead means \"interesting puzzles that are rigged so that low-skill solvers are highly likely to stumble upon the solution\". If you're a veteran puzzle-solver, you may not even realize this. It's quite clever. The puzzles off the \"easy path\" are quite challenging (some mind-bogglingly so) and many are incredible feats of design that you will not want to miss.\n\nThe art, sound, and writing are competently executed, and the controls, audio, and visuals do not get in the way of the puzzle-solving. The narrative is entirely flavourtext and is completely irrelevant to the puzzle content, so you can ignore it if you don't care for it (but some of it is hilarious).\n\nThere is one \"thing I wish I knew before I started playing\", and this is that if you want to find all the secrets, you should first rush to complete to the game (get to the credits) before spending a lot of time trying to find secrets. Trying to 100% each area individually during your first playthrough will lead to a lot of frustration and wasted time.\n\nThis game is wonderful. I hope Drak makes an expansion/sequel with another 500+ islands. There are enough unused tricks and unexplored design space here that he could easily fill it (but adding 3x1 logs might also be fun).",
      "Valve ignored this game because it doesn't rake in the money like tf2/dota/csgo and thats why its good",
      "I backed this game back at the end of September 2013 and have finally played it through to completion. \n\nCandle is a beautifully unique game which takes elements from puzzle, platforming and point and click adventures. The puzzles, although sometimes frustratingly difficult, are all different and use different mechanics keeping the game engaging and fresh. Teku's Candle is such a interesting game mechanic that I really enjoyed getting to know and learn. As previously said, the game looks and sounds absolutely stunning. I don't think I have seen a game that looks this good before and that is attritubuted to every character and scene being hand drawn. Controls can be a bit finicky but not game breaking and you can easily adjust too. I would recommend getting this game because it provides a great whole experience.",
      "Stephen's Sausage Roll is a game that the developer doesn't want normal people to buy, it seems. The description is literally, \"A simple 3d puzzle game.\", there is one video that shows you nothing about the game, and it's priced at $32 CND.\n\nFortunately, I'm here to tell you to get off your ass and to buy this wonderful game. The graphics are alright, the music is OK, but the puzzles are sublime.\n\nIn each level, the goal is the same: cook all the sausages and exit the level by standing on the exit level sign in the right orientation. You cook sausages by pushing them over a grill. Like in sokoban games, you can't pull the sausage (yet...), only push it. Another huge wrinkle is that sides of the sausage can only touch the grill once. If you touch a cooked side of a sausage to the grill, it will be burned and you fail the level. This little wrinkle will make you pull your hair out in some levels as you try and figure out how the hell you are going to maneuver the sausages around so they get cooked properly. A neat thing about the game is that if you fail, you can still continue playing the level, which might help you figure out how to play it.\n\nYou'll have a section (part of an island) that has a number of puzzles for you to solve in any order, so if you get stuck, you can try another one (until you get to the last puzzle of the section). Once you complete a section, a new section will open up with more puzzles.\n\nYour little guy has tank controls, which you will find extremely useful, as turning to the left or right near a sausage will push it in different directions. A nice detail is that the all of the puzzles make up the island section. When you activate a puzzle, the rest of the island drops away into the sea, leaving you on a tiny puzzle island.\n\nEach section introduces new mechanics into the game. First you'll just be pushing the sausages, but then you'll be stacking them, skewering them (you would think this would make things easier, but no! You can't turn when you have a skewered sausage!), walking on them...\n\nI would say that these levels are on the level of Snakebird, though I found many of them easier than Snakebird's puzzles (maybe I'm better at sokoban games than I know?). These are the kind of puzzles that you walk away from frustrated, but come back to a few hours later with the solution. This is the game where there are so many ah-ha! moments that make you feel smart. You have no idea what to do at first, but eventually you get better and better. You might not see solutions at first, but you begin to see where you need to go to solve the puzzle, and then work backwards from there. It's wonderful!\n\nIf you're having trouble, there's a community guide that has all the solutions, which is super helpful (though not as much when I was playing because it wasn't complete!).\n\nIt might be expensive, but I took 36 hours to solve all the puzzles and it was worth every penny.",
      "New edit: The developers have made the steam workshop available, but as an Oceanic user I don't have direct access to the workshop and I can't upload mods. It seems to be only available to Chinese modders, much like the previous 3rd party software. The problem appears to be covered up and not solved.\n\nEdit: Modding capability is now available. The devs are using a 3rd part chinese workshop that we all hate (thanks devs), however you can use Nexus Mods instead. Simply go to the Tale of Immortal nexus page and download any mod, then add it into the local mod section provided in the mod category. Then you're good to go.\n\nBe aware that currently, from what I've seen, the IDs mods use are generated at mod creation and multiple mods have a chance of ID conflict (breaking the mod/s). So if you have problems this may be the reason.\n\n\nOfficial English translation is available. The devs have mentioned 90% is translated, but I believe it won't impact gameplay. Players who haven't launched the game before will be switched to English automatically.\n\nIf you have launched the game before you will have to do the following: in the main menu select 语言 and change 简体中文 to English (Alpha) and restart the game.\n\nFor my review: Having played the game, I can say it's both good and bad. It failed to meet my expectations but I still enjoyed the game and will recommend it. The art is fantastic. The combat is fun but lacking compared to other action & slash titles (there is a lot they could do with it). Quests aren't very clear and their incentives are bad making it hard to get invested. You don't get anything really unique or interesting from quests as far as I've played.\n\nProgression is the most disappointing part of the game. It's a mix of crafting, gathering and looting to acquire items that will either enable you to advance or give you a stronger stat-boost when you do advance. Every realm does the same thing, only requiring different items at the new area/s that open up for that realm. This is a shame. Progression is the area that has the most potential in this game and yet is the most tacked on part, mostly an afterthought.\n\nThe developers could've made each realm advancement unique, with different gameplay mechanics for each one that ties into the unique aspects of the area/realm they're in. This would be a fantastic way to give a sense of freshness to each area the player explores and make them engage more actively in said area rather than rushing through it as we do now.\n\nProgression could've been the strongest part of this game but they ended up making it the weakest. Again, it's a shame. I see so much potential that just isn't capitilised on. Overall this is an experience I'd recommend. But I'd only play it once in its current state.",
      "First off, just want to say this isn't a Metroidvania. This is a Zelda clone. And a good one!\n\nI bought this game because I heard it really put stress on you. You have limited time to complete the game and NPCs will begin dying if you aren't fast enough. Pretty crazy, right? Well, I do have a few gripes with that, but let me point out the good stuff first:\n+ Amazing combat. You have access to both guns and swords, but most of your damage will likely come from melee weapons since they have the ability to do an extremely-easy-to-pull-off PARRY! Parrying an enemy stuns it and gives your next attack against it a massive damage multiplier. All enemies, all bosses, and most projectiles are parryable, so this is what combat ends up revolving around. Even though I call it easy, you still get that cool feeling when you walk into an ambush and clear it without taking a hit, so it never gets dull as you go through the game.\n\n+ Good dungeon design. Since this game takes after Zelda, it's not shy about inserting a few puzzles into its dungeons. The overworld as well has quite a few surprising secrets and side quests that you won't be expecting when you play for the first time.\n\n+ Sequence breaks. This is mostly for New Game+ (or New Game Extra, a separate mode where you have access to major exploration items from the start, but not your whole endgame inventory), but it was interesting to find out how many secret paths and shortcuts there were, and how tightly they were managed. The devs thought of everything!\n\nSo now for the bad stuff.\n- Underwhelming story. Guess how much is really explained over the course of this story. If you guessed \"all of it\", you would be completely wrong and here's your dunce hat. Unsighted ends up spending so much of its time on the protagonist's relationships that it fails to answer several of the more important questions concerning the game's backstory. Why was there was a war? Who started it? Where are the humans now? Why are they so disorganized? Why do they seem to have no chain of command whatsoever? How did the automatons ever win anything at all at any point when they seem so extremely outclassed? I guess it doesn't matter. Look, there's two robot-girls kissing.\n\n- Fake pressure. I heard there was going to be pressure before I started the game, so I decided to go DEFCON 1 from the get-go and rush everything. I ended up completing the game in 10 in-game days and I felt pretty good about it. Zero NPC deaths! Zero! I'm a super awesome amazing hero, right? Well, credits roll and... the only achievement I get is the one for beating the game. No one really cares and apparently you're meant to play through multiple times anyway. So... why did I ever care? Why is this mechanic even in the game? All it did was make me shy away from general exploration and side quests since all of those things are less important than, ya know, saving the world. You can call that interesting, but when it has no payoff, it ends up being frustrating.\n\n- No post-game. Did I mention, if you bumrush the game and finish with just hours left on everyone's timers, you don't get to do any extra no-timer exploring afterwards? No, the game's over. Load the save and you get set back to where you were before fighting the final boss. If you want to do any actual exploring, that's what \"Explorer\" mode is for. You know, that mode that makes you feel like you're cheating?\n\nBasically, Unsighted is another game filled with missed opportunities. I recommend this game because the core gameplay and level design is very well done and very well executed, but you should probably know this before you start:\n\nThe only pressure here is the one you imagine. Since the game does nothing to acknowledge your successes, just play it at your own pace and don't be shy about using Explorer. Shame on the devs for hailing the agony of defeat, but not the thrill of victory.",

      "You finally don't need a guide on how to purchase the game.\n\n- 21 different story missions that each take approximately 20 to 50 minutes to complete.\n- DLC sidestory contracts - different targets but same maps.\n- Escalation contracts on those same maps; think of this as a puzzle mode.\n- The new roguelike Freelancer mode that gives randomly generated targets in a randomly generated campaign.\n\nThis game now has such a vast wealth of content that it would take you months to complete it all. I genuinely recommend it.",
      "First of all - Subnautica is a good game. Very atmospheric, very scary and overall a really overwhelming experience. At first. \nThis might be the only negative review in this month, but I think some of you might appreciate a different view than \"omg this game is just awesome\". Which it kinda is, but in some points it maybe isnt.\n\nThis first section of the review doesnt contain any major spoilers for the story, just a comment on the overall progress through the game stages.\nAt the time of writing this review, I played the game for ~ 35 hours, I have advanced quite a bit. The first few hours were fantastic, I was looking for new things to explore, the blueprints for all the stuff that I need and every new thing felt like I made a progress. But then at a certain point nothing new happend. It seemed to me like I had all resources I could ever need (even the blue crystals), I had all the vehicles you could build, all the upgrades I needed.\nAnd then there was no challenge anymore. You build your submarines, your bases and the game gets too easy, its not a challenge anymore. Don't continue reading after this point, if you havent played the game yet.\n\n[spoiler] The big strength of this game is the immersion in the seemingly endless underwater worlds. But at a certain point this immersion breaks (at least it did for me).\nNone of the monsters can really harm you, not even the biggest ones are a real threat. Just hop into you seamoth and out-speed everything. If there is a leviathan, just hug the walls or strave, they cant catch you. And if they do, just step out, repair your ship and continue. None of the threats is really dangerous. You really need to have bad luck to die. And if you do ... nothing happens. You just respawn.\nAt first the map seems endless, since you cant move fast. But once you get the seamoth, the map is very finite. Sure, there are deeper levels you cant access with the moth, but everything on the surface is within reach. Its the same with the deeper levels and the prawnsuit.\nSurvival is hard at first, since you constantly need to get water and food. Once you can plant you own food, you have unlimited supply and the survival aspect becomes just an annoyence.\n\nAnother thing that bothers me is the amount of resources you need to build stuff. In the later part of the game you need to build a giant structure. But the necessary resources are just like \"get 3 wooden planks, 2 nails and a hammer\". And with these resources you build the statue of liberty.\n\nMy last point is about the storyline. After something like 15 hours into the game there was a major stall for me - I had no clue where to go, to me it seemed like I searched everything I had access to at that time. I searched for 10 hours and found nothing. I went to the Islands twice to check if I missed anything, but no. I dont know, maybe I just had bad luck and something didnt trigger right, I missed a hint somewhere or something. It eventually went on, but on that point I already had the big submarine, the prawnsuit and everything. The story felt like I just need to run from A to B and back, there was no challenge anymore. \n [/spoiler]\n\nSo anyways. If you made it this far in the review, thanks for reading. If you disagree with me, thats totally fine for me. I don't want to ruin the game for anyone, maybe the points that bother me dont mean much to you.\nI know that my critique is pretty harsh. There are many positive aspects in this game. If you can really dive into this game and fully roleplay it, submerge in its story and ignore some flaws, this is a fantastic game.\nBut maybe some of you are like me, so some of my mentioned points could bother you too.\nThanks for reading, I hope I didnt butcher the English language too badly, feel free to comment, if you like.",
      "With almost 300 hours of Destiny 2 (D2) back on Battle.net (the Blizzard launcher), let me give this perspective/advice for new players, specifically with regards for the F2P offering that is Destiny 2: New Light, with a few more holistic thoughts sprinkled throughout:\n\nThis overall game is very good. It doesn't always live up to its promise (the first mission of every campaign is always the most polished thing aside from the raids/dungeons), but when it does, it [b]really[/b] shines.\n\nThe gunplay is unrivaled. The visual/audio feedback is great, the handling feels really good, and enemies really pop when you take them out. Expect nothing less from the studio that brought us grunt birthday parties.\n\nThe game is better in a fireteam. Now that the base game is F2P [though with considerably less content than it used to be/I would like], this should be easier than ever for most activities. That said, a huge majority of my playtime was done solo. It can get tricky at times (\"Darkness Zones\" in certain missions prevent respawning but allow for revives, so solo players have a distinct disadvantage there). \n\nWith that said, dungeons (currently 'The Shattered Throne', 'Pit of Heresy', 'Prophecy' which is free to all players, 'Grasp of Avarice', 'Duality', and 'Spire of the Watcher') and raids (\"Last Wish\" from Forsaken, \"Garden of Salvation\" from Shadowkeep, \"The Deep Stone Crypt\" from Beyond Light, 'Vow of the Disciple' from Witch Queen, as well as 'Vault of Glass' and 'King's Fall' from D1 - both of which are both free to all players) are best experienced with a team, so don't shy away from LFG group-finder options like the Discord, official app, or any number of other sites (just make sure to accurately describe your experience, level, and gear. 'Tis only polite). \n\nOf the matchmade multiplayer offerings, I enjoy Gambit (PvPvE, reminds me of the Black Ops Zombies 4z4 mode done right), jump into the occasional Strike (PvE, matchmade fireteams running campaign-like missions), and have no interest in Crucible (PvP, it's fine I guess, but I've never liked PvP that's dependent in large part on personal progression - especially in the competitive modes like Trials of Osiris and Iron Banner)\n\nDon't be afraid to ignore content - this is absolutely the kind of game where you can set your own goals. Want a specific exotic gun? Look up where it drops and focus on grinding that content. Want a specific roll on a random roll gun? Find the best possible farming (or crafting) method and go to town. Chase down some of the exotic questions that the game clutters up your quest page with, or just goof around doing things that you find fun while absolutely ignoring all signposts.\n\nSome stuff just won't be explained in game. It's not as bad as Warframe (much less need for a wiki) but some things are still obscured. Feel free to look up Xur (exotic weapon vendor who visits on weekends) and other hidden exotics tied to specific activities, lost sectors, patrol locations, or quest chains.\n\nFor anything that you can't easily find online - reach out and find a sherpa. The community for this game tends to be pretty great, and enough of us have spent enough time leaning specific parts of it (e.g. raids) or just mechanics in general (\"What are random rolls? Which do I keep?\") that we'd be happy to jump onto discord (there are a bunch for PC, just check out the subreddit sidebar linked below) and answer any and all questions you may have. \n\nThe fact that a representative chunk of this game is free makes this the perfect time to dip your toes in without emptying out your wallet. Any other questions about this game as a product (\"Should I pay for DLC? Is Eververse worth it?\") should absolutely be researched elsewhere.\n\nIf you're looking for a place to start with the F2P content, finish the intro missions in the Cosmodrome. New and returning players are semi-regularly upgraded to a new light level floor, but means that you can miss out on the \"learning the ropes\" parts of the game that come with working your way through the New Light quest chain or unlocking different subclasses. [As of Beyond Light, all of the campaign content through Forsaken are not currently accessible. Release order was Red War (launch campaign) > Forsaken > Shadowkeep > Beyond Light > Witch Queen, followed by the upcoming expansions Lightfall > Final Shape.]\n\nEyes up, guardian.\n\nFootnotes for people yelling at me in the comments:\n-All of this is my opinion. Feel free to hold your own and disagree with mine.\n-I generally enjoy grinding, looter shooters, FPS's, and weird sci-fi space magic. Halo, Borderlands, Warframe, and CoD Zombies are some of my most-played and favorite games.\n-As far as I can tell, anything that is not strictly subjective in the above is factually correct [as of Season of Plunder, with updates noted throughout. This game changes quite a bit over time, so make sure to do your own research before spending money on it]. If I've missed something, feel free to point it out in the comments and I'll do my best to update this periodically. \n-This review previously made mention of both content vaulting and weapon sunsetting. These practices have both been discontinued as of Season of Plunder. However, it is not clear at this if or when power capped or vaulted may return/be uncapped, if ever.\n\n-----------------\nTL:DR: It's good. Not perfect, but really good. And since it's free, you can get a really good sense of if this game is for you without paying for any of it. You can play almost any activity solo pretty easily except for a handful of endgame activities. If you're overwhelmed at first, just play through the Cosmodrome missions while you get your feet under you, or ask a veteran player for help.\n-----------------\n\nSites to use (List was compiled at Shadowkeep launch, but most of it should still be relevant/useful)\n\n    \nBeginner's Guide (Current as of Beyond Light) - https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/49007\n\nThe DTG Subreddit - /r/DestinyTheGame on Reddit - https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/\n\nDestiny Item Manager (mange your inventory from your browser even while in-game, essential to avoid unneeded trips back to the tower) - app.destinyitemmanager.com\n\nDestiny 2 Checklist (Lists out everything to do as well as when it resets in-game) - www.d2checklist.com/\n\nLight gg (Database of in-game items, useful for looking up random rolls) - https://www.light.gg/\n\nBraytech org (Lots of overlapping features, but I really like their maps) - braytech.org/\n\nDatto (Destiny Youtuber / 24:02 Raider who posts lots of useful/educational content, including exotic guides) - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkmAjbIecTIjTQctolYeuDw\n\nIf you've played D2 on another system, check out the CrossSave page (https://www.bungie.net/7/en/crosssave) on the Bungie net official site respectively to get all of your content and progression moved over to Steam.\n\nStory Recap up through Shadowkeep (Spoilers Destiny 1 / D1, and D2, obviously) (My name is Byf on YouTube: The Complete Story of Destiny!

      "Most puzzle games demand you to think 'outside the box'. In Baba is You, there is no box. This game will present to you so many simple yet impossible levels, you'll swear your game is bugged. But there is always some ingenious, big-brain solution, hiding in plain sight.\n\nIf you look at the comment section of any Baba is You solution video, you will find no shortage of angry commenters. They will claim, \"That's not fair! The game never taught me I could do that!\" even though it has. In a moment of weakness, they blamed the game and not themselves.\n\nHere's the thing - you cannot expect to try multiple permutations of one-dimensional solutions and expect to make progress. Baba is You will not give you the satisfaction of beating it for free. You will have to push the rules to its limit. You will have to create infinite combos, clip through walls, and build complex machinery using nothing but four words and a rock.\n\nNow, that's not to say looking up hints or solutions is bad. Unless you're like me, who has zero respect for their time, it's perfectly reasonable to say no to another hour of banging your head against the wall for one level. But when you do decide to wave the white flag, don't go telling the game dev off for making a game that finally respects people's intelligence, just because you feel it disrespects your stupidity.\n\nIf you ever happen to be part of the 2.6% of people that beat all 200+ levels in this game, know that it will be a lonely achievement. Your parents, who have never touched a video game in their life, they wouldn't understand. Your old high school buddies, who only contact you when they need something, they wouldn't understand. Your Steam friends, they've never even heard of Baba is You, they wouldn't understand. \n\nBut know, just know, that I will understand.",
      "[h1] 9/10 [/h1]\n[h1] As a sequel to Steins;Gate, you won't be able to understand the content of the game without playing the previous game. [/h1]\n\nThe sequel to the famous visual novel game Steins;Gate. Although some people think that Steins;Gate 0 is not as good as its predecessor, I think this game is a well-deserved excellent sequel.\n\nA change from the witty and relaxed game style of the previous game, the overall atmosphere of this game is heavy, and personally I prefer this kind of visual novel work. The plot of the game is naturally wonderful, so I won’t comment here to avoid spoilers. If you are deeply attracted by the game’s background settings and characters before playing Steins;Gate, then this work must be worthwhile. The music of this game is also very beautiful, and it will never disappoint the players. The only shortcoming of it is that the description of some characters is too sloppy and the characterization is insufficient, such as Kagari.\n\nIn any case, this one is definitely a must-try work for players who love Steins;Gate, and it is an important addition to the series of plots. As a related supplementary sequel, its nature is also destined that players must play the previous game in order to understand the content of this one.",
      "This game is basically awesome, under 3 conditions:\n\n1- You get rid of all on-screen icons (i.e. incoming attacks, ennemy spotting)\n2- Do not care about secondary missions only here to further lenghten the game's lifespan\n3- Play the game as you would if  YOU were in charge\n\nBasically, nevermind the Ubisoft micro transactions' system and other abhorrent company induced  greed-leaned system to get stuff faster and more easily by robbing you out of your hard-earned cash...you can finish the game without spending a single dime in the store, it's all pay to win...\nThe open-world aspect is very satisfying and rewarding, in terms of progression, don't fall for the micro transaction system\nCombat is easy even in the highest difficulty setting, but makes you think you are badass when you slash through waves of ennemies, whose AI is rather basic, with your arsenal of rockets, LMGs and explosives but it is satisfying as fuck!\n\nImagine strapping C4 to your plane, jump out of it, have it crashing down an ennemy outpost meanwhile you are parachuting down and throwing hand grenades their way, land on a roof and eliminate the remaining ennemies with fire ammo shotgun and a motherfucking M60 with armor-piercing bullets while throwing dynamites and there you have it...FarCry5 in a nutshell\n\nOh and don't forget about the flame-thrower lol, who doesn't love a flame-thrower scorching ennemies to their own demise eh?\n\nFarCry5 got it all, extreme freedom of how you wanna handle a situation (stealthily or all guns blazing) while being challenging enough in the highest difficulty setting!\nP.S. don't forget to turn off all the on-screen icons, really ruins it for hardcore FPS fans by making it extremely easy, please hear me out, you don't need these!",
      "First, let me state that the 3 hours shown as my time played is majorly inaccurate. I spend most of my time playing games in offline mode due to living in a VERY rural area with no internet available aside from satellite or mobile hotspot (both of which have extremely stingy monthly data caps). I started playing this game less than 24 hours ago and am currently on day 22 in game.\n\nAs has been said by others, if you are a fan of Animal Crossing, Harvest Moon, Stardew Valley, Staxel, etc, this game is something you will want to seriously consider. There is already a significant amount of content available with more being planned in the developer's roadmap. What is here is well designed and feels like second nature if you've ever played any of the aforementioned games.\n\n\nWhat Dinkum Does Right\n\nGraphics - Excellent. Graphics are exactly what I would expect for this style of game, Characters, buildings, animals, and environments look absolutely great.\n\nMusic - While the music is definitely understated, it fits the setting and gameplay perfectly.\n\nSound Effects - Another area the game absolutely nails. The sound effects are spot on from the rainfall, pick on stone, bees buzzing, fish splashing, and even the gibberish language voice effects are exactly what I expected.\n\nDay/Night Cycle - The day/night cycle is dialed in to the point that it strikes a near perfect balance of giving me enough time in the day to make progress on my projects while also not giving me so much time that I can make so much progress that the day/night cycle is meaningless.\n\nTool Durability - While tool durability is still something that annoys me in video games, it is something I have grown to accept and Dinkum manages to make the system feel like less of a hindrance than most other games in the genre.\n\n\nThe Missteps\n\nThe Sky - As I said earlier, the game's overall graphics are great. The one place I've noticed that falls a bit flat is the sky. While during the night, it looks pretty decent, during the day and evening, is a bit lackluster. Not a dealbreaker, but it is a bit disappointing considering how great the rest of the game looks.\n\nUpgrading Tools - The fact that I have to buy a basic axe, pickaxe, etc and then use a couple of ingots to upgrade it rather than being able to just make a new, higher tier tool from scratch is a bit annoying. ESPECIALLY on Sundays.\n\nBland NPCs - Now this is something that I was initially hesitant to include given the game is an Early Access release and is one of the easiest things to polish up in a final release. That said, the game is being presented in a FOR SALE manner, so I feel that what is currently in the game should be considered indicative of what to expect in a full release and decided to include it. That said, the game's NPCs (with the exception of Fletch) do feel incredibly bland and lacking in personality when compared to those of Stardew Valley, Animal Crossing, Harvest Moon, and the like. As stated, though, this is a simple fix as the game nears a final release.\n\n\nOverall\n\nGiven how minor my few complaints with the game are, this is a game that I would absolutely recommend to anyone who is a fan of the genre and I consider it an absolute steal at a $20 price point.\n\nAs someone who has grown disenfranchised with Nintendo, having a game that takes the Animal Crossing community building gameplay and merges it with the farming, hunting, and survival gameplay of Stardew Valley is something I had been hoping to see for quite a while and Dinkum does a fantastic job of capturing that. This is a game I am very excited to see completed and I would love to see more games like this on PC.",
      "Game really falls off after Anor Londo. The difficulty starts to come more from tedium, shitty terrain/hitboxes, and cheap shots than any test of reflex or strategy. Bosses can be total snoozefests (Ornstein and Smough, Four Kings, Quelaag) or relentless, cheap bastards (Gwyn, Sif) or even dumb puzzles that rely on at least one death to figure out (Discharge, Bed of Chaos, Gaping Dragon). Actual fun bosses are few despite the total number of boss fights. Try not to fall asleep while waiting for the boss to do the one attack you can actually punish without getting hit by the patented zero frame windup or retarded delayed backswing. Marvel at how touching the air 1 foot away from the boss kills you after he does his big EPIC swing because silly player, you should know the exact dimensions of the hitbox surrounding the 20ft tall demon and his 2 ton hammer. Sigh as you run past all the enemies and time-wasting obstacles again as you try to figure out the one stupid gimmick you need to master.\n\nNow, this game isn't all bad. The game's artstyle and atmosphere are pretty cool and the voice acting is good. Some of the levels are also really interesting and well-designed (Undead Burg and Parish, Sen's Fortress, Anor Londo) even if there are also some really shitty ones (Tomb of Giants, Blighttown through Lost Izalith, Crystal Cavern). Play after the second bell only if you want to see whether you can \"git gud.\" I got gud but I see that this game was popular mostly because AAA games were shit when it came out and because of the multiplayer gimmicks.",

      "I have it on the Epic store but the amount of stuttering it has made it unplayable so I gave up. I got the Humble choice for $6 to get a steam key and try it on here because I have a few games on steam that run well but run poorly on other platforms like the awful Windows store or the below average Epic launcher, but it's unfortunately the same deal on here for this game. It has done it on two entirely different computer setups for me so that tells me that they didn't bother to spend enough time testing enough different pc setup combinations when it was in development, and my pc setup isn't rare by any means. The look and functioning of the UI and menu's shows that it is a obvious direct console port which would explain their lack of attention to the pc version.\n\nEven giving it a fair shot based on content, it's pretty much just a modified version of Borderlands 2. The amount of dialogue is unbearable. No one in the game EVER shuts up, and every single last word they say is cringe. It's like a kid in fifth grade who laughs at fart jokes wrote the entire script. In addition to everyone never shutting up, the main boss randomly has page-long speeches over the radio just to make sure you get the message that they want you to feel entirely uncomfortable at this game's bottomless amount of cringe.\n\nThe gameplay is identical to BL2, with the only real new noticeable features being that some guns have two functions that you can toggle on and off with the C key and of course the new playable characters. However even without the stuttering ruining the game for me, it's my opinion that BL3's negatives, mainly the insane amount of neverending dialogue and how unbelievably cringe it is, overshadow its positives.",
      "Playerunknowns Battlegrounds\n\n\nIn my opinion hands down the best Battle Royale game released.\n\n\n+Built on a very flexible engine that is built to handle games of the FPS genre\n\n+Core mechanics of the game are solid and function with little to no bugs (In my experience, I've personally only encountered 2 bugs)\n\n+Vehicles that have good physics and good controls to them\n\n+The game in most aspects visually looks great\n\n+Plenty of weaponry (For release)\n\n+Gun mechanics themselves feel very solid and fluid, weapons have recoil to them and for me feel \"weighted\" \n\n+Nice animations for all weapons currently in game\n\n+The map size in my opinion is perfect. Large enough that you aren't always on top of another player (Unless you purposely land in an area with others), vehicles are useful, while also being small enough that generally it's not a painful chore to run somewhere \n\n++SPECTATOR MODE IN TEAMS (No more sitting staring at a death screen for 20 minutes waiting for your teammates, while also making your teammates feel guilty for \"leaving you behind\" ) \n\n\n\n-Server stability (There are semi frequent heavy lag spikes that can affect the entire server, from what I heard this wasn't as bad in the closed beta, hopefully this will be resolved soon) \n\n-Performance/Optimization is quite bad (For many, many people) in this, IF you don't apply some commands/launch parameters to the game. (I personally went from 25-40 fps on medium and very low, to 55-65 by inputting a simple launch parameter, this command/launch parameter \"fix\" does NOT work for everyone) \n\n\nAside from those 2 negatives I cannot think of anything else that's bad enough to be worth mentioning. \n\n\n\nOverall this game is great, even if doing solos, but is even more fun when playing with friends, I would entirely recommend it to a friend, so long as their PC is capable of handling it, or if the launch parameter works for them\n\n\n\n\nSystem specs the game was played on:\n\nIntel Core i7 6700 HQ Skylake 3.6 ghz\n\nNvidia GTX 960m 2GB \n\n16gb's DDR4 2133mhz\n\nWindows 10 \n\n(System was an ASUS ROG gaming laptop) \n\n\n\nEDIT: For those who may be looking for the launch parameter me and friends used:\n\n\nNavigate to the game in your library\n\nRight click and go to properties, click \"Set Launch Options\" and enter the following command\n\n\n\n-USEALLAVAILABLECORES -malloc=system -sm4",
      "Alpha, Beta, Finished Product... I hear lots of Blah blah blahs complaining about this game not being out of Alpha after years and years, but it isn't like we've been paying a monthly fee for it.  I paid one time to support this game and I've got years of play out of a product that I enjoy.  There aren't too many games that scratch an itch like this game for me... Open World, completely editable/buildable environment and zombies!  One of my biggest issues with a game that I like is that after I buy it, they release a few DLCs and then move on to their next product.  Alpha, Beta, Finished or Not... the developers have given me years of standing by their product and many updates with new content and mechanics.  For that alone, I love their game!\n\nGraphics: 3 outta 5 graphics, she looks a little dated but they keep updating it... It looks better than it originally did.  There's growth\nReplayability: 5 outta 5\nGameplay:3 outta 5... sometimes she's a little clunky\n\nI definitely still believe that this game is worth buying and that they devs and their product is worth supporting.  Hopefully this is helpful to someone.",
      "TL;DR - 80-90s retro fun. Will prove you wrong if you think FMV games couldn't ever be good. Check out 5 seconds of playthrough if unsure.\nNOTE: Story isn't written in this review as game is reliant on mysterious plot. \n\n　　　For those unfamiliar, FMV stands for full motion video where you are playing a game that is based primarily/largely on the usage of pre-recorded video clips. Though it is no longer a frequented genre in video gaming, during the 90s, FMV games on CDs would often lead me into the darkened halls of many a thrilling Sherlockian mystery adventure. Unfortunately the majority of FMV games were downright awful. Pre-recorded videos with a small quantity of scenes by actual actors caused the a gaming experience to feel boxed in. Astoundingly, Her Story does the exact opposite while still being as classically FMV as FMV games go. It displays FMV like a shield of pride with the added old school touches being tasteful to a tee. As the game is \"turned on\", the screen whirring into action like any early 90s PC would, making the familiar creaking and croaking, players are introduced to their in-game desktop. The thick 90s computer monitor flares a little and in its reflection can be seen the old tube shaped fluorescent lamps that were common fixtures in most public buildings back then, flickering and popping from time to time. It is like playing a game in the past without the annoying performance issues. [spoiler]The glare on screen where you can see a better reflection towards the end made me jump a little here and there. It is fabulous as a \"moodsetter\" like many of the other suppositious yet important details that worked towards the game's impressive little plot.[/spoiler] In addition to the other details, the background music between searches where players are looking at the desktop felt like a good touch and appropriate in terms of guiding players (reacts to clips/progress etc). There is such an abundance of both subsidiary and essential detail in this game that I'd be happy with the mere nostalgia prompting ambiance. It is an added bonus, which isn't too recurrent in indie games these days where there is a deficiency in either style or story, that makes Her Story such a good FMV. It differs because players can feel as if they are in control as every person works towards the ending down a differing path depending on how they decide to investigate which is conducted solely by which searches are brought up how and when. The secret to any game that lacks the variety and freedom of choice by \"genre default\", is to give the player as much control as possible within the walls of that rigid reality. Within the uncomplicated, search - watch - find clues - check Db repertoire, players are given room to stretch and investigate on their own. The mastery is in the details so it is crucial to pay attention. Everything is told methodically and the acting that seems off in places makes much more sense once you piece the evidence and videos together. You are the \"detective\".\n\n　　　This superlative story told through proficient acting by the talented Viva Seifert (also musician/former British gymnast) weaves a surprisingly thick plot into a very lugubrious tale and the eerie horrors of the truth become more evident the more you unveil. The \"wifey killed him\" synopsis we are inclined to linger on in theory is not as discernible in-game as you'd imagine and it'll keep you guessing and alarm you at several progression points. It'll make your thoughts run wild but mostly you'll be wrong with those assumptions until you get the whole picture, as in as close to 100% off the clips as you can. The short clips have a role in that you're piecing together a very large puzzle. The splintered pieces of a total 7 interviews leaving you with 271 videos spanning between mere seconds to a couple of minutes will feel jumbled up so receiving the story in abstruse titbits as such makes you feel like your own little Jessica Fletcher and adds to the anticipation of piecing everything together. If possible I imagine it would be a fun \"couch co-op\" game for an afternoon in with a friend/SO taking notes and guessing the story together (plot contains mature content). \n\n[i]Other interesting things[/i]:\n- Doesn't stop running while you do other things so you can open up your notepad and type there if you'd rather that over pen and paper\n- Search history is helpful. Anti-Glare Filter is a nice touch. Yellow subtitles are very British. \n- The odd title is actually fittingly chosen\n- Database Checker on your desktop screen will display the overall progress you make, creating a timeline for your discoveries so investigation will be smoother\n- Each keyword brings up 5 clips at most (excluding default keyword*). Keep a list of words that stick out in clips and if you get too stuck, use default keyword to bring up whole Db\n\n*[i]Default keyword:[/i] [spoiler]BLANK[/spoiler] Using the default is not optimal. Uncovering new snippets in turn revealing new clues/plots urging you to solve the case yourself is most of the fun.\n\n[b]TIP[/b]: All clips found will have the default keyword in its details. I assigned a number for every new top she wore. Examples: [spoiler]BLANK5, BLANK1 etc..[/spoiler]. An easier method is just deleting the whole keyword for each clip watched, never to return. ;)\n\n　　　Though the sweet yet unnerving finale didn't feel as inspired, the wrap up was still nicely done. People who are new to FMV games may find it harder to get into, but it has a good depth of story to tell for the short game (3-4 hrs) that it is and I recommend it to people who enjoy a good tale. Chances are it's either going to feel like something new and interesting or old school and nostalgic. \n\n[i]Bought game on dev's site: $4.99 (Steam key + DRM free version).[/i]",
      "[H1] GUIDE TO THE PURCHASE OPTIONS [/H1]\nso heres how you can tell the difference between what your buying, because you don't wanna be like me, who often bought packs that did the same thing. \n\nHitman 3 standard edition - Just Hitman 3, so no Hitman 2 or 1. You get access to the newly added levels, as well as elusive targets and most of the escalations. This does not give you access to the 7 deadly sins levels.\n\nHitman 3 Deluxe edition - a bit scammy, not quite worth the money, but it comes with some music, 3 new skins and a couple of extra escalations. This won't give you any new levels. This does not give you access to the 7 deadly sins levels.\n\nHitman trilogy - Comes with nearly everything. If you want to buy hitman and access most of the levels, this is the one to go for. I believe the only things you do not get access to are the sniper edition levels, the patient zero campaign, the deluxe stuff, the 7 deadly sins levels and any extra skins. This is like the core of the game without any extra things.\n\nHitman trilogy premium add-ons - literally just hitman trilogy except it includes the features that aren't in hitman trilogy. You have to own the original Hitman trilogy in order to buy this one. The only thing it doesn't include is the 7 deadly sins. If you are stupid and can't comprehend what I just said; it doesn't include the base levels. Only the extra stuff\n\nHitman - 7 deadly sins pack - the new 7 deadly sins pack. It includes the 7 new levels that are a bit simular to escalations. Basically, there are still 3 stages in each sin, (they are sorted as targets, so every time you eliminate a target, its like a checkpoint. So you can really count it as just 1 stage with 3 targets.)  Its basically escalations but with a lot of effort put into them.\n\nHitman 3 access passes - these are basically dlc's that were put in hitman 2 and 1. If you already own these, you should automatically gain access to them during the carryover. There is one called 'hitman 3 access pass: hitman 2 gold', this basically means 'if you are new to the hitman trilogy, you can have access to the dlc in hitman 2 here'. \n\n\nhere are what the access passes do:\n\nHitman 2 gold edition - it gives you access to all hitman 2 levels, which is why its so expensive. It comes with all levels, including the sniper editions, the expansion pack (2 places, Maldives and New York) as well as some extra skins. Its pretty big if you ask me\n\nHitman 2 standard - gives you access to standard hitman 2 locations. This is basically the gold edition but without sniper edition, the expansion pack or extra skins. It gives you access to the base levels. Which is miami, columbia, mumbai, whittleton creek and the isle of sgail\n\nHitman 1 GOTY edition - gives you access to every level from hitman 1 but without campaigns\n\nHitman 1 GOTY upgrade - gives access to the hitman 1 campaigns, does not include the base levels.\n\n\nMost of these packs are worth the money. But most of them are on sale quite often. So if you think some of them aren't worth the money, you can always wait a month or two and get a massive sale on it.\n\nthank me later\n",

I push away from the table, stumble into kitchen, pour some bourbon trying not to clink the bottle against the glass.

Doing all that would be like rating a poem by word count, very accurate and of absolutely no use to anyone.\nI can only describe Kentucky: Route Zero as a feeling. Shortness of breath, tightness in the chest, a lump in a throat.  A slight vertigo. It's that acceptance that comes after the anger, when you're putting everything in order in preparation. A longing for the good old times that never were and you only imagined them and kept thinking about them until they seemed real. It's coming back to your parents' home for a funeral.

      "So I'm going to assume that you've played CIV V in the past. Endless Legend's another 4x game like it, but in my opinion, it's so much better. And here's why:\n\n1) I know this is the advantage of being in a fantasy setting as opposed to the \"Real world\" (You get what I mean, I know Civ 5 isn't historically accurate, but it tries to stay in the world of realism), but all the factions feel genuinly different and exciting from one another. Both in style and aesthetics, the difference between Wild Walkers and Ardent Mages is far, far greater than say The Netherlands and Japan. \n\n2) I like the way that influence is a resource. I know it kinda takes the place of culture in that it's used for policies, but having to save up a resource that's more than just troops for wars and the like makes diplomacy far more meaningful, I find.\n\n3) The way strategic and luxury resources are done. Instead of \"This deposit has 8 iron\", it says \"This deposit has titanium\", and just gives you 1 per turn. It let's you build things that require a lot of that resource even if you only have 1 source, just slower than other people who have more. It makes a lot more sense to me. the fact that each luxury item is different from one another and have different effects is a lot more interesting than just giving +Happiness, and the booster system means that having 5 dye deposits (I wish) is more useful than it is in civ, where you have to desperatly try and peddle it off or it's a huge waste.\n\n4) This is a personal thing, but I like the fact that technology is seperated by era rather than previous tech. I find it a far nicer system to work with as it lets me get what I want when I want it, instead of having to research bloody sailing even though I'm completely land locked.\n\n 5)  I know this is locked away in Tempest, but naval warfare is so bloody interesting now. With ocean based citadels and bloody weather effects that you have to wrstle with, I've never been happier to play on ocean-heavy maps. The ocean's not just an awkward land, it's its own living breathing world. \n\n6) The living breathing world that is Auriga. The lore I'm uncovering from quests and gameplay is ridiculous, and it really brings the world to life. It makes me sympathise and despise each faction for their motives and executions, and I love it. Plus, I'm learning the more and more I play that this is Sci-Fi, not high fantasy. It's amazing.\n\n7) Minor Factions are a far better method of doing barbarian encampments and city states. They're a great blend of the two, spawning enemy units like barbs, and giving meaningful bonuses like city states. Plus, your opponents can't just take them over and use them as a base of operations against you.\n\n 8) I know this is a controversial one, but I love winter. 1-30 turns where I'm surviving rather than thriving? I'm amazed with how much I love the double edged sword of dread and gratitude depending on whether or not I'm being invaded at the time\n\n9) I love the region system. There's X regions, this is their shape and size, and there's one city for each. I think it makes placing cities a lot more important than in civ where you can fart them around all over the place, and I get a lot less worried about having my neighbours settle all over me (Like the bloody shoshone). Plus, I think it makes zooming out and gazing upon your empire more satisfying. They're something nice about having all those rough edges instead of clean hexagons. Losing a city means losing a huge chuck of territory, and taking a citygains a huge chunk. The wars I've been in have been far more exciting as a result.\n\n10) Populations gets you citizens, like in Civ. I like just yelling at them to make more cabinets, sell more cabinets, or research new and exciting cabinets rather than making them work tiles. The fact that all the tiles get worked on automatically fits into this, as does the fact that your 20 population city is probably going to take up a hell of a lot more space than 1 tile. The fact that you can actually expand cities is something I love\n\n11) The way wars are fought. it;s not just blankets of single units, but a few core armies with 6-8 units in each. It makes it a HECK of a lot quicker and cleaner, while still having a grand scale. The fact that you can hands on rather than auto is something that I like to do if the odds are against my favor, but I can think of a clever stretegy to turn the tide in my favour.\n\n12) The hero system is something I like far more than the great person system. Instead of getting four bloody musicians I can't do anything with until the bloody modern era, you just get heros who you can use as spies, governers or generals, each able to be upgraded into whatever you want them to be or do. It's a super nice system I find, as I can just always get exactly the hero I need when I need them, which leads me nicely onto...\n\n13) The marketplace system is one I like. \"Oh I have no adamantium and noone will trade it with me!\". Well little Billy, you don't just have to resort to war anymore, you can just buy some. At a high price so it shouldn't be your first option, but it's nice to always be able to get what you need. Plus you can play the stock market in case you want to play Offworld Trading Company while you play Endless Legend.It's a nice way to get extra troops and great people too.\n\n\ntl;dr: It's a good game.\n\nGet it.",
      "If you look past all of the stale \"The Cake Is A Lie\" memes, you have your self a pretty clean cut, innovative experience.

      "This game is extremely addictive for one simple reason: it's a sandbox survival game with zero grind, because everything can be automated.\n\nIn a normal survival game, to craft 100 items, you need to first harvest 100 of some resource. In this game, you set up a power plant, a coal mine to fuel the it, an iron mine, a few assembly plants, a few conveyor belts and a chest and then wait for it to fill up with 100 grenades while you go work on another part of the factory. Meanwhile, the increasing pollution makes the bugs native to the planet increasingly agitated.\n\nAutomation is extended into every single part of the gameplay - you can mass produce buildings, then use robots to place them according to blueprints, transport items with automatic trains, and create complex control networks to let production adapt to demand. There is always something to do with very little repetition - a sudden bug attack, a bottleneck in your iron production, a depleted ore patch that forces you to explore for a new one. People spend absurd amounts of time on this game because it doesn't waste any of it.",
      "\nI couldn't really decide if 'received the product for free' cheapens my review or gives it credibility.  I love this game, I loved testing this game, my kids loved testing this game.  The 53 hours listed at the time here is almost all actual play time.\n\nIf all it was, was the sheer joy of fast-moving with a web, slinging from one side of the screen to the next, it would be kind of fun and not knowing why you were doing it, but still doing it.  We've sat playing in the intro screen.  However to add the technique of throwing laser-sabres, timing bomb throws, that sweet rush of hitting an opposing spider with a mine --- this game is one of my all-time favorite couch coop game easily rivaling Ascention, Killer Queen Black, Samurai Gunn 2, or Boomerang-Fu.   It is indeed the pool a fly can drink from and an elephant can swim.\n\nMy kids (9 & 11) are absolutely ecstatic over it.  If they didn't know what they were doing initially, they made-do by swinging around and flailing with the weapons, still having a good time.  Eventually they managed to figure out how to force pull a laser saber after throwing it, and managing a kill on the return.   Online, while I'm pretty good at this, I haven't found I need to 'git gud'.   I can do a reasonable job against people who have practiced way more than I have and clearly have the moves to back it up.   This game is dad-compatible. \n\nYou really won't regret getting this game.  With multiplayer couch co-ops it's hard to know who has the goods as a great game and who is just \"well, with the right crowd, hitting each other with sticks is fun.\"   This definitely has the goods.  You want to flail and have fun, you can do it.   You want to get vicious and see how deep the pool of physics goes, you can do it.",

      "111 reviews, only 15 bucks, published way back in April... how unfortunate.\n\nOnly one guide for this game. One. The only one that I could find anyway. I only really looked for it because I had a slight difficulty with something I missed. I'd seen what I needed to do earlier, I just didn't remember, probably because I'd run out of coffee quite a while ago.\n\nAnything I could rag on this game would pretty much be nitpicking. In all honesty, if this game made any screw-ups, they are no worse than certain AAA titles that get stupidly enormous amounts of undeserved praise. The ending wasn't perfect, I kinda saw it coming, but it gripped me and it didn't piss me off. Granted, yes, a few holes were left unfilled, but ultimately they can somewhat be ignored due to the way things were wrapped up being quite final. It did seem a tad abrupt, though, but I've seen far worse endings, believe me.\n\nThe gameplay tries to draw elements from all the previous titles and succeeds rather well. I felt it was a bit of a challenge without being completely convoluted and irrational as torturing your neighbor's dog for no reason, so I'm happy. At no point did I really need a guide, but nothing was excessively easy. This and the last game both did this pretty well, unlike Convergence which felt rather too straightforward to me.\n\nMaybe the series could have kept going, wrapped a few more loose-ends up, but overall I think this was a fine conclusion to an excellent series. It's a shining light at the end of it all.",

      "As someone who was disappointed by Deconstructeam's previous game, The Red Strings Club, I'm happy to say that I enjoyed this immensely.

The art design is gorgeous, the gameplay is soothing, and the plot keeps my attention from start to finish (no more grinding to a screeching halt in the third act to make some phone calls). \n\nKeep in mind that the game does encourage more than one playthrough, so some players might not get a whole lot of enjoyment (it's slower paced and has a few missable achievement) but I thoroughly enjoyed this one. I plan on coming back to reforge my fate with the Cosmic Wheel soon.",
      "Not For Broadcast is a good game... but it has some issues.\n\nThe story is really captivating; though the game does switch between humour and a serious story quite often, both are excellently done. Advance (the political party who ends up getting into power and becomes authoritarian) actually only gets into power in the first part of the game (the tutorial broadcast). You actually get to see the descent into authoritarianism and dystopia, which basically no other game (at least, any game I've ever played) has actually done, and not really any other forms of media either. You also get to influence some events in game [spoiler](for example, one of the ads you can play is an advertisement for a children's toy, and later there is an... incident... involving the toy, and (if you played the ad), the presenters of National Nightly News (Jeremy and Megan) state in a segment regarding the incident that they should never have advertised the toy.[/spoiler] It's a really minor thing, because you can just choose [i]not[/i] to play the ad, but I really love that detail), and having a noticeable impact on anything is really enjoyable.\n\nThe gameplay is mostly good. You basically just have to be on your toes, switching to different cameras every now and again, being ready to censor things, and being ready to go to the adverts. All basic tasks, but since you're doing most of them together, it relies on you being attentive and reactive. The only part of the gameplay I would criticize is the signal interference section. It's easy, and doesn't even really distract you, as you just have to move a slider up and down with a slight bit of delay. It's just not a fun part of the game.\n\nMy biggest gripe with the game has to be the lag; something which I know I'm not alone in experiencing. Online, it suggests closing down performance heavy tasks, such as web browsers, but I know for a fact that I had a few webpages up when I was playing the free prologue (the first broadcast, which gives a pretty good idea of what the game is), and experienced no issues at all. I really don't know what the coding differences between the paid version and the prologue of the game are, but that doesn't seem like it should be a difference. Generally the lag was irritating, but not something that hinders you in any way, but there is one level where you're advised to switch screens because naked protesters may pop up to protest Advance's policies. Visual lag, in this case, really isn't good. I also just got a windows pop up saying that the game was frozen, and so I had to close it down... not great.\n\nOverall; the gameplay is good, with really the exception of the interference task, and the story is excellent, but the technical issues are just... really, really irritating. I would recommend the game, but I would warn you that the technical issues do end up being quite irritating.\n\nOverall; the game is good, but the technical issues can be annoying.",

Snatch up this game and you won’t be disappointed. The only thing I’m disappointed in are my own reflexes, as I’m currently stuck in a few levels that are just way to hard for my taste.

      "Steam version Review (For veterans coming from the mobile version):\n\nHi everyone! I've been a long time fan, playing the game on mobile since 1.5 (Theory of everything)\nThe Steam version is great, because, PC versions are always better, so if you have the mobile version and you're looking to \"Upgrade\" your game, this is your ticket. I highly disagree with people who try to crack the game. Come on, what are 4 dollars just to support the person who made us this amazing game? With that said, I will list all the pros and cons, comparing to the mobile version:\nPros:\n-Obviously better graphics, the backgrounds look beautiful and the blocks are more detailed, you can also adjust graphics to your prefference, varying from quiality, windowed mode resolution, as well as some other adjustments.\n-The level editor interface is VERY comfortable, there's a shortcut key for EVERYTHING. Nothing compared to Bluestacks. Using the new layers mode, you can classify your objects of the level in groups, for example, you can use one layer for solid blocks, one for decor, one for effects, etc... Incredibly helpful, as this will prevent you from constantly fighting with the game, in order to select an object which is placed in the same location as others.\n-Gameplay is great. Multiple ways to jump, and keys to place and remove checkpoints on practice. Really looking foward to being able to make your own controls scheme on 2.1!\n-2 exclusive icons. 'Cause why not, exclusives are always good.\n-Incredibly faster online performance. On mobile, it' almost impossible to save your progress. On PC it's done quick, songs are downloaded fast, as well as levels.\n-Tired of your phone/tablet running out of battery but you want to keep playing? No longer a problem! Unless you don't pay your electricity service (Higly unlikely) or have laptop (Just play while plugged in).\n\nCons:\n\n-Obviously, this great version cannot be taken on the go, so... Back to mobile GD.\n\nAlas, I'm done. This version is amazing. Recommended 100% to every Geometry Dash mobile player and newcomer as well. Thanks for reading, hope this makes you decide to buy the game!\n10/10 -IGN",
      "Played the original back in 2017/2018, and I must say what a hell of a remaster, everything is enhanced, the visual the UI the user experience, its amazing to see this game in a fullscreen i can finally see the tiny details!",
      "I love the Disgaea series (I've owned every game).  I gladly paid full price when it initially came out on PS2.  As the years have gone by, release after release, I find that the core game is pretty much the same.  With that said, these iterative approaches should by no means be priced at what they are.  I'd be semi OK to buy these at $40.  For such a niche genre, the price needs to be more accessible for folks to really want to get into it.\n\nI liked my short time with it, but I'd only recommend it at half price.  Thumbs down for price, which outweighs the thumbs up for a good game.",
      "Stunning pixel art platformer where you will travel through different eras fighting hordes of enemies even using the ability to change time! Super recommended, a must try if you like platformers!",
      "1. What is \"Pyre\"?\nThe game \"Pyre\" was made by Supergiant Games and was released on the 25th of July in 2017. After \"Bastion\" and \"Transistor\" this is their third game. \"Pyre\" is an indie-action-rpg, which story is mostly told in form of a novel. The gameplay is very different to the experience you probably made in \"Bastion/Transistor\", which lead a few people to put a negative review on steam. Now you will no longer play as one single character like before, but you are responsible for a group of exiles. The gameplay at it´s heart can be declared as 3 parts:\n \npart 1 contains travelling/exploring the world\n\npart 2 contains social interactivity with your group (talking/trading/decision-making)\n\npart 3 contains to take part in the rites, that means a fast-paced action ball game (3 vs 3) without        a planning phase (like in \"Transistor\")\n\n\n2. Technical details\n-the game runs fine on my windows 10 64 bit machine and it needs about 8.2 gb space of your hard drive. Unfortunately the game runs bad on old machines, because you need about 4 gb ram to run it without an error (my other 3 gb ddr2-system couldn´t run it, I received a ram-error-message when starting the game).\n\n-controls with mouse+keyboard or gamepad are good and well implemented.\n\n\n3. What does the game do right?\n-great rpg-novel-mixture as a whole unique and emotional experience\n-despite the linear progression (mentioned \"phases/parts\" above) the game stays interesting enough to continue\n-a colourful and fantastic world to explore (no open-world)\n-great character-design and a good variety of different creatures, which affects the gameplay during the rites\n-beautiful artstyle with a lot of detail and smooth animations \n-believable and fleshed-out storyline (NOT \"black and white\") with a personalised ending! \n-wonderful soundtrack (mostly ambient)\n-the creatures of the world speak their own language, subtitle is displayed in old-fashioned English\n-rites: the thrilling-faced-paced-action-game has a lot of depth to it (skill tree/character selection/items/area of the rite)\n-selectable difficulty level (rites can be optionally restartet), which can be changed during the game (+ \"titan-mode\": advanced challenges you can add separately like in \"Bastion/Transistor\")\n-meaningful and emotional decisions to be made (I´m looking at you mass effect), thankfully there are no dead-ends but different endings (personalised!)\n-\"Pyre\" is \"2-3 times\" longer compared to \"Bastion\"/\"Transistor\" without getting boring\n-good mouse+keyboard and gamepad support\n-\"versus-mode\": you can play against friends together on your pc or alone against CPU (with all the characters in the game!)\n\n\n4. What does the game do wrong?\n-the fast-paced-gameplay during the rites can be very fast and too stressful at times (I experienced some unfair situations here and there)\n-controls are sometimes not precise enough, especially when the gameplay is getting hot\n-hardware requirements (like \"Transistor\") with 4 gb ddr-ram are over the top regarding old rigs with dual-core cpu´s \n-some minor bugs during the rites (ball gets stuck, switching between characters over distance, bad camera angles over distance)\n-\"versus mode\" can only be played as local multiplayer\n-no bonus material for fans at all \n\n\n5. tl;dr\nPyre offers a fantastic but linear action-rpg-experience with a great story, which is told in form of a novel with a personalised ending. The gameplay is a mixture of exploration, social interactivity and a 3 vs 3 ball-sports-game. The level of creativity considering world-building, character design, music and the way the story is being told is on an insanely high level. If you liked \"Bastion\" and \"Transistor\" you need to know that you don´t play just as one character anymore. But what you can expect is a game with a heart, just like their games before. Pyre is in my opinion a masterpiece and the best Supergiant game so far.\n\n\n6. Final thoughts\nAs a child of the 80´s I played a lot of pc games. Sometimes I look back and remember how I bought game boxes from a company called \"Lucas Arts\". There were times I didn´t even inform myself about the upcoming games, I just bought them because I loved their games I purchased before. For me Supergiant reached that status in the present time. \n\n\n\nUntil the stars align!\nIf you liked this review be sure to hit the like button to help other players with helpful reviews.

      "This one of the best first person shooter games I've ever played, plain and simple.\n\nHalf Life 2 begins 20 years after the original Half Life. As Gordon Freeman awakens from stasis he finds himself on a train heading to City 17 which is overrun by the combine. You find yourself as the leader of the resistance and you must take down the Combine. \n\nHalf Life 2 is at this point one of the best received games and I'm sure pretty much everyone has played it. If not well what the hell are you doing reading this review ? You need to go buy this game straight away and play it right now.\n\nThe game is a simple first person shooter, but it does plenty things different than the regular first person shooters. You have a health bar and you have to do platforming to solve some of the puzzles.  Not to mention the source engine physics are absolutely insane. \n\nFor a game that came out back in 2004 it still looks amazing. Now while it does have so low res textures it's still looks breath taking, like in the final chapters.\n\nThe game for the most part is pretty easy. I played through the game without a problem, even though some segments were tough due to the fast movement you have to pull off to avoid gunfire. Not to mention the Strider battles are incredibly intense and quite difficult.\n\nThe game took me 10 hours to finish. I felt this was the perfect amount of time for the price I paid for it and this was worth every single penny.\n\nApart from the single playthrough there's not much replay value. The only reason to replay it twice is to look for the G-Man Easter eggs. \n\nIn the end Half Life 2 is a fantastic game. It's a must own for everyone who is a gamer. This game is a piece of history and without a doubt one of the best games I have ever played in my entire life.\n\nI experienced zero problems while playing the game. I ran the game on ultra settings 60 FPS the entire time of playing. This game runs really well and should run on pretty much all systems.\n\nFinal Rating:\n9.5/10 -  A Must own and must play\n\nIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments what you disliked about the review.\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/snortsreviews#curation]here[/url] - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!",
      "I even set a calendar reminder so that I could get this on release. I wish I hadn't bothered. Going great guns until I got to the passage. Game over as I can't progress. Tried allsorts to drop the jammer but unable to do so. I guess it is a case of waiting for all the bugs to get resolved.",
      "I was reluctant to buy this because 2020 should be out in a few months but I couldn't pass up the deal I got. I am having a blast with this game! The presentation is wonderful, sense of speed is some of the best I've experienced, and the AI seems very human like so far. I was a little worried about the RPG elements and leveling up because I'm not really into stuff like that but it really isn't that much to worry about and I'm glad I got over myself. I've completed 2 weekends so far with default assists on and I'm currently 10 points behind 1st in the standings. I think it's time to take assists off. Oh I'm using a PS4 controller, by the way. I'll be happy to answer questions if you have any.\n\n***Update because it's super cheap with 2020 coming out soon. I still stand behind my OG review. Early reviews of 2020 indicates that there may be more realistic physics but could still use improvement. I say either get 19 now or wait for 20 to get discounted in a few months. No series is worth $60+ every single year.",
      "Something I've been needing to get off my chest, despite how much maxis and EA go on about how much they care for the LGBTQ community, it's clear to me that they don't. First if they did they wouldn't be pushing the community the whey and as hard as they have. When things get pushed like they are, hateful people just harden there harts more, and just become infuriated. The sympathetic the become hatful towards it. The more something gets pushed, after awhile the more it gets hatted. A better approach would be, (if they really did care,) would be to put what they are talking about into a FREE pack, and get people whom make amazing custom content to contribute to it. If there is enough nice stuff in the pack people will download it, and talk people whom are on the fence to download it, and maybe to come over, and might start to get the people on the other side to at least get on the fence. That whey the LGBTQ community would get there representation, and acceptance would be pushed in a whey that won't burn people out.\n\n\nAnother resin why they should do it like this, and is part of why people are getting mad, is that they bought this game a certain whey, paid a lot for it and it's DLC, now they are changing, it and braking it to do so. Changing the experience against there will. Evan something you love like chocolate, or bacon, or anything will become something you hate if it's shoved down your throat ageist you will. If you want people to take it just offer it, most of the time people will take it. And if they don't just make it just make it more appealing. IE instead of braking the main game to add something even the LGBTQ community can't enjoy with a broken game. Make a free pack, and to tempt more people to get the pack, just add more nice CAS and build mode stuff. And maybe update the pack and add more stuff to it every once in awhile.\n\n\nI just had to say this for two resins, one companies being this careless or ignorant is just killing the public sentiment for LGBTQ and similar groups. And two, they are just killing interest in what they are selling, it will cut the Sims 4's life short, and will cut the Sims 5's life much, much sorter. \nIt's good to give options, as long as they are options. Or you are just like Hennery Ford, “The people can have the model T in any color! so long as it's black.”\n",
      "Oh, that The Resident Evil (The RE)… One of the best stories in the gaming industry! The Capcom is well done that decided to remake games. Many players criticize The RE3, but I understand them, the game is quite short, there are no horror elements in the game. But the game has become easier, for example, a knife does not wear out. The players did not forget to criticize the Nemesis too, saying that there is no element of surprise and persecution, and there’s no sense of the constant presence of someone, who can mutilate you. The Nemesis means in English as “a good script”. However, the game creators tried to convey the atmosphere of The RE and the horror that the doomed city is filled with. Well-chosen actors, excellent voice acting, correctly conveyed the atmosphere of the city. I would add more moving elements on the destroyed streets of the city, like people or zombies\nTotal score: 8.5/10",
      "good game but later missions seem to be less polished ran in multiple bugs when playing as The Son enemies getting stuck in impossible to reach places and for some odd reason some characters have dog killing animations that for the most part are bugged and only work half the time causing an insta death and a retry don't even understand why later in the game you have to do animations to kill dogs as for basically the whole game you don't need to perform animations also seems to have some input lag throughout the whole game but overall its decent and when its on sale you should buy it.",

      "They added \"Precision\" mode for the mouse under controls, which is pretty much raw mouse movement. YAY!\n\nAnyway, one of my favorite games of all time easily at this point. Incredible story, fun combat, and awesome world. A must play for sure, especially if you've never played it before on Play-Station (like me). It also has a New Game Plus mode that unlocks different NG+ only armor that are insane.\n\nI played at normal, and aside from the Valkyries the other bosses are a cakewalk. Maybe play on hard or hardest.",

      "I'm severely disappointed whenever a game points at the stands and intends to hit a home run, and then instead smashes the pitcher out after the bat flies out of their hands.\n\nIt looks wonderful, it's relentlessly and uncompromisingly unique, and it plays like complete hell.\n\nUnreasonable difficulty, bordering on sadism, a unique idea let down by just-so-imprecise hitboxes and the feeling of being far too weak to take on anything.\n\nI haven't enjoyed this game, I can't recommend it to anyone else, if you buy it and find favour with it then bully for you, but I'll never understand how.",
      "no autosave, plus crashes, so if you put in several hours and never saved - you lost ALL the progress on ALL stages on a random crash, That makes me wanna quit the game and not play it anymore.

      "I only just found out about this game when it released. Saw a few videos and had to get it.\n\nI'm a musician, and instructor. Have been playin music for most my life and this game kicked my butt. \n\nThere's parts of each level that groove and feel \"right\" while a lot of the rest of the level doesn't seem to fit with the tempo/time signature, (each level number represents it's time signature). It frustrated me a LOT. I felt like the devs put in those groove sections to make it seem like a rhythm game but most the filler was just an out of time mess.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nThe more you learn about the mechanics, which are actually fairly complex for one button and stick, the more you'll apreciate how finely tuned this game is. So, a lot of the patterns don't exactly groove like typical rhythm games, but once you start feeling how all the more advanced scoring mechanics work together, you'll start feeling the music in really interesting ways.  It's hard to explain, haha.\n\nYes.... your thumbs will get sore playing this, like... seriously. But man.... when you nail sections and feel how it all fits together there's no comparison to how awesome it makes you feel.  \n\nThere's PLENTY of replay that can be had in this, plus the music will stick with you and make you want to play more just to hear it again.\n\nIt's worth the price.",
      "An interesting experience for RPGMaker vidya enthusiasts.\n\nBefore you pick up this title, be sure to download and play the demo, as the demo is the (free) first episode of the series, this game being the second episode.\n\nA Psychological Thriller, as stated in the description, is probably the best way to describe this series, an adventure through bizzare yet oddly pretty settings.\n\nThe first episode is quite a fun, humorous adventure, but still manages to be gripping and gut-wrenching in some areas. Difficult for me to describe in words, but it's free, so there's no reason not to play it.\n\nThe second episode strays from the fun, humorous side of things and focuses more on story, an unexpected yet completely welcome change of tone. If you enjoyed the first and got to like the characters, the second episode is well worth the price.\n\nFeel free to pick it up if it seems interesting to you.",
      "Events that took place:\n\nDid not want to sell player,\nGot an offer for said player,\nRejected the offer,\nPlayer demaned to be allowed to speak to the club,\nGot a second offer from said club,\nEssentially forced to accept the offer,\nPlayer reached an agreement with the club,\nWished player the \"best of luck\" in his future endeavours,\nPlayer is angry that he is leaving,\nPlayer considerers his new club a \"step down\" in his career,\nReminder: Player demanded to go to said club,\nMe finding solice in the fact that FM19 although lacking in the football department, delivers a brilliant experience in dealings with manic and psychotic people.\n\nAllow me to grant you an insight into SI's employee knowledge on the subject their games are about. I once engaged in a conversation with a developer at SI about FM, and football in general. After some talking about premier league, and me slightly confused, I eventually understood that this developer thought that Tottenham Hotspurs were located in Liverpool. So I posed him the following question: \"Then why do they call any matches between Tottenham and Arsenal the 'North London Derby'?\" to which he responded that he did not know, but he assured me that Tottenham F.C was located in Liverpool. I had to resort to showing him the borough of Tottenham in London for him to understand that Tottenham Hotspurs is not lovated in Liverpool, but in fact in London.\n\nThis will be the last edition of this game series I will ever purchase. In a football management simulator such as this, letting SI and their employees (including the one that responded to this review) tell you various aspects of football, is like having a pervert preach to you about the virtues of sexual absitence. They know nothing, and since the core game has not progressed the slightest in 10 years, it would be a fair assumption that they do not care neither.\n\nFuck SI, Fuck their beloved \"devs\" and fuck Charlton Heston while you're at it.",
      "I have not play for long, but know well enough this game deserves a mention. A side on, survival-ish game set in a war. Now, While I admire this game, it does have a few issues I personally find abnoxious.\nI'll start with those, and then will share what I like about it.\n\n-Characters you play seem to have never stolen anything at all from anyone, ever during the war. This is reflected in how unhappy and whiney they become caring more about the people they have taken from than their own wellbeing.\n\n-Characters you play are too softhearted. Just use the example with the point above. \n\n-Characters are expert carfters for being just average people. How many average people know how to pick locks, make servicable firearms and make alcoholic beverages? Well these three certain are capable of all three and more. For that matter, they all can do everything, but have one special skill they are the better at than the rest.\n\n-You get to only visit one building per night. This is bad since if you chose a building with other survivors in it, you will either need to steal from them to get supplies and be faced with a lot of unhappy complaining, or return home with nothing.\n\n-Visting other survivors, you cannot negotiate with them let alone talk to them. What you can do is beat them to death (or kill them with whatever weapon you happen to have on you at the time). I don't see how this was a good design choice at all when the characters you play are not personally that sort of people. Attacking other survivors is certain to cause problems with your characters.\n\n-You can not relocate from your starting place. What you start with is your base of operations.\n\n-Raids happen frequently to you only. You will never kill raiders, only chase them off and this happens behind the scenes, out of your control, while your character is out scavanging.\n\n-You can not sleep in shifts. If a person sleeps, they sleep the whole night.\n\n-Rediculous resource requirements. Some things require far too much, while others require far too little. \n\n-There is little to none interaction between your characters. No idle chatter between them. \n\n\nNow for the good points.\n-You play 3 characters to begin with, each having one specialty. They somewhat have different personalities.\n\n-The art style appeals to me.\n\n-Characters are well animated. Different staes of tiredness, different things they do when unhappy or when they have nothing else to do.\n\n-The overall idea, even though it isn't implemented well enough.\n\n-Building your shelter from ground up.\n\n-Forgaing and stealth play.\n\n\nSo while i find some issues with this game's design, if you ignore the lack of realism and consider this to be just a game with a very narrow play style, it is quite fine. It has a certain atmosphere you generally don't find elsewhere. I still recommend to give it a try.",
      "I bought the game and the mechanics are fun! The battle system is super impactful and just FEELS fun. It really gives you a sense of satisfaction. And it has interesting elements that really every game should have... but the UI sucks, the classes are genderlocked, and there are so many systems going on at once it's annoying. Like something as simple as a constant notification in the middle of the screen of some other person or random guild you know nothing about doing quests or getting skill points. It's a fun game, but has WAAAY too many minor (except genderlocked classes. Genderlock is never a minor thing) problems that just add up making it annoying to play",
      "[h1] Overview [/h1]\nThis is going to be a really long review, so I'm just going to start off with an overview of the whole game. For, one I really enjoyed playing it because of its unique playstyle and interesting storyline. This game kept me engaged the whole time and even though I finished the main storyline, I feel like there is sitll more for me to do. And one last thing, I won't be reviewing Multiplayer here, since I haven't played multiplayer yet.\n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\nThe storyline is definitely a strong point of this game. Rather than giving you evrything from the start, you get thrown into an unknown world with little known about the end of the game and the path that leads to it. You find out more progressively as you search and discover ruins to find ancient relics that give more clues about the past. However, you don't have to explore each area to its fullest potential the first time you enter the game, you can also come back to areas with fast travel (except for at the very end towards the conclusion of the game). The tombs you can raid are also kind of like side quests and the relics that you can find, both inside the tombs and around the map give you insight into the area and the main story. There are also several cut scenes that add onto the story and I thought the experience was a lot more directed than a game such as Skyrim, but it still provides a large amount of freedom.\n\n[h1]Level Design/Graphics [/h1]\nSpeaking of freedom and your ability to enjoy the world around you, I feel like this feeds perfectly into another aspect of the game. One of the most important parts of the modern game is the graphics engine with which it runs, as well as how it is exploited to provide the best experience. Though this Tomb Raider is undoubtedly older than what one would consider modern, I still find that it does a good job with shaders and keeping the world immersive. And though the textures, normals maps, and hair physics may not be the best I have ever seen, they are still very good. The cinematic cutscenes feel actually cinematic and everything seems to be smoothed out with animations which makes the experience itself a lot more enjoyable. I also really enjoyed how this game had well worked out levels, beautiful scenery, and a in fact a partially open world experience. Though some levels will collapse, break, and change once you go through them, other parts of the island are simply very enjoyable slow-paced worlds than can be explored once the game is over, which brings to my next point.\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\nLast, but not least I want to talk about gameplay (please keep in mind this review is directed at those interested in Tomb Raider for the single player experience). The gameplay was fluid and interseting. You have the parkour notion which is one of the biggest parts of the Tomb Raider series. This part doesn't seem to be too difficult in this game, but it certainly isn't easy either. Another portion is the shooter portion where a bunch of guys try to murder you and you protect yourself (because you don't want to die). However, the main part about this game in particular that I like, is that there isn't just one way to go about all this. Somtimes you can be sneaky and try and get around without being seen, or take out any guards before the sound an alarm. Another way is to just run into battle (which I wouldn't recommend). There are so many ways to make your way through the levels. And even though combat was for the most part repetetive, there were some new enemies introduced as the game proceeded, which made the game a bit harder, though not that much harder. The game also introduced new elements to the game as it proceeded which made the experience a bit more dynamic. However, every now and again, the game struggeled a bit with finding where to place the camera, and it gave me some confusing moments. Other times Lara (the main character) would not grab on to the zip line (and thus fall to her death). But other than that I don't really have any complaints.\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\nShould you buy this game? Yes, it will provide you with a great deal of fun, and you will definitely enjoy the experience.",

      "Go ahead and try to find something to criticize about this game. \n\nMaybe graphics scalability? Can you even be offended at that? The game does use polygonal graphics and what appears to be vertex lighting, but I think most integrated graphics chips can handle this amount of detail. Don't quote me on that one. Most systems out there can run this game no problem... If they are Windows systems.\n\nMaybe the friend requirement? Flipping through the manual yourself still provides an interesting experience. The entire game can be beaten with one person or with the participation of 20 or more people. How many games are like that?\n\nLack of voice chat feature? The game has full Steam support, making this a non-issue.\n\nLack of netcode? The design of the game makes this irrelevant. You don't even need an internet connection, but to initially download the game.\n\nFrustration? You can pick up or close the game at any time. Learning to play it without griping at others or being discouraged is probably good for your social health. It's far less frustrating or \"cheap\" than many modern games, too: bounding boxes in Dark Souls 2, spawns in flanking in Call of Duty, unreasonable level design in Hotline Miami 2. Bombs are self-contained puzzles and you lose only seconds if you make a mistake, not hours of effort. In fact, the more level-headed you are, the better you will be at the game.\n\nBrevity? This one I could see, but the main collection of bombs is only to introduce the mechanics and give some gimmicky setups in the first place. Once you complete it, you can free play whenever you want, as the design calls for well over 11^11 (that's about 2.9 * 10^11) variations. It's unlikely you will ever play the same bomb twice if your objective is variation.\n\nCost? It's $15 right now; if you go in with friends it's a drop in the bucket. I don't feel too bad about the development:cost differential, but I suppose that's up to personal preference.\n\nKeep Talking and Nobody explodes is an accessible, inexpensive, tightly designed game. Even if you've never played a party game or don't care for them, this one is a glimmering example. After hours of consideration, the only problem I can think of is that it seems to be Windows-only at the moment. Do you have Windows and some fraction of $15? Do you like fun games that reward skill, intelligence, and cooperation? If you said yes, it's time to buy.",
      "Hello Charlotte is not a game; it is a confessional.\nIf you're here you've probably already realized, but I wish to place massive emphasis that Hello Charlotte, and Hello Charlotte 3 especially, has very little gameplay, and what is present is very standard RPGMaker fare. If you are the kind to balk at visual novels, HC3 will not be your cup of tea. Watch a playthrough or something if you're interested, but don't expect any kind of engaging play.\nWith that said: Hello Charlotte 3 (and its DLC, Heaven's Gate) has been one of the most emotional, impactful pieces of art I've ever engaged with. It is horrifically honest, incorrigibly vulnerable, and, as previously stated-- more a confessional than a game. With everything I know how to say and with everything I have to say about it, I cannot find a way to truly articulate what Hello Charlotte made me feel (still makes me feel) and how it has affected me.\n\nHello Charlotte: Childhood's End is from the perspective not of the Charlotte of the previous two games, but a new, blank slate PC. While not necessary to play the previous two games, I strongly recommend it. It develops on the themes of the previous two games, and in doing so, completely recontextualizes them. C and Anri of HC2 return, as does Scarlett, though not in the forms we are accustomed to. We are finally given a full understanding on the nature of Charlotte and the False Realm, and what we are in relation to it.\netherane's art has markedly improved since the second game, with impressive sprite and background artwork, though their style is still recognizable. The music (some composed by etherane, others outsourced) is varied and distinctive. Most prominent about etherane's work, however, are the themes and writing, which have matured considerably since the release of HC2. Though often garish and on the nose, HC3 is a poignant commentary on the nature of art and fiction, the impact we have on one another, and our understanding of realness itself.\nYou will experience confusion. You will experience whiplash. The game intends to make you unsure and uncomfortable in its consumption, <i>deliberately</i> so. In the process it becomes a jarring, distinctive work of art unique to its creator and an important representation of the Millenial psyche. It's a psychological horror game and by God will it force you to experience psychological horror.",

      "[h1] Floppy Knights is just boat loads of fun. If you like tactics games, this is right up your alley. [/h1]\n[b]The Good:[/b] \nThe art style. It is just so fun and creative. From the different faces that Carlton, your AI arm and best friend makes, to the enemies, even including the fully drawn cutscenes.\nThe dialogue. Everything that is said between Phoebe, Carlton, and others is tons of fun and gives plenty of plot to be invested in it. Plenty of jokes.\nThe combat, units, and general gameplay. You build a deck of up to 30 cards with a mixture of effects ranging from straight up buffing your units (or dealing damage to them with positive side effects!), to creating lots of card draw. Every turn, you draw 5 cards and your commander generates it's own card every turn. These feel unique, while not being too many of them to create bloat. You can even swap between sets of decks that you have built before you start a level, allowing you different options to quickly switch up your play style. \nThe music. There is enough of a variation of music that has a quick beat to it, that it keeps you wanting more. The songs along, ESPECIALLY the boss music, had me tapping my foot alongside it the whole time.\n[b]The Bad[/b]\nYes, every game isn't perfect. However the singular real flaw I have found is one singular bug that the devs state is rare, and it really didn't affect my gameplay at all. I wasn't able to interact with something on a map, however I was still able to clear the level. The fix was just a simple reboot, and after that I literally haven't encountered it once, at all. They are aware of it and are working on it!\n[b]The Subjective[/b]\nI'm not super great at tactics games, sometimes really taking my time or making stupid decisions. The game's difficulty to myself is fairly difficult later on, however after sitting back, thinking, and playing tactically (hah go figure!), I'm able to overcome the objective by planning around different units and synergies with the cards. There is always a factor of RNG within games that have deck building, but you can always squish the size of your deck if you so choose to.\n[b]Overall[/b]\nI would EXTREMELY recommend this game to pretty much anyone who likes turn based games that require thinking. If you aren't sure if you like tactics style games, I would HIGHLY recommend picking this up and trying it out. You won't regret it!",
      "Ah yes, the infamous Saturn Quest, the only 3 game series that has 3 fans and maybe 30 sold copies put together (I imagine it's not exact but very close). Part bullet hell, part space shooter, part boss rush, some platforming here and there, and even some puzzles with exploration - so take that intuitive game design. Once again I feel like I have to thank the developer for this rather personal gift, I take it personally because only a few of us still follow these games, and I imagine the dev is well aware of its lack of appeal. As with other Arkhouse games, I don't play them because they are good games, I am playing them for the experience, strange art, unique soundtrack, and just the world that I can't truly explain. \n\nI was just about to say that Arkhouse finally made a game with fair difficulty and learned from his mistakes - yep spoke too soon, it's a nightmare, a test of patience like it always is, 5 games back to back, shoving a hot ____ __ __ ___, absolute torture, no mercy, only illusion of hope and a false sense of security. I can just see myself from 3 years ago, yea Beetle, we have been through this before you know, stop acting like you're surprised. It started so relaxing though, almost self-aware of his mistakes in a way, even kinda playful which is not something that I usually get from these games, but yea, eventually the game ramps up the difficulty to what I consider a \"let me play something else\" tier. Actually, I will say the difficulty in this game is kinda more reasonable, but at the same time,  it's not any easier than the previous 2 just because some of the boss fights are so time-consuming, plus some of the space stages are just BS, they always are with this dev. \n\nYea, if you did not like Arkhouse games before, this probably won't change your mind, I just think the first half of this game is a lot more accessible, not as intense as some of the other entries, and I actually really like some of the interactions in the narrative (if you want to call it narrative, there is a little twist this time), it seems the developer is more aware of his tropes now, implementing them in a more enjoyable way. Overall, whenever this game changes the genre I feel like it has a better sense of direction and purpose, whereas in previous Saturn games it was done just for the \"hey, look at my artsy game\".\n\nI will say that there are individual parts of this game that are well above other games from this developer in terms of being mesmerizing with beautiful pixel art, plus the music this time is absolutely stellar which is a huge upgrade from the second game. The only nitpick I have is that a lot of bosses look similar now, I actually kinda liked the design in the first game a little more. There is a pretty cool twist on the combat system, you do not just dodge bullets and hump the bosses now, but you can also build turrets and other support structures, it's kind of a cool idea, but it also makes it more confusing at first.\n\n[h1] Pros: [/h1]\n\n(+) I think there are moments in this game that would make it the best Arkhouse game in terms of visuals, music, atmosphere, and even how the game interacts with you, I actually think the world is a lot more playful this time around. It feels like the developer is a bit more self-aware, I always ***** about his game design, but it seems there is an \"attempt\" to use it to the game's advantage.\n\n(+) As with any game from this developer, you do get something a little different from your typical video game, and this game is no exception. It seems the developer believes he was at the height of his creative power, and I can see that. It's probably the most realized game in his collection, although it's probably not the most compelling story (I think Cube Gothic beats it slightly), there is a better sense of creative direction, and aside from a few unfair difficulty spikes, I think the game almost feels like a crazy art museum, more so than just another game.\n\n(+) I actually like how you handled the narrative this time, kinda committed to that Saturn Language joke, which worked for me personally, and I will tell you, I 100% understand those conversations and exactly what is being told - not really. I like all of the dev-to-player interactions with the hints, didn't expect much humor in this game after the first 2.\n\n(+) You know, I think that turret thing was a really cool idea and it builds upon the previous game, it just does not work that well in all situations, often making the boss fights very long, but I do like the added layer of complexity. \n\n[h1] Feedback: [/h1]\n\nHere let me copy/paste my feedback from the last 5 games. You know what, I am not doing it again, it is what it is, it will never change, stay toasty Arkhouse, you might be crazy ******, but I still can't live without you. Okay you know what, put a jump on a dedicated button, one day right, not today, and probably not next game. It's a joke I know you won't do it.\n\n[b] Overall Thoughts: 8/10 (this is a diehard fan score okay, I am aware of my biased here, I like it personally, and I am sure most people will hate this game with a passion) [/b]\n\nIn the spirit of this game I will put my final thoughts in the only language this dev understands.

      "Remember the way Monkey Island 2 ended? That weird mess that confused the hell outta everybody? Well, the first 15 minutes of this game manage to \"save\" it completely and suddenly, it all makes sense.\n\nAnd this is just one reason (out of many, many reasons I will experience as I play this game, I believe) you owe it to yourself to play RtMI. \nThank you, Ron!\n\nEDIT: 3+ hours in and I love it! The music is there, the humor is there, and it's the perfect combination of nostalgia and fresh. The puzzles so far are fun and the inclusion of a hint book as an inventory item that never gets in your way is rather clever. Oh, and I love the trivia book! Really tests your knowledge of the series! \n\nYou can clearly tell that this game is a labor of love. And the art style - love it or hate it - simply works when you see it in motion.\n\nEDIT 2: Have a drink whenever someone mentions \"The Secret of Monkey Island\". Now there's an idea for a party game that will get everyone drunk! :D",
      "I do think the Mixed review rating is justified, but for the wrong reasons.\nHere are a few pro's and con's from someone who's been a long-time fan and played every Dirt game except the first one.\n\nPRO:\n+ Handling and physics are alright on both \"Gamer\" and \"Simulation\" settings\n+ Decent soundtrack\n+ Building and leveling up your staff and garage gives the game more depth\n\nCON:\n- Horrendously inconsistent AI. In roughly 15 years of playing racing games I've never seen AI as inconsistent as in this game. I played on \"Tough\" and could complete some races with a 10+ second gap, while others were quite literally impossible. This is because of the auto generated track system - unlike in the previous Dirt games, the AI never actually drives on the track, but stage times are auto-generated by how an AI *would* likely perform on a stage. \n- Lack of tracks / Boring tracks. As mentioned, there are no proper tracks for Rally events as they are auto-generated. While the tech behind it is quite impressive, this leaves most tracks feeling incredibly dull with no highlights or features whatsoever. Remember the cool cliff sides from Greece in Dirt Rally? None of these here. Essentially all tracks feel the same no matter what the location is. Couple that with the fact that there are only 5 locations and you'll find yourself bored quite quickly. Rallycross and Landrush tracks are not auto generated, but feel incredibly boring and forgettable. Baja or Malaysia in Dirt 2 were such a blast, but Dirt 4? Yawn.\n- Historical Rally. In its entirety. It's just normal Rally with older cars, but after a while I refused to continue this event type as the events are dragged out as hell. Near the middle you'll have to complete 12 events with each 5 stages. That's 60 stages in total. Consider my previous point about tracks feeling dull and I can't help but wonder who actually completed all these events. This seems to be a Codemasters thing though as I had the same issue with Grid Autosport.\n- Menuing. Why is it that I need to go out of the career every time I want to buy a car? Why is selecting sponsors (which you'll do often as they expire after awhile) in the same category where you can customize your car? Everything is a huge mess and finding the right things took me more time than it should every time.\n+ Lack of rewards. I actually found Joyride, which isn't part of the main career, to be the most fun thing to do in the game. Even though the events in Joyride repeat frequently but with different cars, it was a proper challenge compared to the career and is somehow quite addicting. The issue with it is that it's meaningless to complete. You don't get anything for getting a Gold medal on everything, not even new liveries or, heck, even an achievement. It's utterly pointless.\n\nAll in all this game is easily the weakest entry in the franchise (minus Dirt 1 maybe, but that one had a way smaller budget). To top it off it just feels like this game has no soul either. I vividly remember Dirt 2's gritty and colorful presentation, while this one lacks anything I could remember the game by. Really all this game made me want to do is play Dirt 2 or Dirt Rally again. Cheers and thanks for reading.",
      "So, I've been playing games for 36 year now. All the genres, like them all. Most of all RPG, turn based strategies, WW2 shooters (BF) etc. And just achieved victory in Slay the spire, after 206 hours of hugely enjoyable play. I would say this is in top 5 games of all times for me. Maybe even top 2, together with Card Hunter. Those two games are so far the two games I would take to a deserted island.

Like how the servers with anti-cheat and server saving (which doesn't save player status/location) functions enabled kick all players from the server every 30-60 minutes.

      "Looks like a game for children, but underneath the friendliness there is a great challenge! Move on the rhythm of good songs on a note bar! \n\n[h2]Swim! Swim little tredpole!

Through various rivers and waters you journey, and eventually save your pond from a disaster that will occur. \nEverything in the river translates to an instrument tone and respects the height on the note bar. The primary goal is to reach the finish. The melody is depicted as little mines which hurt your health if you swim across one. Along the way you can collect points by collecting bubbles (with a bonus if you collect them all), little bubbles, health packs, and you can slap your tail on bamboo or cymbals that launch you in the air!

      "UGH! The scariest thing about this game is that someone at Steam okayed it for being released. Absolute garbage! Frustrating as heck and not fun in the least bit. If you want a scare, you might accidentally get one through a jumpscare, but don't count on it. Avoid this game at all costs, even if its free, I would be hesitant to recommend downloading this pile of crap. You'll spend the entire time just trying to find things to click on, and when you do, you're rewarded with? some of the worst animations ever to be found in gaming",
      "This game is adrenaline, speed and acid to the absolute maximum and it delivers - you'll be doing exactly what you see in the trailers in absolutely no time and feeling like a badass!\n\nWe have all the menu, leaderboards and replay system as in Devil Daggers along with a new clips section for highlights from runs. \nThe new scoring system is a HUGE improvement. In DD you had to survive as long as possible leading to it becoming repetitive as you grinded, here the score is based on how fast you can kill stuff and there is an ending to the run meaning you might survive to the end and kill the boss - but someone else could beat your score by killing stuff faster in the first min and then dying. \nThis adds loads more risk to the game as you WANT to take those risks to kill stuff faster.\n\nOnly let down is the controls, the simple control scheme worked in Devil daggers as there wasn't much going on but it REALLY hurts now theres so many new mechanics causing both a lot of unintended actions like with RMB is your laser and you can scatter this off the ground or like you see in the trailers shoot the gems for your homing daggers trouble is RMB is also grab meaning if you look at a gem and start to power your laser you simple pick up the gem and no laser huge momentum loss. Likewise spacebar is jump, dash, slide, fake and air slam this not only leads to awkward \"thats not what i wanted\" moments but also cramps my hand since you are constantly spamming for dash which is 2 presses...\n\nIf the controls dont bother you or get some love this game is easily a 10/10.",

      "You probably have to be a dedicated wargamer to remember Fields of Glory, a turn-based strategy series that covered almost every era of ancient warfare. The historical scope was deep and wide, but the rules and features were shallow and anorexic... just saying. The game needed an overhaul. The graphics needed a facelift, and the gameplay and ruleset needed growth hormones. This game addresses those issues definitively.\n\nIt was a matter of bringing the game over to the Battle Academy engine, Which in my opinion is one of the most robust tbs platforms out there. It handles WW2 games, fantasy games like Hell, Sci-Fi with Sanctus Reach, and historical wargames Pike and Shot and Sengoku Jidai. I'm assuming that, like the old FoG, this game will eventually have a slew of historical skins DLC. Everything will be overpriced and never go on sale, but if you're a fan of any of the games above like me, you'll bite the hook... like me.\n\nThe mechanics and rules of the game work almost the exact same way as Pike and Shot and Sengoku Jidai, not the old FoG. It's lazy but it works. If you've played either, you won't need the tutorial. You'd also recognize the soft pastel, almost cartoony maps. The game looks much better than previous games. The rigid, boxey blob models are gone, replaced by units that shuffle nervously, taunt their foes, and continue swinging at each other in between turns. It's a Slitherine tbs that actually feels alive and breathing.    \n\nIt's a straight up, left-click only tbs. You'll have a command unit with a command range, units outside of which will suffer a penalty. Units have zones of control. Once engaged in melee, units won't disengage, but will continue fighting each turn until one breaks. Victorious units may compulsively pursue routed foes, even disappearing off the map, never to be seen again...Units gain advantages and suffer penalties based on terrain and morale. Units get buffs for adjacent allies, and penalties if those allies are routed. There are bonuses for flanking, charging, and fighting on the high ground. There is no experience gain, no upgrades or leveling, and no rpg elements.\n\nAll the elements you'd expect from a good tbs are here, implemented in an approachable, almost casual way that you can enjoy without having to put down your drink or jazz cigarette. Turn based tacticians should approve. 8/10",
      "I like furry art, but first and foremost im a RPG gamer, and as such I will rend judgment impartially. \n\nThe story is not bad, but still falls in the average category and it is predictable, gameplay is the same as the first Fuga (I have no problems there) but there are few new enemies,  so the strategy to beat the regular battles is very repetitive. My biggest complain remains the same since Tail Concerto and it is the dificulty... which is way too easy, there is no hard / nightmare mode for veteran players, Im not asking to die repeatedly like in dark souls but Cyberconnect2 needs to understand some players like a challenge in their games.\n\nMusic is ok and Hack is the best character of the lot (Tah tah tah tah  taaah!!!!!) I would play Fuga 3 just for him.\n\nIt pains me to give the thumbs down, but Cyberconnect2 needs to work a little harder.",
      "136 hours, 49/49 achievements - sounds like just enough for the review.\n\nIt is indeed complete package. Brilliant characters, neatly constructed plot and enjoyable gameplay with the classic \"easy to play, hard to master\" aspect to it.\n\nI really can't pick at the graphics or music - they are just in line with the Supergaint roster, crafted at the level we have come to expect.\n\nIs there anything substantial that I would change? Not really, no. Adjustment to the \"progress\" in the one place, perhaps some slight balancing elsewhere... But does it matter when taking everything into account? Nope, not at all.\n\nEasy recommendation.",

      "Nobody will read my review, so i'll just say i'm gay",
      "I got this game for $12 off humble bundle. Me and my friends play it for hours on end. This game honestly feels like the perfect fighting game for me because there is no set style. I don't have to remember specific combos or any crazy inputs. It's just simplicity. Unless you want to do that in which you can. But it's fun for anyone. If I were you I would get it off of humble bundle for $12.",
      "I would give this a mixed rating if I could. \nThe story is told in such a boring way that it's hard to stay invested. You run to one person, listen to a cutscene, or more likely read a cutscene, than go to another person to talk to. Sometimes you fight one guy but mostly it's pretty dull. There is very little gameplay in the overland content and everything plays like a bad visual novel.\n\nAAR, the first MSQ is just one fetch quest after the other with little story in it. Oh there is some story there, but it's not great. The characters are shallow with few expectations, both the supporting cast and villains. \n\nHeavensward, the expansion I got through before my time ran out, is better than ARR but not that enjoyable. There were parts I like (not to give spoilers, it was the part where you go on a “journey”) Sadly, that part of the expansion was far too short. Than the story precedes to shove itself up it’s own ass as it becomes fixated on one part of the lore. [spoiler]I don’t give a damn how the war started! It was a thousand years ago.[/spoiler]\nPro:\n-If you like story, and only story, you will like this game.\n-A lot of content\n-Trial fights. (Good boss fights without the boring part of dungeons)\n\nCons:\n-Little in the way of gameplay outside of dungeons and trials \n-ARR is a slog and not worth reading. Skip as fast as you can and just watch a recap video.\n-dungeons are locked behind the story and not unlocked as you level up.\n-The story is on the lower end of other final fantasy games.\n-Lalafells are in the game. People who play this race are degenerates.",
      "Honestly this game feels like it was made for me.\nQuoting iron pineapple:\"this guy (the dev) just gets it\". And he really does! The level design is great and the areas are cool and unique and a real joy to explore! A really slick zelda-like souls-like-ish game. \nBut that's not all.\nThe gimmick of this game, and the thing that really sets it apart and makes it go above the rest, is the manual. The whole gimmick is that the game is written, mostly, in an unknown runic language, forcing the player to figure out game mechanics, progression and puzzles on their own. You have only one thing to help you: as you progress you collect pages of a manual, in the style of those old console games, which gives you again pseudo-cryptic hints, because it's also mostly in the other language.\nThe way the manual and the knowledge based progression flow into the design of the game is nothing short of genius. It's hard to gosh about just how amazing it is, because that would be spoiling it, but it's completely genius. \nGame's a masterpiece for me, a strange mesh of Hollow Knight  meets  Outer Wilds-based knowledge progression. \nDefinitely a must-buy, don't even worry about it going on a sale, it's an easy indie GOTY for me",
      "This game is really special. I'm a 50 year old man with an emotional structure made largely of mud and thumbtacks, and I had to bite the inside of my jaw in a parts to keep from tearing up. \n\nMany people seem to equate an \"adult game\" with gore and violence or explicit imagery. Nothing wrong with those types of games, I have and will continue to enjoy them. This game explores mature themes on relationships and mortality and doesn't pull any punches, without being cheap or manipulative. In that sense, its the most adult game I've ever played. \n\nI won't ever forget it. If this sounds like something you'd be interested in, stop reading and buy it. Its a slow burn, and you won't be invested until you've spent some time with the characters in the story. In the end, the payoff is tremendous.",
      "Do yourself a favor if you get eye-strain or nauseated from the forced motion blur and/or the chromatic aberration and go to %appdata%/Local/FinchGame/Saved/Config/WindowsNoEditor and open the \"Engine.ini\" file and copy in the following:\n\n[/Script/Engine.RendererSettings]\nr.SceneColorFringe.Max=0\nr.DefaultFeature.MotionBlur=0\n\nThis will disable both effects which in my case completely removed any strain I was having.",
      "[h1] The First \"Fun\" game, after a long time\t[/h1]\n\nHours upon hours have I tirelessly spent on games I didn't thoroughly enjoy. Needlessly competitive games like MOBAS and PvP games leaves an emotional toll of helpless frustration and unfullfillment that makes it feel mentally unhealthy to be a part of.\n\nOnly after playing The Messenger did I realise how long It's been since I played a game for the genuinely fun and exciting experience it was meant to be.\n\nAnd how much I've missed it.\n\nThe Messenger offers an adventure with controls running as tight and comfortable as the spandex pants worn by Ryu Hayabusa. Accompanied by \"unexpectantly likable\" characters, the shopkeeper in particular. With his selfdepricating/ 4:th wall breaking/ life advising humour about us being the main character and should probably be out saving the world instead of spamming his \"chat\" 30 times just to see if the dialogue changes. Only to punish us with a long, \"boring\" and unskippable dialogue.\n\nI didn't regret a single second I spent bothering him and it still amazes me how self-aware the game is and how It uses the knowledge in a way that makes the game all the more fun to play. Like putting less emphasis on the story and more on entertaining dialogues and scenarios.\n\nThe levels are varied with enemies being used as both obstacles and tools to help manuvering through levels that gradually gets more difficult, as they're pushing the boundaries on how the game can be interacted with.\n\nVisually and auditory, The Messenger presents itself in a pixelated format, all 16-bits included, but It doesn't stop there. The game takes place in two seperate timelines that you'll easily travel to through portals scattered about. Moving though one timeline could present a path unavailable in the other. This mechanic is sometimes included to get through certain areas. But my point is, not only does the game look and sound great. The different timelines are also created with a seperate artstyle. Yes, both the looks and sound instantly switch when going through a timeportal. Creating cool moments were you'll have to go though the flow of the levels, even through time.\n\nSo the game turned out to be about a time traveling Ninja who needs to deliver a message in order to save the world.\n\nI had a great time playing this and there's no doubt you'll feel the same. It's just a shame how easily it is to overlook it as something less than what it truly is, how it can easily go unnoticed among the thousands of titles here on steam.\n\nOne last thing.\nI'd like to thank the passionate people who crafted this game and I appreciate the publisher for signing it which helped them get noticed. You people have made something truly awesome and I'm looking forward to anything you'll do next.",
      "I bought this piece of shit with 50 other games.\nIt is as if some great sculptor , sculpted out of a great feculence.\nI do honestly admire your efforts. If such a dung was made in the 90s\nI am sure it would have succeeded to a most part very very small percent of \npeople would have been tricked into purchasing this. I had to leave it running for\n2 more minutes just to warn you about this defecation.\n\nI insist not to play this as it literally is breaking your steam game playing aparatus.\nI am not sure how this technical disgrace got passed steam as it literally damages your\nequipment steam could have green lit any of the other great games out there or taken a deuce OR both du duns, Whoever made this did not try to fix any of it's many flaws. They just said\nthis magnificent excrement is done and as many secretious BM it runs on steam. 0/10",
      "the game itself is pretty ok and fun for what it is, and runs great on deck. but man, F**K THE ALWAYS-ONLINE-DRM WHICH AT TIMES TAKES AGES TO CONNECT, GETTING THE GAME STUCK IN THE MENU WITH NOTHING TO DO!!\n\n>> Update after 20h played:\nI really enjoy playing the game. It is good, it is fun and runs great on the Steam Deck, which is especially important to me, as I tend to travel a lot as part of my job.\n\nThat being said, however, is core of the issue: The Always-On-DRM actually prevents me from playing this game on the go. Having this sort of DRM is, in my opinion, only predatory and inexcusable in any way. I get that the online-components of the game will not work when I am on the move, but I am mainly interested in the single player experience, from which I am also locked out. I am even locked out of the main menu without a stable internet collection, which is just ridiculous.",
      "G.A.R.B.A.G.E\n\nuhm idk man, it was but it just isn't, you know? because I don't know??? lots of bugs, cinematics are rushed, game is rigged, friends cheat... FUCKS THIS SHIET",
      "It's CSS.  Nothing fancy about it. Old graphics, slow gameplay, and nothing really to play for except for skins to sell.  I'll stick with Battlefield series.",
      "Where's the atmosphere the first two games had?\nWhy can I only have 2 weapons at any time?\nWhy is this game a generic shooter?\nIf the game they had shown in so many videos previous to the release had come out, it'd have been a masterpiece, instead we got a severely watered down version of it.\nIt's a corridor shooter for the most part, with some parts where you're in a bigger room instead, really what I played the first two games for.",
      "Before you buy: What you enjoy about Her Story (and maybe Telling lies) will very much affect your enjoyment of this game. \n\nIf you enjoyed the acting, the non-linear story telling, and the *movie* part of those games, this will probably be the best in the trilogy. HOWEVER, if you enjoy the detective aspect, the puzzles, the mental challenge, this game is probably not for you.\n\nThe gameplay is a big departure compared to Her Story and Telling Lies, and in my opinion, doesn't make for much of a challenge at all. In the 10 hours I spent on the game, 9 were just me watching clips and clicking random objects in the background. I found the actual movie stuff to be really fun (and especially seeing the process of how movies are made), but that kind of fun is very different to the kind I had with the previous two games.\n\nI don't dislike the game but I don't recommend it either, at least to a decent chunk of the fanbase (those being fans of detective puzzle games).",
      "100%'ed the LUCT version of the game and I'm slowly working my way through this version now.\n\nOver all the game itself is solid. If you're reading this, its a brilliant tactics game that helped define the genre. However most of the changes they made in reborn, while innovative, ultimately feel constraining. \n\nFor example, they've limited spell slots to 4, so you can only ever take 4 different spells. One or two of which (missile + indirect) are taken by a damage spell of your choice, leaving you with even less spell customization than you'd think. And its unfortunately the same situation with skills, as one will always be taken up by your weapon skill. \n\nThe cards that drop in battle, while an interesting system on paper, just end up cluttering the field most of the time, often with auto-skill activation up, which most of your units won't even really want compared to the other options. \n\nRandom battles were also removed, limiting chances to recruit to a few key dungeons as well as removing some of the more amusing battle locations from the game. \n\nI've also seen some people complain about the level cap, but in my current play-though of the game, it isn't too much of a concern for me, but it may be for others. \n\nOver all, it just feels like they've taken a step back from what Tactics ogre: Let us cling together, gave us. Yes there's bloat in that version, but it also gave us a feeling of freedom when we were putting our teams together that this version lacks. I am grateful that we saw a remake of this game within my lifetime, but I wish they had improved on Luct, rather than take steps back from it. \n\nIf they ever increase the amount of spells and/or skills you can take, to like 6-8, then I'd probably switch my review to a yes. But until then, with a heavy heart I have to say that this version just isn't as good as Luct so far.",
      "It's hard to review a game like this.\n\nAs a game in it's own right, if you've never played it before, it's a good game. Typical crazy Final Fantasy story (although it takes a bit to get into it), interesting characters, and simple but fun real-time turn-based combat. Final Fantasy games are known for their stories and characters, which are great in this member of the series.\n\nIf you've played the game before on PS1, then it's good for nostalgia. However, many people complain about it being a bad port. It has built-in cheats, in case you just want to be able to enjoy the story, characters, and side-quests. I played this years ago on PS1, and I really enjoyed my trip down memory lane with this game.\n\nIf you're an achievement hunter, this game is horrible. There are achievements that, unless you're literally following an online scripted step-by-step walkthrough, you will miss some random little thing, not know it, and then have to play the entire game over. Another achievement requires you to speed through the game in under 12 hours, which means you will grind through the game you already played, watching the same story you just watched, all over again, wasting six hours (that's how long it took me), just for the sake of one achievement... There's also another achievement to kill 10k enemies. when you can play the whole game and not even kill 1k enemies... You might think, \"oh they just want you to play the game through 10 times then\". No. It's 10k enemies in one playthrough. You run out of content, and have nothing to do, except grind battles, for literally dozens of hours. It's terrible.\n\nDespite my bitterness about the achievements, it's a really enjoyable game. Considering the FF series are mainly known for their stories, it lives up to its reputation. If you're an RPG fan, this is definitely on the list of \"must plays\".",
      "Coming from Monster Hunter World, I didn't like it for the following reasons:\n\n- WAY more anime than World. I could overlook the weird anime stuff from World because it was more subtle, but in Rise it is so in your face at all times. Matter of taste, but for me it made the game insufferable\n\n- tiny maps. I know that this is a return to old-school maps, made for portable. But coming from World it seems like a massive downgrade\n\n- graphics and ambience downgraded. Again, I know that this is because it's designed for Switch, but it doesn't change the fact that it feels like a huge step backwards\n\n- grapple zip thing. It's flashy and fast, but I felt that it takes a lot away from the methodical feel of the game. Makes the game feel more arcade\n\nMost of my complaints are based on taste, but for anyone without much MH experience before World, it's going to feel like a step back.",
      "This game is shit, and the devs should eat shit for shitting this shit on top of gamer community's head.\nCombat? You need a piano keyboard to dodgeparryhitlowhithighlowthendodge. Its a clusterfuck! Reaction time? None. I tried to dodge, I got damaged, Parry same story. And don't get me started on fucking archery! HELLOO ITS 2021, PUT A FUCKING CROSSHAIR so I can hit something !!\n\nWow, what a piece of shit. 18 hours of my life spent TRYING to make sense of this clusterfuck of a game. Pity I can't get a refund AND throw dung at this whitewashed game, like people did to Deuscht.\n\nI hope you devs sit on it and rotate.\n",
      "One of the most likable FPS game in recent years.\nGreat for free roaming and exploring and the combat is challenging enough to keep one on their toes.\n\nAnd, surprising, has a very good story to it.\n\nBest Far Cry to date.",
      "While still a work very much in progress, Nuclear Throne is currently one of my favorite games. It's a roguelike dungeon crawler with heavy \"bullet-hell\" elements and a little RPG sprinkled on top. When you begin a session of Nuclear Throne, you choose from one of several well-designed & freakish \"mutants\", each with their own special attributes which, in itself, does much to add variety (there's also a random-select option which is a fun idea in this particular case). The goal of each stage is to exterminate all of the enemies. After doing so, a portal opens which takes your mutant freak to the next level. There are a great many weapons with which to inflict meyhem on your adversaries. As you gain experience points, in the form of green goo earned by killing enemies & also found in cache jars, you'll be able to choose new persistent perks for your character (such as more HP or certain weapons doing more damage). Every so-often, you'll encounter a boss. The bosses tend to pop in during the height of an already-in-progress battle which makes beating them all-the-more difficult & hectic.\n\nOriginally, this game did not have controller support which was a great disappointment (though I had been ejoying it anyway, using the keyboard and mouse). However, a recent update rectified this and the gameplay using a dual-analog controller (such as that of the Xbox 360) is just fantastic. Like Ultratron before it (another very similar game which is also worth a look; I also wrote a review for it, if you're interested in checking it out), Nuclear Throne throws you straight back to the arcades of yore and plops you in front of a Smash TV cabinet.\n\nAs a roguelike dungeon-crawler, the replay value is extremely high (due to the fact that the level and enemy layout is totally different from one session to the next). The rather extreme difficulty doesn't hurt either, as playing entails dying and thus restarting... a lot. Fortunately, said difficulty isn't of the variety that compels you to smash your controller/keyboard in frustration. Every death feels like the fault lay squarely on *your* shoulders (if only you had moved to dodge a little faster or conserved ammo a little better!), as opposed to the game feeling like it's cheating. Another stand-out feature which I think I need to bring up is the soundtrack. ...Just wow! Nuclear Throne's score is totally original and extremely surreal. It goes *miles* in lending its own atmosphere to the game. \n\nSome might consider the current price of $12.99 to be just a *little* steep for a game in this class, but considering how well it's made overall and the fun I've gotten from it (especially being in its currently pre-release/beta state), I consider it to be well worth the price. As of the time of this writing, the developer(s) is very active and updates are coming quite frequently.\n\nUPDATE 01/12/16: I hadn't played this game in quite a while (at least 6+ months) and I wanted to check out the progress that the devs have made, etc. Well... The game starts but as soon as I select a character, it totally locks up. I can't play it at all. To make matters worse, I've heard that the devs have since \"abandoned\" development of this game (so it's not likely that whatever is causing the crashes for me is going to be fixed any time soon - or ever). Bummer man. I loved this game...",

      "In a world where \"enhanced edition\" has started to be synonymous with \"will run on modern hardware if you shell out $20\" it's absolutely refreshing to see Larian deliver this masterpiece free of charge to owners of the original. You start out with an already fantastic game that's received numerous game of the year and editor's choice awards. Then you spend a year polishing that game, and adding new features. The result is brilliant Enhanced Edtion of an already fantastic game.\n\nNew features for EE:\n[list]\n[*] Fully voice acted - Every line of dialog now has voice acting. The voice acting is really good too\n[*] Dual wield - Rogues now look more iconic with the ability to dual wield\n[*] Grenades - You can craft and throw various sorts of grenades. \n[*] Tactician Mode - A new  challenging mode where encounters are redesigned to be harder by adding new spells and enemies into the mix. Classic mode still available obviously.\n[*] Split screen co-op \n[*] Controller support\n[*] Updated graphics - The UI is totally reworked, the graphics are updated, and spells have new effects\n[*] Updates to the story  - The story, esepcially the ending, was rewritten a bit to clear up some confusing aspects\n[/list]\n\nI'm sure there's more, but really these ought to be reason enough to play this game.",
      "Hoooh boy, this game sneaks up on you! It seems like any other chill little puzzle game at first. You're enjoying how it tickles the logical part of your brain and maybe even start to feel a little cocky after you've understood the mechanics, like you've outsmarted the game because you've figured out where the enemies are and beat the king for the first time... \n\n...and suddenly it's past midnight. You just nuked every enemy on the map with one attack, jumping in and out of the shadows on a pacifist run or chaining perfectly planned combos for zero energy while thinking \"just one more round, I was so close to getting the king on the highest difficulty!!\"\n\nThe music is well balanced to keep it exciting while not ruining your focus.\nThe art has a handcrafted quality, is easy on the eyes and is cute (even as the enemies turn to skeletons!).\nThe gameplay is easy to get into even for a dumb-dumb like me. It's fun but challenging and I find myself coming back for more even after clearing it all!\n\nOver all, I give this game a 2.75 out of 2.8! (My cat came up with the scoring system, please don't tease him he is very self-conscious about it).",
      "It is a total eyegasm with a captivating story/lore. If you're even a tiny bit interested in anything f*cked-up and mysterious (SCP-like), buy this.\n\nFrom the gameplay perspective, it is simply good. Nothing mind-blowing, but good nonetheless.\n\nI've completed the game with a couple of sidequests (there are more for me) in about 13 hours, and there are two story DLC + the Expeditions mode, so I anticipate at least another 10+ hours of gameplay. Which is great for the price.\n\nUpdate: I've put in ~10 more hours to complete the Foundation DLC. It is a good DLC, and brings a few more hours of joy living in this world. It also has some sick areas (like that dark cave with the TV). The overall design is a bit more dull, but I enjoyed the story.",
      "[h1]Technology[/h1]\nThe game is (was?) awfully poorly optimized.\nI don't think this game looks good enough for the hardware it requires. Some old RTS games looked similar to this title but required much less to run (I am referencing how the technology is better but the \"PC to FPS\" ratio has gone downhills).\n\nI understand that calculating AI choices and the simulation take a lot of resources, but this is not a game with a few thousand AI players like e.g. EU4 is. This is a relatively small map with just some AI players. This game also does not look that much better than some other RTS/TBS titles and I had FPS issues even with the lowest settings.\n\nI first ran this title with R9 280, so a quite old GPU, but that GPU was fully capable of running many decently modern games. This is IMO unacceptable, the developer can't optimize the game, and releases poorly coded product. I tested different graphic settings and noticed nearly no differences in the framerate.\n\nI then upgraded my PC to the top AM4 CPU and a very new GPU card (6600XT, overclocked) and the game ran fine on the highest settings, but I would not call it super smooth. All the other games run perfectly.\nElden Ring, Baldurs Gate 3, Cyberpunk (absolutely 0 issues in Cyberpunk). I would say CA messed up their game and didn't care to optimize it.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThe game is rather decent, it's enjoyable and has a connection to the lore of Warhammer.\nYou can't say a bad word about the general RTS mechanics, the battles and whatever. Just a normal RTS...\n\nIt just isn't the greatest RTS/TBS. Compared to Heroes of Might and Magic 3, or titles like let's say Cossacks, Age of Empires, or maybe Supreme Commander... It is unique in the Total War way, but given the amount of games in the series, it's ... not unique really (I have seen everything this game offers in different titles over the years).\n\nJust a giant simulation with a surprising lack of mechanics for an RTS game (as in economic aspect, diplomacy, map tactics. I think Europa Universalis IV is a good example of a really advanced tactics model in an RTS/TBS game and Civ 6 would be a great example of map design/economics). I personally don't like the maps for real-time battles. These maps seem quite crude and the skirmishes are badly designed.\n\nIn order to inflict maximum casualties you would need to kill every single unit. It should be enough that you break the enemy and automatically win. It's also quite unbalanced. Depending on what you kill first the results can wildly vary (including the AI acting much differently every time and the proposed outcomes of auto-resolved battles are just unhinged).\n\n I probably would like this game more without the \"real-time\" battles, but I assume it's the \"Total War\" way. To me it's time intensive and just not interesting. I liked Warhammer 40k's battles much more. They felt more tactical. Placement of units in this game does matter, but I had more fun playing The Battle for Middle Earth 15 years ago than this. I think the units panic too quickly and the characters don't matter enough.\n\nIt's the closest to the HoMM in terms of map and characters, however it lacks many things that made HoMM great (like tailored character development with meaningful spells and ability to recruit units, find artifacts on the map etc). The cities feel kind of empty, the mechanics are rather poorly described/introduced and just weird for an RTS (for my liking). \n\nI am not sure why there is so little care about the main characters. It would be very cool to build them up, be able to find artifacts on the map (besides the Sword of Khaine, that's just one item) and do something else than just advance some skills in the skill tree. Even if you invest your time in them then they can be sieged and just die.\n\nI also don't like some mechanics, for example the corruption, or slaves (they are not much intuitive. I think they should create clearer GUI and work on the general set of game rules, rather than make every faction different but also following totally different rules. Are we supposed to compete in a campaign and how if we follow different rules?). \nSome game prompts are meant to \"help\" learning the game, but they not always load up and they also don't explain small logos (traits) of the units, it's pretty useless. You need to use web browser anyway. Why to bother?\nIn that aspect - I think the designers totally messed up the UI/UX.\n\n21st August 2023 update: I played Baldur's Gate 3 and imagine they paid enough of work to actually make icons explain the traits of characters or items, amazing is it not? Seems to be lack of care. Every single icon in BG3 is fully explained. I could learn the game's rules and effectively build my characters.\n\n[h1]Genre[/h1]\nThe game is pretty fine, it gives some fun when playing it. Feels like Warhammer I guess? I personally am more of the 40k fan, but a game in the old universe is making lots of sense and the character design with world design are high quality.\n\n[h1] Summary (what made me dump this game also) [/h1]\nThe character design is quite impressive and it seems that they cared about the \"vibe\", but the game is just a money grab. why are there 3 game titles instead of one? What is the main improvement in between all of these titles?\nEach one of them has dozens of DLCs. An average person surely won't spend 300$ just to play more factions.\n\nWhat angered me so much I stopped playing after the purchase:\nThe publisher releases a paid product that claims to have free DLCs - some of them are, but the most important one isn't, and without it the game has got only 50% functionality and feels like a demo.\nRTS game without skirmish mode or some kind of \"do whatever\" mode is a meme. This isn't a DnD campaign board (and ironically such a campaign would allow for much more than selection of 5 heroes on one map lol), but an RTS in a specific universe.\n\nEvery normal RTS game has got a skirmish/free play mode (The Battle for the Middle-earth, Command and Conquer, Supreme Commander, Cossacks, Starcraft. Like every single RTS EVER) and this is especially filthy when you proclaim to release FREE functionality for the title, but then the player gets informed that they must buy TWO titles (WH1 and WH2) to get functionalities in the one they wanted to expand. Such a money grab, and even then the game is still locked behind micro-transactions/DLCs. I wanted to play a game, not donate to the \"poor\" publisher in 10 different ways. If the publisher wants money then they can sell better games.\n\nAwfully lot of DLCs, that don't add many things into the game. The base game doesn't feel like a game, but a rather Free to Play game account, that has 80% of content locked. Choosing from like 4 factions, especially in a game which varies so wildly depending on the faction (the factions aren't meant to be following any common rules it seems).\n\nWhat I also dislike is the publisher urging you to create an account to claim some of the \"free\" DLCs - the purpose is to collect data, and force you into their own website I assume (to raise statistics and show it to the management?). Why bother releasing game on Steam if you can't offer free DLCs to Steam users? I don't want your stupid 3rd party website.\n\nI don't recommend this game. I like Warhammer, but CA is a terrible company. I updated this review and in the meantime there have been at least a few different internet dramas with them involved.\n\nI would personally rather pay 70$ to a company that cares and provides a fun product (e.g. Lorian), than a DLC-locked tech demo... that \"stock\" Warhammer sure is.",
      "This is a game that should not exist. It is so niche that I struggle to understand how a company could have greenlit a project like this. But I'm very glad they did, because it is absolutely incredible.\n\nIt is a love letter to history, to writing, to stories, to culture. A gorgeously illustrated and scored, geekly researched slice of humanity, where the fate of the Universe is not at stake, where there are no cosmic heroes to save the day. What there are however, is a cast of profoundly human characters, shaped by where they came from, having to decide where they will go and what will become of their tiny, little piece of the world.",
      "Really fun for the first few rounds... Then the game changes your control scheme without telling you, and with no way to turn it back. This has lead to several hours of frustration, trying to revert it. From what I've read, this is 'intended' to make the game more difficult, but really, is just incredible stupid. If I wanted the game to be more difficult because of a more annoying control scheme, I'd play with a god damn dance pad.\n\nThe game is really fun, but this has frustrated me to the point that I can't enjoy it any more unless it's fixed, and therefore I can't recommend it either",
      "Most of the negative reviews cover my complaints already. So I won't rehash the ones I've already read. \n\nHere's my biggest complaints: \n\n- Jumpscares have never been compelling to me. Doubly so on VR. Are you trying to injure me in my computer room? Stop. \n\n- Guns are fun. Not having ammo for them is not fun. (The game is pretty generous with ammo but it also encourages tediously conservative behavior, if you just unload clips at shit you'll run out pretty fast) \n\n- \"Continuous Turning\" feels so bad. Like, how can I turn my headset and everything looks smooth as butter, but as soon as I use the look stick for turning suddenly it's all choppy and looks wrong? I'm familiar with some of the motion sickness issues people get with turning in VR games, but this isn't that... \n\n\nThough honestly it seems like they just leaned really into the whole horror thing, which is fine, but also just super not my thing. \n\nIf the mechanics and some design choices had been better I might have slogged through it anyway. \n\n\nGame's beautiful, though, so they got that going for them.",
      "Alright. Reviewing a free to play game once again.\n\nThis is a game created by a game lover. RPG lover to be precise. \n\nIt's a very simple Action RPG. The whole game is quite straight forward with minimum amount of puzzle and Mazes. \n\nThere are a few secret chest that's a bit hard to find. \nBut generally it's a very relaxing and non-demanding game.\nThe game itself is very short, 3-4 hours worth but you can possible play longer if you want to.\n\nMusic is basic and okish with no voice acting. (small indie game after all).\n\nThe biggest + for this game are two:\n1. Wonderfully touching story with multiple ending.\n2. Interesting designed boss with 3 different difficulty. \n\nFor some challenge and extra intense action i recommend everyone to beat all 3 boss on hard difficulty.\nThe last one is very hard but just ignore the chaos and act quickly and decisively.\n\nOne extra hint/recommendation i have for everyone is go to keyboard setting and disable sticking key for the final boss.\n(so you have more percision on control when you move around. You want to click up key to move 1 up. To avoid holding up too long and move up 2 square.).\n\nfor Freebie... 9/10.\n\nIf it wasn't free to start i would pay 1-2 dollar for this game and rate is 7/10.",
      "This is a game that I have been looking forward to for at least 2 and a half years. I have wanted to have a game on the PC that had the elements of harvest moon (for the little bit I played of it), Animal crossing (<3) and Rune factory. I was super excited when I was approached by Leth (publishing manager at Chucklefish) at the beginning of December to help him and ConcernedApe (developer of the game) with bug testing and QA. 400+ hours later (off steam and on steam), I still love the game. \n\n[b]Farming.[/b] The farming is fantastic. It is to me one of the main elements of the game, and it's just a joy. Being able to design your farm any way you want it... yes please. Planning out what to buy every season, where to plant them, on top of the thrill of when you can harvest and reap on the gold... it's so enjoyable and addictive. \n\n[b]Fishing.[/b] The fishing is outstanding. From playing WoW and Runescape.. or any game with fishing, the fishing in Stardew Valley is so much fun. At first, the fishing is challenging, but as you progress your skill, you become a pro in no time.\n\n[b]Mining and combat.[/b] Mining and combat is incredible. Going deeper into the mines can be tough, but if you're prepared with your food and weapon in hand, you can fend off the creatures and get your sweet ore/minerals/gems that you want to bring back to your house and possibly hoard. (Hi, I'm Bexy, and i'm a hoarder.) \n\n[b]Social.[/b] Social interactions are great. Being able to become friends with the people in the town,  and eventually being able to get into relationships with people and having a family with them.. what's not to like about that? And what's great is that it gives great replayability because you can have different saves with different spouses! The backstory for each of the characters too is so in depth and well thought out, you will be silly if you don't shed a tear maybe once or twice. \n\n[b]Main story.[/b] The actual main story is well rewarding, and once you \"complete\" it, you can still continue on your adventures and farming life with no problems, hell you might even discover new things afterwards, I sure as hell did! \n\nYes, I was a tester for the game. Yes, I have played for ridiculous amounts of hours. It may feel like i'm being a bit overzealous with this. However you have to remember, I was a tester. I tested the crap out of every aspect with this game, even though there were massive game breaking bugs, errors, glitches, crashes. I still love this game. I reported many a bug, and ConcernedApe was quick to fix them. \n\nAnd that's the thing, not only is the game amazing, the developer is too. ConcernedApe works around the clock to make sure that bugs are fixed in quick time in order for us to have an amazing experience with this game. And that's true. The experience that you have with this game IS amazing. \n\nMinutes playing turn into hours. Hours turn into \"oh no it's time to sleep\".\nYou will forget about time. You will forget about sleep. You will forget that dinner was about 5 hours ago but you couldn't' remember because you were too busy trying to fight off 12 bats that were clobbering you inside the mines while trying to gather that 1 diamond waaaaay in the back. \n\nSo yes, I without a shadow of a doubt 150% recommend this game to anyone that wants to \"escape\" for days on end with what I am classifying as my #1 Game of 2016.",
      "*Sigh* This game was just tiring. I wouldn't come to say it was a complete rip off of Paper's Please, but it was a very similar game but just worse. Mainly to the point that I played, at most, 10 minutes, I saw multiple repeats of the same messages, and the only updates were legislation, unlike in Papers, Please where you got new rules and new tools almost every day. I won't completely judge the game since I haven't played it the entire way through, but it's just not very good. Plain and simple.",
      "A new game from Zeboyd, you know I'm there! And this was such a fun game\n\nThis game is about as long as Cthulhu Saves Christmas and it's just as Linear. However given their statement on this video, that's meant to be the point these days.\n\nThe Graphics for the main game are basic but it's fitting for the Genre. Also they have dropped the random battles with on screen monsters to avoid if you want to not fight (And you still have the option to start a battle through the main menu). The fighting system is identical to CSC too which I've enjoyed but I can understand those who may not like it. The Animation for the transformations are incredible...except I'm always stuck watching them every single time which can get very tedious.\n\nThe story is clever, and they provide \"Translations\" for the Ole English of Shakespeare...but a lot of the translations are jokes and very silly ones at that.\n\nThere isn't a LOT of replay value but you will enjoy the story enough you'll want to play it again eventually.\n\nThere is no New Game Plus mode...yet but given how they patched it into CSC later on I'm certain they're do that here eventually.\n\nI say the game is incredible for the price range and is entertaining for all ages.\n\n\nVIDEO REVIEW: https://youtu.be/wuw9pJPowqM",
      "First, there was Guitar Hero. Now you've got Guitar Nero. \n\nIt's wild that this came out of nowhere, because this is easily one of the best games I've ever played. This is what I've been waiting for rhythm games to be like since Space Channel 5 on Dreamcast.",
      "[h1] Too much for too little? [/h1]\nThe game hovers over/under an hour (depending on your pace) and there really isn't much in terms of replayability....besides going through it again or trying to obtain all the achievements (which aren't challenging), this at most would add a couple more hours.So in short you don't get much content for the price tag, with that said what you do get is quality.... a lot of it, ranging from the art to the music and everything in between. Now with that in mind, I believe that if the lack of content hinders you too much wait for a sale, but if not go ahead and pick it up you probably won't regret it. \n[h1] What's inside? [/h1]\nStory is very straightforward without much depth behind it, but that's not necessarly a bad thing... at least when it comes to this game. What makes an otherwise simple plot into something much more enticing is how everything like the art style, music, flow from one scene to the next and especially the interactions complement one another in order to create a sense of immersion w/everything that comes with that feeling. \n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\nI highly recommend this game for anyone with feeeels and without. It's short, but as they say it \"packs a punch\".",
      "[h1]Game Pros[/h1]\n\n• Open world\n• Not a GPU/CPU intensive game. Easily runnable and runs quite smooth.\n• Beautiful cut scenes/visuals, gorgeous!\n• Clean menu.\n• Night/Day Cycle.\n• Weather does effect how you take on a mission.\n• You can easily get immersed in the game and play it for hours without even knowing it.\n• Tons of missions and side objectives. Tnere will be plenty to do.\n• Everything you do in-game affects the current and future missions.\n• Those who can stragically plan better will have an easier time progressing through missions with a higher score.\n• Various weapons/tools/items/gear to research. Lots of customization.\n• Custmomizable \"Mother Base\" with soldiers and objects/items from the open world.\n• You can infiltrate other players bases and steal soldiers/resources (FoB's/Events alike).\n• Multiple companion's that you can bond with throughout missions. (You are not alone!)\n• Intelligent and adapatable AI. They will deal with people using repetitive infiltration methods and the like.\n• If you punch one of your soldiers in the face, you will recieve words of praise.\n• Not a game you can just breeze through in just 10-20 hours.\n\n[h1]Controversial Features[/h1]\n\n• Mission checkpoints can have a large gap, punishing your stupidity and impatience.\n• Not necessarily a \"Pay to Win\" option, but there are microtransactions in this game that 'enhance' your online experience. (MB Coins)\n\n[h1]Game Cons[/h1]\n\n• Storyline seemed to be lacking/repetitive.\n• AI and player pathing have a few bugs when encountering ladders or something of the sort in small places (Seldom occurs, but worthwhile to mention).\n• Can feel repetitve at times during missions due to similar objectives (Go here and kill/rescure this person, etc).\n• Hackers have been spotted while online. (FoB Attacks)\n• You CAN NOT bind anything to a numpad key. Which blows for left handed PC gamers.\n\n[h1]Relatable Games[/h1]\n\n• Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes\n• Metal Gear (General Franchise)\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nWith the ingenuity of Kojima and Co. combined with the power of the Fox engine here is another gem to marvel upon- Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. The game/franchise as a whole continues to be a lovely experience with a multitude of things to do online post-story. Seriously, you will always have something to do. The story is mesmerizing, leaving you with a feeling of wanting more. For the hardcore Metal Gear fans out there, many of your questions regarding to 'plot holes' will definately get (at least some) answers this time around!\n\n[b]Overall Score: 90/100[/b]\n\nThank you for reading!

      "This is half of a very good game. You might be impressed in the first 10 hours, but after that it becomes evident you are playing the skeleton of what could be a generational game. Here is some of the good and some of the bad.\n\nThe Good:\n-Graphics look great, even on lower settings\n-Decently varied battle maps\n-Sound design makes killing blows feel amazing\n-Decent variety of weapons\n\nThe Bad:\n-Extremely shallow \"campaign\"\n-Almost zero role playing elements. Every character behaves identically towards you. Even your own wife will try to introduce herself. Kill someone's father/brother/entire clan? They will never mention it and will behave towards you just like anyone else.\n-\"Realistic mode\" means all your enemies will be absolute tank meat sponges while you are made of glass.\n-After you get your first settlement the game becomes extremely tedious. You will play whack a mole with enemy armies who take almost no time to recuperate. Wipe out 3 enemy armies in a massive, \"war changing battle\"? Oops, looks like all of those armies are back to full strength in a matter of days.\n-Almost zero variation of playstyles. Sure you can be a trader or a rogue mercenary for the early game, but you will always end up cheesing the smithing economy mechanics to support the larger armies you need in the mid game\n\nThis is simply an unfinished game. The fact they have been selling it for $50 successfully for years is wild.\nWould have much rather paid $100 for a fully finished product.\n\nUnless they have a massive overhaul on the \"Official Release\" October 25th, I cannot recommend this game.

      "I'm 45, I've had good times and bad times.  I've fallen in love, grown up, gotten married, beaten alcoholism, \nhad a child, fought off depression, led my wife through her kidney failure, carried the death of loved ones, and come back from the brink.  I've weathered the storm of life like anyone else . . . I'm not special.  I'm not rich, but comfortable, and I've gathered quite a steam library as a hobby over the last 10 years.  Something I have rarely done, during my time with almost 4000 titles, is write a review.  Two, maybe three for 4000 games.  Think about that for a second.\n\nI'm 45.  I just cried playing a video game, something I can't ever remember doing.  I feel like my heart is going to burst.  It's joy, and sadness.  It's like a good memory with a parent who's long gone, bubbled up at random, making you laugh and ache at the same time.  It's bittersweet.\n\nThe music and visuals are subtle and flashy at the same time, they get under you and lift you up.  It's got spirit of the 60's, the heart of the 80's, and feels like every memorable video game trope from the 2000's, with the social softness of the 2020's.

It's all of these and more.\n\nMy emotions are a flood.  I had to write a review, and let people know how I feel.  I can't describe it, I feel like I found my heart again, and I didn't even know it was lost.  Life was comfortable before 2:00pm today . . . now it's magical.  It's these small things that I forget, and remember, and then forget again . . . the birth of my son, the feeling of nervous sweetness on my first date with my wife, an unexpected comment from a random stranger about my eyes, finding an old photo of my dad that no one ever remembered taking --\n\n-- This game is like that sweet, fleeting memory.\n\nTL;DR:  45-year old man cries after finding his heart lost in a game, and writes a review while his wife asks him if he's okay.\n\n11/10, would purchase these feels again.",
      "Play this game in roguelike mode (no extra lives) as that seems to be how it was designed. By letting objects of the same type touch each other you will be able to deal damage to or destroy them all with one move! Attacking enemies will damage you back so you have to use potions that also drop down to heal.\n\nI see some of the reviews here saying this game sucks and it's all randomness. It's a roguelike though, so there is a good deal of randomness but the fun comes from gaining skill with the mechanics and making the right decisions. If you can carve out lone pieces and allow a bunch of the same object to get into a big cluster, popping that huge chain is super satisfying. \n\nThe game was very intimidating at first and I would die in the first 2 stages over and over, but I eventually got the hang of things and beat the game for the first time pretty quickly. This game requires patience to get a hang of the mechanics but once you do it's a fun little time waster to open up every once in a while. There are lots of characters to unlock too and they all bring their own strategies to the table.",

Graphics\nBG3 has the best graphics in any CRPG I've played up until this point. The animations still need work, as there are a number of cutscenes where things and characters are misplaced. However, environments, spell effects, equipment, characters, etc., are all meticulously designed and you can rest assured that Larian has painstakingly made even the most inconsequential NPC stand out.\n\n2. Sound\nThe sound design is fantastic. Each spell and weapon attack has a unique sound. The ambient sounds are distinct with each area you are located in, as well as the soundtrack. The soundtrack, in general, is well composed. I could sit on the title screen and just listen to the opening song for a long time. The voice acting is fantastic, especially the narrator. The only issue that I've found with the sound is similar to that of graphical bugs: cutscenes need polish. Sometimes characters don't properly voice their lines when cued. If there is a large fight going on with many different effects at once, some new effects may not properly play either.\n\n3. Story\nNot a whole lot of tied up loose ends story-wise as of yet. However, the intro scene is phenomenal. Probably the best intro cutscene in just about any game I've played. From there, the story picks up on a grand scale, then drops you off in the  starting area. You then begin to pick up the pieces to figure out what is going on and how to best solve your little problem. The storyline so far as what's available in EA isn't overly complex, but the particularly enticing part about it is the number of other smaller plots and characters which lend to the main. Over the course of my playthrough, I've picked up several potential paths which could ultimately be taken probably closer to the midpoint of the finished game. \n\n4. Characters\nI'll keep this one brief, but I just want to take a second to say that all of the characters are very well fleshed out and distinct. Even simple NPC's have personalities which, for the most part, don't strike me as cookie cutter in any way. Care has been taken into writing seemingly each and every character, even many animals and corpses. Many actions you take have an effect on your party's opinion of you, but each character has different preferences. Some party members, however, are a tough to nail down as to what makes them happy, even after almost 300 hours. The personality differences between what is expressed through character dialogue and what changes their opinion of your character can feel a bit inconsistent.\n\n5. Combat\nThe combat is fun and rewarding. Each action you take feels as if it has a distinct impact on the battle. This is partially due to the aforementioned animation and sound effects, very punchy and flashy, lots of pretty colors. This is also thanks, in part, to the combat system adopted from 5th ed. D&D. The die rolls, while not visible during combat, add quite a bit of tension and strategy to a fight. You can't just fling cantrips and spells willy-nilly at random enemies and expect to come out on top (for the most part). The balancing is done well enough to allow for a fair fight, but one that doesn't hold your hand throughout and is rewarding when you win. The world design is also done so well that, anywhere a fight could possibly break out (you can attack/kill anyone), the environment lends a lot of variation and strategy to the fight. The enemies are also very smart, to the point where they will flank and take the high ground on you. Stay frosty!\n\n6. Exploration\nExpanding on the final point of the Combat section, the world design makes Faerun feel alive. There is usually something to find around every corner; exploration is very rewarding. Exploration is rewarded in a few different ways. You can get unique loot (while not necessarily as distinct as titles such as Elden Ring, there is a good variety of equipment to find), find interesting social encounters, or battles. Furthermore, battles can be turned to social encounters or vice versa. The versatility in how the player overcomes different situations is very well thought out. My main grip with the exploration is a personal one, but it's the map. It can get sort of tedious trying to navigate the world using the map. But, the exploration area is not particularly sprawling, so you won't be caught wandering around looking for a particular area for too long. A few important items for side quests also come to mind as being particularly hard to find, as they don't really stand out from the background. But, holding Left ALT will bring up titles for items lying around the area if you want to go that route.\n\n7. Races/Classes\nThe current races available are as follows: drow, human, githyanki, dwarf, elf, half elf, halfling, gnome, and tiefling. The classes are fighter, wizard, rogue, ranger, cleric, warlock, druid, sorcerer, warlock, and bard. Larian has done a good job distinguishing each race and class from one another, whether the customization options or progression. The only issue that I have is that the full PHB selection is not yet available. There are subraces available for each race, each with differing characteristics from another. The subclasses are all very self explanatory, if you are familiar with the 5th edition Player's Handbook. A few names had to be changed for certain things within classes, probably due to licensing issues. Also no multiclassing as of just yet. Curious to see if they decide to patch that one in.\n\n8. Character Creation (Visual)\nKind of simplistic at this point. There are no sliders which allow to you to sculpt the face or body, although there are a fair number of preset faces. A good number of hairstyles and facial hair options, as well as colors to apply. And yes, you can apply beards to female dwarves (lookin' at you, Rings of Power).\n\n9. Progression\nSimilar progression to 5e, except that there are several events which grant XP other than just slaying your enemies. Now comes the main problem I have with EA, the level cap. The world is very well designed and very dense, each action you take for the most part feels well rewarded with XP. But, a full playthrough of all the content could see you sitting at 4th level for several hours before completing. This is especially frustrating because 5th level is when you get your second attack and 3rd level spells. But the loot in the game still allows for a little more variety as it does continue to progress in power/utility even up until the end.\n\n10. Optimization\nI run this on a pretty mid-system (Ryzen 5, 1660ti, 16gb RAM) and I can hold between 50-60 fps when exploring on high settings. When in a busier fight, my fps ranges from 35-45 ish. There are a few bugs which impact functionality (dialogue not displaying during conversation, getting stuck on a character's turn during combat, random crashes, etc.). Luckily, these have all vastly reduced in frequency. While the gameplay is by no means flawless, it has reduced frequency enough to where it's not so bothersome as to ruin the game for me. Just depends on your bug tolerance. If you're a Bethesda fan, you'll be just fine.\n\nJust a final thought before I end this thing. If you just want to experience something different and don't mind playing a work in progress, this game is for you. Larian is fantastic at listening to user feedback for optimization to things as small as simple tooltips. If you want a full experience (and I 100% would not blame you if that were the case), just wait until it comes out. Hoping for early-mid '23.",

      "I have only one point of criticism:\nThis game lacks a proper ending or epilog; something like The Witcher's Blood & Wine DLC. After adventuring hundreds of hours, after growing fond of and close to my companions, I got kicked so hard out of the game - it hurt!\nIn fact I immediately started a 2nd playthrough, because I wasn't yet ready to let go. Please Larian, give us an epilog or at least one last night at the camp with all my allies, companions and friends for the Definitive Edition.\n\nedit: As of patch5 this has been implemented. Thanks Larian Studios! You guys are the best!",
      "This was released alongside about 10 other big Steam releases around the end of October 2022 and so it is very tempting to joke about how it's better than all of those combined, the real GOTY so on and so forth, as I'm sure has been done already. But what I noticed was that out of all those releases, this one had an emphasis on comedy, which is very difficult to execute successfully in any form of media. There is no voice acting or any high-budget production so how the dialogue and seemingly basic visuals/animations kept me entertained throughout, just like the previous 2 games (from memory) is a tremendous achievement. At a point where I have played a bazillion high-budget action games, and will honestly play a bazillion more, games like this only become more important in showcasing how creative independence is imperative in creating uplifting experiences.\nAfter the prologue, seeing Frog Detective step out of the train and the camera pausing on his full-body shot was akin to, say, if I saw Shepherd step out of the Normany in ME4, or if I saw Keanu step out of a train in John Wick 4, it was really on that level for me.\nThough, I feel like the dance scenes at the end of this game was a step-down from Frog Detective 2 unfortunately, but still good.\n\nEdit: I nominated this game for 'Outstanding Visual Style' Steam Award!",
      "I was hoping for a good game but I can't believe the positive reviews. Really annoying on a personal level. If you like your hand held and revel in 3rd person view then enjoy, but I think it's terrible. I was on the mountain jumping across a platform. \"Press ENTER\" to 'grab' it suggests. I press ENTER and what do you know? Nothing happens. Well, you die continually because what it tells you to do (zzzzz) doesn't work. Ah, maybe this is part of the 'difficulty'...hahahaha.\n\nNot a patch on any Far Cry or GTA even though these are full of directions. First Tomb Raider I've bought and definitely the last. What is it with games these days telling you what to do every step of the way: Do this...do that....go here....find item...take item...drop item...fire now.....pull lever...talk....rest....jump.... quit game and uninstall, ya that's the best option. As this game is created for a dumbed-down society or tailored for intellectually challenged meercats, some of us can see where the industry is heading. What happened to thinking for yourself???\n\nI don't need to progess far in this game because the first 10 minutes says enough. Do this, do that, blah blah blah...",
      "[h1]Strategy at its finest[/h1]\n\nInto the Breach is Subset Game’s latest title, following on from their massive hit, FTL. I put off trying Into the Breach for a long while, but I finally got it when it dropped down to $10 on HB a couple of months ago and I’m so glad I did. This game isn’t for everyone, it’s kind of rogue-like mech chess, but if it clicks for you then it’ll be one of the best strategy games you’ll ever play.\n\n[h1]Positives:[/h1]\n[list][*]First up, the game looks fantastic. The pixel art here is great, from the backgrounds to the mechs and even the pilot portraits. The animations here area also really good. There’s nothing too complicated here but it’s all well executed. On the topic of appearances, I also really like the way the maps are laid out, the 8x8 grids on a plain background work really well here and it reminds me of simple boardgames. I think it works well for the game.\n\n[*]As with any good strategy game, it’s easy to pick up, but hard to master. You have a squad of three mechs (there are a few different mech groups to unlock with gold coins (?) and you can also create custom groups from the mechs you’ve unlocked). Each group has a unique element, but they all follow the basic structure of one close-range mech, one long-range mech and one support mech. Each mech has a different ability/weapon and they’re all well varied. The mech teams are really well designed here so that no one mech is super powerful and they all work really well as a unit. \n\n[*]The combat is excellent. It’s really simple but it works so well. You’ll quickly learn the different roles your mechs have and figure out the best strategies to use them. There are two ways to kill most enemies. Getting rid of all of their HP or pushing them into water/lava (with the exception of boss enemies or flying enemies). However, a lot of the time you probably won’t even be trying to kill your enemies in a given turn. You can always see what the enemies will do on their next turn and so you always want to be playing to react to/prevent their next move. Typically, enemies target civilian buildings or buildings related to your objective, so it’s usually better to focus on moving them away from these buildings rather than focusing on killing them. If you’re really smart/lucky you can also push enemies so that they attack each other, as friendly fire is a major part of this game. It’s really satisfying when you line it up right so the enemies are killing each other rather than attacking you or the buildings you defend. You can even block them from spawning by moving something on top of them!\n\n[*]Unlocks in this game are handled better than in FTL in my opinion. There are six actions that you can complete with each mech squad to earn those gold coins I mentioned in order to unlock new mech squads. The first three are the three possible victories: two, three and four island (more on that in a second) and then the other three achievements are unique to each mech squad. They’re centred around the unique aspect of each squad, tasking you to get a bit creative with the way that you’re playing. I know some players didn’t like the way that unlocks worked but I think it’s a really good way to handle it and encourages you to try new strategies. \n\n[*]The game has five islands, with one of those being the final boss fight. Each island is basically a different biome with different enemies and environmental hazards. They aren’t necessarily easier or harder than each other to start with, but the difficulty does increase as you move from island to island. There is some crossover with the enemies you’ll see, but they at the very least have a different appearance and most of them behave differently. There are also enemies unique to each island. \n\n[*]On each island, you’ll need to complete several missions before facing off against the island’s mini-boss. The missions all have different objectives for you to complete, though the win condition is always just to survive all of the turns (typically 5 turns). The different objectives vary but there are usual two, with some easier missions only having one and harder missions having three. Completing these objectives gets you certain rewards. You can either get stars, which are used upon completing an island to purchase new pilots, abilities or weapons. There is grid power which restores or increases the grid power you start with (grid power is lost when buildings are destroyed, losing all grid power results in a loss). Lastly, some of the missions award power cores (usually you only see this as the third reward for a hard mission) which allow you to upgrade your mech’s weapons or abilities (super handy). The mission variety is fairly good.\n\n[*]There are a range of different pilots in the game. You always start with one ‘special’ pilot and two regular pilots but more can be found in cryo-pods or bought at the end-of-island store. All pilots earn xp at the end of missions and when they level up they get some kind of upgrade, like more mech health or an extra movement per turn. The ‘special’ pilots all have some kind of special ability, such as being able to attack twice if you don’t move or the ability for the piloted mech to fly. Some of these require a power core, but they’re definitely worth it.  [/list]\n\n[h1]Negatives: [/h1]\n[list][*]Honestly, I’m clutching at straws here for negatives. One thing I would mention is that I don’t think this game will have as much replay value as FTL does for most people (completionists have an awful lot to do here) which shouldn’t put you off from getting it, but is something to base your expectations on. I also felt like Chris Avellone was a bit wasted on this game, his writing is fantastic but there just isn’t much of it. [/list]\n\n[h1]Verdict: [/h1]\n\nInto the Breach is as close to a perfect strategy game as I’ve ever played and it’s an excellent follow-up to FTL. This game is easy to pick up, hard to master and it looks beautiful the whole time you’re playing this weird mech chess. I can’t recommend this enough and at $15 it’s an absolute steal. This was easily one of my favourite releases of 2018 and anyone who likes strategy absolutely needs this in their library. \n\nIf you found this review helpful, please check out my other reviews over at [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33633486/]Kemo's Corner.[/url]",
      "From afar, the life of royalty can seem very glamorous: the lavish lifestyle, the royal finery, fancy food and drink. However, the life of a prince can be very difficult and traumatic, when your very birth was a disappointment to the king. \n\nUGLY is the fragmented story of a prince who was considered by his father, the king, to be much too ugly to show his face. Forced to wear a mask and bear his father’s unfair demands, we wake up amongst the ruins of what must have been a rather fantastic palace. \n\nThe main mechanic in UGLY is the magical mirror that the prince receives at the beginning. This mirror allows him to create a reflection of himself within the space that you can switch between. You can place the mirror either vertically or horizontally, allowing you to enter rooms that may be blocked by impassable walls, or reaching platforms high up in hard to reach areas.\n\nThere are several different areas, each locked by a door with a particular coloured gemstone. To progress you must find the special key for each door, and inside clear out all of the rooms by, again, finding keys and unlocking every door. Once you’ve cleared an area, and collected the next coloured-gemstone-key, you will be confronted with that area’s boss. \n\nThe boss battles are extremely fun, and are like a much more intensified puzzle than a “fight”. Some of the puzzle rooms are real mind bogglers, and it will take all of your ingenuity to flip the switch in your brain to maximize the mechanics and figure out all of the puzzles. Each room is different and challenging, and the background design is chalk full of visual storytelling. \n\nFrom drawings and pictures on walls, to very interesting machines, to a whole theatre room where you can tell the little prince used to put on puppet shows for his loving mother and all of his stuffed animals.  The story is a treatise to what can happen to a child who’s tenderness and creativity is stifled by the unseemly and unreasonable demands of a narcissistic parent. The wonderful part is that the story is left up to the player to figure out. \n\nThere are secrets to uncover: hidden films and the prince’s memories to unlock. Every subsequent area adds a new mechanic to work with, or around, to the puzzling (such as pink pant that doesn’t allow you to switch to your reflection, or broken glass that your reflection can actually touch). \n\nThe game is very reminiscent of Braid, and considering how mind-blowing and phenomenal that game was when it was originally released in 2008, it’s fantastic to see another game following in those creative footsteps and create such a stellar experience for gamers everywhere. \n\nI would recommend this game to anyone who likes puzzle games, a challenge, or a heart wrenching story.",
      "Note this is not \"Steampunk Civ\" so don't think of it that way. Its effectively a story/scenario driven city builder. The game looks beautiful and works well with the world building that goes on with the game. \n\nYour games will be short but its still fairly challenging depending on the scenario you choose\n\nDefinitely recommended",
      "It has poor simulation of hand skeleton, so you can't use all fingers, benefits of Index Knuckles controller or VR gloves, etc. And, scenario doesn't allow you to do anything, actually, except one straightforward way. Some things are elaborated, but mostly it isn't worth time or money. But I'm rating it as professional developer for VR, sexual content itself is not matter nor interested for me. My advice for game developer is to add more hand tracking features and more scenarios - in this case it can be something better.",
      "i thought it is overpriced eventhough its good, but it am wrong, \nall ascpects in the game are well made with high quality.\nspecial thanks to accessibility setting, very thoughtful for players.\nand it runs perfeclty in steam deck",
      "Melatonin is a simple rhythm game, with a focus on ease of gameplay and calmer sounds.\nIf you're expecting something on the tougher or more upbeat side, this ain't it.  Ironically, I had more fun as I stopped focusing on scoring well, and more fun when I was just feeling the music and half-asleep.  The sounds and songs are quite relaxing lol.\n\nOn the shorter side of games, it still delivers an enjoyable experience in what it offers. The timing is a *little* on the forgiving side, and there are even accessibility options if you need a little more help, such as timing circles, metronome, and a bigger Perfect window.  If you'd rather go for a challenge, a Perfect only option is also available.\n\nControls are quite simple, using [strike]4[/strike] 3 directional keys and an action key (Space by default). In each tutorial, you're told whether you'll need to hit directional keys or the action key, and whether they're held or not, as well as general timing.  For some stages, the instructions don't give you as good an idea as the tutorial itself/timing circles do (Work and Time levels for me).  All good, but in some levels you get tempo changes in the middle of the song that can throw you a bit off, especially if you're just grooving to the audio cues... when you can hear and distinguish them.  Unfortunately, there are a few levels where the audio cues are either far too similar to each other, or happen too quickly to react to.  This can be a bit of a bummer, as I prefer working off audio for rhythm games, as their focus should be lol.  \n\nWhile Melatonin doesn't bring a whole lot to the table, it doesn't need to.  Less is more here, and the art and sound direction definitely hit their target.\nRelax.",
      "Heavily recommended game! And the following play-through should make you either highly appalled or very interested:\n\n- Started off with a monkey as a pet. Named her \"Butters\", but later on my pet monkey took a liking to another guy named Bones. It made me a tiny bit sad.\n- Built a nice settlement, made the entire surroundings and buildings out of the easiest findable supply around: wood.\n- Ended up with 5 villagers after having successfully defended our 'village' a couple of times and converted 2 of the pirate prisoners to join our cause. They eventually did.\n\n(I'm skipping the story about the micromanagement and supply hoarding business - you'll learn about this on the spot yourself.)\n\n- I thought I had things going smoothly. Perhaps a bit too flawless. Characters got along well and two of them actually married eachother early on. It was a joyful moment for Bones and Greta. Bones had a dislike for clothes, so he was always running around naked which was not appreciated by some. But apparently he had a passion for farming and was well endowed. Greta took the earliest opportunity and showed him some loving. Greta was listed as a lazy and weapon hating person, but not too lazy to chase down some 'bone'. Good for her.\n- My self created character, named Adante, was a tireless fat miner and the other two people named Dorothy and Hunter were your average run of the mill converted prisoners from earlier battles. Dorothy could cook up some decent meals and Hunter, well, as the name implies, he was hunting down the animals for the food to make nice meals mixed up with the harvested crops from our farms. Luxurious and plentiful meals of variety. Even salt was added for flavour.\n\nBut then an event changed the atmosphere quite rapidly:\n\n- A nasty cobra snuck into the settlement and had its fangs set on Butters, the pet Monkey, and I did not notice as I was looking to mine some shizzle.\n- They battled eachother like no tomorrow and the fight lasted quite long because by the time I had actually noticed, the pet monkey had all her limbs bitten off by the snake and was crying for help while still being pounded by the Cobra.\n- The sound of the monkey cries... it still traumatizes me to this day.\n- Bones probably noticed long before I did, but hey, he loves being naked and probably didn't want to risk being bitten in dangling places so did nothing to help out.\n- Hunter, however, eventually shot & killed the cobra before it could put a killing blow on the poor limbless cryin' monkey.\n- Butters was then picked up by Hunters, carried and put in Bones' room to keep him comfortable with some painkillers while we figure out a way to get his limbs back. There are ways in this game to do so, be it four wooden pegs or made out of other technology, but it takes some craftmanship to pull this off.\n- By the time that we've managed to construct these, an electric storm came down on the settlement as if it was telling us: YOUR INTENTIONS ARE NOBLE BUT THE MONKEY MUST DIE!\n\n(Now, here's a lesson I've learned: Never make your ENTIRE settlement out of wood.)\n\n- The storm caused fire to start and spread like wildfire.\n- All villagers were alerted and commanded to extinguish the fire.\n- The fire became so intense, and spread from the storages and houses straight to the farm area (and all over the entire map, all animals and trees on the entire map were burned alive.)\n- Now, the house in which Butters was still 'recovering' was also hit by the fire. I sent my main character Adante to help out but the fire enclosed the area in a rapid speed. My fat miner and his slow jigglywiggly runs could not win that race by a long shot. He was a hauler, not a speedy gonzalez. \n- Butters, the poor cursed monkey, just shrieked and screamed her lungs out when the fire was getting closer and closer after every second. \n- So within seconds, we could hear the cries again, of a pet Monkey. Not only in pain from snake bites and losing all limbs before, but now also jumping by the belly up & down inside her once comfortable pet-bed, being on fire.\n- Every villager probably had tears in the eyes from that whole ordeal once the fire started demanding the limbless body and a Monkey fighting for the last breath of her life. \n- I made Bones, since he's supposedly the new master of Butters, go into the flames and try to retrieve the monkey while the plan was to let him carry the monkey into the water at a nearby lake.\n- This turned Bones into a running naked man carrying a limbless monkey across the settlement, while both being on fire. \n- The outcome of this is probably easy to guess. They burned together, into (what it seemed) a neverending sea of flames and emotion.\n- I ordered all my other villagers to stand in the water of the lake and wait out the fire frenzy. They were all depressed and Greta simply lost it and ran into the firesea on her own accord due to severe depression.\n\nAfter the fire died, I stopped playing and told the story to my girlfriend. Her eyes opened wide and then the question came: \"What kind of f***ed up game is that?\"\n\nRimworld, my dear. It's Rimworld. -true story-\n\n[Edit review 21.04.2022] \nAs you can see I've been playing this game for another 2000 hours from the point of my initial review back in 2017. The game itself has grown so substantially and in so many positive directions. The modders play a great part in this as the content that is being made makes the game even more enjoyable. There will be more and more content in the future as well as more official DLC's which, to me, is very exciting. The maker(s) of the game together with the Rimworld community really made something special that will last you with endless of hours of amazing gameplay. I cannot praise this game higher than I already do and I highly recommend to anyone reading this that you give this a try!\n[End of edit]",
      "I got this game on a whim because I once played this series like... a decade ago. DW3/4 to be specific. And even though I know full well that this sort of game is basically meant for consoles, I managed to play it just fine once I adjusted the key bindings to stuff that worked well for me. Anyway... game.\n\nIf, like me, you have played these games before, you pretty much know what you are in for. If you have never played any of these games, I'm not quite sure what else is quite like it. Basically it's a fighting game, except it is on large battlefield maps where you murder thousands of random and a handful of named NPC's while following objectives in order to complete each level. If that sounds repetitive... well it can certainly be that. It's the ultimate hack and slash-fest game, and if you get bored with murdering insane numbers of enemies, then chances are this game is not for you.\n\nThe game is based upon the Three Kingdoms era of Ancient China (184-280, roughly), and, despite the absurd outfits and personalities of many of the characters in the game, it is actually fairly consistent with what is known about the period. Or rather, it is consistent with the famous novel 'Romance of the Three Kingdoms' by Luo Guanzhong, which is basically a work of historical fiction that takes real events and bends them a bit according to the whims and views of the author. Which, of course, means that certain characters (particularly Shu-Han characters like Xuande/Liu Bei) are depicted as noble honorable sorts fighting for justice while others (like Mengde/Cao Cao) are depicted as villanous and driven by ambition. I don't want to dig too deep into this because there most likely are entire books written about how Luo Guanzhong messed around with the characters, but the depictions he made are pretty much what are found in this and all previous DW games. The nice thing though is that if you read between the lines (or maybe it's just because I am very familiar with the source material this game is based off of), you can see the flaws in the author's bias in the game as well. Namely that Liu Bei was a massive hypocrite every bit as ambitious as his rivals, and that Cao Cao, while not exactly the nicest guy around, wasn't the hellspawn other characters (like Liu Bei) called him.\n\nAnyway, the game follows the story decently well, though some creative license and trimming down obviously has happened. I still liked how the game depicted things most of the time. Perhaps my favorite was Lu Bu's campaign which, while maintaining the massive \"OMG ITS LU BU\" hype that all DW games have had, reveals exactly why the real Lu Bu got himself executed in chapter 19 of a 120 chapter book: that he was dumb as a brick, betrayed people constantly, and never listened to anyone's advice. While the old DW games I played did have storylines for him, they didn't take the historical route that this game's (default) story path takes. The same goes for the numerous character deaths shown, though many of these are made more dramatic than they actually were.\n\nAlso, while the playable character cast has increased to the point of total insanity (including some that may not have even existed or actually fought on battlefields), I did like that, in the time between DW4 and this, they added a number of characters that rounded out the cast further by including some of the other lesser-known strategists (Chen Gong, Lu Su) and characters who rose to prominence in the later parts of the story (Deng Ai, the sons of Guan Yu/Zhang Fei, as well as the entire Jin faction who were the ultimate winners of this whole mess). I thought that was a nice treat since these sorts had been badly neglected in past games, where everything seemed to stop at the year 234 (when Kongming/Zhuge Liang died), which was roughly the chronological halfway point of the entire story.\n\nOk, I better stop and just finish this up.\n\nIn short, It's a DW game. That means that on the one hand, the combat gets repetitive, many of the characters are very hard to take seriously, and many of the story events are overdramatized to the point of being kind of ridiculous. On the other hand, there is a MASSIVE amount of content (and all those DLC's for this \"Complete Edition\" are purely cosmetic), big battles are kind of fun, and one can even argue that the storyline's inherent cheesiness may actually be more a positive than a negative.\n\nIf you have never played one of these games before, this is the one i'd look at because (to my knowledge) it's the newest one and has an insane amount of content even compared to its predecessors. If you have played these and liked them before... why not? If you didn't like these games however, then most likely this will do nothing to change your opinion.\n\nFor all it's goofiness and repetition, DW is still entertaining enough for me to waste sizeable amounts of time with it. Hooray and stuff.",
      "The amount of love and fun that went into this game is astounding. If you like minigames, memes, fun, and a challenge, check this game out. The “ending” was a bit lackluster, in my opinion, but it did not taint my views on the game and I had an overwhelmingly fun time with it. Definitely recommend!",
      "I technically got this game for free, as it was bought for me from a friend. And honestly, I didn't really like it. She got it for me, as a means to help with some of my mental health issues I suppose? But it just was very big miss for me, and kinda made me feel worse. A bit anxiety inducing for me, just given the circumstances, talking about life and death. Just not my personal cup of tea.",
      "[h1]An old classic that's fresher than lots of today's titles.[/h1]\n\n[i]Day of the Tentacle[/i] first launched in 1993. I remember, because I was a teenager then and couldn't play it as my PC didn't meet the minimum requirements! This was actually the sequel to an earlier game, [i]Maniac Mansion[/i], which was released in 1987. I played [i]Maniac Mansion[/i] a few years after it came out, but did not complete it as the game's movement and controls were just too dated and clunky for me (even back then) to be bothered with. \n\nPlaying [i]Maniac Mansion[/i] is not at all necessary in order to enjoy [i]Day of the Tentacle[/i], though those who have will definitely find greater connection to the game's characters, especially the Edison family.\n\n23 years later, [i]Day of the Tentacle Remastered[/i] is essentially the same as it was before, but with sleeker graphics and a more modernised interface. While the story hasn't changed, it surprisingly (or not) hasn't aged one bit either - tentacle mutates and seeks to conquer the world, and only you (and your friends) can stop him! Though straightforward, the game's charm is in its various amusing time travel locations and the weird and wonderful characters you meet along the way. This is a prime example of where [i]\"it's all about the journey, not the destination.\"[/i]\n\n\n[h1]Yays![/h1]\n\n+ Vibrant, colourful, hi-res cartoon-style graphics.\n+ Well-designed rooms, locations and scenery.\n+ Fully voiced, with good voice acting for the most part. (The guy who plays Dr Fred is awesome.)\n+ Interesting, memorable characters.\n+ Fun, amusing story.\n+ Wacky humour.\n+ Clear goals.\n+ Cool easter eggs. (Under \"achievements\".)\n+ Contains a free game ([i]Maniac Mansion[/i])!\n+ Puzzles are mostly enjoyable and require some creative thinking.\n+ Many gameplay hours.\n+ Trading cards.\n\n[h1]Nays.[/h1]\n\n- [url=steamcommunity.com/app/388210/discussions/0/392184522713202518/]Audio starts stuttering[/url] after a while, due to memory problems.\n- Achievements remain hidden, even after the game is completed, so you can't see what you're missing.\n- Some puzzles have illogical or nonsensical solutions.\n- Bugs: e.g. When looking at one of the items, Laverne's voice sounds when Bernard speaks.\n- No mouse command to fast-forward dialogue; instead, you have to press \".\" which is really inconvenient, especially when the whole point of a point-n-click game is to [i]not[/i] have to use your keyboard!\n- Some counter-intuitive puzzle set-ups: E.g. For the videotape puzzle, a button which looks like the \"STOP\" button, is actually the \"RECORD\" button. Anyone who's ever used a VCR or tape recorder would know that the square symbol denotes \"STOP\", while the round button denotes \"RECORD\". \n- Hoagie's periodic belches sound absolutely disgusting!\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nThis was a hugely enjoyable experience from start to finish. Though the nostalgia factor played a part in my case, even if you've never heard of the [i]Maniac Mansion[/i] series, as long as you count yourself a point-n-click adventure game fan, this is a must-play because it just gets so many things right. Add to that the timeless plot and wacky characters, and you have yourself a game that will play just as fresh & new decades down the road.\n\n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [td][u]Disclaimer:[/u] [i]Game played for free, with many thanks to my dear friend [url=steamcommunity.com/id/kflorence]KFlo[/url]. :)[/i][/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]",

      "[h1] DiRT4 a review and comparison with DiRT Rally [/h1]\n\nAfter 100 hours in Dirt Rally and another 40 in Dirt 4 I feel like I am finally able to give a good comparison of both games while also reviewing Dirt 4. This review will be comprised of 5 categories of which \"Handling and Realism\" is the most important for me at least.\n\n[u] Handling and Realism [/u]\nIt is immediately clear that Dirt 4 is less focused than Dirt Rallye being a sequel to Dirt 3 rather than Dirt Rally but this does not mean Dirt 4 is less realistic than Dirt Rally.\nOn the contrary cars have more weight and are not as floaty as in Dirt Rally. There is no more pogo jumping over bumps and driving techniques like lifting/breaking before jumps are actually useful. In general weight transfer is much better in Dirt 4 than in Dirt Rally lockups are more present than in Dirt Rally encouraging good driving and on-throttle braking. \nGrip levels are quite high in places probably because of the added car weight at least on gravel stages. On tarmac Dirt 4 is way better than Dirt Rally still not very good since there is no tire flex but cars do not seem to drive on rails grip is significantly lowered compared to Dirt Rally and cars are more lively.\nThe real issue Dirt 4 seems to have is on-throttle traction. In general cars have to much traction especially when driving RWD cars on-throttle oversteer is not as progressive as you would expect on a gravel road and traction breaks very sudden thus playing with the gas is not as effective in creating oversteer as it should be making RWD cars quite boring and stale compared to AWD and FWD cars. Weather does not affect handling too much on gravel and tarmac which is a bit of a shame since it seems like there are tools in place for simulating aquaplaning. On snow weather has no affect on handling whatsoever. While both games have deforming snow banks in Sweden leaning still does not really work since the snow banks in both games just feel like guard rails with some padding attached to them more deformation would be better. Damage models are great and internal damage seems to occur more often than in Dirt Rally but the damage model is far from realistic and just not punishing enough a hardcore mode would be very much appriciated since all the necessary tools seem to be in place.\nFFB hasn't much changed since Dirt Rally it still requres a lot of tweaking and is missing many effects and settings other sims like iRacing, Assetto Corsa and RaceRoom have.\nNonetheless Dirt 4 has a more realistic driving experience than Dirt Rallye. \n\n[u] Tracks [/u]\nCodemasters has put a lot of effort into highlighting the procedural track generation tool of Dirt 4. While it is an intriguing idea to have countless tracks and endless content the execution lacks variety. It seems as if the tool is combining certain premade sections procedually. The issue could be fixed if codemasters creates  [b] many [/b] more sections the algorithm can choose from. Also a track editor where users could make their own track sections and tracks would help mitigate repetition and prolong the games lifecycle. Also rally stages are quite short compared to their real life counterparts which can exceed 40km more than twice the length of Dirt 4's longest stages. Codemasters is keen to make Rally stages longer but claims that the Ego engine cant handle stages longer than ~18km. Still repetition is way smaller than in Dirt Rally which has maybe 20 hours worth of original content. The selection of locations is limited due to licensing but diverse enough. Rallycross has more tracks and is more fleshed out than in Dirt Rally while retaining the official FIA branding and Landrush is a nice addition to the game while not necessarily needed.\n\n[u] Cars [/u]\nThe car selection lacks a bit. While most of the really important rallye cars are in the game some classes like WRC are missing completely due to licensing issues making R5 the fastest available class in the game for rallying. Rallyecross on the other hand has all cars you can really wish for since Codemasters hold the license for the FIA World Rallycross Championship.\n\n[u] Graphics [/u]\nOverall the graphics haven't improved much since Dirt Rally. While lighting and effects have improved the overall looks of the game are hindered by the quite repetitive stages. Also variation is very big while sometimes really beautiful e.g. a stage after some rain Dirt 4 can come across really stale looking. Still the game does not look bad the engine just needs a  refresh. \n\n[u] Sound [/u]\nLike the graphics Dirt 4's sound didn't really improve since Dirt Rally. Sounds are generally informative but not much more also Dirt 4 has some layering issues and you probably need some adjusting to get a good mix. The co-driver is really good considering the tracks are procedually generated but bad camber call-outs would be appreciated. Really nothing bad but nothing special either.\n\n[u] In Conclusion [/u]\nWhile Dirt 4 may not be a perfect game in any sense, it improves upon Dirt Rally and still delivers a good challange. Many of the general directions are IMHO correct. Going to procedually generated stages is the way to go in the future but still needs a lot improvement and polish to really become what it is intended to be. Also a better damage system and further evolution of the handling would be much appreciated but still the basics are done right so if you were on the fence buying this game give it a try.",
      "This game has such a HUGE potential like Stardew Valley in its early days!!\nCollecting stuff, helping people by crafting potions its so rewarding and lovely pls dear developers keep working on it. I BEG YOU! :D\nSure it has some bug right now but even on day one they managed to get some fast fixes and tried their best to make it work for everyone. \nThe controls were a bit tricky in the beginning (used Playstation 5 Controller) but its just a matter of time, its just not the normal controls like in other games.\nThe music was pretty nice and chill and also the animations were super cute, i love watching little Rubrum built his sandcastles over and over again. >3< \n\nOverall a good game, but could become even more better in the future, keep going guys!!",
      "This version comes bundled together with some kind of horrid bloatware called \"Steam\" which functions as a type of DRM meaning you do not actually own the game. Avoid at all costs, buy it on CD instead!",
      "You will enjoy the game at the beginning, it's fun and entertaining...Until you start playing the harder and larger hospitals and you get plagued with bad pathing issues, bad AI, people getting stuck in rooms, people dieing but they idle in a death state and stay around forever and all kinds of glitches which kills the enjoyment and ruins the management aspects. I've had to stop playing this game until they patch it because right now you're just managing bugs and glitches and you will have to design hospitals to get around these bugs, so that means extra wide corridors and spacing items out so people don't get stuck. Which sucks.\n\nNeeded much more playtesting before being released.\n\n*This is from v1.01.*",
      "DON'T BUY THIS GAME!\nThis is one of the best games I've ever played. It is quite possibly the best and most detailed Choose-Your-Own-Adventure novel ever written and if you buy it now the creators will receive *NO COMPENSATION* for their work. I am thankful i bought it when I did, while they were still involved, but due to contracting and political differences (ironically fitting for the content of the game) the 2 or 3 writers who pioneered this project were cut out and can't receive royalties anymore.\nThis is a game about the inherent flaws in dogmatic political ideologies, all ideologies including centrism and being a moderate, and it was essentially stolen by capitalists.\nI love this game with all my heart. It is a beautiful story about loss, depression, and finding meaning in a chaotic and absurd reality. Anything more is kinda spoilery so I'm gonna stop myself there. It is all narrated so you dont have to read the enormous amount of text on your own and it is HILARIOUS. Depressing at times but always that spark of humor lingers.\nDON'T BUY THIS GAME. And *DEFINITELY* don't *PIRATE THIS GAME*. Even though it is totally in line with the messaging of the game, would be a HUGE middle finger to the corporation that cut the writers out of their own creation, and is super easy to do with like an an hour of searching Reddit or something, *YOU SHOULD* not *PIRATE THIS OUTSTANDING GAME*. Thank you for reading this, I hope you do the right thing, and you should totally hit on that girl at the beginning she is super into you and there will be no repercussions. Peace.",

      "This game looks incredible and I'm really enjoying the story so far. It does have some bugs still, but nothing I've come across has particularly bothered me, much less ruined the game. It's incredibly immersive and detailed, the voice acting is really good, and the gameplay is fun.",
      "A lot of people's main complaint's seem to be about microtransactions. The game is perfectly playable without spending a dollar other than what you spent on the base game. And it's really not P2W. mostly aesthetic. Dedicated servers would be nice. but I feel they could fix this by better host migration. It is rather annoying when in a 4v4 and the host gets tilt and breaks the match by leaving, losing all the exp earned.\n\nTL;DR people are mad about spending extra money but want dedicated servers for free? =/\n\n*EDIT* after spending a few hours practicing, I now get told to kill myself on a regular basis in duels.\n\n11/10 Git Gud",

If you need something to play with your group of friends during quarantine, this is the game!",
      "So, I hated this game at first...\n\n I've never been into a MMO before, and I went into it with a mindset of \"FUCK YEAH! MULTIPLAYER SKYRIM LETS GO\" - In short don't do that. This isn't going to be like playing Skyrim, Oblivion, Morrowind. \n\nIt is when it all comes down to the core an MMO, it's set in Tamriel, it sounds like Tamriel and the storylines feel like an Elder Scrolls game. However being an MMO, it has a lot of grindy MMO style quests. And don't get me wrong, it's bewildering at first, all these mechanics, all these places to go....and before the 'One Tamriel' update if you chose the wrong faction, you were screwed, in a place all on your own surrounded by all these people who are WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY higher level than you. But thankfully they changed all of that. The game scales now, so you can rock up to a dungeon with your level V300 mate, and still have some fun slicing up enemies.\n\nSo I saw a friend playing the other day, and spent a few hours installing this to join him (By the way its like 70 Gig...If you have slow internet prepare for a few days of download), I got back on it after not playing for 14 months, but this time I was playing with a friend who was already Veteran Level 250, So I was in luck, he introduced me to everything and I got used to all the deconstructing of equipment to get my blacksmithing up, showed me about dungeons and bascially got me to enjoy the grind. I think my previous time was a bit lackluster because I got dropped in the middle of the Aldmeri Dominion on my own, without any of my friends. So I left.\n\nNow I know what I'm doing, and keep in mind I usually hate MMO's never played WoW or anything like that, this is the first one. I'm enjoying myself, I'm triple digits into this game time-wise and I don't see it stopping now. We've made a guild for noobies. To help them out, and get them to enjoy the game also. Because the community is nice...but you still get the elitist fucks from any competitive game kicking you out of dungeons because you're only level 14. But you won't get that when you're in a guild, having people to play with and explain all the mechanics did help, a lot. I've even gone as far as to buy this AGAIN on steam just to collect my hours and so on.\n\nAdd-ons are awesome being able to mod basic features of the game to help with information and quality of life improvements is a must. I'll provide an essential mods pack if any of you wish to know.\n\nFor those of you who actually got this far into this, well done. I didn't think I'd keep you captivated long enough to get to the end.\n\nIf any of you are new to the game, on EU server and would like to join a guild to show you the way, add me or visit our [url=www.godsofsalt.com]website[/url] and join us on teamspeak, or just message us in game @diseasedcrow.\n\nBut all in all if you like Elder Scrolls and you think you want to try this, just do, I'm glad I gave it a second chance.",
      "For every like this review gets, I will consume 1 spoonful of mayonnaise",
      "Ahh, CrossCode.\nLet's start this review with what this game does right.\n\nPros:\nEverything. There review is complete. But on a serious note I'll elaborate.\n\nThis game starts out very generically. You got an amnesia stricken heroine. You got fairly archetypal characters. The story is the typical trying to figure out your past. But it's not. I lied about all that, that only covers the first 10-15 hours then you see drastic changes in the pace and tone. The story turns out to be well done, not the best, but enjoyable. 8/10 for story and characters.\n\nLet's talk about gameplay. It's perfect, seriously. The pacing of combat is fairly quick. There's a decent variety of enemy types which nearly all of them have some sort of unique trait. Your skill set leaves you with a lot of variety and different tools to take on different situations. I have yet to get bored of it, despite the fact combat isn't inherently profitable for most of the game. Puzzles. You have timing puzzles, logic puzzles, memory puzzles, enemy based puzzles. It's all there. It's all enjoyable. They're quite varied, no two puzzles feel the same. This game has over 200 'maps'. And just about every 'map' has a puzzle or two (optional or not). Ez 10/10.\n\nArt design. I'm a sucker for 16 and 32 bit graphics. The level designer, this guy made the game. He created some beautiful and interconnected maps with nearly everything having purpose. In all honesty, I have never seen design quality this high, it even beats out SquareSoft games (you know before they became that crappy company that is SE). 10/10 again.\n\nCharacter design. It works. Not the best. Not bad. The characters look the way they should. Lukas' nose drives me crazy, it's huge. But Holiday Man is solid. 7/10.\n\nMusic. Some of it's great. Some of it annoyed ME (but I'm picky). They stayed true to what they were trying to make. But it's obvious their composer was no Yasunori Mitsuda. But still, what I enjoyed, I really enjoyed. 8/10.\n\nDid I enjoy it? Every single minute of it. Even when I was confused. \"I WILL figure this puzzle out.\" 35/40, based off my personal taste, but CrossCode is as damn near perfect as you can get.",
      "Oh boy. DoDonPachi Resurrection.\nI love this game. Its loads of modes, tight controls, great bullet patterns, and fun gameplay and scoring mechanics make it an awesome shooter. \nThat being said, this game is tough as nails. Even the novice mode is hard as heck and definitely isn't novice-friendly. I reccomend having one or two shmup clears under your belt before you try to tackle DoDonPachi. (Crimzon Clover's novice mode is a good introduction to shmupping) You need some skill to get the maximum amount of enjoyment out of this game.\n\nStill, though, It's awesome! DoDonPachi Resurrection is a very fun experience, even with it's difficulty.\n",
      "This game is utter trash, a classic example of a terrible game that exists only to make the developer money on card sales. There are no options for audio and video settings, the textures and font are ugly as hell, and the controls stink. You move a glowing ball of light around and pass through various colored laser barriers. There are enemies who dim your light on the first hit, and kill you on the second. The instructions are barely above gibberish, with instructions like \"color change to spend the wall color\" and \"use the right button mouse for charge and defend\". You eventually piece together that those instructions mean \"touch the colored balls of light to change the color of your light to match the laser barriers in order to pass through them without dying\" and \"stand on the button and right click to power up laser barriers to protect yourself from the small enemy lights that chase you relentlessly when you get too close\". That second one is only theoretical though, as in practice it's impossible to escape the enemy lights fast enough to have time to charge the defensive laser barriers, so I have no proof that they actually destroy the enemies. On top of all that, the game occasionally gets stuck after you die a few times on the same level, and there's nothing to be done except restart from the very beginning on the tutorial levels. There's the potential for an interesting puzzle game here, but the execution is so bad I can't recommend this junk even for the price of two cents that I paid.",
      "To be honest, this game is a bit of an acquired taste. At first I didn't get it: Few options to customize your army, at the beginning of a battle every unit has its predetermined place on the map, there's an unforgiving time limit to reach your objectives and the graphics could be much better. The first encounters with an entrenched enemy ended in a bloodbath for my units, despite overall superiority in numbers and total command of the air. And when I learned that you don't necessarily keep your veteran units after a successful battle but sometimes have to start the next scenario with new ones, I came close to deleting the game.\n\nLuckily, I  didn't. Like any decent strategy-game, UOCII takes some time to learn. The game's mechanics and its reliance on logistics are the main differences to most others I've played. The first lesson: Your success depends heavily on understanding both your own and the enemy's supply network. Finding his vulnerable spots while protecting your own is elementary. Once you figured out where to strike and with which units, your chances improve dramatically. The AI is quite good and will help you find your own weak spots soon enough – a single forgotten enemy in your rear can easily stop the most impressive offensive, if it decides to block the one railway line supporting all your units and your HQ. +-To make things more interesting, the game relies on Headquarters, which you have to move around together with your regular units. These HQ can and must be improved over time to learn additional “skills” like bridge-building, special orders, emergency supply etc. During a battle, they must be kept within range of your units to be effective, giving the game a bit of an role-playing-aspect: One or several generals moving around, each commanding a part of your force, never too close to the firing line, all the while learning new skills and helping your units to do a limited number of special tricks. Nice flavour.\n\nI could write a lot more, but to sum it up: UOCII is a really rewarding strategy-game with some new and interesting features I haven't found anywhere else. It's not perfect – more options to customize or to place units would be welcome and the difficulty in some of the later DLCs is quite brutal -  but all in all it's very much worth its price. Still enjoy it after several years and look forward to the next DLC (Africa) :-)",
      "DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU ALREADY OWN SHOVEL KNIGHT!!!!\n\nIt's a free update to the Original Shovel Knight if you purchased it.  Not a bad game by any means, has the same charm as the original S.K., but why pay for it here if you can get it free with the original (now called Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove).\n",
      "I appreciate the sincerity of Jusant. You can tell its creators have placed genuine care into their product, which has made the experience of playing it joyful and kind.\nThe visuals are stunning, the mechanics are not overwhelming, the soundtrack is soothing, and the puzzles are not frustrating. A great climbing game all around with an easy-to-follow yet gripping narrative. \nHopefully, Ukrainian localization will also be added soon.\n",
      "The game vaguely reminds me of Yume Nikki and Strange Telephone due to thematic similarities, but in the end, I think it managed to be something completely different - I don't want to compare it directly to Undertale, but I got those narrative vibes as well. Unlike its exploration-based relatives, UNREAL LIFE is somewhat of a linear game, but the areas tend to loop around into the hub when using waypoints, occasionally involving some backtracking and optional achievements (including a game within a game). It took me about 6 hours to get 2 bad endings on the same playthrough, that said I am missing more than half of the achievements and probably other endings as well. Despite its modest art style, I think the locations and the world design were very good, granted the game settings are very limited for the price. The writing and characters were the highlight of the experience for me, I would say I enjoyed about 95% of the dialogue and world-building, despite being a very text-heavy game. The game tells a story in a unique way where the character can extract memories from the objects that she touched, unlocking potential hints that you will need to solve puzzles.\n\nYour room works as a hub area to which you can return for manual saves or the minigame, additionally to connecting all areas with a waypoint system, but you don't have to worry too much about those as the checkpoints are very frequent. Generally, the gameplay is just exploring 2D levels, picking up items, and occasionally solving creative sequence puzzles. The character keeps track of 3 different memories that may contain clues if you managed to miss them - it's hard to do because the important text is color-coded. I want to give the devs credit for actually putting some originality into puzzle mechanics, they were fun and not difficult enough to drag the game down. However, when the character learns about a hidden item from the memory, you have to click in the correct spot with no indication, which is perfectly fine, I only wish I realized it sooner. For any Yume fans out there, the game works as a psychedelic visual candy, with many dream-like environments and themes to navigate. \n\n[i]In a way, playing through this game reminded me of the first time I finished watching Spirited Away, the journey so immersive it left me in a state of melancholy. Do you ever get a feeling that you changed as a person after finishing a game? [/i]\n\n[h1] Pros: [/h1]\n\n+ fun characters, enjoyable narrative \n+ multiple endings and optional achievements \n+ creative puzzle based on memory mechanics \n+ nice variety of locations\n+ awesome soundtrack \n\n[h1] Feedback: [/h1]\n\n[u] Some Nitpicks [/u] - I ended up playing on a controller, but if you are using a mouse you have to drag the character around, it would be nice to have the clicking option instead - if it has one I don't know how to activate it. I was slightly confused by the main menu controls when using a controller, but if you can't figure out the buttons you can select the options with the mouse. I wish you just had the visual Q like \"new game\", \"load game\" and so on. Sometimes to progress you may have to talk to characters multiple times, so just make sure that you exhaust all dialogue before moving on. On a side note, you can softlock the game if the water turtle pushes you against the platform (not a big deal, reload 10 second checkpoint). Overall, I don't have any real issues with the game, mostly the story felt like sliding on a big stick of butter.  \n\n[b] Overall Thoughts: 9/10 [/b]\n\nIs it worth $20? Well, it's a really good game for this niche genre if you like those types of ambient/psychedelic games like Dreaming Sarah - it feels bigger and more ambitious than most. There is no question that devs put so much love into the project, but it's still a niche game at the end of the day. My skepticism slowly faded away as the game kept being compelling in the storytelling and enjoyable locations. As someone that plays many games that occupy the same space, I can't really imagine a game that offers much more than that. For me, it was a special game, and by 'special' I mean like it hit a nerve, got pretty personal. \n\n[code]Review By: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/31294838-Hidden-Gem-Discovery/ [/code]",

[/h1] \n\n\n[h1]===[ General Consensus ]===[/h1]\n\n[b]This was the baseline for two entire generations of Single-Player FPS[/b]\n\n[u]The Half-Life series is considered to be one of the \"Grandfathers\" of modern FPS. Along with some other titles of its generation, it revolutionized the shooter genre, giving games a new depth and even bigger focus on storytelling and big setpieces, remeniscent of action genre movies. And naturally, Half-Life 2 is remembered one of the finest games to be realized and developed, even after a tumultuous and bumpy development.[/u]\n\n\nI only came to the awareness of this game's status in the gaming world a few years ago. I never really heard too much about it or even payed to much attention to it; back in my childhood I remember seeing it around the internet but it never really talked to me.\nSo a few years back I bought the whole HL franchise here on Steam, already acquainted with the game's praise. \n\nAfter a couple of failed attempts to play HL2, but getting stuck on the same part, I finally got to finish the game. \nAnd I must say I'm totally on board with all the praise and status!\n\n\n[h1]PLOT:[/h1]\n\nThe story continues after the events of Half-Life 1, where Gordon Freeman, a scientist working on the Black Mesa Research Facility, fights his way through hords of aliens brought to Earth by a portal that Gordon himself opened.\n\nWe wake-up to a dystopian future where the Black Mesa and the alien infestation led to a very different world of ours, where humans live in a opressing society on the likes of the book \"1984\", where everyone is meticulously controlled by the \"system\".\nThis hugely different and creative setting really talked to me and even made me more interested in the narrative.\n\nFrom then on, Freeman tries to lead a group of \"resistence\" fighters to oppose and tear down the ruller of Earth, the former administrator of the Black Mesa Facility, Wallace Breen, (whom also \"negotiated\" a peace agreement with the aliens, right after the events of HL1).\n\nI must say this story is a very creative and different experience of those found in other FPS games.\nI always found myself on the edge of my seat, eager to know what was gonna happen next, and while also amazed by all the environmental storytelling.\nIt's truly one of the game's strongest points and even though your character doesn't speak, you will find yourself completely imersed on the narrative. Even all these years after, this political and social matter that Valve went for and explored is one of the game's strongest points really!\n\nAnd not to forget about all of those fantabulous and explosive setpieces seen throughtout the game that are really solid and entretaining, having inspired other games like Uncharted and the Call of Duty campaigns, just to say a few. You are really put in some tricky and tough situations.\n\n\n[h1]GAMEPLAY:[/h1]\n\nThis is your average FPS gameplay. Nothing you haven't seen before, but HL2 is certainly a gold standard of how to excell and give variety in your gameplay.\n\nYou've got your normal 2000's arsenal, like Pistols, the series' signature weapon the Crowbar, a Revolver that packs a serious punch, an SMG, Assault Rifle, Shotgun (THAT FEELS SO GOOD TO SHOOT), Grenades, Crossbow, Rocket Laucher and a new \"toy gun\" the Gravity Gun.\n\nAt the time, Valve was developing a new physics engine never seen before that went on to shake and revolutionize games at the time, but in order to really make usage of this new technology, [u]the developers of Half-Life 2 introduced the Gravity Gun to the weapons roster [/u]. \nWith it you can \"grab\" multiple objects, such as crates, file cabinets, gasoline tanks or even buzzsaw blades to throw at oponents. It's a very creative way to make usage of the different environment assets while showing off new technology.\nIt's also another tool to help you get out of sticky situations like puzzles, something that Half Life 2 really experiments with. \nWith this engine, Valve pushed the physics to bring different puzzles that just feel natural to solve.\n\nGameplay feels really natural and it's what we have grown accostumed to in the FPS genre, but very competent and polished.\n[spoiler](the shotgun just feels awesome and sooooo satisfying to shoot)[/spoiler]\n\n\n[h1]SOUND AND MUSIC:[/h1]\n\nSound feels like a very big step-up comparing to Half-Life 1 and every weapon sound much better when firing.\n\nEnvironmental sound is really good and pushes you even more to the game's immersion. Every area of the game is masterfully design, to the sewer sections that feel so claustrophobic and tense to walk through, to the more city like big places where you can sense the real sense of scale of the space through the sound design. \n\nI must say it's really top notch.\n\nBut there were times where I felt that the sound mixing was a little off, having sounds playing with a really pumped up volume that really distracted me and put me off.\n\nIn the other hand, the Music is just amazing. It's 00's techno and rock like music that just injects you with such adrenaline and makes you feel really awesome with gunning down opponest. VERY SATIFYING INDEED.\n\n\n[h1]GRAPHICS:[/h1]\n\nIn all honesty this is a hard category to judge, because obviously the graphics are going to look a bit dated to what we have today (in 2020), but honestly everything look really good.\n\nFrom characters and enemies, to the environments, to the fire and explosion effects, it all looks very good and has a great level of quality to them. Specially the alien creatures. I felt utterly disturbed by those \"facehuggers\" like creatures. Everytime they jumped at my face I would equally jump, but of my seat with disgust... \n\n\n[h1]CONCLUSION:[/h1]\n\n[b]To summ it up, I think that Half-Life 2 is a must play game. \n\nReally, if you are like me and you have heard about it, but was like \"meh maybe this game is old and dated and its now crap\", just cut the argument and go play a really good and polished experience.\n\nFor those out there, if you want a polished and strong game that still challenges most contemporary games, with an interesting narrative, and some awesome moments just grab yourself a copy of this. It's dirt cheap, no excuses...[/b]",

      "[b]HUGE DISCLAIMER[/b]\nThe Steam version of Titanfall 2 STILL REQUIRES ORIGIN. It has NO useful Steam integration whatsoever. It launches the game through Origin, and you can only invite friends through Origin. If you've already got Titanfall 2 on Origin, you may as well skip this. \n\nTHAT SAID\nTitanfall 2 is one of the greatest (if not [i]the[/i] greatest first person shooters of our generation. The game's four years old, I'm not sure I can say anything that hasn't been said before.  The story is short and sweet, and genuinely really really good. The multiplayer is the meat of this game, and it's fantastic. Movement is fast and fun, shooting feels great (I mean, these dudes made Modern Warfare, so), piloting a giant robot is sick as hell.\n\nI don't know what to tell you. If you play FPSs and you've never tried Titanfall 2, you owe it to yourself to buy this game.",
      "Absolutely amazing. PLEASE don't judge this game based on how it looks. You must try it yourself! I thought it would be terrible but a friend convinced me to try it, and I'm glad he did. I haven't had so much fun in a game in a long time.",

      "Big improvement over the first game. \n\nCombat is much more enjoyable and the boss fights actually have some interesting patterns and design. I had some issues with taking damage when being too close to the boss which was frustrating but not too huge of an issue. Boss patterns felt fair and it felt like I really learned the fight in and out by the time I beat them.\n\nPersonally I found the overworld a bit less visually interesting than the first; though travelling back and forth between two different worlds was a nice touch. The overworld also has lot of mazes, much more than I remember in the first game. That being said, I spent much less time not knowing how to progress in the game which is nice.\n\nAudio-Visual presentation is excellent as to be expected. Though I also felt the narrative to be more interesting this time around. I was able to follow the narrative pretty well and the plot even has some pretty good twists. Overall another improvement over the first game.\n\nIn general I found this a lot less frustrating to play than the first game; allowing for the game's good points to work better. Given this I have a much easier time recommending this than the first game, which was always a very cautious recommendation from me. It should be noted that this game has many references to the prequel so it should be played before this; even if doing so is a bit rough. If the third game improves on this I would have very little issue recommending the whole trilogy.\n\n",
      "I am a 43 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he helped me. Loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.\nThank you <3",

      "Edit 2 (9/24/22): The devs have made several updates now to address some of the UI problems. And right now, the in battle experience is greatly improved, especially when not using a mouse. It's good enough that I'm having fun playing it now, and am looking forward to seeing more of it so I'm reversing the thumb on this review. However, the experience remains decidedly clunky, especially with a mouse and especially out of combat. Overall, to anyone who is expecting a modern game with modern usability and controls, this game is not for you. But if you don't mind those things so much, this game has some real meat on its bones. It also has delightful music and sound. I'm leaving the original review here, as I hope the devs will continue to improve on the usability of the game so that everyone can enjoy it fully. If you're playing on keyboard and mouse, I'd recommend using the option that disables the mouse, the jank doesn't feel as bad when you're not clicking\n\nEdit: The devs have taken this feedback very seriously, I'm keeping a close eye on this game to see when things change so I can give this game another go.\n\nAgh... I really want to like this game. The customization and squad building seems like it will get really cool in the later parts of the game. But I don't think I'm going to make it to the later parts of the game. Why? Because the UI and controls are so frustrating. Camera movement is frustrating, selecting units is frustrating, distinguishing between your units is difficult, managing your squads is frustrating, promoting your characters is confusing, even attacking is a pain in the butt. Every time I go to do anything there's always some interface or controls issue in my way. And every time I finish a map and have to go do the in-between battles management, I know the UI will fight me every step of the way. \n\nMy thoughts on what should change:\n\nOut of battle:\n- On the \"Organize Army\" screen, I shouldn't need to click \"Squad Operations\" first to look at a squad. Simply clicking a squad should do that.\n- When returning to \"Organize Army\" from a squads view, \"Squad Operations\" is deselected, and has to be clicked again.\n- It is not possible to scroll the squad list without clicking \"Squad Operations\"\n- When I am in one mode on the squad screen (say \"Move Unit\") I can't switch to another mode by clicking the appropriate button, I have to cancel first.\n- When changing classes, there is not a clear enough indicator on the version of the unit I need to click that shows it has an upgrade available.\n- When changing classes, an extra click is required for no reason (and with no UI indication) before the upgrade options are viewable.\n- When changing classes, it should be easier to see what the next tier options will be for that class.\n- There should be a way to quickly view and either upgrade or sleep for a year all units who have class mastery between battles, so I don't have to check every squad.\n- From the Organize Army screen, there is no way to see a squad's capacity, so you have to click into every squad to see if you can add another unit.\n- When equipping an artifact, the first empty slot should be selected automatically.\n- When equipping an artifact, if I click the item first and then the slot, that should work. Drag and drop would be nice too.\n- On unit details screens (such as Unit Status or Change Class) there should be derived stats, that let me see how much damage the unit does / resists. As is, it's hard to tell what my stats are doing for me.\n- Unit traits should show a tooltip saying what they do when you hover or click the name or icon, I shouldn't need to go to another page for that.\n- Affinities should show a tooltip saying what they do when you hover or click them, I shouldn't have to go all the way to the game manual for that.\n- When using an item, I should be able to see my list of items before selecting which unit I want to use it on.\n- When using an item, an extra click is needed before you can select the item, for no reason.\n- There should be a better visual indicator on the squad screen of who the squad leader is.[strike]Right now Jules looks identical to the archers on either side of him.[/strike]\n- In the marketplace, if I've clicked on \"Recruit\", and want to switch to buying items, I should be able to click direclty on \"Trader\" and vice-versa, without needing to cancel first.\n- When recruiting units, there should be a way to lock a units stats in place so I can look at their traits without accidentally mousing over another units name and switching it.\n- There should be a way to see what the deploy limit for the upcoming battle is, so I can organize my squads appropriately, without needing to go back to the battle prep screen after seeing it.\n- The mouse scroll wheel doesn't work on the game manual / tutorial pages\n\nIn Battle:\n- There should be a way to move the camera with the keyboard without moving the targeting cursor (this is necessary if I want to move the camera while still having my hand on the mouse)\n- It should be possible to move the camera with the mouse by left-click dragging, instead of having to bring the mouse near the edge of the screen (this is especially vital in windowed mode)\n- There should be a toggle to turn off the need to select \"Move\" for moving units on capture points\n- There should be a toggle to allow the turn to end automatically when all squads have taken their turn.\n[strike]There should be a hotkey to end the turn.[/strike] (There isn't, but double-tapping space is close to good enough)\n- There should be a hotkey to display the mission info, and the mission info should appear automatically at the start of a map.\n[strike]There should be a hotkey to move to the next unit whose turn is still available, so I don't always have to scan the screen visually for this.[/strike]\n- There should be a way to see a units health (% of units alive, maybe?) and morale at a glance from the battle map. It takes so much time to dig out morale information for each unit by clicking all the way into their unit details.\n[strike]When you hover a unit, their morale needs to appear in the little mini-squad-view that pops up.[/strike]\n- There should be a way to see a tooltip explaining what a piece of terrain does.\n[strike]There should be a way to make an enemy unit's attack range stay visible on the screen so I can plan around it. Ideally, I'd be able to have multiple units selected for this at once, and be able to highlight them in different colors.[/strike]\n- There should be a way to quickly distinguish between squads led by the same unit type at a glance, especially when both squads are led by main characters. [strike]Right now Jules' squad and Narima's squad are identical visually.[/strike]\n- During combat, there should be a clear indicator of which unit is the squad leader.\n- After selecting an attack type, and a squad to target, on the screen that shows the two squads, there should be buttons I can use to change my attack type (such as switching to \"Force Surrender\" after seeing the enemy's morale is low).\n[strike]If I back out of an attack, I should be able to change attack type, or which action I do without the unit undoing their entire turn and deselecting themselves[/strike]\n- On the list of attack types, \"Force Surrender\" should have an indicator of what the surrender chance is, so I don't have to keep checking it.\n- It should be easier to tell at a glance if a unit has ranged attacks. Especially, some of the icons for cavalry ranged units are hard to identify.\n[strike]When moving units, it would be nice to have a visual indicator for units I can do a charge or ambush attack against[/strike]\n\nGeneral:\n- There need to be better resolution settings. Almost every piece of text in the game is difficult to read on a high resolution monitor.\n- The game needs rebindable controls, it's an accessibility issue.\n\nIf the game sees improvement in this area, I hope to be able to give it another chance and change my review.",
      "I thought I could overcome the Chinese Language barrier since I read chinese webnovels, but as it turns out trying to decipher game content is a different ballgame from novels. \nSo far, what I can make of the story is making me cringe and I can't quite figure out the combat mechanics, but I'm hoping that English translation will make it better (optimistic).

      "This game is like cocaine. \nI always tell myself just one more, then im done. I'll do homework. I'll sleep. I'll eat something. \nBut you know what? That last death was cheap, I'll do one more to make up for it. I just need 1000 gold for that upgrade, I'll just do one more to get it. Always just one more. \n\nThings I like:\n\n+Strong RPG Progression - Gold from your run can be spent on stats, equipment, abilities, etc. making multiple runs and longer runs more rewarding.\n\n+The game is witty and has flavor. -- there are various conditions your new characters can have such as being blind, gay or having a fear of chickens, amongst many, many others. Dying is in this sense, pretty fun. The writing has a lot of charm!\n\n+The controls are very tight -- this game has good controls. It's easy to do what you want, which is good because it's very tough and you will die a lot.\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n- The bosses in new game plus don't get harder -- As you progress into new game + or ++ or +++ and beyond, the bosses don't scale well, despite the general enemies leveling up to basically become bosses themselves. Not a huge deal, but it's the only negative I have.\n\nThen at some point you realize you've beaten the game, Thankfully there is a new game plus.\nMaybe just one more playthrough...",
      "VIDEO REVIEW: https://youtu.be/DzdF-i2drLs\n\nI loved this game!  It was a worthy prequel to Cthulhu Saves the World!  If you’re a fan of the games from this company I recommend playing it!\n\nIf there is one downside to the game, it’s that it’s very linear. Every game day you just make a selection to the R'lyehtionships options, a cutscene occurs and you get a reward item. Do that for a few in game days than the next level plays. These levels are just as linear as there’s very little deviating. \n\nHowever the rest of the game makes up for that short coming. The R'lyehtionships choices give great replay value, the writing is spot on, and the fighting is just as good.\n\nAlso the addition of a “skip incoming random battle” option was refreshing. \n\nSo overall i say that the game is another Zeboyd games classic that is perfect for the holiday. \n\nPRO\n+Great funny writing as per Zeboyd Games\n+Amazing graphics on par with Cosmic Star Heroine\n+Great music\n+Combat is easy simple and fun\n+Challenging but fair\n+ R'lyehtionships gives clever replay value \n\nCON\n-Game is painfully linear.\n-Very little places to wonder around in gameplay\n-R'lyehtionships causes Uber simplified “quests” to be glorified cutscenes\n-Needs more interactive items in the maps for more funny writing \n\nI’d give the game an 8/10! It’s highly recommend it if you’re a long time fan and it’s worthy a purchase during a sale if you’re unsure.",
      "Ib manages to do for me what so few horror games manage to accomplish, and that is to actually give a sense of unease and dread. Without going into spoilers, it's only a few minutes into the game that things start to tread the path of uncomfortable surrealism, with the art growing considerably more disturbing in how Ib interacts with it, and how the art interacts with her.\n\nWith all due respect to more conventional horror titles, say, Dead Space or The Evil Within, Ib maintains a feeling of dread and discomfort. Enemies can be evaded, yes, but there's a feeling of being stalked while trapped in a world you can't possibly fully understand. \n\nContrast Dead Space remake, where soon enough the horror gives way to cutting off an abomination's arm, then using telekinesis to impale it or another horror with said arm, then simply setting fire to the more mobile enemies.\n\nThis is not, I repeat, not to disrespect games in which reducing enemies to a smoldering heap of charred body parts is an acceptable tactic- there is a time and a place for the cathartic destruction of the nightmares that haunted our closets and lurked under our beds. Ib, however, leans firmly towards the horror and self-preservation of being in a hostile and unknown environment, where the only feasible option is to run, hide, and hope whatever nameless horror eventually loses track of you.\n\nAnd let's face it- some modern art galleries are creepy enough already, even in the daylight.\n",
      "It's hard not to compare this with Divinity: Original Sin. Both were funded on Kickstarter, both have a 91% score on Steam, both are rich, engaging cRPGs, and they were released months apart. It's fair to say both games have been wild successes that have surprised even the developers. If you had to pick ONE of these to invest time in which should it be?\n\nTurn-based vs. Real-time with pause: I eventually came to accept and even enjoy the real-time with pause combat of Pillars, though I much prefer turn-based. Real-time combat presents many problems that aren't the result of player mistakes. On numerous occasions I'd have characters stuck in place because the pathfinding didn't work right. The real-time combat often felt like a jumbled, chaotic mess instead of the tactical plan I had set out. Divinity is much cleaner in this respect and offered a much better experience, especially with respect to using the environment as a weapon. With Divinity I felt each power had a time and place, whereas with Pillars I ended up spamming the same powers and hoping for the best.\n\nStory: Pillars of Eternity definity wins out here. While the story in Divinity:OS wasn't bad, I would call it playful to the point of campy. Pillars had a deep, mature fantasy story worthy of a novel. While it was almost too much reading at times, the story was serious, dark, and dealt with real themes. \n\nArt: Pillars harkens back to the golden age of Infinity Engine games like Balgur's Gate, Icewind Dale, Planescape Torment, etc. The scenes are appealing, but prerendered and they felt a little static. This helps stoke the nostalgia for the late 90s, but Divinity feels up-to-date and immersive. Couple the art style of Divinity with it's highly interactive environments, and the world of Original Sin ends up feeling much more alive. \n\nMusic: Both were great soundtracks but Pillars feels just a bit derivative of the Lord of the Rings movies. They aren't bad at all, but almost generically fantasy at times. Music is important here because when you spend tens of hours in these worlds, you're gonna get this music stuck in your head.\n\nIn short, you should play both if you love deep, isometric, high-fantasy, western computer RPGs. If you MUST pick, consider the following choice. Choose Pillars of Eternity if you favor story and choose Divinity: Original Sin if you prefer combat. Both are hallmarks of a great RPG and each specializes beautifully.",

      "I remembered when I was 8, back then I used to play this on my PS3. It was one of the first RPG games i've ever played aside from Pokemon on GameBoy / Nintendo DS. This game made me feel like I'm in an another world back then. I had dreams of my companion and Drippy. It was such a nostalgic moment when I opened this game, and I was abit sad because I wished that I could turn back time and finish this game when I was a kid. I wasn't able to finish it at that time due to my brother taking away the PS3 overseas. Because now, after getting older, there are so many responsibilities that I must hold on to. Playing games like this during childhood truly changes the vibe of experiencing it. Now I only got a glimpse of it when I opened it for an hour or so.

Since the beta I wondered why mods on the mod page on the Chucklefish website were sometimes incorporated into the base game and now I know why.\n\nThe devs of this game ultimately have amazing talent behind them, but they've exploited those they've called \"volunteer developers\". Promising \"exposure\" as a form of payment, and ultimately delivering neither payment, or giving their \"volunteers\" a spotlight on their own steam page or website. \n\nStill, you and I'd both buy nestle products even if they were made by child laborers, Nike shoes made by sweatshop workers, and beauty cosmetics that harm animals and even harm us when we use them. Even making the most *perfect* product doesn't make you immune to criticism for gross business practices.\n\nStarbound is a fantastic game, with incredible mod support, a fantastic soundtrack, and just all around an amazing game even if it does have shoddy server support. It's essentially Terraria in space with a more engaging visual and music style yet shallower combat. It's much easier to approach than Terraria, without as much content. Still, I absolutely enjoy this game over Terraria.\n\nI love this game, but dislike the people who made this game. It took me a while to write this because I wanted to see if the devs would make up for their disregard for their \"volunteers\". They did not.",
      "If I could get my money back, I would. AI as usual is hot garbage, cant even take turns without getting LITERALLY BODIED by the AI drivers. The new progression system really sucks. Cool that they wanted to try something different, but I really dont feel like leveling every god damn car in the game just to modify it. If you wanted multiple of same car you would have to level those duplicate cars you purchase. My experience with the physics is just... eh. I mean I sure do love loosing grip just from barely tapping the gas. Constantly fighting my wheel just to stay stable. Driving its probably fine for controller players, I wouldnt on wheel. Credits are only used to buy cars now. Also kinda runs like crap. All i wanted was a Gran Turismo on PC and this... this is not it. Game is mid, move on me thinks.\n\nEdit: I put in a request for a refund and Valve did indeed approve it. I thought I was over the time limit for sure. Don't be me and spend 100 USD for early access. Thanks Valve, you're the best!",

      "Overall its a great hunting game. The base game is good enough on its own to give you an enjoyable experience hunting several varieties of animals. \n\nI feel that some of the best content is in the DLC's. I dont mind the price tag for maps are they are just a large and some of them have a truly diverse animal population. \n\nThe Weapon Packs have some items that really should have been available in the base game (.22 rifle).\nTripod stands, Tents and ATV's are also DLC items that i feel should have been included in the base game. \n\nThe cost for these packs are not huge, and I have bought them, but they really do impact your play in a meaningful way so it is hard not feel like they were left out on purpose. \n\nBeing a former hunter in real life I would say that the realism of it is pretty good. Lung shots and heart shots drop animals quickly and using the right ammo along with good aim greatly influences this. A poor shot will leave you tracking this wounded animal across the map till you sneak up on it again or just give up. \n\nThey have a system called Tru Racks (sumthn like that) that simulates different qualities of animals. So you end up with little bucks, average bucks, and monster bucks. Weight and coloration plays a part in this too. In short every animal has a trophy of some kind and they are varied by what must be some sort of RNG. \n\nAll that having been said, this game can devolve into a shooting gallery were you kill everything on sight as there in no real incentive not to. You get money and experience for every kill you claim and wiping out a heard of deer with your DLC M1 Garand on your DLC Tripod Stand becomes the quickest way to bypass the grind.\n\n It feels like the game starts as a \"hunting sim\" and becomes a \"poaching sim\" once you realize the progression system is going to take a long time to do...\"ethically?\".\n\n\nAgain, this is a game i would recommend, but it is just that, a game. \n\n",
      "Wow. Just wow. This is BY FAR the best visual novel i have played. the old school forums and cameras feel very detailed as whenever anything happens in a video chat, no matter how small, the characters react to it. the story was very enthralling and every time i slipped up and made a wrong move, my heart would feel as though it was gonna beat out of my chest. talking to violet felt very real and made the ending that i got so much more satisfying. the only bad things i can even say about this absolute masterpiece is just the fact that most of the really impact full options were locked because \"Emmett isn't cocky enough\" or  \"Emmett isn't compassionate enough\" which felt very vague and confining.\n\noverall the game is absolutely amazing and i wish the devs would come out with a game similar to this because of how good it was.\n9/10",

      "What a refreshing experience, returning to Ishimura yet again, but with a nice new coat of paint!\nAfter so many years, we finally got a \"new\" Dead Space game, and surprisingly, they actually delivered! \n\nThere are some differences in story and other details, but honestly I think it was all tastefully done.\nThe gameplay borrows from the games after Dead Space 1, like being able to TK enemies with spikes and their claws properly, along with stomping for loot!\n\nThere are also some new differences, like new side missions for extra story, and being able to return and explore areas you have previously been to, which I think was a wonderful addition.\n\nThere were a few small issues occasionally, I imagine with time these may be touched upon, but mainly it was fps hitching when loading new areas sometimes, and very rare crashes (I crashed twice through the entire playthrough)\n\nOtherwise I kept a stable fps for most of the game on Ultra settings, and didn't really experience any other issues (RTX 2080)\n\nIt really was just overall a great singleplayer experience for one of my favorite franchises, and I hope this will do well enough, so we can see more Dead Space in the near future from now on! \n\nGreat game, beautiful visuals, and wonderful experience, for any Dead Space fan. \n\n(Also small side note, you receive the original Dead Space (2008) suit upon visiting your stores inventory, which is a very welcoming surprise!

      "Early review right now after a quick hour of play.\n\nLater Alligator (and I swear I'm not biased towards this game at all) is a gorgeously 2d-animated, primarily point-and-click, cartoony romp through Alligator New York City. Everyone's alligators. The gameplay itself is simplistic; unlike normal point-and-click games of this style that you might have come to expect, there's no picking up items, there's no real big decision making. It crosses over more with Professor Layton-style gameplay, wandering around the city and picking up little collectibles by clicking on various pieces of the environment.\n\nScattered in between these are a plentiful trove of minigames in all sorts of styles. As far as I can tell, they begin to increase in complexity the further you go through (for reference, the first minigame is pretty much not fail-able; you're asked to track a Queen in 3 Card Monte, however the hapless alligator running the game barely moves the cards and flails on the two that *aren't* the queen.)\n\nHowever, it seems that the gameplay and the minigames are meant more as a vehicle for the whimsical comedy of the writing and the eclectic cast of characters present throughout the city. Each character is quirky and fun in their own way, with their own little story. And that's the real draw of this game. \n\nSo this game so far doesn't particularly lend itself to anyone looking to challenge themselves. But if you just want some good feelings, a laugh, and a spot of relaxation, Later Alligator delivers in spades.",
      "Don't let the horror tag scare you off; there are no jump scares, no over-the-top gore (there is some, but it's all pixels), nothing that leads to nightmares (at least not for me); and there are good endings too.\n\nA good story that takes about 4 hours to complete (including multiple endings -- there's a chapter select option after you finish so you don't have to replay the whole game). Some puzzles, a lot of cutscenes (all skippable, but worth reading). There's a lot of humour to be found in here too!",

      "Edit: ARCANE HALLOWS REVIEW (Written Feb. 19 2021)\n\nRoguelike Enthusiast's Caveat: The player's progression is directed in a much longer scale over multiple playthroughs due to the nonlinear nature of exploration unlike Hades or Skul. There is also a higher focus on evading stage hazards than said roguelites, with more control in how you start your run than needing to worry about coordinating a build throughout.\n\nNew Player's Verdict: The most recent large update for the game now makes the game well worth the price. Overall changes to the game makes the early-game far more approachable and increased the player's survivability all around while easing power progression.\n\nNew Resolve system for making powerups far less punishing is great. They added features to reroll power up selections as they add more, same with being able to rerolling character selection now that they added (two more very fun and powerful) new classes. The Skeleton Key, one such new randomized power up, addressed my issues with Fairy Chests which are a major source of character progression. \n\nEvery class offers such a unique playstyle while also having great power in their own right (though right now I feel the weakest classes are Ranger and Mage)\n\nNow if we could be able to rechallenge bosses we've beaten that would put me over the moon\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW (Written Feb. 4 2021)\n\nAbridged Verdict: Wait for Arcane Hallows Update (Feb. 18 2021) before purchasing for total content volume that matches RL1 along with additional QoL changes\n\nThe latest update as of writing this review (Far Shores) added 2 whole new areas, I bought EA awhile back but didn't really play much until this update, as the amount of content in the game effectively tripled between the areas, new classes, and QoL additions.\n\nGame is more accessible than RL1 for sure, but seems harder to get into than Hades, especially for people not used to roguelites. Namely, its far more punishing and harder to recover from mistakes.\n\nThings I love: The whimsical charm, the much more varied aesthetics of biomes as well as each biome having unique structures (Axis Mundi being a long hallway that makes it more akin to a Classicvania stage is genius). Classes having much more unique and pronounced playstyles adds much replayability. Boss mechanics and designs are much more complex this time around and the way they test your mastery of heirlooms is excellent. The new Armor System as a separate way to reinforce HP and the Mastery system to get steady stat increases go a long way to helping player progression. I'm seriously hooked on the gameplay loop in a way that I wasn't with RL1, every class is so much fun, and I'm so looking forward to the next update!\n\nMy Gripes: Runes are a total gamechanger that can make your life so much easier. Unfortunately the Fairy Chests that contain them are randomly spawned, and as a new player whether you can actually find and survive to one is a steep uphill road, and sometimes they just aren't possible without a specific class. The execution required for some challenges will be extremely difficult for more casual players and thus their ability to progress overall will be greatly hampered without the likes of things such as a soulsteal rune to recover HP. If there's an algorithm that sorts relative difficulty of Fairy Chest rooms, I would like if there were a way to increase the likelihood of creating Fairy Chest rooms if the player hasn't found any, and gradually make them more accessible until the player finds one. Additionally I would like if every Fairy Chest contained runes until you find them all in a biome, as I've gotten hordes of Gemstones from Fairy Chests before getting another rune or rune upgrade\n\nRelics. I'm looking forward to the Resolve system update because as of now, the hits to max HP are incredibly devastating, especially if you don't find a room that can give you the nectar to increase your max HP again (and even then its a huge gamble since you take a lot of damage from it). Most of them don't really feel worth the tradeoff as of right now, unless you find the War Drum to continually increase damage. If we can get a vendor to \"rent\" one (1) relic among a selection of ones we found for a certain amount of gold or something, similar to heirs that start with a relic without losing max HP would add a certain level of accessibility without removing the randomness aspect of roguelikes\n\nWhile all enemy attacks are technically possible to evade, this isn't always the case when you have certain combinations of enemies (Frostens and Aqua Braces in a room with a floor thats all spikes is so mean ; A;). Sometimes you'll spawn into a room next to a Warg that will immediately headbutt you before you can react and suddenly you take 70 damage. I would appreciate if certain enemies were stationary upon entering a room so you have time to process and react accordingly.\n\nEnemy damage scales extremely fast as you move through the map, along with their attacks becoming more frantic or complex, without means to restore HP and Armor through the specific runes, most classes' having lower max HP get real squishy.\n\nOne of the Duelist class's main attraction is that their talent gives them invulnerability windows with a roll, but it can't always be used of you're in a tight position without much room to move. I hope that they add a small invul window to the Dash heirloom, with runes to increase that window, but make it much smaller than the Duelist's (say 1/5th the time of whatever the window is of Duelist's talent)\n\nAnyways, despite my misgivings with the game I listed here, the game is really fun and a lot more accessible and varied than the original game, wait for it to go on sale and pick it up!",
      "Events that took place:\n\nDid not want to sell player,\nGot an offer for said player,\nRejected the offer,\nPlayer demaned to be allowed to speak to the club,\nGot a second offer from said club,\nEssentially forced to accept the offer,\nPlayer reached an agreement with the club,\nWished player the \"best of luck\" in his future endeavours,\nPlayer is angry that he is leaving,\nPlayer considerers his new club a \"step down\" in his career,\nReminder: Player demanded to go to said club,\nMe finding solice in the fact that FM19 although lacking in the football department, delivers a brilliant experience in dealings with manic and psychotic people.\n\nAllow me to grant you an insight into SI's employee knowledge on the subject their games are about. I once engaged in a conversation with a developer at SI about FM, and football in general. After some talking about premier league, and me slightly confused, I eventually understood that this developer thought that Tottenham Hotspurs were located in Liverpool. So I posed him the following question: \"Then why do they call any matches between Tottenham and Arsenal the 'North London Derby'?\" to which he responded that he did not know, but he assured me that Tottenham F.C was located in Liverpool. I had to resort to showing him the borough of Tottenham in London for him to understand that Tottenham Hotspurs is not lovated in Liverpool, but in fact in London.\n\nThis will be the last edition of this game series I will ever purchase. In a football management simulator such as this, letting SI and their employees (including the one that responded to this review) tell you various aspects of football, is like having a pervert preach to you about the virtues of sexual absitence. They know nothing, and since the core game has not progressed the slightest in 10 years, it would be a fair assumption that they do not care neither.\n\nFuck SI, Fuck their beloved \"devs\" and fuck Charlton Heston while you're at it.",

      "If you want to cut your teeth on the Final Boss of box-pushing puzzle games, then have I got the game for you.\n\nRight out of the gate SSR offers a somewhat uneven mix of real head-scratchers and what I can only describe as pity puzzles, but quickly reveals itself to be the sort of puzzler that mandates particularly extensive sessions of staring at the seemingly inconsequential number of tiles onscreen and poking experimentally at them until something starts to click. This demands a little more patience than I ordinarily have, but I was starting to appreciate the design as I acclimatized to it.\n\nThen I arrived at The Great Tower level (in only the second subsection of the overworld), which all at once foists about 4 times more pieces on you than you've dealt with previously, while simultaneously introducing a Z-axis and the concept of using pieces as platforms mid-puzzle.\n\nSSR does have a well-executed and forgiving Undo function with basically unlimited storage which is a great thing to have up until the time spent rewinding would outweigh the time spent to simply restart the puzzle and do over; the only way it could be made practical on a level that large would be if you had a full-on timeline scrubber like in the rerelease of Duke Nukem 3D.\n\nThere's patience, there's logic, and then there's [b]this.[/b] I play puzzle games to try and [i]relieve[/i] stress, not the other way round.

      "1. What is \"Pyre\"?\nThe game \"Pyre\" was made by Supergiant Games and was released on the 25th of July in 2017. After \"Bastion\" and \"Transistor\" this is their third game. \"Pyre\" is an indie-action-rpg, which story is mostly told in form of a novel. The gameplay is very different to the experience you probably made in \"Bastion/Transistor\", which lead a few people to put a negative review on steam. Now you will no longer play as one single character like before, but you are responsible for a group of exiles. The gameplay at it´s heart can be declared as 3 parts:\n \npart 1 contains travelling/exploring the world\n\npart 2 contains social interactivity with your group (talking/trading/decision-making)\n\npart 3 contains to take part in the rites, that means a fast-paced action ball game (3 vs 3) without        a planning phase (like in \"Transistor\")\n\n\n2. Technical details\n-the game runs fine on my windows 10 64 bit machine and it needs about 8.2 gb space of your hard drive. Unfortunately the game runs bad on old machines, because you need about 4 gb ram to run it without an error (my other 3 gb ddr2-system couldn´t run it, I received a ram-error-message when starting the game).\n\n-controls with mouse+keyboard or gamepad are good and well implemented.\n\n\n3. What does the game do right?\n-great rpg-novel-mixture as a whole unique and emotional experience\n-despite the linear progression (mentioned \"phases/parts\" above) the game stays interesting enough to continue\n-a colourful and fantastic world to explore (no open-world)\n-great character-design and a good variety of different creatures, which affects the gameplay during the rites\n-beautiful artstyle with a lot of detail and smooth animations \n-believable and fleshed-out storyline (NOT \"black and white\") with a personalised ending! \n-wonderful soundtrack (mostly ambient)\n-the creatures of the world speak their own language, subtitle is displayed in old-fashioned English\n-rites: the thrilling-faced-paced-action-game has a lot of depth to it (skill tree/character selection/items/area of the rite)\n-selectable difficulty level (rites can be optionally restartet), which can be changed during the game (+ \"titan-mode\": advanced challenges you can add separately like in \"Bastion/Transistor\")\n-meaningful and emotional decisions to be made (I´m looking at you mass effect), thankfully there are no dead-ends but different endings (personalised!)\n-\"Pyre\" is \"2-3 times\" longer compared to \"Bastion\"/\"Transistor\" without getting boring\n-good mouse+keyboard and gamepad support\n-\"versus-mode\": you can play against friends together on your pc or alone against CPU (with all the characters in the game!)\n\n\n4. What does the game do wrong?\n-the fast-paced-gameplay during the rites can be very fast and too stressful at times (I experienced some unfair situations here and there)\n-controls are sometimes not precise enough, especially when the gameplay is getting hot\n-hardware requirements (like \"Transistor\") with 4 gb ddr-ram are over the top regarding old rigs with dual-core cpu´s \n-some minor bugs during the rites (ball gets stuck, switching between characters over distance, bad camera angles over distance)\n-\"versus mode\" can only be played as local multiplayer\n-no bonus material for fans at all \n\n\n5. tl;dr\nPyre offers a fantastic but linear action-rpg-experience with a great story, which is told in form of a novel with a personalised ending. The gameplay is a mixture of exploration, social interactivity and a 3 vs 3 ball-sports-game. The level of creativity considering world-building, character design, music and the way the story is being told is on an insanely high level. If you liked \"Bastion\" and \"Transistor\" you need to know that you don´t play just as one character anymore. But what you can expect is a game with a heart, just like their games before. Pyre is in my opinion a masterpiece and the best Supergiant game so far.\n\n\n6. Final thoughts\nAs a child of the 80´s I played a lot of pc games. Sometimes I look back and remember how I bought game boxes from a company called \"Lucas Arts\". There were times I didn´t even inform myself about the upcoming games, I just bought them because I loved their games I purchased before. For me Supergiant reached that status in the present time. \n\n\n\nUntil the stars align!\nIf you liked this review be sure to hit the like button to help other players with helpful reviews.

      "The British Forces give the Allies a bit of the German defensive capacities. It has the problem of adding too many buildings to a game that is, in its core, dynamic and based on movement and aggressiveness instead of turtling. The British units are diverse and interesting, bringing much to the table. \n\nThe DLC lacks a proper campaign for the Brits, unfortunately, even though Caen, Goodwood, Arnhem and Walcheren could have been done in some interesting missions.

As this game isn't worth reviewing, there is nothing to review. Well, I should say there is stuff to review but I feel as though the dev's didn't even attempt to make this a game that anyone would enjoy. Well actually I'll let them off of the target of \"enjoy\", I'd go further to say it doesn't even feel like they tried to make a game that someone who had nothing to do and was bored out of their mind would say maybe I'll play this for a bit\nI jumped straight in, ignored the help in menu and started playing.

Once I did get the hang of it I still thought \"I must be missing something, I'm not really doing anything\" so I ventured to the help menu to find that nope, thats it buddy.\nThe controls are lacking, the soundtrack and the sound effects (which happen to be a melody playing) do not blend at all, (they play completely out of time on top of the soundtrack).\nYou can buy it and prove me wrong, go ahead.

This masterpiece came out of no where and completely reignited my love for gaming. PLEASE do not sleep on this game, it's such a breath of fresh air from the garbage you'd normally expect from modern day companies. Definitely taking a spot in my top 5 favorites and I haven't even scratched the surface of the game yet, it's just that good. Beautiful art style, crisp animations, a unique concept, FUN gameplay, its everything I've been wanting and more. Kudos to the devs for making this absolute banger <3",

Tons of questions that change based on the questions you've asked, you see a question that might not be there after you ask another question instead.

      "I was a playtester on this game, and I can say with authority, love and joy and care all radiate out of the work that was put into making this game. It still has the same Psychonauts wackiness and great comedy, but it's also become more mature, more understanding, more willing to tackle dark topics head on and acknowledge that human beings are flawed, and need help, and make mistakes, and sometimes even do awful things. But Psychonauts 2 understands that human beings aren't defined by any of this, and that people can learn from their wrongs and can change for the better. And it tells all this through a delicious array of gorgeous, varied mental landscapes, through creative collectibles that reveal the memories, loves, and regrets of the colorful cast, and through a combat and platforming system that is much improved from its predecessor. I can't recommend this game enough. It's an emotional triumph.",

      "Saw a few youtube videos on this and decided to check it out.  Only played 30 min but here's my review from that. \n\nCustomization options are disappointing and boring. All of the character skins were white guys (and a possible vanilla Mexican). The option not to add other races at least to the Allied side is weird. As a gamer, when given the option for customization I expect to be able to create a character I at least somewhat feel represents me so I can get immersed (and don't even talk about 'historical accuracy'). They're also level locked for some reason. The uniforms are basic as they should be and you have a very limited weapon selection depending on the class you choose which is standard for these kinds of games. The character customization is very lacking and the only real reason I see it being there is to create DLC uniforms to buy. \n\nThe game itself seems like it's going in slow motion and maybe it's something people get used to after a while but I couldn't deal with it. The run is more like a speed walk and it feels like the soldier is considering being a conscientious objector with the amount of hesitation in aiming. Also everyone was kind just playing the game like Battlefield anyway.\n\nThis is probably a game that's more fun to play in a serious MilSim community.",
      "Something I've been needing to get off my chest, despite how much maxis and EA go on about how much they care for the LGBTQ community, it's clear to me that they don't. First if they did they wouldn't be pushing the community the whey and as hard as they have. When things get pushed like they are, hateful people just harden there harts more, and just become infuriated. The sympathetic the become hatful towards it. The more something gets pushed, after awhile the more it gets hatted. A better approach would be, (if they really did care,) would be to put what they are talking about into a FREE pack, and get people whom make amazing custom content to contribute to it. If there is enough nice stuff in the pack people will download it, and talk people whom are on the fence to download it, and maybe to come over, and might start to get the people on the other side to at least get on the fence. That whey the LGBTQ community would get there representation, and acceptance would be pushed in a whey that won't burn people out.\n\n\nAnother resin why they should do it like this, and is part of why people are getting mad, is that they bought this game a certain whey, paid a lot for it and it's DLC, now they are changing, it and braking it to do so. Changing the experience against there will. Evan something you love like chocolate, or bacon, or anything will become something you hate if it's shoved down your throat ageist you will. If you want people to take it just offer it, most of the time people will take it. And if they don't just make it just make it more appealing. IE instead of braking the main game to add something even the LGBTQ community can't enjoy with a broken game. Make a free pack, and to tempt more people to get the pack, just add more nice CAS and build mode stuff. And maybe update the pack and add more stuff to it every once in awhile.\n\n\nI just had to say this for two resins, one companies being this careless or ignorant is just killing the public sentiment for LGBTQ and similar groups. And two, they are just killing interest in what they are selling, it will cut the Sims 4's life short, and will cut the Sims 5's life much, much sorter. \nIt's good to give options, as long as they are options. Or you are just like Hennery Ford, “The people can have the model T in any color! so long as it's black.”\n",

      "Ok so... \n\nFar From Noise is a narrative game in which you play a woman stuck in its car, balancing on the edge of a cliff. \n\nIt's about life, death, nature, purpose, creativity, dreams, stars and badgers. \n\nThe thing about Far From Noise is that it'll ask you something very special, something that we all forget to do nowadays, something that I've forgotten. This game will ask you to take your time. Don't rush things. Sit down and relax as you'll be forced to follow the slow pace of the game, but you'll enjoy it, for sure.\n\nThis game is for you if you come home after a rough day at work. This game is for you if you're searching for a meaning, a purpose in your life. This game is for you if you just want to experiment something new.\n\nBecause Far From Noise is offering you something new. It gives a vibe that is between Firewatch and Life is Strange, but without all the forced action, stress, adrenaline those game wanted to give. Don't misunderstand me, I loved those 2 games, but Far From Noise chose a direction more... pure. It's just you and the nature that evolves around you.\n\nI've finished the game within 90 mins, but I heard they were several endings, so I might as well try to get some more (but the one I've got fully satisfied me, to be honest).\n\nBeing more pragmatic, the art and sound coincide perfectly. The visuals are gorgeous and the musics hit just right where it needs to. You'll be lifted by the compositions as you'll stare into the beautiful sunset, and the dark starry sky.\n\nYou may find it expensive, as the game costs 8$ for one hour and a half of experience, but hey, think about a cinema ticket. Far From Noise is cheaper and the experience you'll live in it is wayyyyy more unique than most of the movies you go see. \n\nI recommend it. Play it. It'll put your mind at ease.\n\n\n\nPS: the main character is one of the most well-written i've seen in video games.",
      "Digital Eclipse’s Making of Karateka is a fantastic interactive documentary giving a Criterion Collection quality exploration of a game as well as persevering it to allow people to play it. The collection focuses on Jordan Mechner’s early years in game dev up until the release of Karateka and its ports. The collection is structured in chapters chronologically with each chapter being comprised of timelines that showcase a smorgasbord of information dealing with Mechner’s early works and Karateka. This information includes content such as concept art, magazine articles, interactive viewers that allow you to see how the animation process of Karateka was designed, and present day interviews with people like Mechner, some of the old Broderbund crew who worked on Karateka, and game devs inspired by the game such as Tom Hall and John Tobias. The way this all is structured is really engaging. The interviews dealing with Mechner’s early years are especially charming as he and his dad reminisce how the whole family inspired and worked to help Jordan make Karateka like how his dad dressed up in a karate gi and essentially did the motion capture for the Karateka MC and how he composed the whole soundtrack. Making of Karateka also does a splendid job preserving not only Karateka and two of its most popular ports, but it also has playable prototype builds. It also has previously unreleased games Mechner made before Karateka complete with earlier design builds as well, one of them being Death Bounce, an Asteroids inspired space shooter. There’s just so much clear love and care put in this collection’s creation and it’s truly splendid to see, especially because video game history and preservation isn’t considered as a serious undertaking compared to older artistic mediums such as literature and film. Video games, being the youngest of the mediums, was born in the age of mass corporatization where being a product that sells is considered to be far more important than being of piece of artistic media that should be celebrated. Films managed to emerge right before rampant commercialization happened so they were still able to be considered art that needed to be preserved, but games haven’t been as lucky and tend to just be considered expendable products, especially by major publishers. It’s just so heartening to see something like this exist. I do have one problem when it comes to this whole package though, I think Karateka is just a straight up bad game. \n\nKarateka may have been a technical marvel at the time, as the documentary materials extensively shows, but it has completely aged like milk and is just not a good game to actually play anymore, especially in the present when a vast plethora of games have surpassed it in all regards. It’s slow, clunky, and repetitive, combat is just mainly spamming kick and moving and back forth, the hitbox on the eagle is an absolute pain in the ass, and running is super awkward and can lead to enemies’ one-shotting you if you don’t get into combat stance fast enough. There’s no lives or continues so you just gotta slog through all those boring fights and unskippable cutscenes all over again. I’m admittedly not a big fan of 80’s games, but I can pick up games like Super Mario Bros., Tetris, or Galaga and have fun with them and respect their quality, plus they’re still quite accessible. Karateka is just miserable, to the point I’m surprised people even liked it at the time. Like it’s kinda sad to me the most fun I had with Jordan Mechner’s older games in this collection was his blatant ripoff of Asteroids he made in high school. Similar to my thoughts on Night Dive’s remaster of Rise of the Triad this year, I feel Digital Eclipse gave a gold star treatment polishing to a turd, an influential one, but a turd nonetheless. Digital Eclipse also did their own remasters of Karateka and Death Bounce, they’re more playable but they still don’t really salvage the games at all to me. The Karateka remaster does add the option of giving yourselves extra lives and it does play a little better but it adds the leopard that got the cut from the original game and that section is just awful. The Death Bounce remaster is okay, though I feel the Rover is just kind of bullshit, though arcade space shooters ain’t really my forte.\n\nOverall Making of Karateka is a wonderful documentary and preservation package for a game that has unfortunately not stood the test of time at all. Regardless if you have any interest in video game history I whole-heartedly recommend it. Definitely looking forward to Digital Eclipse possibly making this an entire series and cover games that were influential and actually good, like Doom or Monkey Island. Man, I want a Doom one so bad…",
      "This game will seem frustrating for probably 99% of new players, but after putting the time in, it's proven itself to be the most exciting game I've ever played. The creativity you get to test is on levels way above any other competitive game and for this it feels like every game is unique, unlike in other games (that I have also put many hours into), in which it feels like games can get repetitive and sometimes boring. Don't get me wrong, the game has it's flaws, and it can sometimes feel like you've lost games due to unprecedented levels of luck for your opponents, but no game is perfect and often it's unnoticed when the luck swings your way. \n\nAfter going to #Landon and experiencing the atmosphere in a stadium with thousands of people, watching the greatest pro games I think many of us players will ever see, I think it's safe to say that my love for this game will never truly die.",

      "Please, bare with me here...I NEVER write reviews for anything (this is probably the third review I have ever written), but I feel like I need to write this one for so many reasons!!!  I grew up playing the Telltale/Lucas Arts Series: Monkey Island. After discovering and playing those, I figured out that I have an infinite amount of love for Point and Click adventure games. After finishing that series, I really only played the other games made by either Lucas Arts or Telltale (Mostly because I thought they were the only creators of Point and Click games...until about a year ago, when I discovered there's an entire genre/world of Point and Click).  Of course, I must also note: The Curse of Monkey Island will always be my fav, as it was the first Point and Click I ever played. Ok...NOW...with all of that being said, I recently discovered WADJET EYE GAMES and I am SO happy I did. I would recommend EVERY.SINGLE,GAME they sell. I have played all of their MAC/iOS compatible Point and Clicks, and I have yet to be (even slightly) disappointed. I had very high expectations going in as the Monkey Island games, Day of the Tentacle, Full Throttle, Grim Fandago, etc. are some of the best games in the history of Point and Click; however, all of the games I have played from Wadjet Eye have been amazing. They have actually been so amazing that I can 100% say Wadjet Eye is at the top of my list, right there with the Telltale/Lucas Arts games. I 100% recommend purchasing and playing every game made by Wadjet Eye to anyone who likes (even those who kinda sorta like) Point and Click games.",

      "Bioshock Infinite is the third and (presumably) final game in the venerable Bioshock series of narrative driven FPS action games.  Gameplay, as always, consists of somewhat linear FPS combat with a \"genetic\" progression advancement system that lets you upgrade your abilities through \"splicing\" \"plasmids\".  This gives you somewhat supernatural abilities to augment the more traditional shooting of enemies with guns that we all enjoy from FPS games.  There's also the usual gamut of minigames, with a carnival theme to them. \n\nFrom the technical perspective, even though this is getting a little old, it's a AAA game and it shows.  Everything gamers expect is delivered here in terms of visual tweaks, control customisation, 4K support and a lot of graphics fine tuning options to allow gamers to experience a perfectly optimised experience.  There's not much else to say when developers get it right!  The visuals are equally top notch. \n\nWhile a great technical implementation is a must, and a minimum requirement for a recommendable game, of course Bioshock Infinite goes beyond that to deliver a masterpiece story that will leave gamers hooked, and perhaps a little bereft once it's over, but that's how all great stories should be.\n\nBioshock Infinite is a must-play for fans of narrative FPS games, although I do recommend trying Bioshock 1 & 2 first.  It's not required, but just like you wouldn't enjoy it as much if you watched Return of the Jedi first, you should try the first two episodes of Bioshock before the third one.",

      "Update 09/10/16\nSo they have added 'last man standing' mode which is great. The only issue is now that the controls are too difficult. If they fix this issue it would be a really fun party game and worth porting to consoles.\n\nPros:\n-Good visuals\n-Fun power ups\n-Awesome 4 player local play\n-In general the game is very fun and I believe with a few tweaks the game would be great. If they had done an early access build it would probably have been a great game on full release but there are still a few things that I and the people I played with don't like.\n\nCons:\nNOW FIXED (THEY ADDED LAST MAN STANDING' MODE) -Scoring system *the scoring system is based on how many you kill, we all thought the game would be better if you had lives instead and had to stay alive, when we played this game it was a case of constant kamakaze and not caring because it doesn't matter if you die* REPEAT THIS HAS BEEN FIXED\n-Controls *this type of game obviously can't be played with keyboard and mouse so this is only reviewed using Xbox 360 controller and it still isn't perfect, none of us felt that  had full control of the vehicle*\n\nVerdict:\nFor now I will give it a thumbs up as if they allow you to select scoring system based on kills or based on deaths we would play this a lot. And I think they could easily improve the controls. I hope the devs don't just leave this game to rot as it is a great idea for a local co-op game",
      "When I say this game changed the way I thought about life, I mean it. And before you say this game isn't worth 44 dollars, you are wrong. I would pay more than double just for this once in a lifetime experience.\n\nWhile this game may look like a stupid bishoujo romance game, it is so much more. Don't let the weird artstyle or obnoxious eyes fool you, this game will make you laugh. cry, depressed, happy, and everything in between. It is so extensive, so great, that there are over 13 character routes and stories to play in this game, all of which are good (some are incredible) and have some of the best, most fleshed our characters I have seen. This game is about life, change, friends, love, and most importantly, family. Every route in this game has a connection to family. (Clannad is a close-enough translation of family in Irish)\n\nIn case it helps, I'm a grown man who had a rather negative outlook on life, and this game me cry buckets. If you ever have thought about getting married and having kids, this game will MAKE you want to have a family. The clever writing and how the protagonist, Okazaki, changes throughout his life is all done so well. It made me realize how much we complain about our lives, but we don't need much to be happy or be motivated. In case it helps again, my mom loves this game, she connects with it quite a bit. Yet again, nothing bad to say here, only to say that Key is incredible and I will be reading some of their other works like Little Busters and Kanon.",
      "Absolutely the second best (half-life Alyx is the best game) VR game I have played in the last 5+ years.  Both RM1 and RM2 are fantastic, superb graphics, excellent story and game play.  I took my time and explored and the game time ended up just over 13 hours.  But the big diff is this game was developed by a very small non-AAA team while Half life Alyx was created with a large AAA dev team with unlimited budget.  The quality/game play of recently released VR games has been exceptionally poor and very disappointing to say the least.  But NOT THIS GAME, RED MATTER 2 excels in every area and is simply a great game that will keep you playing.     \n\nI played using Vive Pro 1 wireless with vive wands and had no issues with controllers or my HMD.

      "I'll lay it out. If you're really interested in the hacking mechanic, that might be sufficient reason to play this game. Otherwise, I'd be inclined to give it a miss.\n\nFrom a gameplay perspective, there's not really much to hook a new player. There's a long period at the start where you're expected to randomly interact with people, but given no reason why you should do so. The whole socializing and partying thing isn't intuitive unless you're a person who'd normally be into that, and there's little in the game that pushes you in that direction. As a result, progressing as far as the story actually starting is often the result of accident at best. It took me 4 hours of just wandering around, not knowing what I was supposed to be doing or why.\n\nOnce you're able to program there's a bit more direction and less frustration, but you're still not given much reason for doing it until later on.\n\nAll in all, stick around if you're really invested in getting to the programming. Otherwise, it's an exercise in frustration and shallow conversations that's not really a lot of fun.\n\nArt's gorgeous though, so the game has that going for it at least.",

      "I purposefully went into this game looking for bugs, seeing that it was in early access, and I have yet to find any. The only reason I stopped playing was because there was a fence that wasn't fully secured to the ground that I was able to get underneath, allowing me to get out of bounds. This lead to me falling into an area where I couldn't get out, and it wouldn't let me respawn at my most recent checkpoint. This would mean I'd have to start from the beginning, which I very much didn't want to do. Anyway, the biggest tips I can give to the developers is to make sure the map is 100% how they want it, and to make the audio design better. That's it. I may come back and change my review in the future.\n\nFINAL RATING: 4 / 10",
      "Do you kinda like 4X games, but mostly the first 2-3 hours of the game where you're exploring and hacking a basic civilization out of the wilderness and desperately fending off natural threats while trying to keep people fed and productive? If so, this game is for you. Nice tight gameplay loop where things never get stagnant for too long; always novel threats and opportunities, and you're not tied to any one settlement for very long, so victory and defeat alike are more temporary. Not to mention a really astounding amount of fun, polished content for an early access game! Eremite, Hooded Horse, I salute you.",
      "[h1] Indie Mario Maker [/h1]\n\nLevelhead is a 2D platformer that's heavily focused on building, sharing, and playing user levels. For those of us that don't own a Nintendo Switch, this game is a fine replacement for the Mario Maker games, and might even be better? \n\n\n[h1] CHARACTER [/h1]\n\nThe controls feel pretty tight and fluid. There are a ton of powerups that you can use, and each of them serves a different purpose. Compared to mario powerups, there's some unique ones here. One powerup lets you wall jump, but also lets you sneak by enemies. Another has a jetpack and propellers. Levelhead allows for some decent precision and very rarely did I feel it was my character's fault when I died. \n\n\n[h1] CAMPAIGN [/h1]\n\nThe first main goal when you boot up Levelhead is to go through the extensive campaign. It's sort of a tutorial, but at the same time is fleshed out and takes a pretty decent amount of time to beat and has some challenge to it. From what I have played of the campaign, levels are fun and well designed. Now, I have played very little of the campaign, it's not what I purchased this game for. I asked a friend for a 100% save file so I could skip the campaign and go right to creating levels. Why did I do this? because of Levelhead's biggest problem: the unlock system. To unlock things to create levels with, you have to beat the campaign and find secrets. So basically they gated off Levelhead's largest appeal, the level editor, behind a campaign that's several hours long and requires you to do some secret hunting. I understand they did this for tutorial reasons, but it still annoys me. \n\n\n[h1] LEVEL EDITOR [/h1]\n\nOnce you finally get your hands on the level editor, you'll quickly notice how accessible and easy to use it is. The UI has nice big and understandable buttons. Almost everything is as simple as pressing left click on what you want and where. Even more complicated things such as a timer or a switch connected to a door are made very simple and understandable. It has to be the best level editor I've ever used, purely for the simplicity of it. \n\n\n[h1] SECOND GOAL [/h1]\n\nThe second primary goal of Levelhead is to create levels and have them become apart of The Tower. The tower is where all the good levels go, and you can sort levels there by difficulty, release date, tags, etc. First you have to get through the Marketing Depertment. To do this, you need Exposure Bux, which is a currency you earn while playing marketing department levels. It's a neat system that works pretty well and encourages you to play other people's levels. \n\n\n[h1] MINOR ISSUES [/h1]\n\nI wish you could name levels without using preset words. I understand why they did this (their target audience is young), but at times I have a genius level name and am unable to use it. Another issue is more of a community-based issue. A lot of the levels in the marketing department are garbage (including my own levels probably). It's kind of rough to sift through the mess to find great works. I also wish you could filter levels in the marketing department the same way you can in the tower. The Rumpus system for friending others is frustrating and borderline useless. People can't search others by name, but rather by a randomly generated code. All of these issues are pretty minor and don't effect the game enough to bother me too much.\n\n\n[h1] CONCLUSION [/h1]\n\nLevelhead is absolutely worth owning, especially for those without a Switch. It's polished in nearly every way, and is just very fun to play. The price point is pretty high though, so possibly wait for a sale unless you think you desperately need to play this. Fully recommended!\n\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/34946548/] Check out my curator! [/url]",
      "Yes and No.\n\nSo many mixed feelings about this game. It does a lot of unexpected things and gamifies some deep and haunting concepts within the human psyche( the game centers around a POWERFUL subject, very hard to discuss without spoiling the game), sports combat that's tough but honestly very satisfying at times through the use of unorthodox party members and antagonists, but the rpg economy, pacing, and sheer grinding within tends to rob a lot of scenes of their emotional impact. I had a lot of fun with Jimmy, but honestly speaking I don't know if I could recommend this game to anyone who isn't used to a big jrpg-length commitment.\n\nIt's not so much that I hated the grinding, but it's that you're presented with symbolically themed enemies (not crazy about a lot of the in-battle art, some of it is phenomenal but a lot of it feels half baked which is something Kasey O has discussed in interviews but this is besides the point) Enemies an make you think and elicit actual emotions...\n\n...but then you have to stare at them for hours as you grind to be able to even last a few turns against each new boss. I found myself resorting to [spoiler]Clean Getaway[/spoiler] a lot throughout the game just to get to the other side of a room in a manageable timeframe. The symbolism loses its impact very quickly, and the momentum of the story is constantly slamming on the brakes to make you grind, and to me, it just dulls the sharp edges off of a lot of otherwise deeply impactful moments. It robs itself.\n\nIt'll present you with something powerful, but then it'll do that 30 more times before the end of a dungeon and it can become a bit tiring, like someone telling you the same knock-knock joke over and over.\n\n[spoiler]Shinryu[/spoiler] and certain aspects of [spoiler]The Pulsating Central Hub[/spoiler] are definitely some of the more outstanding examples.\n\nalso [spoiler]Heart Prison[/spoiler] is a ridiculous ask of a player. You finish the game and can wipe out any leftover superbosses at around Lv.60, and the [spoiler]family battle[/spoiler] requires Lv.90+. I'm not going to sit down and literally grind for 30 levels for the only battle left that I could watch on YouTube in 3 minutes.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I really loved this game, it brought me to tears at points. SO much work was clearly put into this and I'm scouring the rest of Kasey's work right now to get more of this excellent writing, I but I feel like Jimmy just barely misses the mark when viewed as a whole package. Any RPGmaker/Earthboundlike fans are sure to enjoy, and I can't stop thinking about the story, but as a gaming experience, I'd hesitate a little to recommend it.",

      "Alpha, Beta, Finished Product... I hear lots of Blah blah blahs complaining about this game not being out of Alpha after years and years, but it isn't like we've been paying a monthly fee for it.  I paid one time to support this game and I've got years of play out of a product that I enjoy.  There aren't too many games that scratch an itch like this game for me... Open World, completely editable/buildable environment and zombies!  One of my biggest issues with a game that I like is that after I buy it, they release a few DLCs and then move on to their next product.  Alpha, Beta, Finished or Not... the developers have given me years of standing by their product and many updates with new content and mechanics.  For that alone, I love their game!\n\nGraphics: 3 outta 5 graphics, she looks a little dated but they keep updating it... It looks better than it originally did.  There's growth\nReplayability: 5 outta 5\nGameplay:3 outta 5... sometimes she's a little clunky\n\nI definitely still believe that this game is worth buying and that they devs and their product is worth supporting.  Hopefully this is helpful to someone.",
      "Fun JRPG with some action commands thrown in, good variety of enemies, and a pretty decent skill development tree.\n\nEnemies can feel pretty tough later in the game, but its more of a puzzle when trying to complete these fights so it doesn't feel cheap.\n\nGreat soundtrack too.\n\nRuns great on Steamdeck",
      "ironic that the best sonic game was the one not made by sonic team",
      "i would recomend it because the physics are great, the game has 8 or 9 level packs (i dont know if there will be a 9th because there are 7 at the time of this review) the units are diverse, there are a lot of secret units to find and i dont know for the final boss because the most expensive unit artimis isnt a good final boss like the dark pesant in the alphas but i hope that the games final boss unit is actually hard to kill and requires more than 7 archers because that wasnt hard or anything hopefully they will make the most expensive unit actually overpowered and unballanced because that would be a great final boss, the sandbox mode is great i like the custom campains , the custom units arent out yet so i cant say anything about that over all this game is worth the money and if its near a sale time like a few days away from a sale then get it on sale if not then just get it you wont regret it and if it lage turn off all the graphics settings",
      "Would be nice to get a definitive upgrade rather than paying full price for dragon quest xi definitive version",
      "This game will seem frustrating for probably 99% of new players, but after putting the time in, it's proven itself to be the most exciting game I've ever played. The creativity you get to test is on levels way above any other competitive game and for this it feels like every game is unique, unlike in other games (that I have also put many hours into), in which it feels like games can get repetitive and sometimes boring. Don't get me wrong, the game has it's flaws, and it can sometimes feel like you've lost games due to unprecedented levels of luck for your opponents, but no game is perfect and often it's unnoticed when the luck swings your way. \n\nAfter going to #Landon and experiencing the atmosphere in a stadium with thousands of people, watching the greatest pro games I think many of us players will ever see, I think it's safe to say that my love for this game will never truly die.",
      "I had seen this in the steam store and wanted it. I put it on my wish list and a friend got it for me. I have to say from start until now it's amazing and keeps me busy. I do take breaks from it from time to time. However the game keeps growing and always something neat to come back to. I was amazed to that right off the bat the game was made well, and wasn't like 20 patches later and it was good to go. It was a few little hot-fixes but it was already good from start in. I am super glad that I got this game from my friend. \n\nupside\n- Was well made from the start \n- developers are still working with the game and adding in new content when they can\n- Game you can play for hours if you are willing \n- Good strategy game \n\nsmall down sides \n-Not a city builder to me , so like not like sim city etc... more like a strategy game that involves having a small town ^^\n- Does take a bit to learn all the little mechanics but once you do , you are good to go \n-Still early access so from time to time you lose saves as they add content",
      "Where to start.... in short entire game is boring and very slow paced for no aparent reason.\n\nAI: AI performs only very basic functions and does not upgrade buildings and does the opposite of whats beneficial for your empire. AI does not do very well when engaging in displomacy.\n\nUI: You will spend most of your time trying to manage/hover around very CLUMSY and absolutely disgusting UI. Other 4x games offer far superior UI and make is easier to manage your asset on the field e.g. Sword of the stars II, Star Ruler 2, Distant world, Endless Legends, Endless Space etc.\n\nGFX: Graphics are not the top notch what you would expect from a modern 4x game but they are on far with Endless Legends. GFX leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nAlien Races: I dont need to say much but like Planets most of the races are COPY / PASTE. Nothing unique or special about each. \n\nMP: Multiplayer has a mind of its own and in most cases wont let you join public games unless its a private game.\n\nStellaris bring nothing new to 4x Genre in 2016!.\n Right now everyone is almost beta testing for the developers so we can find bugs, report them  and help them fix their game. Why not let players do beta before before release? But then there is  a question of sale and refund. \n\nBut overall this game does offer amazing soundtrack.",

      "Know your History: \n\nMany of you will already know this, but this game has ties much deeper than you think. It's no secret that Bethesda's Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim had extended it's life through an extensive modding community. For decades, literally, ENBs, shaders, textures, companions, and even story-lines added THOUSANDS of hours to an already sizable game. One story-line mod was called \"The Forgotten City\".  Over the next few years since it's release, the mod had acquired awards such as the 2016 Australian Writers' Guild Award, Zero Period Top 5 Quest Mods of 2015, and others. It was an astounding mod that threw the dragon born into a deeply profound, well written, and engaging story. It was a staple for my personal mod list for years. I've played the Skyrim version countless times, but as soon as I saw this release I immediately bought this and booted it up. \nObviously this is nothing like the mod, both visually or engine wise, but the spirit of the game is still there. It's more defined, expanded, and developed. It deserves every award and accolade it's received. When I walked into the opening scene and fell down the tunnel I couldn't help but shake my head and smile as a wave of nostalgia mixed with new expectations flooded my mind:\n\n\"My god, they've done it.\" \n\nHere's to you, Modern Storyteller, all the best and more to come!",
      "I have played enough of this game to say that I really, really love it.\n\nI have played every Assassin's Creed game, even the ones on the DS and the mediocre PSP game. This is by far the best Assassin's Creed.\n\nFirst of all, the naval combat is intuitive and really fluid and satisfying. The combat is the same \"Press B to counter\", but the addition of guns and darts do make things more interesting.\n\nWhile most of the time you are at sea \"pirating\", the sections on land are also really good. While the tailing and eavesdropping sessions are frustrating at times and boring at others, the free running is more fluid than ever, with realistic animations and few obstacles that can stop you.\n\nThe story is interesting and does encourage you to play all the main missions. However, there is a huge variety of side missions that can be played as soon as you get your ship to sail the enormous maps, where many ships sail and where whales swim.\n\nI have not played a lot of the multiplayer because I don't find it that interesting and varied.\n\nOverall, this is the best AC game so far: improved gameplay, lenghty and fun, it only makes me more pumped for Assassin's Creed Unity.\n\nSCORE: 90/100",
      "Dave the Diver is a charming little 'Indie'* that still surprises you with new mechanics even hours in. The various activity cutscenes are pretty funny as well.\n\nJust a word of warning though. Mintrocket is NOT a indie studio, it's a subsidiary of NEXON, so DtD is entirely a NEXON game, and with how their reputation is it's pretty understandable to not buy this game just because of that.",
      "EDIT: they made putting easier!  I can finally shoot even and below on the first few courses.  Ignore my complaints about impossible putting below.  I'm back playing this again and enjoying it much more since the putting changes.\n\nI have a love/hate relationship with this game.  It's the closest thing to an enjoyable disc golf game on the PC that I've ever seen, and on that basis I recommend it.  Unlike most sports games, where I can play better on the computer than I can in real life, in this game that's not the case.  After six miserable hours of failure in this game I can safely promise you that I'm wildly better at real life disc golf than I ever will be with this game.\n\nPositives:\n\n- Discs mostly work the way they should (assuming you understand from IRL play how a particular disc should  behave depending on speed and throwing angle) though I feel like flight paths when you're throwing up or down in elevation are off sometimes, but if you throw a fast understable disc at too low a speed it will tail off into the left immediately and when you want to crank up and hyzer bomb the same disc at high speed it gives you the long S you expect and so forth\n- No bugs really (a couple of times the character model went wonky when a disc landed on/next to a rock wall)\n- Graphics are fine by me\n\nCons (possibly only for me, you may not suck at this):\n\n- The entire game is based on a \"stop the tick mark on a spot as it circles a ring\" type swing meter, and I'm absolute trash at it\n- Feels like no progress, other than buying discs--I've upgraded the three skill meters a lot and it has never felt like game play changed much (lol, it certainly hasn't gotten any easier!)\n- Putting is im-fucking-possible, at least for me, it's way too hard--putts that would be gimmes for a novice in real life are a crapshoot, especially if there's any elevation difference\n- After six hours I have only unlocked the first course and half of the second course . . . I may try to go back to this at some point, but for now I've given up on this sucker which is a shame--there are a bunch of other courses that I will never see (my fault, to be sure--I'm terrible at that stupid swing meter)\n\nI haven't played any better options, so while I'm probably giving up at six hours in I'd still recommend it to anyone who's into disc golf.  It's clearly too hard for me, but assuming you're not a complete klutz you will probably have better luck with it.",
      "There is no skill requirement to play this game; everything seems pretty randomized including when and where the demon attacks you. Its rather difficult to play alone or just with two players. So if your looking for a game to play alone for a fright or just with one other buddy of yours. Make sure your ready to lose, This game has a great concept I just hope it will get more refined with the attacks. It seems like you get killed before you can even attempt to complete the objective.",
      "Ni no kuni II: Revenant Kingdom is a great RPG that, while a little dissapointing in some aspects, makes up for it with it's positives.\n\nLet's start talking about the negatives: \n\n- the characters are a little bland, most of them barely get anything added to their backstories nor are there any specific sidequests for them (yet). They're not bad, and Evan/Roland are good characters, but the rest falls a bit short.\n\n- The soundtrack is a little forgetable, even if it does have a few good gems in there\n\nNow the \"neutral\" points:\n\n- The main gameplay is simple, with only a few attack buttons and barely any combos, so if you're looking for a deep combat you're going to be a little dissapointed.\n\n- The story is simple; i personally enjoy it and how it ends but i could see someone who's looking for some deep story to be left unsatisfied.\n\nNow for the good aspects:\n\n- The graphics are beautiful, it's basically a playable Ghibli Studio movie\n- The gameplay (both combat and army based) is fun, fast and rewarding to do, especially when you unlock more spells\n- The kingdom management is simple to do and it gives you a sense of pride and accomplishment (unlike EA) when you expand it with new building and bigger borders\n- The sidequests are for the most time fun with cool citizens to meet and recruit\n- The random dungeons are cool to explore\n\nI played 85 hours of this game and i enjoyed every second. If you're a fan of Action RPG with a touch of base management and \"tactical\" combat you're certainly enjoy this beauty of a game.",
      "I hated Undertale.\n\nIt was, pretty clearly, a game about sexy skeletons. I did not care about sexy skeletons. I refused to play a game about sexy skeletons.\n\nThen my friend made me listen to the soundtrack, and I decided I could deal with a few hours of sexy skeletons if I got to listen to the best video game music I had ever heard while doing it. \n\nI played Undertale. It's not a game about sexy skeletons. It's a game about choices, maybe, or morality, or curiosity. It's a game about pushing the limits. It's a game about experiences, about \"what would happen if I did this?\", about storytelling so intricate and complex and raw that it shouldn't be able to fit into seven hours of bullet hell and pixel graphics. But, somehow, it does. Every choice you make has an impact. Every object you check has a story. The soundtrack, the witty yet profound writing, the simple pixel graphics, and even the menu screens and bullet patterns themselves all intertwine in order to tell a story that only you decide the ending of.\n\nAlso, the skeletons aren't even sexy.\n\nMy advice to you: Go in as blind as you can. Don't read walkthroughs. Don't watch playthroughs. Don't prepare yourself. Don't even look at overviews. Hell, don't even read the Steam page description. Just buy the game (and give some well-earned money to a little white dog), and, as it were, climb the mountain yourself. Don't let anyone backseat. Don't listen to people who tell you there's a right way to play.\n\nAnd when you think you've reached the end, just think--what other choices could you have made?\n\nSo, yes. I hated Undertale.\n\nAnd then I played it.",

It felt like maps are only 50% related to the song and you have to ignore what you hear because the map randomly demands patterns that have no matching audio equivalent and everything becomes pure visual memorization.",

      "Just finished it. Having trouble putting words together.\n\nI went on a road trip around the US last year, and on my way down the west coast was surprised by how many giant factories passed by, puffing smoke into the air. One even had Google reviews, where it became clear that the town residents who worked there posted good reviews, and everyone else wanted the factory gone.\n\nThose did not compare to the oil refineries in Louisiana, one of which I had to pull off of the highway to properly behold. Certainly I'd seen images of them, but in real life their scale is hard to believe. And they're so bright, both because of innumerable light bulbs and the infamous refinery flame spouts. Even going through the pictures I took while worried the refinery security was going to attack, the size of these things accurately portrayed in none of them. I'd already played the NORCO demo by this point, and had it in my mind throughout my time in the area. There was even an encounter with an old man working at a convenience store somewhere around 1-2am who asked me if I believed in God with a crazed look in his eye, something I would not know was reality foreshadowing this game until the past week.\n\nSo my impression here, forming as I type this, is as follows: \n\nThe surreal imagery and sublime writing in NORCO combine to seem more accurate to my brief experience in the places resembling the real life Norco than any photo or video I've seen.\n\nA lot more can be said about this game, but I'm currently trying to untie my thoughts.

      "SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT.\n\nAs the store page states, NOREN is supposedly a 'simple' keyfinding game. That would be true if there were any keys actually in the game, but as it stands it seems that NOREN is a simple abandoned shovelware game that's impossible to progress in, let alone beat. You play as some soldier in a massive, dark castle, equipped only with a dying lantern. The light fades quickly, and you can regain light slowly by... standing by a light source. That'd be simple enough if you weren't endlessly pursued by dinosaurs that are programmed with AI which knows your exact location at all times; three chomps and you're 'aparted' from the world, where you respawn with whatever amount of light and sanity you have left. Additionally, the translation attempt is abysmal at best. \n\nBoth NOREN and its developer, ThroneLab, should be banned from Steam. I do not blow the 'scam' whistle lightly, and I only do such when I am 100% certain of something actually being a scam. There are a handful of videos of this title on YouTube as well, with only one being over 5 minutes long. No one found a key.

      "Developers should be proud of themselves for this awful game.\nAfter a 3 hour session with a friend, my legs are stiff, my heart is confused with constant beating and my brain is extremely satisfied and wants more.\n\nIf you like being scared and the horror genre, just find a like-minded friend and play it. Even when you are simply running in and out, it's going be a lot of fun. I have no idea how one would play a medium map but maybe with 4 people one might have the courage to walk inside that cursed high school more than we did - which was 2 meters into the entrance.

I've played at least a couple of rounds every single day and I still love the game.\n\nMy suggestion is to find a friend who'd enjoy this, get the game both and play. DON'T READ ABOUT IT! Just play for a while, enjoy screwing up, getting spooked, killed, whatever happens! The more you learn about the mechanics, the more you lose the fear, so don't read about it!\nI mean I'm still a coward at level 60 something but that's me. Of course if you are like me, then why are you reading this and not buying the game?\n\nFinal word: Check their discord to find like-minded people in the LFG! You won't be alone, I promise!",
      "It's hard to recommend Spelunky 2. Not because it is a bad game, but because it can be frustrating. As with most roguelikes, dying means going back to the beginning. In Spelunky however, nothing carries over to future runs. All you get to bring in to your next run is your own experience and knowledge; And when half the things in the game kill you instantly or stunlock you to death, having a great run end in a quick death can be damaging to one's will.\n\nThankfully, your own experiences count a great deal towards your progress. Most hazards and enemies in Spelunky 2 have a very simple and predictable behaviour. But keeping track of everything on the screen is still a challenge. Enemies and traps will also work together (or against each other) and still bring your demise somehow. Either by bumping your helplessly stunned body into other enemies and traps, or enemies having their own flaming corpse launched towards you and your flammable jetpack. It's actually quite funny sometimes. A good deal of entertainment can be had recording your own amazingly nonsensical deaths.\n\nSpelunky 2 improves upon Spelunky HD's gameplay by adding split paths, which allow for more variety and decision-making in your runs while staying true to the feeling and style of previous entries. It also adds a back layer to each level, allowing for more secrets to be kept. After successfully completing your first run, you can try to discover these secrets and find hidden bosses and areas and even different endings!\n\nAnyway, you might enjoy the game if you're a masochist or something.",

      "After the past few years of broken, buggy AAA games I've started to lose the passion I once had for the industry. This masterpiece came out of no where and completely reignited my love for gaming. PLEASE do not sleep on this game, it's such a breath of fresh air from the garbage you'd normally expect from modern day companies. Definitely taking a spot in my top 5 favorites and I haven't even scratched the surface of the game yet, it's just that good. Beautiful art style, crisp animations, a unique concept, FUN gameplay, its everything I've been wanting and more. Kudos to the devs for making this absolute banger <3",
      "This is the fighting game that you give to a friend who doesn't play fighting games to learn, the Steam Edition of Killer Instinct comes with all of the characters as well as the extra premium skins that were added into the game. Killer Instinct has arguably one of the best tutorial systems that I have played with in recent years, if not one of the best period. It allows you to learn at a reasonable pace each and every one of the specific features of the game, including assists so that people are able to learn what combo breaker they need to use versus specific attacks. Combo Assist in this is less a crutch or a hand hold mechanic and more of a guide when it comes to using combos, it will automatically add in linkers to combos so that people who are unfamiliar with the game aren't left mashing buttons and making a fool of themselves because they don't know what they are doing, it will free flow the fight as best as it can to help guide people toward what they need to be doing, showing off what specials people could be doing to link the combo together and maximize the amount of damage they could possibly get, and due to the combo meter it stops people from being locked into combos forever since once a combo ends you are forced away, either by the opponent's combo ender or the combo forcing itself closed.\n\nThe price that they ask for on Steam you will get more out of the game than you could expect from something this priced. There are two story modes specific to the first two seasons of characters that came out, then with Season 3, which brought back the two original bosses from the franchise, Shadow Lords, a seperate scenario style campaign in which you pick the team that you wish to take in your attempt to overthrow the Shadow Lord himself. That's without taking into account the Shadow Lab mode which allows you to train a Shadow of yourself, an AI that learns and builds off your own patterns to fight in a similar manner to yourself, these Shadows are used within its own unique survival mode, as well as special missions that can crop up within the Shadow Lord mode.\n\nIf you're after a fighting game to get into, or you're looking to get a friend into fighting games, this is the best one that you could possibly start with, since it will not only teach the specific mechanics to this one, but also allow you to learn in time a lot of the mechanics that other competitive fighters share, though this one, eases you into it, so that it is a less daunting experience, as well as being much friendlier to new players.",

      "[h1]First of all, NISA... the elephant in the room needs addressing.[/h1]\nIf you're going to use D3D11 and try to do stuff multi-threaded, use a 64-bit executable.\n\nMemory allocation and thread pooling work much better in a 64-bit environment. 32-bit doesn't really expand your market share any but causes several compatibility headaches (including memory fragmentation in your resource manager). Please, NISA, stop fooling around with legacy APIs (i.e. WinMM for gamepad input and OpenGL 1.x as you did in Disgaea) and outdated ABIs.  D3D11 / 64-Bit should be the target environment for software longevity.\n\nI get the impression you believe that OLDER means more compatible, but you've got the whole PC development paradigm upside down. Old stuff is simply old, period.\n\nI would encourage you to review the guidelines for authoring Windows Store software, Microsoft's policies for Windows Store are designed to reduce legacy software maintenance problems. You need not follow them, but they will give you a pretty good idea of the APIs and ABIs that are relevant / native / not running through compatibility layer redtape. Do this and I believe you will find PC development much less troublesome.\n\n\n\n\n[list][i]With that out  of the way, I would like to point out that NISA patches their games more than any developer I have ever seen.[/i][/list]\n\n\nI personally believe this game is best suited for the Nintendo Switch, but PC will have a stable version by the time the Switch version ships. I have already authored a number of fixes for texture aliasing that guarantee image quality-wise, the PC version is where you would expect it to be. We just need NISA to polish the rest of the stuff :)\n\nTake early reviews with a grain of salt because NISA's going to be busy patching this game for months if Disgaea is any indication. Price complaints are probably the only aspect of current reviews that will remain valid. I tend to agree, the asking price is not what it should be for a game that's not exactly finished.\n\n\n\n[h1]I am leaving a positive review because I have faith NISA will stick with it, but ...[/h1]\n\n[list][list]You shouldn't rush to buy this game by any means.

      "It's horrible. It's annoying to play, it freaks you out, it insults you relentlessly. Yeah, of course I'm recommending it, why do you ask?\n\nWill You Snail is what it says it is. A platformer with traps popping on your predicted path with some meta plot and an evil AI commenting on your actions, mostly with clever insults. But it's also a little more than that, mainly due to the quality of its elements - so the game becomes more than the sum of its parts.\n\nYou're probably wondering about the difficulty. Well, good news: there are four settings, and by default they change depending on your performance. You struggle with the level too much? It's lowered. You beat it on the first few tries? It goes up. All with a (not) nice comment from Squid, the antagonist. I personally found the design annoying rather than actually challenging, but I'm quite sure that's intentional. The game's got it all: conveyor belts (that randomly change direction), underwater currents, perfectly timed spikes falling on your head, blocks that cave in on you after you break them. PhD in twatologist design. Due to the ever-shifting nature of the levels, I wouldn't even call this game a precision platformer - it's not about learning the level, but about adaptation. Luckily, the platforming segments are only one part of the game and there's some downtime between them, with optional (but fun) puzzles.\n\nOh, and for reference: I played mostly on difficulty 3 out of 4, sometimes dropping to 2 and rose to 4 towards the end. I found it roughly as difficult as Ori and the Blind Forest's latter sections, harder than Celeste ignoring strawberries, and easier than Garlic.\n\nLet's talk about Squid, the antagonist. The misanthropic, fatalistic, super-intelligent AI trope is pretty old at this point - but Squid is a very good refinement of that trope. It feels like he's really insulting you - the player - not the player character, like GLaDOS did. Mainly because he really reacts to the exact things that you do. You died just before the end? He'll point that out. You keep dying in one spot? He'll let you have it. You died to a spike? Comments about hitting your head incoming. Ran into a bomb? He'll tell you not to collect them. And so on. There so many lines, I never, ever, not once ran into a duplicate. That really makes him feel like a living, breathing person, not an NPC. I mean, he's not living and breathing... you know what I mean.\n\nOn that topic: if you've watched the trailer, you've probably noticed that Squid speaks with a non-native accent. That's because he's voiced by the dev, who's German; and indeed the general writing has this sardonic, matter-of-fact yet earnest quality that will be familiar to you if you know the German style of communication. No, no angry screaming, that's not how Germans talk. Stop watching WW2 speeches and watch some Staplerfahrer Klaus instead.\n\nAnd finally, there's the story. It's a bit meta, no surprises there. I won't write too much about it because I don't want to spoil it. Let's just say that it leaves many things out, but gives you just enough info to fill in the blanks. It's rather suspenseful; more importantly, it slowly builds up to... cosmic horror? Existential terror? Perhaps both. Also, it has a very clear message, delivered quite convincingly. Up to you to decide what to do with it.\n\nOverall, Will You Snail is pretty good. I don't think it's as flawless as many reviews make it out to be; the annoying design is still annoying in the end, even if it's thematically correct. Also, the music relies a little too much on the central leitmotif of the game, and it simply doesn't have the grace and variety to pull it off like Toby Fox did with UNDERTALE's soundtrack. Still; those little things aren't enough to wear down the emotional feast presented by this game. I'd say \"Guten appetit\" to this fine escargot meal, but in this case, we are the snails. Enjoy!\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42922988]Curator page[/url]",

      "The only marginally interesting or entertaining part of this game is it's history.\n\nJanuary 15, 2015: It's sold under the name of H1Z1. It was marketed as an open world zombie survival game, akin to DayZ. I bought it for 20$. The game does not run.\n\nAfter a time, they release a new gamemode; King of the Kill. It's a battle royale mode, made specifically because PLAYERUNKNOWN made a hugely successful battle royale mod for the game but then split off to make his own game (PUBG).\n\nFebruary 5, 2016: KOTK is doing well, so they split it off from the game, both of them costing 20$. They silently abandon the original game, only doing small feature updates and adding nothing but bugs. H1Z1 (The survival game.) is renamed to H1Z1 Just Survive.  KOTK is renamed H1Z1: King of the Kill. Not long after they rename H1Z1 Just Survive to simply Just Survive (Which sounds like a terrible 3$ app game.) and rename H1Z1 King of the Kill to just H1Z1. (H1Z1 Battle Royale on consoles.) Development of the original survival game, \"Just Survive\", is still mostly halted.\n\nOctober 24, 2018: Just Survive, the survival game i paid for, is shut down. The game is removed from my, and everyone else's steam library, with no refund. KOTK, or H1Z1, or H1Z1 Battle Royale...or...whatever the crap they named it, is shut down as well, and re-published and renamed as a different game, Z1 Battle Royale, obviously done to alienate the game from it's wretched history.\n\nThe kicker? It's free. Also, it's still called H1Z1 Battle Royale on consoles, and when Z1 BR is run, the window is named H1Z1. \n\nThey made a game said it was like DayZ. It didn't even work. Then they simply deleted it from my library with no refund. Z1 BR is dead, it garners about 3 active players. They actually, legitimately built a fake game and then deleted it for money.\n\nUtterly disgusting development team. When everyone said the original game was going down in flames due to terrible updates, horrible balancing fix attempts that only worsened the balance, and endless amounts of bugs spilling into the game, i sat there, with hope. This is what i got.\n\nThey said the original H1Z1 was originally going to be made free. I was fine, 20$ for instant beta access to a DayZ game was fine. What they didn't say is that it was a blatant lie and they would toss the game in the trash in favor of another random game they made using the original games assets (I told you. They're terrible. Too lazy to even make new assets.) simply because Fortnite was getting popular.\n\nAnd after all that?\n\nThe game sucks balls.\n\nDon't [strike]buy[/strike] download this game.",
      "It's an asset flip. I know that's a bit obvious, but just in case you were in doubt, there you go.\n\nFull of bugs, rushed, empty, poor sound/animation/ai/overall design quality, completely broken english, barely functioning UI, you get the picture, it's a cash grab.",
      "Upon further play, the game wasn't super luck based, it just doesn't do a great job explaining core mechanics that are crucial to gameplay. It has a more hands off, let the player discover how this works type of playstyle, but a simple line of dialogue alluding to these features would have been nice. That said, the story is really gripping, the gameplay (once learned) is fun, and overall, I definitely think it's worth $20.",
      "This is more than a game for me.  It has become a hobby.  What started as a random purchase for myself last Christmas -- I had an old electric guitar I never played in the closet, so this gave me an excuse to see if I can learn -- has become an expensive obsession for me.  Warning -- but a good warning -- you'll find that you're learning guitar very quickly on this game, and it will become the start of an expensive habit!  I have downloaded hundreds of dollars worth of songs, bought a brand new guitar, I've signed up for music theory and guitar lessons at the local county college ... this has become a genuine hobby for me.  Literally, it is one of those rare games which has genuinely made an impact on my life.  Six months later, and the game has not gotten old.  I look forward to new songs, I laugh when a new chord I've never seen magically appears on the song that I've practiced the hell out and achieved a new difficulty.  The game is, most importantly, fun.  It remains fresh and only gets better as you get better.  I highly recommend.",
      "As a historical novelist and former high school English teacher with over 700 books in my home devoted to ancient Greek literature, history and culture I had to try this game.\n\nI should mention that I am pushing 60 years old and although I like strategy games like Creative Assembly’s Rome II, I’m not a fan of ‘gopher’ games that make you run around collecting items, rescuing damsels in distress, delivering messages, and murdering politicians to level your character.  The whole premises seems rather tedious and unimaginative.  \n\nSo right from the start I expected to hate Assassin’s Creed Odyssey.  Combine that with the fact that I’d never played an Assassin’s Creed game before, and I am not the most nimble finger clicker, I was prepared to spend a good portion of my playing time getting my head lopped off.  \n\nNone of that happened.  Well, yeah, there is a pretty steep learning curve here.  I did spend a lot of my initial hours zigging when I should have been zagging, and with my opponent’s spear in my head, but I stuck with it and eventually even an old poop like me was able to figure out the mechanics.\n\nWhat kept me going was the sheer majesty of the game and the beauty of the surroundings.  \n\nI’ve been to Athens, Sparta, Argos, Mycenae, Delos, Aegina, Hydra, Crete, Melos (now Santorini), and dozens of other locales on the campaign map multiple times.  I’ve walked around the ruins at Delphi, strolled the docks of Piraeus and walked through valley of Laconia for research for my books.  I wanted to see these places at they might have looked 2,500 years ago and that for me is the true joy of Assassin’s Creed Odyssey.\n\nThe team at Ubisoft deserves a lot of credit.  They did their homework.  Sure, you’d expect to see historical figures like Pericles, Socrates, Alcibiades and Archidamas in a game about the Peloponnesian War.  But that anyone outside of academia even knows who Brasidas, Aspasia, Herodotus and Pausanias were, is impressive.  Kudos to you.\n\nI’m probably an oddball gamer because I was not motivated by stabbing people in the back to gain levels and steal loot.  The entire idea of stabbing people in the back goes against the grain of the Greek ethos of ‘kleos’ or honor.  What kept me going was the desire to see more of the world that Ubisoft created.  \n\nI wanted to visit the Athenian Acropolis and see the Propylaea, Erechtheion and Parthenon as they were shiny and new, instead of in piles of rubble.  I wanted to gaze up at Phidias' statue of Zeus in Olympus (one of the wonders of the ancient Greek world that no longer exists), speak to the Pythia at the temple of Delphi, and see the five villages of Sparta as they might have looked.  Getting to walk the streets of Athens, Argos and Elis was like taking a trip back in time.  Magical.\n\nOkay, the game isn’t perfect.  The pronunciation of common names like Pericles and Socrates and the character’s accents were maddening.  I can only guess that Ubisoft believes we’ve Americanized the real pronunciations, or at least I hope that’s what they were thinking.  Ultimately it’s a minor annoyance.\n\nThe hoplite battles were a major disappointment.  The Greeks fought in a phalanx formation.  Shoulder to shoulder.  Shield to shield.  The battles here are a 300 movie style free for all.  Oh well, guess you can’t have everything.  \n\nAlso I could not fathom how Alexios and Kassandra could be descended from Leonidas, but have no connection to the Agiad royal family.  By rights they should have been Pausanias’ cousins, but they’re not.  I don’t know who they are. The whole Pythagoras-is-my-father thing is rather bizarre and makes no sense at all.  \n\nI won’t go off the charts here listing the historical inaccuracies that drove me batsh!t crazy, as it serves no purpose.  Suffice it to say that I enjoyed the game.  \n\nIf you ever wanted to unravel the labyrinth of the minotaur beneath King Minos palace at Knossos, get drunk and sing songs with Socrates at an Athenian symposium, feel the Aegean Sea roll beneath your feet on the deck of a  trireme, or stare out in wonder at the lights twinkling over Attica at twilight, try this game.  You won’t be disappointed.",
      "Alpha, Beta, Finished Product... I hear lots of Blah blah blahs complaining about this game not being out of Alpha after years and years, but it isn't like we've been paying a monthly fee for it.  I paid one time to support this game and I've got years of play out of a product that I enjoy.  There aren't too many games that scratch an itch like this game for me... Open World, completely editable/buildable environment and zombies!  One of my biggest issues with a game that I like is that after I buy it, they release a few DLCs and then move on to their next product.

      "This does what I wish AAA RPGs with narratives would do; choices actually feel like they make an impact and the gameplay changes that reflect this are dynamic in nature and provide meaningful differences in the conversations.\n\nIt doesn't feel this way on a macro scale, the meaning is more in the individual encounters with some exceptions. To word it a little differently, I felt like my choices had very little impact on the story as a whole and I could easily (a little too easily) steer the final outcome at any time but, within individual interrogations, what I chose to do had a major affect on the immediate narrative.\n\nThat being said, it is a wonderful game to play for four to six hours on a Sunday and at $15 USD it is cheap and entertaining enough to only need a single playthrough to feel like you've gotten your money's worth. Although I haven't started my second playthrough, I'm already thinking about when I want to sit down and have another go.",

Some old RTS games looked similar to this title but required much less to run (I am referencing how the technology is better but the \"PC to FPS\" ratio has gone downhills).\n\nI understand that calculating AI choices and the simulation take a lot of resources, but this is not a game with a few thousand AI players like e.g. EU4 is. This is a relatively small map with just some AI players. This game also does not look that much better than some other RTS/TBS titles and I had FPS issues even with the lowest settings.\n\nI first ran this title with R9 280, so a quite old GPU, but that GPU was fully capable of running many decently modern games. This is IMO unacceptable, the developer can't optimize the game, and releases poorly coded product. I tested different graphic settings and noticed nearly no differences in the framerate.\n\nI then upgraded my PC to the top AM4 CPU and a very new GPU card (6600XT, overclocked) and the game ran fine on the highest settings, but I would not call it super smooth. All the other games run perfectly.\nElden Ring, Baldurs Gate 3, Cyberpunk (absolutely 0 issues in Cyberpunk). I would say CA messed up their game and didn't care to optimize it.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThe game is rather decent, it's enjoyable and has a connection to the lore of Warhammer.\nYou can't say a bad word about the general RTS mechanics, the battles and whatever. Just a normal RTS...\n\nIt just isn't the greatest RTS/TBS. Compared to Heroes of Might and Magic 3, or titles like let's say Cossacks, Age of Empires, or maybe Supreme Commander... It is unique in the Total War way, but given the amount of games in the series, it's ... not unique really (I have seen everything this game offers in different titles over the years).\n\nJust a giant simulation with a surprising lack of mechanics for an RTS game (as in economic aspect, diplomacy, map tactics. I think Europa Universalis IV is a good example of a really advanced tactics model in an RTS/TBS game and Civ 6 would be a great example of map design/economics). I personally don't like the maps for real-time battles. These maps seem quite crude and the skirmishes are badly designed.\n\nIn order to inflict maximum casualties you would need to kill every single unit. It should be enough that you break the enemy and automatically win. It's also quite unbalanced. Depending on what you kill first the results can wildly vary (including the AI acting much differently every time and the proposed outcomes of auto-resolved battles are just unhinged).\n\n I probably would like this game more without the \"real-time\" battles, but I assume it's the \"Total War\" way. To me it's time intensive and just not interesting. I liked Warhammer 40k's battles much more. They felt more tactical. Placement of units in this game does matter, but I had more fun playing The Battle for Middle Earth 15 years ago than this. I think the units panic too quickly and the characters don't matter enough.\n\nIt's the closest to the HoMM in terms of map and characters, however it lacks many things that made HoMM great (like tailored character development with meaningful spells and ability to recruit units, find artifacts on the map etc). The cities feel kind of empty, the mechanics are rather poorly described/introduced and just weird for an RTS (for my liking). \n\nI am not sure why there is so little care about the main characters. It would be very cool to build them up, be able to find artifacts on the map (besides the Sword of Khaine, that's just one item) and do something else than just advance some skills in the skill tree. Even if you invest your time in them then they can be sieged and just die.\n\nI also don't like some mechanics, for example the corruption, or slaves (they are not much intuitive. I think they should create clearer GUI and work on the general set of game rules, rather than make every faction different but also following totally different rules. Are we supposed to compete in a campaign and how if we follow different rules?). \nSome game prompts are meant to \"help\" learning the game, but they not always load up and they also don't explain small logos (traits) of the units, it's pretty useless. You need to use web browser anyway. Why to bother?\nIn that aspect - I think the designers totally messed up the UI/UX.\n\n21st August 2023 update: I played Baldur's Gate 3 and imagine they paid enough of work to actually make icons explain the traits of characters or items, amazing is it not? Seems to be lack of care. Every single icon in BG3 is fully explained. I could learn the game's rules and effectively build my characters.\n\n[h1]Genre[/h1]\nThe game is pretty fine, it gives some fun when playing it. Feels like Warhammer I guess? I personally am more of the 40k fan, but a game in the old universe is making lots of sense and the character design with world design are high quality.\n\n[h1] Summary (what made me dump this game also) [/h1]\nThe character design is quite impressive and it seems that they cared about the \"vibe\", but the game is just a money grab. why are there 3 game titles instead of one? What is the main improvement in between all of these titles?\nEach one of them has dozens of DLCs. An average person surely won't spend 300$ just to play more factions.\n\nWhat angered me so much I stopped playing after the purchase:\nThe publisher releases a paid product that claims to have free DLCs - some of them are, but the most important one isn't, and without it the game has got only 50% functionality and feels like a demo.\nRTS game without skirmish mode or some kind of \"do whatever\" mode is a meme. This isn't a DnD campaign board (and ironically such a campaign would allow for much more than selection of 5 heroes on one map lol), but an RTS in a specific universe.\n\nEvery normal RTS game has got a skirmish/free play mode (The Battle for the Middle-earth, Command and Conquer, Supreme Commander, Cossacks, Starcraft. Like every single RTS EVER) and this is especially filthy when you proclaim to release FREE functionality for the title, but then the player gets informed that they must buy TWO titles (WH1 and WH2) to get functionalities in the one they wanted to expand. Such a money grab, and even then the game is still locked behind micro-transactions/DLCs. I wanted to play a game, not donate to the \"poor\" publisher in 10 different ways. If the publisher wants money then they can sell better games.\n\nAwfully lot of DLCs, that don't add many things into the game. The base game doesn't feel like a game, but a rather Free to Play game account, that has 80% of content locked. Choosing from like 4 factions, especially in a game which varies so wildly depending on the faction (the factions aren't meant to be following any common rules it seems).\n\nWhat I also dislike is the publisher urging you to create an account to claim some of the \"free\" DLCs - the purpose is to collect data, and force you into their own website I assume (to raise statistics and show it to the management?). Why bother releasing game on Steam if you can't offer free DLCs to Steam users? I don't want your stupid 3rd party website.\n\nI don't recommend this game. I like Warhammer, but CA is a terrible company. I updated this review and in the meantime there have been at least a few different internet dramas with them involved.\n\nI would personally rather pay 70$ to a company that cares and provides a fun product (e.g. Lorian), than a DLC-locked tech demo... that \"stock\" Warhammer sure is.",
      "I got this game on a whim because I once played this series like... a decade ago. DW3/4 to be specific. And even though I know full well that this sort of game is basically meant for consoles, I managed to play it just fine once I adjusted the key bindings to stuff that worked well for me. Anyway... game.\n\nIf, like me, you have played these games before, you pretty much know what you are in for. If you have never played any of these games, I'm not quite sure what else is quite like it. Basically it's a fighting game, except it is on large battlefield maps where you murder thousands of random and a handful of named NPC's while following objectives in order to complete each level. If that sounds repetitive... well it can certainly be that. It's the ultimate hack and slash-fest game, and if you get bored with murdering insane numbers of enemies, then chances are this game is not for you.\n\nThe game is based upon the Three Kingdoms era of Ancient China (184-280, roughly), and, despite the absurd outfits and personalities of many of the characters in the game, it is actually fairly consistent with what is known about the period. Or rather, it is consistent with the famous novel 'Romance of the Three Kingdoms' by Luo Guanzhong, which is basically a work of historical fiction that takes real events and bends them a bit according to the whims and views of the author. Which, of course, means that certain characters (particularly Shu-Han characters like Xuande/Liu Bei) are depicted as noble honorable sorts fighting for justice while others (like Mengde/Cao Cao) are depicted as villanous and driven by ambition. I don't want to dig too deep into this because there most likely are entire books written about how Luo Guanzhong messed around with the characters, but the depictions he made are pretty much what are found in this and all previous DW games. The nice thing though is that if you read between the lines (or maybe it's just because I am very familiar with the source material this game is based off of), you can see the flaws in the author's bias in the game as well. Namely that Liu Bei was a massive hypocrite every bit as ambitious as his rivals, and that Cao Cao, while not exactly the nicest guy around, wasn't the hellspawn other characters (like Liu Bei) called him.\n\nAnyway, the game follows the story decently well, though some creative license and trimming down obviously has happened. I still liked how the game depicted things most of the time. Perhaps my favorite was Lu Bu's campaign which, while maintaining the massive \"OMG ITS LU BU\" hype that all DW games have had, reveals exactly why the real Lu Bu got himself executed in chapter 19 of a 120 chapter book: that he was dumb as a brick, betrayed people constantly, and never listened to anyone's advice. While the old DW games I played did have storylines for him, they didn't take the historical route that this game's (default) story path takes. The same goes for the numerous character deaths shown, though many of these are made more dramatic than they actually were.\n\nAlso, while the playable character cast has increased to the point of total insanity (including some that may not have even existed or actually fought on battlefields), I did like that, in the time between DW4 and this, they added a number of characters that rounded out the cast further by including some of the other lesser-known strategists (Chen Gong, Lu Su) and characters who rose to prominence in the later parts of the story (Deng Ai, the sons of Guan Yu/Zhang Fei, as well as the entire Jin faction who were the ultimate winners of this whole mess). I thought that was a nice treat since these sorts had been badly neglected in past games, where everything seemed to stop at the year 234 (when Kongming/Zhuge Liang died), which was roughly the chronological halfway point of the entire story.\n\nOk, I better stop and just finish this up.\n\nIn short, It's a DW game. That means that on the one hand, the combat gets repetitive, many of the characters are very hard to take seriously, and many of the story events are overdramatized to the point of being kind of ridiculous. On the other hand, there is a MASSIVE amount of content (and all those DLC's for this \"Complete Edition\" are purely cosmetic), big battles are kind of fun, and one can even argue that the storyline's inherent cheesiness may actually be more a positive than a negative.\n\nIf you have never played one of these games before, this is the one i'd look at because (to my knowledge) it's the newest one and has an insane amount of content even compared to its predecessors. If you have played these and liked them before... why not? If you didn't like these games however, then most likely this will do nothing to change your opinion.\n\nFor all it's goofiness and repetition, DW is still entertaining enough for me to waste sizeable amounts of time with it. Hooray and stuff.",
      "WTF, this isn’t gaming! Where are my lootboxes and micro transactions?!\n\nMy main thought after I beat GRIS was, \"I don't really understand anything that just happened, but it sure was pretty.\"\n\nI was absolutely amazed how a game with zero actual dialogue could move me to tears, just on strenght of its visuals and music. In general, the whole theme of dealing with grief/depression spoke to me in a way that I didn't expect.  It's one of those games you play to \"feel\" more than for the gameplay itself.\n\nI have PTSD from dealing with my wife getting a boyfriend, and this game made me cry several times while playing it. Especially during the scene where you're swimming away from the eel. That symbolism to me perfectly captures the feeling of trauma recovery. I'd spent time finding the little lights throughout that section of the game and activating the turtle which ultimately saved me from my own darkness and helplessness.\n\nIt felt like hope. It was such a good representation of how the coping skills I'd learned and the hard work I'd put in were finally seeming to pay off. It's when you're at your weakest that you learn how strong you actually are. I cried like a baby during and after that scene. It made me realize how much I've actually overcome, and how grateful I am to be free.\n\nGris truly is a beautiful game and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a slow paced experience. The only bit of criticism I have for the game is it certainly gives \"not like the other girls\" vibes at times, but I think this is quite easy to get over.\n\nIn conclusion: the visuals are stunning,  the music is beautiful and knows exactly when to kick in, the platforming elements are fantastic, and it’s story and themes are spectacular without a single word. Truly a must-play.\n\n10/10",
      "I played the demo and instantly became enamored. The mix of Slay the Spire-style deck-building with elements of the ship combat from FTL: Faster Than Light is an absolutely fascinating mix, and the \"single-axis\" movement system adds a whole extra layer that I've never seen in anything except the Mega Man: Battle Network series.\n\nI bought the full game within the first hour of being available. After having played for nearly 4 hours at the time of writing, my opinion hasn't changed in the slightest. I already love what's available and so far I feel like I've barely scratched the surface.\n\nI can't wait to see what awaits in the future for this awesome title.\n\nEDIT: As a small addition, I will say: I beat my very first run, which is set to the lowest difficulty (Normal). I jumped up to Hard to try to unlock a new ship, and I haven't been able to beat a run since then. It's probably just that I'm bad, all things considered, but be aware that the changes made with difficulty increases are probably more impactful than they may seem.\n\nAlso I wanna say to the devs: thank you for launching the game with mod support and working on making it easier! But also please look into getting Steam Workshop support if you can!",
      "Okay so,\n\nFirst off, the Streaming of the game play yesterday did this title zero favours. Whoever made the decision to allow a copy of the game which was 400 builds behind to be live streamed made a mistake.\n\nThe character creation is a nice touch, makes you think and get involved with it characteristics of the nation you pick to play as. I like this and rarely see stuff like this in game.\n\nThe Steam page states 'SuperPower 3 is tailor-made for all the megalomaniacs out there who are convinced they can do a much better job at running the world than real politicians and military leaders across the globe'. That's a rather bold statement for a game that has 5 or 6 laws you can change for a whole country...., \n\nOverall the game in its current state is incredibly basic and lacks any depth in regards to the actual management and running of a country. No parliaments behind a leader etc, why? Even the excuse of the focus is around you and your characters decisions doesn't make much sense. It takes away the feeling of running a country, that which you are describing in the games description. Where are the ministers, the scandals that come with the running of a country?\n\nThe game isn't a write off, I personally feel it will be good in time but looks to be missing alot. Overall 5/10. Product refunded.",
      "Earlier this week I did the impossible - I came out to a family member. One of my two sisters, in specific.\n\nI was nervous but relieved to know she accepted and supported me - and thought, you know, perhaps we should call and talk about some things. We had that call this Wednesday and I expressed a lot of my resentment towards my family - being stuck at home with some of my family, more specifically my [spoiler]mom[/spoiler], has completely wrecked my mental health. I'm still closeted from them and I live with each passing day, worried [spoiler]she'd[/spoiler] reject me - for being non-binary, for dating a trans person, for disappointing [spoiler]her[/spoiler].\n\nMy sister told me that [spoiler] my mom [/spoiler] only hears what [spoiler]she[/spoiler] wants to hear, that [spoiler]she[/spoiler] only thinks about what [spoiler]she[/spoiler] wants to see in [spoiler]her[/spoiler] kids despite often saying otherwise. From her experience, [spoiler]mom[/spoiler] seemed to be a very not open and is often a close-minded individual. \nComing into If Found..., I had only broke down early Thursday morning as my many months of frustrations and anxieties finally given the voice it needed.\n\nIf you've played the game it'd make sense if I told you that Kasio's experience with her parents in If Found... hurt reading for me - it genuinely hurt. Seeing her mom's first letter and annotating it with \"She's trying. But she has all these ideas of how I should be.\" and \"She didn't even consider she might need to apologize too.\" was something I sat at for a long time, probably longer than any other part of her journal that I was erasing through at a normal pace.\n\nMoments like that made me realize that this game is something I never knew I needed - a realization that hey, think about the move out you're doing in a month as rebuilding - as leaving the past behind. That there isn't anything wrong with that, and that you can really be yourself once we're out there, together. That family doesn't have to be bound by blood and it's really about the people who's there for you, even at your absolute worst. That I don't need to seek acceptance through others - but rather be more accepting of myself.\n\n[spoiler]\"I find I care less and less what other people think of me, and more for my own opinion. And these days I'm so much more comfortable in my own skin.\"[/spoiler]\n\nThere's people I can think of who need to read and see this.\n\nIf Found... left me with hope - and it's leaving me with a lot to think about. Thank you so much for this game, DREAMFEEL. I wish I could articulate this game better like other people have - but it's been a lot lately and I need to rest - if you're coming across this review/text you should without a doubt play it, especially if you've felt similarly trapped like both me and Kasio did.\n\nP.S. - If you find the eraser mechanic to be a little strenuous you can increase the size of the eraser in the options!",
      "As someone who was disappointed by Deconstructeam's previous game, The Red Strings Club, I'm happy to say that I enjoyed this immensely. Your choices actually matter this time (you can have multiple endings as opposed to one), the characters are compelling and fun to engage with, and it offers some much needed improvements on transgender rep (no more using someone's deadname in order to progress the plot). The art design is gorgeous, the gameplay is soothing, and the plot keeps my attention from start to finish (no more grinding to a screeching halt in the third act to make some phone calls). \n\nKeep in mind that the game does encourage more than one playthrough, so some players might not get a whole lot of enjoyment (it's slower paced and has a few missable achievement) but I thoroughly enjoyed this one. I plan on coming back to reforge my fate with the Cosmic Wheel soon.",
      "I am generally not a big fan of card games, because luck is most often the deciding factor in them, and so it is also here. But there are many solid mechanics that lessen the randomness and make it enjoyable. You can plan builds and be tactical with your card purchases, so you get a strong deck that can beat the boss. \n\nOf course it is also a rougelike, you will die. But that's part of it, you can have a strategy and get better with every run. It is also addicting in a good way. There are no in game purchases, or other such garbage that is common in so many other card games.\n\nThis is one of the best games that went through Early Access, and the developers made good updates, introducing two new characters with new cards and gameplay mechanics and also further balancing the game. They are currently working on a fourth character. They also interact really well with the players, featuring artwork and being active in the discussions.\n\nThere is much to love with this game, I saw myself coming back time and time again. \nI recommend it for everyone =)",

      "This is more of a personal opinion than a useful review, but I would like to share my experience with this game! At the beginning I was very disappointed... I was hoping for a Phoenix Wright competitor, but it wasn't even close! The investigation was so silly, the game doesn't let you leave the scene before you find all the clues, you can't \"weist\" your time going to places not related to the case and the trial doesn't start until you have all you need... the only way to fail is not having coordination to shoot the bullets xD The game takes you exactly where it wants.\nThe first trial was also so obvious I almost gave up playing. BUT THEN... things started to get strange. During my second trial I was \"that is what happened... I mean... I guess...\" and during the third trial I had no fucking idea what was going on D: The story got so deeper and full of details. Each chapter revealing new secrets, showing how complex the plot was!\nI realized that I shouldn't see Danganronpa as a poorly investigation game that wasn't that challenging, but as an amazing novel with such a rich story! The gameplay became secondarly compared to how envolved I was with the whole scenario! The further you go, more incredibly enjoyable it gets. So, for those who didn't like the game for this very reason, give a second chance with another point of view :) enjoy it's fabulous mysteries and you will not regret unreaviling it's secrets!",
      "Tentative review of game in progress, but so far it is amazing and I had to leave a review in support of it.  As far as the game itself goes, I'm giving it a 9/10.  As far as the port goes, the lack of keyboard input prompts seems frustrating when they already have the ability to change between xbox and ps4 buttons, but I use a controller and expect most will for this, but it's worth mentioning in the sake of fairness and accuracy.  There is a certain graphics setting called \"effects\" with high and low.  High is causing major fps drops under certain conditions even on a pc with an rtx 3080 and a 5800x cpu.  Devs have acknowledged it and are working on improving it.  Other than these issues though, no problems at all.  Online play has been smooth and i haven't experienced any disconnects.  The game itself has only crashed once in 93 hours, but that was also during excessive alt tabbing while the game was in true fullscreen mode, and it crashed on an alt-tab itself, so I'm not really blaming the game on that one given it was the only time.  Again, overall the game is playing great and I have no problems with it on a functional level as well as an entertainment level, I just want to be as fair and accurate as I can, and these were really the only problems I could find with it.",

      "\nWell, after almost a year of not playing this game, I must say, the devs did fix most of my issues. *Most*. Creative mode is fun, but you still need to collect stuff to make things, which is incredibly tedious. On top of that, the character dialogue is still really annoying and you need a NASA computer to play at a stable framerate, but hey, you can actually play without getting your ass beat. I'd like to up my ranking to an 8/10. Very fun, but I highly recommend playing with others. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOG REVIEW (outdated):\nThis game has potential, but unfortunately having fun with it is impossible if you aren't a hardcore survivalist.\n\nCritical Issue #1:\nThe main characters won't stop talking. Everytime you eat or hold the torch they say an unfunny one-liner that makes me want to gouge my eyes out with forks. Even Robin Ayou from Subnautica: Below Zero talked less, and the original game had a silent protaganist. Having characters that have constant dialogue that always repeats is just so annoying to the point where I had to turn off the volume. If the main characters were silent but atleast talked with each other, then I could see potential in that. But they just talk and talk and talk and none of it means anything.\n\nCritical Issue #2:\nThe enemies are way too hard to battle. To make better gear, you need to take on enemies that are so difficult to battle. Maybe you could say I'm just not good at battling enemies in survival games, but I was able to easily battle monsters in Terraria, Minecraft, Subnautica and Raft just fine. When your in-game monsters are too hard to defeat without gear that requires you to battle even MORE monsters, it is not fun, repetitive, and frustrating.\n\nCritical Issue #3:\nThe story is in the background. The fact that the story doesn't impact the game as much as it should is probably the worst aspect of any piece of media out there. The game sends you an a goose chase to find the  main story and it is infuriating. The story itself is all over the place. First it just seems like you need to make yourself grow bigger, but then it goes completely off the rails and into this scientist bunker with a robot that gives you quests, but you can ignore him and continue playing. I don't know if they finished the story, but so far it is not good.\n\nSomewhat Critical Issue:\nThere is no setting to dial back the graphics without lowering the resolution to look like Terraria. I can't see, and it is dumb and brings the whole beautiful vibe of being small down, ironically.\n\nMinor Issues:\nThe music is bland, and although I love electronic/synth music, this is just not it. The fact that you can't have bugs as pets or mounts, or even herd them is extremely upsetting. The farming sucks ass, it gives you 4 items of what you grew every 2 in-game days, when you can just find that item in more abundance at the place where it is located. Under the pond... JESUS CHRIST, the graphics are so bad. The wavy filter looks so bad, and you can see the entire underwater area crystal f**king clear, even though other smaller bodies of water have some kind of murkiness to it. Minor issues like this hold back the game.\n\nAlthough this is still in early access, it feels as if they wasted a lot of potential already. For such a unique world and concept, it never really exploits the amazing and obvious things that it can accomplish. Why not grow your own personal army of ants? Oh sorry, you can pick up eggs but they hatch and they aren't friendly. Why not create a raft made of weed stems and lilypads? Oh sorry, you can just build a base that looks like a boat. Although there are much worse steam games out there, and ones that I have hated more than this, this was sort of a slap to the face. It's not god-awful, and there are a lot of good things about it like the cartoony bug designs and the beautiful graphics, but honestly, it's a 6/10 bordering on a 7, and although many others have enjoyed this, being the super critical demogorgon that I am, this didn't exactly \"ground\" me.",

[/spoiler]\n\nNow:\nAfter the first few minutes (16 to be exact), I felt all the childhood memories resurface in my mind, the excited fan inside me screaming to continue in this beautiful game. Used to play the game on the Wii with 480p resolution on a small screen, now with 1440p on a computer monitor large enough to be fully immersed in this work of art, I can't begin to imagine what 4K will look like. Not only all the textures are sharp, but the added post processing effects from the original on PS2 makes the experience simply better.\n\nThis newest edition of Okami allows both controller and keyboard/mouse support, the game open to the Playstation or the \"Wii\" playstyles. I have not tested the controller part yet, however for the keyboard/mouse part, all the controls can be rebound to your heart's content. The camera is controlled by the mouse, in case you are wondering.\n\nUsing the Celestial Brush feels natural, comfortably giving you full control on your line work without horrid wavering drawing (Wii version with its Wiimote not being stable in your hand, for example). I miss the ability to change the thickness of the brush freely like on PS2, although at least there's the ability to paint a constant, thicker line instead.\n\nYou can also change the refresh rate of the game, as well as the resolution and if you want it fullscreen, windowed, or borderless windowed. Either you can't change to a 1920x1200 resolution if you don't have a 16:10 screen (even if your 16:9 screen is bigger than that), or it's locked at 4:3 and 16:9 only. You might get some black lines if you are using a 16:10 screen.\n\nWith all the positive above, I do have to point out the controls overall can take a little while to get used to. As for framerate, the Fan Menu can go at 60 fps, while the game itself seems to be capped at 30 fps. In any case, the framerate of the game was not wavering at all on either situations, which is a mega plus compared to, say, an emulator.\n\nOverall, the game compared to its predecessing versions is simply stunning, completely worth the $20.00. This 30 hours game is a masterpiece, a classic, and simply a unique and fun experience. Now's your chance to play this amazing, way underrated work of art!\n\nP.S.: For the artists out there, try out your drawing tablets with the game and see if it works. If you can move your mouse cursor with a pen, so should the camera and Celestial Brush. This can be a unique way to play~\n\nEDIT: I forgot to point out by default, the right mouse button makes the alternate, thicker line. Now if you have some sort of plugin for a PS3 controller for detecting analog inputs, I wonder if the game will still recognize that data and allow you to draw variable lines, like on PS2...\n\nUPDATE: I can confirm that Okami is playable with a drawing tablet like Intuos Comic and the likes. It actually makes for a very interesting playstyle! However, the camera is a little bit hard to control unless you have a very high sensitivity, since you can't just reposition your pen like you would with your mouse in this case. For the first time, I finally was able to really draw in Okami...\n\nTIPS:\nIf you need to walk [spoiler]for the \"Pick Nami's clothes\" minigame[/spoiler], hold B on the keyboard. It will make Amaterasu walk instead of run when you move around.\n\nPressing the Fan Menu button twice allows you to skip nearly all dialog in the game, without the need to complete the game first.\n\nApplying Gold Dust on weapons apply different visual effects on them, no matter how subtle they are. It's easier to notice it now in this edition of the game!",
      "This game was so much fun but it's borderline unplayable a lot of the time due to no region lock. You get a lot of players from china playing on NA servers and they're basically untouchable due to ping. I genuinely think this game has fantastic game play and the characters and customization are top notch but spawning and dying to untouchable Chinese players every match just ruins the experience no matter how much I try to enjoy it. Not worth until they region lock the game or unless you want maybe a few hours of fun until you run into 我操你妈 every game and die to reasons out of your control.",

      "An okay game that wastes your time.\n\n\nI played on the hardest difficulty. For me there was a pretty big difficulty spike somewhere in chapter 6 or 7. Apparently I had been skipping on the battles earlier on and was a bit too low level. No problem, I had just unlocked skill trees for the characters, so some XP spending made things manageable. I had to try the map a few times, but once I downed a few mobs and gained some levels, all was going well. The objective was to kill all the enemies by certain time, and that's what I aimed to do. Except, once I'd killed all the enemies, the objective changed and I would've needed to trudge to the other side of the map and kill the boss as well. Yeah, fuck that.\n\n\nThe combat works round-by-round in speed order. If your characters go faster than the enemies, you can simply spam AoE attacks and kill droves of them before they go. If enemies are faster, you're kind of screwed because they hit hard, you're on the defensive, have to spend turns healing and cannot attack that much. And levels seem to make a huge difference here. Combat seems sort of poorly balanced in this respect; maps are hard at the beginning, but by the end just a joke because you gained a few points of speed and are now overall faster and can spam AoE attack and kill enemies in droves.\n\nThe user interface and usability is pretty archaic. For example, to get out of a menu you have to explicitly click on the button that says \"back\" instead of just clicking a right mouse button or Esc or whatever.\n\nThe writing was quite funny at times. It also seemed of a mixed quality. A lot of times it seemed clearly aimed at 13-year olds.  (Especially cringey are the first pair of \"combat helpers\" you get.) I also did play the game for a lot longer at once than I usually do. I think there's some kind of magical simplicity about it, and it's fun to play.\n\nIt's just, in general, the one thing I dislike the most is doing again the exact same thing that I just did. That's the developers' way of saying \"fuck you\" to me, and so I don't want to play this game anymore. If you don't mind that, and the game looks like something you'd like, then I don't doubt you'll like it. Don't get it for 20 moneys though. 15, perhaps... 10 yeah, sure. Because reading the reviews, the one thing many agree on is the later you get the more garbage the combat gets. So, in essence, you only have the visual novel aspect. And if you're not 13 anymore, I don't know. Play something else perhaps.",

      "Portal is a first person puzzle platformer where you are testing science with portals guided by GLaDOS.\n\nThe game is a classic for a reason. It uses portals as the main puzzle mechanic and combines other mechanics with the portals such as falling and gaining momentum to launch at a higher speed through the other portal. The levels gradually build up with complexity, but are never too frustrating and half of them are done with access to only a single portal. The puzzles have great visual clarity with the mostly white colors and decent visual cues on how it should all work out.\n\nPortal has the classic Valve way of telling stories, as things are already happening before you get there. You are woken up to follow instructions for the testing purposes of GLaDOS, but you are also figuring out if maybe there isn't a role better suited that could fit you. It's an enjoyable mystery leading you on without forcing it's way in.\n\nGoing back from Portal 2 to Portal made me aware of the improvements to the overall gameplay. Exiting through portals in Portal makes the camera rotate in a weird way sometimes and the levels are generally designed to be slower pace than what Portal 2 offers.\n\nIf there is one thing I didn't enjoy, it's the advanced and challenge levels. Figuring the harder puzzles is one part of the challenge, but executing them relied on tight timings where the puzzle mechanics they rely on felt too clunky to be fun.\n\nFor achievement hunters:\nTwo playthroughs are required with 2 sets of collectibles, one of which requires to be done in one go, a few challenges through the story and completing the advanced and challenge levels that can be console cheesed.

      "The premise is that you're a passenger on a ship, waking up on the morning after you've murdered your well-to-do husband. From that point, you're free to go anywhere on board to do whatever you can to avoid justice within the time limit. You could just try to play dumb and cover up enough evidence to put your guilt into doubt. If you're more devious you could try to frame one of your fellow passengers. You could even go the And Then There Were None route and murder everyone else on board just to be thorough, if you can pull it off.\n\nOverboard! was clearly designed for replayability. The ship is full of evidence and red herrings to tamper with, desperate schemes to attempt, and secrets to learn. The first playthrough reveals only a small slice of all this, leaving a collection of unsolved mysteries and unfollowed leads to pursue on the second. The second playthrough prepares you for the third, and so on, until finally you beat the game... but there's much more to it than that. Vague, but I don't want to spoil anything.\n\nThis game was released today without any kind of announcement beforehand from inkle. As usual, their writing and design are superb. If you're captivated by the premise, even by a little, you won't regret the purchase.",
      "An Excelent, well polished shmup(except for one technical fault) with great graphics and music.\n\nNot much to say other than it has fun boss fights with some creative bullet patterns, you have a gauge that fills up and when activated it doubles your fire power, and also you have bombs. If you have bombs and you get hit, you lose all of your bombs instead of just dying straight out, so you essentially have 2 hit points. You have a graze meter as well, meaning that if bullets pass by you it fills that meter up, when it is full, all bullets around you are basically nullified, and any enemy you kill, any bullets it fired at you will also get nullified. When you pass through the nullifeid bullets, it will fill the first gauge I mentioned so you can go ape s**t more often.\n\nIt's fairly simple, but the pace of the game takes a little while to get used to, the speed of your ship releative to the bullets is a little too slow but it's not game breaking. The only major issue is that my controller is not detectable by the game so I have to use joytokey, so I can't make full use of my controllers analog controls.",
      "This is somehow the only game where you can play as an anti-fascist faction in Nazi Germany, drive the Nazis into the ocean, kill Hitler and reclaim Germany as a democracy, and that's somehow the most boring possible outcome.",
      "Note this is not \"Steampunk Civ\" so don't think of it that way. Its effectively a story/scenario driven city builder. The game looks beautiful and works well with the world building that goes on with the game. \n\nYour games will be short but its still fairly challenging depending on the scenario you choose\n\nDefinitely recommended",
      "Update circa Feb 2017: PLEASE READ!\n\nIt's been brought to my attention that there is a code for unlocking all the characters and stages in the game.  One of the main reasons I could not recommend this game at all on release was that, as far as I knew, it was not possible to unlock all single-player content without multiplayer modes (versus), which requires an extra controller.  As this is NOT the case, I can recommend this game if it is on sale (50% off or more, and it has been 75% off previously) and you look up the code.  If it matters, you will still need to fufill normal unlock conditions for achievements.\n\nThe game still sorely needs an online mode, has no AI for versus, and is not quite a pick-up and play title.  The two times I've returned to this game after a long absence, it has taken me a while to relearn the controls, an issue I don't frequently have with other games.  This may not be a problem if you play often enough, or with a controller.\n\nMy outdated review can be seen below\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you can gather 1 to 3 people for local multiplayer, then feel free to buy this game.\n\nHowever, if you plan to play this game by yourself, make sure you have a spare controller before purchasing this game.\n\nWhy?  Because even with a keyboard, a controller is required to play Versus mode, and certain content (at least 3 map sets and all 4 extra characters) can not be unlocked unless you can access Versus mode.\n\nIf you do not have a controller, you will not be able to unlock all single player content.\nIf you do not have a controller, you will not be able to unlock all the content in a game you paid for.\n\nI would change my stance on this game in the future if either:\n1)  The ability for a single player to fight against the AI in \"versus mode\"  is added\nor \n2) An online mulitplater mode is added  \nThe second option may be a little unreasonable, but the first isn't.\n\nEither of these would allow players to play versus mode without a controller, thus giving them the ability to unlock game content that is currently unaccessible with just a keyboard.",

This game will go down as a cult classic!!",
      "This game is amazing! Truly the Dark Souls of little girl simulators.\n\nI’m glad that Dark Souls taught me how to dodge in literally every video game, it unknowingly prepared me for this. Ender Lilies is a Soulslike with JoJo Stand combat. That’s an instant win for me.\n\nThe world is depressing, suffocating and overwhelmingly beautiful. Each stories of the main spirits are well written and realistically human. The endings are top notch too.\n\nIf you’re even considering playing it… play it… I promise you won’t regret it. I was much more emotionally invested in this game than I was on Hollow Knight. Lilly is an amazing protagonist… and she never even utters a word. She doesn’t have to.\n\nIt's a beautiful game with fun combat, awesome art and amazing music. My only real complaint was a bit of exploration fatigue having to go around finding all the collectibles. \n\nI think the easiest way to sum up Ender Lilies is \"It's Momodora, but better.\" It has the same gameplay loop of \"slash slash roll behind the enemy slash slash repeat\" and fairly challenging bosses, in a much bigger and more non-linear world with nearly every single room having some sort of collectible. It's also aesthetically atmospheric and pleasing, and the soundtrack is great.\n\nI can safely say that this game is a creative masterpiece. And in the end… Like Lilly, don’t we all have a little girl inside of us, telling us to stop all this silliness and go back to being the proper good boys our Mother wanted us to be?\n\n10/10",
      "I really liked the concept of this game of navigating through orbits to collect crates and then successfully landing on the exit.  However, there just isn't enough content to justify it being sold as a complete product, especially at its current price of $6.99.  You see everything there is in the first couple of levels.  No new mechanics are added to the game as you progress.  The developer admits that the game is too simple and the fix was to add artificial difficulty to make the game longer.  For instance, rather than have intuitive controls using toggles, it requires the player to activate thrusters with one hand and turn them off with another.  The level design stops adding anything new and just adds more tedious narrow paths that must be navigated rather than an actual challenge or puzzles.  Finally, the DLC appears to be “pay to win” rather than getting any new content, it just gives the player access to aircraft that should be included already in the game.  By level 9 it is near impossible to progress any further with the default ship as it cannot accelerate fast enough to get through the small orbit and requires purchasing the DLC to advance the level.",

Its loads of modes, tight controls, great bullet patterns, and fun gameplay and scoring mechanics make it an awesome shooter. \nThat being said, this game is tough as nails. Even the novice mode is hard as heck and definitely isn't novice-friendly. I reccomend having one or two shmup clears under your belt before you try to tackle DoDonPachi. (Crimzon Clover's novice mode is a good introduction to shmupping) You need some skill to get the maximum amount of enjoyment out of this game.\n\nStill, though, It's awesome! DoDonPachi Resurrection is a very fun experience, even with it's difficulty.\n",
      "Alpha, Beta, Finished Product... I hear lots of Blah blah blahs complaining about this game not being out of Alpha after years and years, but it isn't like we've been paying a monthly fee for it.  I paid one time to support this game and I've got years of play out of a product that I enjoy.  There aren't too many games that scratch an itch like this game for me... Open World, completely editable/buildable environment and zombies!  One of my biggest issues with a game that I like is that after I buy it, they release a few DLCs and then move on to their next product.  Alpha, Beta, Finished or Not... the developers have given me years of standing by their product and many updates with new content and mechanics.  For that alone, I love their game!\n\nGraphics: 3 outta 5 graphics, she looks a little dated but they keep updating it... It looks better than it originally did.  There's growth\nReplayability: 5 outta 5\nGameplay:3 outta 5... sometimes she's a little clunky\n\nI definitely still believe that this game is worth buying and that they devs and their product is worth supporting.

Rowling, at a time far before Harry & friends were even born. You’ll play as a fifth year student in the titular magics academy, admitted this late because of unspecified ‘special circumstances’. The virtual rendition of Rowling’s works is nothing short of exceptional, with not only Hogwarts itself, but also its environs (like the town of Hogsmeade or the dangerous Forbidden Forest), all recreated faithfully and down to the most minute details. Of course, some things will differ from movies and books, with the game being set in the 1800s. \n\nThe main story follows the classic ‘manifest destiny’ archetype, where your custom-made character will discover hidden potential that ties them to a greater purpose. Despite some genuinely memorable characters and some interesting side- and main-quests, the overall narrative can’t help but fall a little flat and stale, especially towards the ending phases. Nonetheless, many enjoyable adventures await you. Notably, there are no romance or love/hate dichotomies in the relationships you have with side-characters, as your choices will always end up in pretty much the same results during questlines.\n\n[h3]Exploration, Collectibles & Secrets[/h3]\nThe world is vast and visually magnificent, peppered to no-end with points of interest that often hold collectibles, currency or other utilities. Initially on foot, and later on with the iconic enchanted brooms and even flying magical creatures, you’ll be able to explore at leisure and clear the enormous amount of side-activities. A good portion of these, however, will prove inaccessible until you gain the right spells or abilities, in a sort-of ‘metroidvania’ fashion that promotes meaningful backtracking. Fast travel and an item-highlighting spell prove invaluable in saving time while exploring. Collectibles are mostly cosmetic, enabling the customization of both your wizard and your own private room once you unlock it, to suit various styles. \n\nMost dungeons and locations have additional puzzles or hidden paths that often lead to collectibles or extra resources; exploration feels rewarding, with a genuine sense of mystery surrounding each new point of interest you’ll find. Despite that, most dungeons and locations play out in the same way, and become repetitive in the long haul.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2933385898\n\n[h3]Combat System & Bosses[/h3]\nMagical battles use spells as sole means of offense and defense. Usually against multiple enemies at once, sometimes supported by allied NPCs, you’ll have to time your protection spell right in order to deflect incoming attacks, or dodge-roll away in case of unblockable ones. Enemies are varied and range from magical creatures to dark wizards and goblin soldiers, to name a few. Some of them may be weak to specific charms, others have shields you can break by using specific spell categories (damage, utility, movement) or other special abilities, like immunity to certain effects. \n\nCombat feels engaging, well-paced and is more than a little gory for this universe’s standards, death will be far more common than in the movies or books. The way you can combine spell effects to your advantage and use the environment further adds to the base system, while the amount of passive upgrades with item traits and spell-related talents you can gain progressively add another layer of depth. In late-game however you’ll become overpowered between potions, passive traits, talents and endgame spells - so much that supposedly fearsome dark wizards will prove little more than a nuisance due to power creep.\n\n[h3]Quests, Minigames & Challenges[/h3]\nQuests usually involve retrieving something, talking to a specific NPC, solving a treasure hunt based on visual clues, getting the solution to logic-based puzzles and more, depending on the case. While some side-quests are unique and memorable, most will be fetch chores or dry open-world shenanigans that you’ll have to repeat over and over in the same fashion. Less, but more meaningful and unique quests would have been better than this bloat, for sure. \n\nChallenges are paramount in unlocking unique bonuses like increased inventory capacity, many cosmetics, and even unique passive upgrades to equip in gear pieces. They often require you to slay X of a specific enemy, finish X of the same activity, and such “long-term” goals. Some of them are a massive grind and will only give you the 25th pair of gloves you don’t need, or other cosmetics that aren’t worth the effort.",

I've already invested a lot of time and energy into this game for little to no return. I'm not going to study guides and waste more time on this game just so I can dig the nuggets of fun out of this wasted youth simulator. I will say that it did a really good job of making me role-play an awkward alcoholic with no job prospects and zero understanding of how to talk to women, living out of a ****** hotel room. But I've already played the real life version of that, so I can't recommend it. If you want to play a fun game about programming, go with Human Resource Machine. If you want a good role-playing game about hackers, go with Shadowrun. If you want to pay money and spend your leisure time feeling really depressed about your 20's, then I can recommend Else Heart.Break(), but maybe you'd be better off talking to a friend about it instead.",
      "It is a very good game, some people complain about how there are no checkpoints in levels, but fear not, as they can all be beaten in a couple of minutes, and some people complain about how its repetitive because you need to do everything over and over if you keep dying, but if that happens, its clear you are missing something, so by heading to the IEYTD website, you can see tips for every level (secrets are not included, only how to beat the level itself), and if the tips dont help, after 2 tips you can just choose to reveal the answer, so those negative reviews are no reason to not buy this amazing game, this is the game trilogy i recommend every VR player to play ATLEAST once",
      "***NEWBIES*** At least 50%, if not more, of this game is map knowledge. So don't beat yourself up if you're  super lost and everyone is yelling at you over game chat. Just mute the salty people and report them if they TK. Trust me there are a lot of people in the game that will back you up and want to help, so don't let one bad experience make you quit the game for good.\n\nThere are a LOT of maps to learn and a lot of small details in every one. It's going to take the average person until your siege level is at LEAST 50 before you really start recognizing map layouts and details on all maps - including room orientation, call outs, soft wall, hard wall, what should be reinforced in each site, common paths of travel, etc..  And then probably until 75 until you're actually comfortable with most maps and operators. I'll give 15% to your own gun skills, 20% to team work and communication (call outs call outs call outs, people. Don't be that guy that just looks at memes after dying. Unless it's casual.), and 15% to your knowledge of the operators and ability to utilize their gadgets. \n\nMore tips:\n-There are a lot of Diamond/Plat smurfs in newcomer that like to make new accounts and s*** on actual new players because it makes them feel good for some reason, so you're better off playing quick match. \n-To learn maps faster, make your own custom games and run around in them. \n-When you die, make sure you watch the replay so you know what cheeky angle the enemy was holding and then don't do what you did next time, or use it to your advantage when you switch sides. \n-If you're not on cams, watch teammates. Look at the places they check as they sweep rooms. Watch the paths they take. Look at how they engage in gun fights and how they rotate around the map. \n-Spend the extra few dollars to buy a version with some operators - it'll make game play more fun for you and you'll have an easier time finding operators that work best with your play style. \n-Squad up with friends - being able to communicate and laugh in a discord can really improve the game experience, even if it's just one other person.\n-Best way to really understand an operator is to play them, so take advantage when there are siege events that allow you to play whoever you want. Use this information to purchase your next operator with the game currency. \n\n",

      "Ranking based on my \"clicking time\" is an odd designer's choice ... Is it a cheap way to add challenge? Apart from that, the game seems nice. Positive review for now, but it is kinda close call for me ...\n\nI admit, it is so fun to play, however, I have just completed 2 scenarios for the warrior and for the rogue and .. why is it so easy? Is the game goint to get any more difficult?\n\nI have just beaten summer campaign. Still absolutely no challenge. I am hoping for the fall and winter to get more challenging ... \n\nAfter playing for a while ... ranking based on time is the most horrible designers' choice I have seen in turn-based games. I see the point here thought, so WHY DON'T you do it based on NUMBER of turns instead? It makes sense and it would be fun to define decks for more effecient play ... time based, however, adds frustration instead of satisfaction. It doesn't feel like a challenge but rather (sorry for repeating myself) the cheapest way ever to pretend there is a challenge here ..\n\n\nAlso .. Tolerance\n[strike] Suffered 3 or less damage in combat. This achievements seems bugged ... I am fairly sure I have had fights where I suffered no damage at all .. [/strike]",
      "While it seems grindy at times, you will probably feel greatly rewarded when you can get enough resolve to spec out a specific build exactly how you want it. I think the progression of the tower abilities and gold gain is great, but even the burdens available don’t seem to switch it up quite enough. I’m on ng+4 and i feel like it’s getting a tad stale. I still like playing it of course. Some classes like the chef make the idea of playing anything else not quite worth it. I’m sure there’s some great niche builds but keep that in mind. Overall, this game keeps you on your toes. If you get hit, it’s almost always because you did something wrong. I LOVE the movement abilities in this game. You can feel like a speed runner with a few hours of practice gliding and jumping. This is a completely different game compared to rogue legacy 1 in all the best ways. 9/10",
      "Not what the developers promised.\nFeels like a graphics mod for Chivalry.\n\nI'm not a fan of Chivalry either. I had some fun with it, but couldn't bear the clunkiness and wished for intuitive controls and realistic fights. Mordhau promised exactly that. \nAlthough it's equally clunky und even more buggy.\n\nAlso it doesn't offer the option to play in private rooms with your friends (duel mode) or only on paid servers. Inviting a friend to a local match should be a standard feature.\n\nAll the new content and features don't really matter - it's a PvP fighting game. I need only a couple of weapons that work, not 100+ that don't.",
      "Normally, I am hard-set on if a game is good, or bad. This game? its in the middle. I mean, a lot of the game is actually really cool, it looks great, it doesn't explain why basically almost every single person is a walking hunk of muscle, but there are some serious flaws. Not just the weird ones like \"kitchen knives break after you stab someone 3 times\" or \"I just ran over an entire sidewalk of people, and the police are nowhere to be found\", but some seriously terrible glitches that make the game unplayable. Such as the whole space-car thing. \"lalala... driving along the road...\" all of the sudden KABAM your car goes flying, hits the ground, explodes, you die, and you get charged money. You use a car to try and get back to where you were going, and BANG same thing happens again. Also, the cops, even though they are extremely spread out and don't appear to have any form of 911 or anything, are nuts with guns. You, who are supposed to be some sort of superultracop, don't even carry a knife. A FREAKING KNIFE. So if you want a gun, you have to kill a police officer, BUT WAIT HE DIDN'T DRAW HIS GUN AND YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE A HOLSTER so you have to wait until another police officer shows up, hope that he tries to shoot you instead of tackling you, and then run up to him while he shoots at you, press f when you are right in front of him, and grab his gun. Meanwhile the entire police force is going to where you are. Thats just how to get a pistol. Whats that? You want a real gun? One that doesn't take 7 shots(literally) to kill a unarmored policeman? Well, you have to hole up in some building, which its hard to find one with an interior, and just keep shooting the police officers when they charge in. Eventually, after maybe 30 officers are dead, they send in their \"elite team\" of guys... with no helmets... no armor other than a vest... and either a shotgun or a submachine gun. The farthest I have gotten to is with these guys dressed in all grey with helmets and assault rifles, they are meant to be the wall, because it can take up to an entire clip of your submachine gun to take one down. Oh, and back to the cars, WHAT THE HECK IS WITH THE CAR ATTACKING. It made me almost fall out of my chair laughing when I realized that I could use my car to \"lunge\" left and right, and take out other cars. I guess the devs didn't know that cars can't drive straight sideways. Your character has no weapons as well, so it looks kinda stupid when you are blocking and punching a bunch of guys with tire irons, knives, and whatnot. Oh yeah, the weapons break after you swing a few times. The game also has weird weapons. You can pick up an umbrella, a purse, heck even a grocery bag, or a take-out box, to use as a weapon, but these things are one use, and deal less damage then a punch. Overall, this game is a little too unrealistic, to the point where it really removes you from the game. Not to mention the glitches, you would think that the \"new and improved\" sleeping dogs would be \"new and improved\" not the horrible, glitchy mess it is now. I really tried to play it, but I just got tired of being gunned down while I am trying to break into a car and start it up, which takes like a good 20 seconds, which is a lot of time when you have 10 cops unloading their bottomless clips at you. I got tired of randomly being flung into space. I got tired of a cop arresting me, and instead of allowing me to break free and whatnot, me and the cop take a \"small adventure\" gliding across the road through cars and buildings. I got tired of a game thats supposed to be fixed and nearly glitchless, when in reality most early access games play better. I am sorry.",

      "This is the best Civilization up to this point, and the DLC just made it even better. I will grant that the with all the add ons it would feel a tad crowded to anyone who hadn't played it before, but you have a crazy amount of options. The game series tagline of \"one more turn\" could not be more applicable.\n\nYou can strive for one of several victories: diplomatic, cultural, technological or domination. Each has its unique challengers to overcome and create a lot of the fun of the game. They are also not necessarily mutually exclusive and after completing one victory, you can go for the others. Each AI opponent has their own personality, and are pretty predictable in how they behave. Any one who has started the game next to Neopoleon or Ghengis Kahn knows they immediately have to have a decent military to repel invasion, while Ghandi will to muscle you out with religion and culture.\n\nThere are some important changes between Civilization IV and V. One of the most notable is that wars are plausible again as you dont constantly lose health in enemy territory and cities are easier to conquer. Additionally, culture doesn't automatically take over neighbor's cities anymore. \n\nThis game is easily worth the money. I'm not entirely sure how it stacks up to Civilization VI, but any game that I log 200+ hours on over a period of years and still haven't come close to doing everything is doing something right. A great game from a great series.",
      "Stellaris is the contemporary 4X sci fi galactic empire grand strategy to play.  The spiritual successor to ancient space exploration games like Master of Orion and Star Wars: Rebellion.  Start out with just your homeworld and send out scout ships and colonies until you've got your own star empire. \n\nManage your population, tell them what to build, design your own spaceships and fleet structures, and then get pounded into the dirt by the far too cheaty AI... yeah, it's another one of those games where because it's hard to make the AI smart, Paradox decided instead to just make the AI units cheat and become ridiculously overpowered.\n\nI have to say the game is probably far too difficult even if you set all the difficulty to the easiest levels, it's unclear what the developers were thinking, but you can mod the game easily in Steam Workshop to make it viable to play single player. \n\nAs with all Paradox games the DLC pricing is murder, and it adds very little to the core game experience, so my advice is to grab this on sale if you were a fan of MOO, go straight to Steam Workshop and mod it until it's playable, and then you'll have a perfect time sink well worth your money.",

Matches are fast paced, with the only goal being \"stay alive longer than your friends\".

Little to no option and interaction with followers of any substance besides the simple 101's. \n\nSo many better options out there (cheaper as well) that can offer you more and robust challenge (rim world, for eg).\n\nIf you must purchase, only do so at a extremely discounted rate.

      "[i]While the artwork and combat remain enjoyable, the story, writing, and pacing were a major letdown.[/i]  \n\n***\nMINOR SPOILERS BELOW. If you're going to play the game, play before reading.\n***\n\n[b]The mature storylines, hard-hitting decisions, beautiful worldbuilding, and tight writing that made the first two so immersive is not present in this game.[/b] (You'll notice immediately that the writing for the caravan in the capital is [i]particular[/i] trite, awkward to read, and uninteresting.)\n\nUnfortunately, it's not just the writing that's weak. [i]The pacing is off.[/i] Antecedents are confusing, characters you'd expect to speak don't, events that should have been foreshadowed come out of nowhere. More frustrating are the serious character continuity \"errors,\" and arcs that disappear, change, or go nowhere. [i]In short, the events, decisions, and conflict from the previous games do not appear or resolve in a way that was suggested by the previous two[/i].\n\n\nHere's one example. In Banner Saga 2, Fosolt is unexpectedly rescued by Bolverk. [i]\"I have a message for Alette from the dead varl king,\" [/i]he said. That's pretty intriuging! Maybe there's a mystery, an oracle, an item, or just cool information about the Varl and their strange king? Maybe there'll finally be context about the bridge decision!\n\n[i]No! He has nothing interesting to say or add, and then his storyline just gets dropped and forgotten.[/i]\n\nWell, Bolverk's been possessed by Bellower! Gosh, who knows what Bellower will say? In fact, I can't wait to find out what happens to Bellower's body! \n\nWell, actually, Bolver's [i]not[/i] possessed, not really, certainly not like it was implied last game, and Bellower's body -- [i]a primary focus of the first two games[/i] -- isn't mentioned [i]once[/i]\n\nOr how about how they casually mention that Eyvyn is not only the [i]head[/i] of the Valka order, but also that he's had periodic bursts of hereditary madness all along? That's... odd. And it's not presented as an well-thought out [i]reveal[/i] or anything. It's presented matter-of-factly, like they were trying to ret-con in a less interesting story, or were tone deaf.\n\nYou'll notice that all the characters are underutilized and have unfulfilled storylines/tensions. Hakon has hard choices to make; Canary's a little crazy; Yrsa is mysterious; Gil's in love with Alette, etc. Will these build into choices? Reveals? Dependent endings based on choices? Will there be discussions referencing the past? Reflections on travels? Hints of despair?\n\nNo. In mine, Gil was [i]murdered[/i] and no one even bothered to reference it. Canary's situation never comes to a head. You never have to choose between Varls and Humans. Murdering people doesn't make people threaten to leave. Ubin returns randomly as an uber Varl and he's... learned the horseborne's language? Travelled the southlands? In like, a month? In a way that doesn't advance the plot? It's just... weakly done.\n\n\nThere are [i]so many[/i] examples like this, where the stories don't quite fit correctly, where what you picked up on in the early games about the [i]mysteries[/i] and the [i]world[/i] and what made it a [i]vibrant[/i] place were forgotten about by the writers. [b]The result is that it the game plays out in unsatisfying ways, in tenseless scenarios made vapid by watered-down morality, an inability to leverage the situation in fun ways, and low-quality writing, paucity of choice-making, a lack of exploration, lack of plot twists, simplified overworld mechanics -- all culminating in an almost staggeringly one-dimensional and shallow ending.[/b]\n\nThe Banner Saga series was always an experience that was greater than the sum of its part. An [i]experience[/i]. Of being [i]riveted[/i] to the computer, checking the map, worrying over supplies, guessing at mysteries, having my breath taken away at each hill. Unfortunately, that's not the case in this game. \n\n\nGameplay-wise, it's also a bit of a letdown. Combat is fun-ish, but you can make invincible character combinations and the mechanics don't even try to deal with this. There's an interesting new reinforcement mechanic that's not used heavily, and never pushes you like you think the end of the world would. You never really have to split up your forces. There's no novelty. Like maybe using a hero in a battle makes them fatigued, so you have to switch them up? Maybe you can station them different places, making them unusable for combat? Maybe you need to choose eight for a secret mission caravan? Maybe dream sequences? No, nothing like that. \n\nThe overworld gameplay had some changes that never really felt significant. Moreover, quite a bit felt taken away. You can't rest, do training missions, no longer weigh food vs upgrades. One example of all thise tone deafness was Iver's march through the destroyed world was consistently at \"Great Morale!\"\n\nThere didn't seem to be many flavor choices (\"Do we hang the criminals or let them join us?\"), including much less on social themes (\"Should women fight, if it disturbs the traditionally-minded men?\" \"One clan's rowdy, what do we do?\" \"They threaten to leave if so and so isn't banished\"), and less delayed results and fewer significant decisions, including among the game's built-up tensions among the factions. \n\n\nThere's also some cases of development [i]feeling[/i] cheap. Remember opening Banner Saga 2, and feeling that it was [i]fresh[/i], and [i]upgraded[/i]? There's little to make you feel that way here. The artwork is okay, but the environments feel more generic, with less variety, and the surreal landscapes in the darkness aren't especially interesting to look at for long periods of time. Iver is voiced by Bolverk's voice actor, and they sound exactly the same. The new title system is a fun idea, but is visually integrated into the game's menu system with the finesse of a cheap mod. \n\nThere's a moment in the game where the screen goes black for scrolling text and voiceover narration explaining the upcoming mechanic. Um, a character can't explain that? It was similar how the many two second animations are used, not to supplement the story, but to [i]replace[/i] written portions, making you feel unsure about what's going on. And finally, the game's pretty short, without fun combat challenges or interesting newgame+ challenges. \n\n\nWhat's [i]particularly[/i] frustrating is that the game's release date was moved forward four months. I don't know the story why, but I do know that a few more months of polish and story embellishment might have delivered the beautiful, grippingly interactive story we were hoping for. Because this is a watered down version of the previous two in just about every way.\n\nThis negative review is for whatever processes lead to this mediocre finale.\n\n---\n\n[i]Here's a plot that would have made more sense. Zephyr arrives and speaks to you secretly. There's a god that's still alive! Neat, now we'll finally get more story on that. Yay, fun caravan mode, now we need to take longships somewhere interesting!\n\nBut uh-oh! There's a Sundr villain going there as well, with an army of dredge! But at least now we'll finally get more story about the Sundr! \n\nThe god reveals something interesting, talks about Juno, the sun, gives a means to protect the city and help Iver. But when you return to the city, now the king and rugga and the factions have devolved into fighting based on your choices. How are you going to handle this? Which of many possibilities will ascend to the throne? How will you defend the city? And what mystery lies beneath the mountain of the city...\n\nFor Iver's caravan, there should be pockets of dredge villages kept alive by Spellsingers. Now you need to decide to plunder them or not! More stuff to do! Maybe go to the remains of the Varl capital first? Fight warped Valka? Realize deceptions, machinations, corruption, hear stories? Find new characters, have old ones die?\n\nInstead there... wasn't a plot?[/i]",

      "EDIT: I nominated this game for game of the year (2023)\n\nLong ago I had heard about this game and how detailed and intricate it could be, and how you could spend hours upon hours building the massive empire of dwarves only for it to all come crashing down in some spectacular but unforeseen way.  Then I got into Rimworld briefly and thought it was ok, but it tended toward chaos a bit too much for my liking.  THEN I heard this game was coming to steam and I eagerly awaited it.\n\nIt's not necessarily that I was too good to play a game with mostly ascii/character graphics (I used to play them a lot back in the 1980s).  I was more intimidated by the depth of the game and not knowing if there was a wiki for it (there is) or how I'd find help if I needed it (I'm sure there's a ton of communities JUST for this game).  I expected that when it came to Steam, it'd be beefed up and worth the wait.\n\nWell it finally arrived and I think I'm STILL a bit intimidated by the sheer amount of options you have... mostly because it's not just me that I have to worry about, but a whole community of dwarves.  In the case of something like minecraft, I could dig a whole intricate tunnel and if stuff starts to go bad, I just high-tail it out of there and recover until I can go back and finish it.  In Dwarf Fortress though, if stuff starts to go bad, you can't just leave.  You are encouraged to deal with the adversity and push onward in the name of greatness... or something.\n\nIn a way it's like role playing, except you don't have to roll character sheets and you don't really control any of the characters directly.  You make decisions about where to mine, what trees to chop down, what to build, what to trade, what to plant, and for every thing there is a season (turn turn turn).  You're forced to deal with death, birth, attacks, sickness, madness, and a ton of other things that I have no idea are coming.  \n\nI keep thinking \"I could do better\" and I start a new game, but then I start to realize that no matter what I do, I'm never gonna have a perfect game, or a game where everything goes exactly according to plan.  I am eventually going to have to buckle down and stick to one game save to see it through.\n\nIf you're like me and starting something new holds a lot more interest than continuing an existing project (ADHD?) you may have difficulty with this game.  At the same time you may become so engrossed in it that you lose track of time and suddenly it's 6am and you wonder why you stayed up all night digging holes.  I'm starting to feel a bit of the madness myself.  (it's almost 4:30am as I write this)\n\nIn any case, it's probably not for everyone, but I'd say if you're unsure, find the non-steam version and try that, and if you can grok what's going on and it interests you, definitely buy this and support the developers... OR buy this and try to stay under the 2 hour refund  limit while you learn the basics (Good luck with that, it'll be 6 hours before you know what happened).  I believe this game is worth the money though (full price).  If you were going to wait for a sale you'd be waiting a long time anyway.  \n\nTL;DR If this looks interesting to you, don't wait! Buy now.  If you aren't sure, do a bit of research and come back and buy it.",

I know that this is a return to old-school maps, made for portable. But coming from World it seems like a massive downgrade\n\n- graphics and ambience downgraded. Again, I know that this is because it's designed for Switch, but it doesn't change the fact that it feels like a huge step backwards\n\n- grapple zip thing. It's flashy and fast, but I felt that it takes a lot away from the methodical feel of the game.

At the end of the day it was a fulfilling experience.\n\nIf you play ME 1-3 I have a couple suggestions. If its your first time don't look up anything online on how to play because it will spoil it. Complete as much content as you possibly can first and then do a 2nd play through to complete what you wish you would have. In the 3rd version bring my boy Javik on most your missions; You wont be disappointed.\n\nBrings a tear to my eye to finish it all the way through for the 3rd time. Really makes me think about a lot.

      "[h1]One of the few multiplayer games that reminds me that people can be amazing[/h1]\n\nI've been playing games for a long time, I've seen some sh*t. I've seen people crumble, I've lost friends, I've watched people eat each other even when they are winning. When people are supposed to be working together and yet they would rather treat their ally like trash because they refuse to take the blame for their own wrongdoing.\n\nSquad is a game in which I have seen true potential. A group of 40 individuals work together to plan, execute, and accomplish masterful plans to outsmart their enemy. I've seen teams rally from the depths of defeat and flip unwinable games into incredible victories. Heros emerging from the storm of mortars landing upon their bunker, to squad leaders risking their own lives to save those of their squad.\n\nSquad is not a game for the light hearted. To enjoy squad to the fulllest, you must communicate, work together, and form a bond with the soldiers at your side. You are a team, you are a unit, and you will never win alone. Be it a medic patching the wounds of your comrades, a logistics driver supplying your team with the supplies they need at the front line, or a squad leader putting the responsibility of 8 individuals on your shoulders, each person is a vital component of the team.\n\nFor this reason, Squad has now become my most played game on steam. The depth, the people, the comraderie, it's an amazing experience that no other game captures. I encourage you all to try it out on a free weekend as I originally did, I have been playing it ever since.\n\nI'll see you on the front line.",

      "Hello Charlotte is not a game; it is a confessional.\nIf you're here you've probably already realized, but I wish to place massive emphasis that Hello Charlotte, and Hello Charlotte 3 especially, has very little gameplay, and what is present is very standard RPGMaker fare. If you are the kind to balk at visual novels, HC3 will not be your cup of tea. Watch a playthrough or something if you're interested, but don't expect any kind of engaging play.\nWith that said: Hello Charlotte 3 (and its DLC, Heaven's Gate) has been one of the most emotional, impactful pieces of art I've ever engaged with. It is horrifically honest, incorrigibly vulnerable, and, as previously stated-- more a confessional than a game. With everything I know how to say and with everything I have to say about it, I cannot find a way to truly articulate what Hello Charlotte made me feel (still makes me feel) and how it has affected me.\n\nHello Charlotte: Childhood's End is from the perspective not of the Charlotte of the previous two games, but a new, blank slate PC. While not necessary to play the previous two games, I strongly recommend it. It develops on the themes of the previous two games, and in doing so, completely recontextualizes them. C and Anri of HC2 return, as does Scarlett, though not in the forms we are accustomed to. We are finally given a full understanding on the nature of Charlotte and the False Realm, and what we are in relation to it.\netherane's art has markedly improved since the second game, with impressive sprite and background artwork, though their style is still recognizable. The music (some composed by etherane, others outsourced) is varied and distinctive. Most prominent about etherane's work, however, are the themes and writing, which have matured considerably since the release of HC2. Though often garish and on the nose, HC3 is a poignant commentary on the nature of art and fiction, the impact we have on one another, and our understanding of realness itself.\nYou will experience confusion. You will experience whiplash. The game intends to make you unsure and uncomfortable in its consumption, <i>deliberately</i> so. In the process it becomes a jarring, distinctive work of art unique to its creator and an important representation of the Millenial psyche. It's a psychological horror game and by God will it force you to experience psychological horror.",
      "When I first heard of Undertale, I had no interest in playing it. I thought the fanbase was massively cringeworthy and the game was probably uninteresting. \nI was correct about the fanbase, but boy was I wrong about the game. \n\nI normally play action/adventure RPG games with the occasional sprinkling of singleplayer FPS. I am not the kind of person to normally go in for conceptual hipster nonsense, and I say that because that's what I thought this game was. \n\nIn reality, it has some of the best atmosphere and writing I've seen in a game in a very long time. And above all else, it manages to be heart-rendingly (no pun indended) sad at times and actually funny at other times. Plus, the music is fantastic and the whole package has a level of care I don't often see anymore. \n\nYou are doing yourself a disservice if you don't try this game out. And I don't say that lightly. \n\nStory/writing: 10\nMusic: 8\nReplay value: 7\nGameplay: 6 for the actual fun of it, but I'll give it a 7 just because of how inventive the mercy system is.

      "After completing every ending, completing the map, and 98%-ing my save file (I'm not going to hunt down whatever miniscule thing is left), I can sum up all my thoughts on the game with one word: Disappointing.\n\nTo go more indepth, as a standalone game, Blasphemous 2 was alright at most. But compared to the first it feels bland and boring in a number of ways. The few NPCs you see are forgettable, the bosses are forgettable, every enemy feels the exact same. \n\nThe executions, which felt like such a large part of the charm of Blasphemous 1's combat, are practically gone- not only do they happen much less often but there's almost no uniqueness to them, with nearly every enemy having the same animation. While in B1 there were 16 different executions (18/19 if you count certain bosses), B2 has.. 4 or 5 different executions? \n\nIt feels like they give no depth to anyone you meet, friend or foe, nearly all of them being left a complete mystery with not even a single sentence talking about who or what they are. Even the Penitent One feels bland, having gone from a brutal, unstoppable force hell-bent on reaching his goal no matter what, to some unremarkable silent protagonist who kills some things.\n\nThe world and its areas felt boring, less like an actual world and more like a jumble of random locations stacked like tetris blocks. The way the enemies were tossed into them makes them feel like they were all pre-made assets and they had to think of where they fit best, and the result was almost none of them fitting in with where you see them.\n\nEverything felt far too easy, far beyond the point of getting used to the gameplay and learning from the first game. Bosses especially were disappointing, all having too little health, and it felt like only a single boss in the entire game had more than three attacks. \n\nThe rewards for quests and secrets were unfulfilling and unsatisfying, whether it was giving a character an item that was obviously meant for them or slowly searching across every little corner of the whole map for tiny secrets you missed. \n\nThe endings especially were a huge disappointment, and they made it feel like everything leading up to them was entirely a waste of time and effort and took away what little enjoyment was left.\n\nEverything about Blasphemous 1 that made it unique- the worldbuilding, the gameplay, the artstyle and animations- feels like it's all been stripped away and we were left with this generic metroidvania that only vaguely resembles its predecessor.\n\nI [b]loved[/b] Blasphemous, it was and still is one of my all time favourite games, but I really can't say I liked Blasphemous 2. If you loved Blasphemous 1 I would honestly advise against playing this, the whole experience is such a letdown that it's hard to not have the first game spoiled simply by what comes after it. If you don't care, or you haven't played the first yet, then at the very least wait until there's a good sale before trying.",

This is the Megaman successor we've been waiting for.\n\nIf I had to say anything negative about it, it'd be the music. It's mediocre at best. It's Meh. It does its job and fills dead air, but I'm not rushing to download the OST any time soon. I can't think of a single track that I went \"wow I need that\" for.

      "In my ongoing and likely futile effort to write a Steam review for every game in my library (#21 out of 500+)... it's time for Trails in the Sky: The 3rd.\n\nIf you haven't played both Trails in the Sky and Trails in the Sky SC, go away. This game is not for you.\n\nIf you have played the Trails in the Sky duology, you're almost certainly going to buy this game no-questions asked. Which is fine. Clearly you are a person of impeccable taste and judgment. There are, however, a few things you should probably be aware of before you dive it.\n\nThe 3rd is not really an indpendent game in its own right--it's more of a Gaiden game. It functions mostly as an extended epilogue to the classic Trails in the Sky duology, while also laying down the foundations for future story arcs (upon which much has been built in the Crossbell and Erebonia sequences).\n\nThe game is effectively divided into three kinds of content: lots of dungeon crawling; mostly indpendent character scenes (taking the form of flashbacks) featuring familiar characters from the prior two Sky games; and mini-games! The dungeon-crawling is fairly generic, as the combat system here is more or less the same as in the prior games, and many of the environments you'll be exploring are the exact *same* environments you explored back in FC and SC. There are some new areas to explore, but not many, and personally I found them too abstract to be very interesting. The mini-games are extremely varied and range from incredibly tedious (playin' poker with Gambler Jack) to the amazing (airship shmup!), and can be a lot of fun. The real meat of the game are the character vignettes, all of which are--at the very least--amusing. If you're here, you've likely already fallen in love with these characters, and you'll be glad to know that everyone gets their time in the spotlight here, and the character writing is as strong as ever.\n\nThat said, not everything is sunshine and roses.There is a \"present\" story arc tying all of those flashbacks, dungeons and mini-games together. and... there's no getting around it: it's not very good. The story is short and relatively predicable, with little dialog and less exposition. Our new protagonist, Kevin Graham, performs solidly here--but fails to be quite as interesting as he was in SC--and his lovely lady heroine, Ries Argent, is among the least compelling characters in the entire Trails pantheon, owing mostly to her lack of screenstime. She is absent from entire swaths of the game, and despite her enormous potential, simply does not get sufficient dialog to properly develop. She really only interacts with Kevin, infrequently, and is isolated from the rest of the cast.\n\nUtlimately Trails in the Sky: The 3rd is a bit underwhelming. It's a fun romp, but it could have been so much better with a little more focus on the narrative. The absence of NPCs to talk to, the simplistic structure of the plot, and the underdeveloped heroine are all flaws that are difficult to dismiss.",

      "I hated Undertale.\n\nIt was, pretty clearly, a game about sexy skeletons. I did not care about sexy skeletons. I refused to play a game about sexy skeletons.\n\nThen my friend made me listen to the soundtrack, and I decided I could deal with a few hours of sexy skeletons if I got to listen to the best video game music I had ever heard while doing it. \n\nI played Undertale. It's not a game about sexy skeletons. It's a game about choices, maybe, or morality, or curiosity. It's a game about pushing the limits. It's a game about experiences, about \"what would happen if I did this?\", about storytelling so intricate and complex and raw that it shouldn't be able to fit into seven hours of bullet hell and pixel graphics. But, somehow, it does. Every choice you make has an impact. Every object you check has a story. The soundtrack, the witty yet profound writing, the simple pixel graphics, and even the menu screens and bullet patterns themselves all intertwine in order to tell a story that only you decide the ending of.\n\nAlso, the skeletons aren't even sexy.\n\nMy advice to you: Go in as blind as you can. Don't read walkthroughs. Don't watch playthroughs. Don't prepare yourself. Don't even look at overviews. Hell, don't even read the Steam page description.

      "This is easily one of the funniest games I played in 2017.  In the 20 hours it took me to solve it the first time, I pretty much did nothing else until I had finished it, despite the fact that I was supposed to be studying.\n\nThe game is set in absurd western themed world where humour is so baked into the fabric of everything that there is virtually nothing that isn't some kind of joke.  This could easily fall flat if it were poorly written, but I found the writing to be fantastic.  Obviouslly humour is subjective so if you aren't onboard with it's humour you proably won't get much out of it.  For everyone else you are due for a hell of a ride as the game is an absolute hoot.\n\nThe game takes place in a kind of openinsh world with your character setting out from a location on their horse. You can either select to \"Wander\" in which case you will make a broad loop out and around, potentially unovering new map locations or encountering a random encounter.  You can also direct travel to locations you have found and will also be told about map locations from NPC's or as the outcomes of various quests.    The world is feels quite expansive with a lot of interesting locations to explore.  There are a couple of central plot quests to pursue and a bunch of side quests as well.  In my 20 hour playthrough I managed to complete the main story but still had a few side things Id managed to miss all the clues for.\n\nCombat in the game takes place in a turn based format that should feel familiar to anyone has played a JRPG before.  You stand on one side, your foes tand on the other and you select your various attacks and abilities from a list specific to each characters class.  As you gain XP  you can choose what skills you buy so you can tailor your character to your play style, with higher skill levels costing increasing amounts of XP.  You can further personalise your character with a swathe of various equiment, almost all of which is humorous and absurd.  The combat is not particularly complex but its good enough and the humour is so good that it really does the heavy lifting for keeping you engaged.\n\nAs you can see from the screenshots the graphics portray everything in stick figures, but everything is surpisingly detailed and the great animation and the little touches really add to the charm of world.  A still screenshot doesn't really do justice to how much fun this game is to see in motion.\n\nThe music and sound are suprisingly good too, with twangy guitars and banjos mixed with good old time whistling and other wild west sounding stuffness.  Once again is better than you have any right to expect from such an overtly daft title and between the lively graphics and relelentless humour It's just another layer of polish to draw you into the games odd version of the wild west.\n\nLook I flat out loved this game. It was a delight. As I said, your milage may vary if the humour doesn't tickle your funny bone but I can tell you now, never have I laughed so hard at a game as I did digging through the spitoons in West of Loathing.\n\nGold.\n\n9 out of 10",

      "Ahh, CrossCode.\nLet's start this review with what this game does right.\n\nPros:\nEverything. There review is complete. But on a serious note I'll elaborate.\n\nThis game starts out very generically. You got an amnesia stricken heroine. You got fairly archetypal characters. The story is the typical trying to figure out your past. But it's not. I lied about all that, that only covers the first 10-15 hours then you see drastic changes in the pace and tone. The story turns out to be well done, not the best, but enjoyable. 8/10 for story and characters.\n\nLet's talk about gameplay. It's perfect, seriously. The pacing of combat is fairly quick. There's a decent variety of enemy types which nearly all of them have some sort of unique trait. Your skill set leaves you with a lot of variety and different tools to take on different situations. I have yet to get bored of it, despite the fact combat isn't inherently profitable for most of the game. Puzzles. You have timing puzzles, logic puzzles, memory puzzles, enemy based puzzles. It's all there. It's all enjoyable. They're quite varied, no two puzzles feel the same. This game has over 200 'maps'. And just about every 'map' has a puzzle or two (optional or not). Ez 10/10.\n\nArt design. I'm a sucker for 16 and 32 bit graphics. The level designer, this guy made the game. He created some beautiful and interconnected maps with nearly everything having purpose. In all honesty, I have never seen design quality this high, it even beats out SquareSoft games (you know before they became that crappy company that is SE). 10/10 again.\n\nCharacter design. It works. Not the best. Not bad. The characters look the way they should. Lukas' nose drives me crazy, it's huge. But Holiday Man is solid. 7/10.\n\nMusic. Some of it's great. Some of it annoyed ME (but I'm picky). They stayed true to what they were trying to make. But it's obvious their composer was no Yasunori Mitsuda. But still, what I enjoyed, I really enjoyed. 8/10.\n\nDid I enjoy it? Every single minute of it. Even when I was confused. \"I WILL figure this puzzle out.\" 35/40, based off my personal taste, but CrossCode is as damn near perfect as you can get.",

So there is no need to fret if you die after doing something important.\n\nI also got to use the stat system a lot today, and man, it reminds me of Dark Souls. If you die, you leave behind your salt, and you have to go back to collect it. Once you do, you can, of course, use it to buy upgrades from the tents for your character. Which is a nice way to choose how you want your character to grow. I like when my healing potions heal a lot, for example, instead of having a lot of base hp right from the start.

      "Something I've been needing to get off my chest, despite how much maxis and EA go on about how much they care for the LGBTQ community, it's clear to me that they don't. First if they did they wouldn't be pushing the community the whey and as hard as they have. When things get pushed like they are, hateful people just harden there harts more, and just become infuriated. The sympathetic the become hatful towards it. The more something gets pushed, after awhile the more it gets hatted. A better approach would be, (if they really did care,) would be to put what they are talking about into a FREE pack, and get people whom make amazing custom content to contribute to it. If there is enough nice stuff in the pack people will download it, and talk people whom are on the fence to download it, and maybe to come over, and might start to get the people on the other side to at least get on the fence. That whey the LGBTQ community would get there representation, and acceptance would be pushed in a whey that won't burn people out.\n\n\nAnother resin why they should do it like this, and is part of why people are getting mad, is that they bought this game a certain whey, paid a lot for it and it's DLC, now they are changing, it and braking it to do so. Changing the experience against there will. Evan something you love like chocolate, or bacon, or anything will become something you hate if it's shoved down your throat ageist you will. If you want people to take it just offer it, most of the time people will take it. And if they don't just make it just make it more appealing. IE instead of braking the main game to add something even the LGBTQ community can't enjoy with a broken game. Make a free pack, and to tempt more people to get the pack, just add more nice CAS and build mode stuff. And maybe update the pack and add more stuff to it every once in awhile.\n\n\nI just had to say this for two resins, one companies being this careless or ignorant is just killing the public sentiment for LGBTQ and similar groups. And two, they are just killing interest in what they are selling, it will cut the Sims 4's life short, and will cut the Sims 5's life much, much sorter. \nIt's good to give options, as long as they are options. Or you are just like Hennery Ford, “The people can have the model T in any color! so long as it's black.”\n",
      "I hated Undertale.\n\nIt was, pretty clearly, a game about sexy skeletons. I did not care about sexy skeletons. I refused to play a game about sexy skeletons.\n\nThen my friend made me listen to the soundtrack, and I decided I could deal with a few hours of sexy skeletons if I got to listen to the best video game music I had ever heard while doing it. \n\nI played Undertale. It's not a game about sexy skeletons. It's a game about choices, maybe, or morality, or curiosity. It's a game about pushing the limits. It's a game about experiences, about \"what would happen if I did this?\", about storytelling so intricate and complex and raw that it shouldn't be able to fit into seven hours of bullet hell and pixel graphics. But, somehow, it does. Every choice you make has an impact. Every object you check has a story. The soundtrack, the witty yet profound writing, the simple pixel graphics, and even the menu screens and bullet patterns themselves all intertwine in order to tell a story that only you decide the ending of.\n\nAlso, the skeletons aren't even sexy.\n\nMy advice to you: Go in as blind as you can. Don't read walkthroughs. Don't watch playthroughs. Don't prepare yourself. Don't even look at overviews. Hell, don't even read the Steam page description. Just buy the game (and give some well-earned money to a little white dog), and, as it were, climb the mountain yourself. Don't let anyone backseat. Don't listen to people who tell you there's a right way to play.\n\nAnd when you think you've reached the end, just think--what other choices could you have made?\n\nSo, yes.

      "Great game... who need 1 or 2 years of development. tl;dr: mid game turn into a micromanagment hell.\n\nThe game is fantastic until a certain point. You start as a mercenary, one party, 50-150 soldiers doing missions, small battles or bigger fights joining armies. Good graphics, brutal engagments with 200-1000 units at the same time if your computer can handle, playing as a soldier is a blast.\n\nThe problems start when you get a few towns and a bigger family, the micromanagement never stops and gets worse overtime. You have to physically move your party to towns to fix their issues. When your lords get captured & escapes, they'll go into a random town until you pick em again, then you'll have to reform the party. Same with caravanes for trading, if they get captured, you'll have to go in his town and recreate the caravan. You have to partially fill towns with soldiers, manually, from your own soldiers. All the little fun things of the beginning soon become a hassle, as you can't delegate. Messengers are not a thing.\n\nYou can't manage a town at a distance, you can't tell a party member to move to a location or guard a territory, they do whatever they want if they're out of your army / party, so you have to do it yourself. Either you're leading your huge army to fight what is basically an enless war mid game, or you take care of your cities while the rest of your faction fight... with various success. Some commanders are pretty good, other will throw waves of recruits at highly trained arbalists in the open backed with cavalry. Protip: don't be a recruit in an imperial army.\n\nYou can't tell a party you created to guard an area or to kill all bandits attacking your villagers, it's up to you, or the IA if it feel like it. Worst, if you let the parties you created roam around (parties = group of 70-200 soldiers under a lord) they can be (temporarily) drafted in other armies of your kingdom... and you'll have to physically move to the army, talk to the leader and pay some reputation to get them back. Of course, large armies are slow. This leads the the next problem, swarms.\n\nMy worst fear is not a massive army, it's an army disbanded in the middle of my territory. The small parties usually start raiding all villages in the vicinity while being too fast to be catched by a big army. Raided villages impact your town / castle loyalty and gold quite heavily. Sure, you could disband your army and hunt them yourself... but that makes you take a step back, and all your parties would reform under another army you can't control. And man, some army commanders are really, really stupid. Verdun style charge in the open against walls of archers, cavalry in a forest vs pikemens, you name it. I can't count the time i had parties wiped in someone else army. But let's say you managed to capture the lords burning your villages.\n\nThe capture system is broken. Captured lords escape A LOT. I had some escape 20 seconds after being captured. They never stay in a jail for more than a few in game days. Once they escape, they magically teleport to their hometown, rebuild a fast 80 mens army in the blink of an eye and go back to raiding villages. AI \"cheat\" with recruits, they will always find soldiers in town, even if they're empty for you. Executions you say?\n\nIf you execute a lord, no matter how much of an A-hole he/she is, the whole faction will hate you. He raided dozens of villages and killed hundreds of peasants? Still not good enough. You just can't kill a lord without suffering heavy consequences down the line, and you'll need those lords to be friendly later. Worth to mention, capturing the leader of a faction won't stop a war.\n\nLast - peace / war is on/off. I had 600 days of continuous war, followed by 600 days of complete peace in the entire map (due to a bug apparently), and i'm now back at 300 days of war. Not a single day of peace, when one war stop another start immediatly. They will just never, ever stop fighting. Can't catch a breath, can't leave the front of your lose towns.\n\nOh and the main quest randomly failed after 875 days or so.\n\nI would still recommand the game, it's really fun for a while but it need a HUGE QoL update.\n",
      "Alright. Time for a review.\n\nThe launch on this game has been absolutely horrible. Day-zero patch, day-one patch, none of 'em did nothing. My rig is running a 10-series i9 and a 4090 Suprim X GPU. Along with 64 GB ram that should be more then enough. However, it was not. Frames between 10 and 30 fps, with a resting 30-40 when in smaller areas, has been quite common for me. As others have noted, the framedrops appeared to happen when changing \"zones\" in maps, and not when there are many enemies, demanding light-sequences, etc. This made my initial experience a living nightmare, as some fights especially are depending on quick reactions. Try quicktiming a block with 10 fps.\n\nThis has been my experience, and it was horrible. I stared off into the sunset. I cried. I questioned my existence. I murdered people (in real life, as i couldn't kill anything in-game). Until 2 hours ago. Because then, a wild 3,3 GB patch appeared.\n\nThe game is now running smoothly at 150 fps. I have no lag whatsoever when changing zones or being in separation areas, and no issues with combat. Finally the game runs as it should. The story is great, gameplay is better. Combat is more immersive and diverse, and somehow the creators made the game in a way that gives you a ton of new skills and equipment as you play, while still letting you start off with the stuff you had in Fallen Order. Its legendary.\n\nThat sound too good to be true? Well, it kinda is, in a way. Cause i have one more thing to add. People have been reporting game crashes. I have had a total of two crashes in 19 hours, until this patch appeared. Now I've had 9 crashes in 19 minutes. However, the reason I'm saving this for last and don't really care that much is that the crashes are completely connected the archive base on Jedha. This is a small area, and not one you have to spend much time in.  It is, however, quite critical when you do have to go there. As things stand now, i have to reboot the game once or twice to get in, deliver a quest and get back out again. The crashes always happen upon entering or exiting the area, not while inside. So until they fix that... well. I can deal with that.\n\nAll in all, it's a great game, and if you're way too obsessed with this game the way that I am, i'd chance buying it now :) If you have self-control (self-respect...?) you might want to wait a bit more, but I'm pretty confident that the next patch will fix the remaining serious issues for most people.\n\nTLDNR: Game bad then.

      "The Swords of Ditto has all the elements needed to be a fantastic game. The world design and art is delightful, the combat is fine, the weapons are fun and interesting, and the world generation is surprisingly solid.\n\nUnfortunately, some poor design choices kill the pacing.\n\nEvery time you die, you need to go through the same tedious routine. Listen to the guide character slowly talk to you, slowly run through a handful of empty screens, grab your sword, stop in town to check in and get your bearings, then grind up enough experience killing random bad guys with just your generic sword until you can start the first dungeon.\n\nOnce you finish the first dungeon and get a special weapon, that's when the game really comes into its own and starts feeling fun. But it just takes way too long to get to that point. While the sword is fine, being stuck with only it over and over again for long periods of time just isn't very exciting. The game's time limit itself isn't a problem, just that you spend so much of each 'life' building up to the good part. \n\nThe game tries to alleviate that problem by having two currencies. One lets you buy stuff for your current life, and the other lets you keep things for your next life. The problem is, you accumulate these currencies way too slowly and they carry over from one life to the next. Consequently, you CAN start with a bunch of advantages, but it feels like it's a huge investment. And if you screw up, that means you'll have to spend another few lives pretty much just grinding up currency to get another shot at a 'good' life.\n\nThese problems end up creating an experience that's just way too repetitive and tedious to recommend.\n\n\nPerhaps what's most frustrating, though, is that there are simple solutions to these problems. If the game simply made accumulating currency much faster and NOT carry over to the next life (thus encouraging you to spend it regularly on fun upgrades and be able to start each life with a special weapon) and did away with having to grind to start the first dungeon, it would be great! Honestly, that's really the only change needed to make this game great.\n\nIf there was ever a game that should have spent a couple months in Early Access before releasing, this was it. I sincerely hope the devs tweak the pacing and I can come back in a few months and turn this review positive.",
      "[h1] 8.5/10 [/h1]\n\n[b] Please note that The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles is a very independent entry in the Ace Attorney series in terms of plot. Even if you have not played any of the Ace Attorney titles before, it will not affect your understanding of the game's plot. [/b]\n\nThis courtroom text adventure game in late 19th century Japan and British have a lot of features, even with the previous Ace Attorney works are very different. With the detailed character costumes and backgrounds, the strong sense of history and atmosphere, the majestic music, and excellent characterization, along with the game's detailed 3D character animation, players can experience an unprecedented adventure. In the plot, The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles presents a layer-by-layer, cocooning type of plot development, each chapter of the story is closely linked, and ambiguous, no chapter is meaningless, and in the final unraveling of all the mystery, the feeling of shock and excitement brought to the player is unprecedented in any text adventure game.\n\nThe reviews of The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles tend to be polarized, and not without reason. The progression of the plot brings with it an overwhelming lack of tension in the first and middle stages of the game. The design of many of the cases in the game seems rather undisciplined, neither interesting nor deep... The Great Ace Attorney: Adventure, as the first half of the game, though the development of the subsequent plot paved a lot of ambushes, the design of the plot and puzzles makes it less interesting and often difficult to motivate players to continue playing. The climax of the game comes too late, whether the player can persist to this point is a huge problem. At the same time, the Steam version of the game globally locks 30 frames, and can not set the Japanese voice is also a very huge drawback, and very damaging to the player's gaming experience.\n\nThe quality of The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles is actually not that bad. But this can only be concluded after you have experienced the entire game in its entirety... And I think this is actually the biggest drawback of this game because the ability to keep the player until the climax of the plot is the biggest pain point of this work. If you are very patient, love the Ace Attorney series, and love the suspenseful story of players, then The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles will not let you down. If you do not have any of the above elements, perhaps The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles will not give you a memorable experience.",
      "TL;DR: This game didn't receive a similar love and praise than Undertale because potato. Play it.\n\n------\n\nIf you're reading this, I already like you and I already think you have a good taste in videogames.\n\nOneShot is one of those little surprises you might have heard of but always keep pushing onto your backlog, assuming other games should have more priority. Eventually I decided to try it out and it took just a few minutes to regret all those delays.\n\nIt is extremely hard to give you some useful information about OneShot without spoiling the heck out of it. You start the game in a dark, small bedroom where the main character (Niko) simply wakes up. That's it. By simply walking around and interacting with elements you soon get some clue of the mechanics that will be present through the whole game and how to progress. \n\nAnd you will also see why this game is special. \n\nWhat the game attempts is probably not new to you. It has constant elements of surprise but many other titles (Undertale as the easiest example) have done so too. When the idea is saturated, it gets harder to eventually fulfill its purpose and, well, surprise the player. \n\nOneShot is the game that will surprise you no matter what. \n\nThrough a simplistic but engaging plot, amazing and memorable soundtrack, and interesting dialogues you'll get yourself into a journey you won't regret. I wish I could give you more details but like many other reviews here, I feel like I would ruin the experience for you.

      "How is this game so damned good?\nAnd for 3 bucks.\n\nVampire Survivors is setting a new bar for value in gaming. $70 for a new AAA game? Pfft. I think not. Not when games like Vampire Survivors are available.\n\nIt is fully functional on the Steam Deck.\n\nThis is an RPG Auto-battler enemy hell (bullet hell). You control the progression and pathing of your character, the game handles the actual combat, making for a near perfect synergy between game and gamer.\n\nThere are currently four main maps and then a bunch of specialty maps, one of which was almost definitely designed specifically to help you expedite your unlocks. Each has its own unique theme.\n\nUnlocks are the progression system in this one, and it works. Accomplishing almost any unique task or reaching certain levels will unlock the next things in line. However, character unlocks have an additional cost in gold (acquired in game). Similarly, permanent character boosts can be unlocked and all characters receive the benefits of all unlocks. There are even more things to unlock veyond those, and everything not only feels practical, but have a noticeable affect on gameplay.\n\nYou'd think that it being an enemy (read: bullet) hell, and with an array of abilities at your disposal, the screen would fill up quickly, and it does, but somehow, the devs managed to make your avatar noticeable and trackable no matter how high the screen chaos gets.\n\nSpeaking of which, for lofi graphics, these are just flat out cool. Again, it just works. The soundtrack mirrors this, and you'll be able to switch between tracks as you please. Additionally, I find this is a great game to play while jamming your own tunes.\n\nIn my opinion, the value at 3 bucks and the huge amount of gameplay variety make this a no brainer. You get far less from any number of full priced AAA titles. AND...the game hasn't even concluded development yet. What other surprises do the devs have in store, I wonder?\n\n[code]If you found this review helpful and would be interested in supporting my Curator group, it would be appreciated. Cheers.\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/curator/32549618/[/code]",
      "First, there was Guitar Hero. Now you've got Guitar Nero. \n\nIt's wild that this came out of nowhere, because this is easily one of the best games I've ever played. This is what I've been waiting for rhythm games to be like since Space Channel 5 on Dreamcast.",
      "I was waiting to be a bit further into the game to give my thoughts on some of the early complaints I've seen cropping up around this game.\n\nFrankly I do not think this game will be for everyone, but some of the people leaving negative reviews are morons.\n\nNo progression in this game is not locked behind story progress. There are several ways the game marks player progression, and while story progression is one of them. The reward track, gear, and gems are the other. You can consider all of this side-content in some way. You mostly make additional progress through exploration and side quests in this game. Each time you enter a new area you're given several tasks on a reward track that allow you to gain SP to level up your skills, and the reward material that allows you to learn new skills. As you learn new skills your character's stats go up. Exploration and sidequests also allow you to gain unique materials that you sell to merchants that open up deals that allow you to buy high level equipment that give large power boosts to your party. The gem system allows you to slot  gear with upgrades to further customize your characters, and all weapons/armor are able to be upgraded twice.\n\nIf you go out of your way to find the hidden treasures, beat the unique monsters, and finish side quests you can sort of trounce the challenges in this game. Class Emblems which give 'very' large power boosts are also hidden out of the way sometimes. You really just have to search for them, but by no means are they necessary.  I have had no difficulty at all in this game. It's relatively easy to grasp, but it does ask you to pay attention a little more than most JRPGs. If you interact with the systems the game has then the progression curve is smooth. If you don't -- that's not really the game's fault.\n\nOn the subject of the Overdrive Bar. Once you get into it the upper left corner will ask you to use a SINGLE move to help maintain the bar. It will ask you to use either: A physical attack, magic attack, buff, debuff, or utility spell. It is not hard to throw in one of these during the party's turn, and you very much can spam moves over and over again. The system is not at all that obtrusive, again, you just have to pay attention. \n\nIf for some reason all of this is not good enough for a player on a baseline level. There are accessibility options that allow you to adjust how aggressive enemies are, how high their stats are, and you can even make the overdrive bar extremely more forgiving. \n\nThe world is well crafted, the story is fine thus far, the combat is fun and it does try some new things. I certainly appreciate the experience for what it is. The price they're charging for this game feels absolutely criminal, and there's clearly a lot of love put into it. Give it a shot.",
      "Plays and looks just like the Park Ranger and Cruise Director HOG series, if you enjoyed those then you will likely enjoy this series. Game is composed of hidden object scenes and simple puzzle transitions that have a loose story to bridge the movement between them. The hidden object scenes follow an older couple as they take their grandchildren to a variety of European counties on their vacation, they sprinkle in a few interesting facts between each location. There are collectibles in each scene along with a raccoon. I overall enjoyed it for a laid back experience and the weirdly fun photostock based scenes. It took me about 2.5 hours to play through the game along with the bonus scenes/puzzles.",
      "One of the best platformer/Beat-them-up just got upgraded. new attacks, new enemies, new bosses, new levels, new modes, new skins and a graphical improvement, this is really worth getting if you didn't play the original version. if you have the original you get a 66% discount which is good but i still think it should be an optional DLC that sells for 2 Dollars. of course i understand many people won't buy it because they played the original and they shouldn't buy it, but as for me its just that i wanted a reason to replay Guacamelee again so i bought this.",
      "Not really that great of a game. It's fairly unengaging, very slow paced, impossible boss fights just a few hours in. Unless you like games that requre hours of picking plants to craft potions you rub on your sword to give you 3 minutes of attack boost to be able to do any damage, side quest grinding, boring activites, and the general RPG stat grinding, skip this one and just get the Witcher 3 which is a game magnitudes better. CD Projeck Red really made the Witcher and Withcer 2 for the hardcore RPG fans. The experience just isn't worth the time investment on this one in my opinion. Not going to finish it and just go enjoy the third game instead.\n\nEDIT: \nTR;DR: A mediocre hack-n-slash that has been dummed down from the predeccesor for consoles.",

      "What starts as a simple game of jumping over some spikes quickly becomes something so much more. Geometry dash is like Minecraft. No matter how many times you quit, you always come back to it (as you can see by my 700 hours of playtime). For $3.99 you get such an amazing and memorable experience. This game tests your patience and persistence. It tests your emotions. It encourages you to push yourself, overcoming challenges you once thought impossible.\n\n(SHORT ANSWER)\nGet this game.",
      "I really liked the concept of this game of navigating through orbits to collect crates and then successfully landing on the exit.  However, there just isn't enough content to justify it being sold as a complete product, especially at its current price of $6.99.  You see everything there is in the first couple of levels.  No new mechanics are added to the game as you progress.  The developer admits that the game is too simple and the fix was to add artificial difficulty to make the game longer.  For instance, rather than have intuitive controls using toggles, it requires the player to activate thrusters with one hand and turn them off with another.  The level design stops adding anything new and just adds more tedious narrow paths that must be navigated rather than an actual challenge or puzzles.  Finally, the DLC appears to be “pay to win” rather than getting any new content, it just gives the player access to aircraft that should be included already in the game.  By level 9 it is near impossible to progress any further with the default ship as it cannot accelerate fast enough to get through the small orbit and requires purchasing the DLC to advance the level.",
      "I've been completely in love with this game ever since the Mojam prototype \"Wasteland Kings\" was released. It's an insanely fun, fastpaced \"roguelike-like\" or \"roguelite\" with randomly generated worlds and tons of weapons to find. On top of that, the developers stream the development of the game on tuesdays and thursdays over at Twitch and they release updates to the game every week. To me, this is the best game of its kind and I've put tons of hours into mastering it (and I still die. Often. It's difficult okay?).",
      "In life, failure is as inevitable as success – this is the underlying principle of great puzzle games. You're equipped with all the tools you need to succeed and it's your responsibility to utilize them effectively to achieve the goals set before you.\n\nHUMANITY places you in control of a luminous Shiba Inu, tasked with guiding hordes of people towards a light that transports them into the unknown. The game unfolds like a series of puzzle boxes, each with a fundamental set of rules: shepherd your humans to the light, prevent them from falling from great heights, and use the provided tools to avert their untimely demise. If navigating the crowds from point A to point B wasn't challenging enough, the game rewards your efforts to collect Goldys – the epitome of human accomplishment – which in turn unlock progress and assistive tools for easier puzzle-solving.\n\nInitially, the toolset is simple, with arrows for direction and commands to jump. These rudimentary tools soon amalgamate into a complex web of commands, making the gameplay increasingly intricate. It would be easy to liken HUMANITY to Lemmings, but doing so would disregard the platform challenges that uniquely define this game. As a player, you'll find yourself questioning how to access certain areas of a level to place commands and realizing that the stream of people you're guiding are also instrumental in your own journey.\n\nThe tranquil aesthetics of HUMANITY are a signature of the team behind Tetris Effect, Child of Eden, Lumines, and REZ. Coupled with the pseudo-futuristic techno music, these visuals create an immersive and cohesive experience, reminiscent of an interactive design studio’s portfolio. The game's sleek aesthetics provide a calming backdrop for the perplexing trials that await you.\n\nThe crafting of a good puzzle game demands talented designers capable of devising some of the most challenging levels. HUMANITY embraces this notion by enabling anyone to create and share their levels, ensuring a constant influx of new challenges from the community.\n\nFans of games like Portal, Baba is You, The Witness, or The Talos Principle will find HUMANITY an easy recommendation. As with those games, failure is not a dead end; instead, it forms part of the learning process propelling you towards success.\n\nHUMANITY is a true Goldy of puzzle games. Underneath its engaging gameplay, it communicates a deeper message – one that resonates with its players, and, much like its puzzles, equips you with enough tools to reach your own conclusions.\n",
      "I am a Filthy Casual (tm) who plays games like Mass Effect and Fallout 4 on easy and still die over and over. I got my \"you died\" achievement in Dark Souls 2 before the tutorial and stopped playing after like forty minutes with zero qualms. I have rage quit every single platformer game I have ever touched, and just sort of despise brutally hard things that feel like chores.\n\nBasically, I am not exactly sure why I decided to buy Dead Cells in the first place. Sure, I love the look and one of the few platformers I've ever 100%'d was Super Metroid (with a LOT of swearing and rage quitting), so 'Metroidvania' is an appealing term to me, but it is still inherently marketed as a game that is not for me, or people like me.\n\nThis game is hard. I have 11 hours on it and I can't get past the third area on any given path. I die for stupid reasons and lose all my stuff and... I don't care. I haven't rage quit once; in fact, I have to force myself away from the game after a death so I can do things like eat. I find the combat engaging and entertaining, the progression satisfying and there's something really solid about being forced to start from square one (ish) every single time, in a way I've just never experienced.\n\nSo, sure, buy this if you love hard games/Dark Souls/no checkpoint kind of games. Absolutely, I'm pretty sure you've alreeady heard this is likely to be up your alley.\n\nBut even if you're a dirty rotten casual gamer who button smashes in any game approaching action, and panics when the screen flashes red around the edges... give it a try if you get the opportunity. It is seriously fun.",
      "Upon further play, the game wasn't super luck based, it just doesn't do a great job explaining core mechanics that are crucial to gameplay. It has a more hands off, let the player discover how this works type of playstyle, but a simple line of dialogue alluding to these features would have been nice. That said, the story is really gripping, the gameplay (once learned) is fun, and overall, I definitely think it's worth $20.",
      "At a first glance I thought I would hate [b]Human Fall Flat[/b]. \n“Oh, this is another one of those wonky psychics ragdoll games that are obnoxiously hard to control,” I thought. \n...\nAfter playing it, I can now confidently say that my first impression was spot on. The only surprise was how much I enjoyed playing it. \n \n[h1][u]Positive:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]I can’t fully explain why but I found Human Fall Flat charming. The “human” is adorably simplistic and can complete daunting tasks despite only being able to jump and grab onto things. It reminds me of a very energetic toddler, especially when you raise your arms and jump - [b]it’s so cute[/b]. Something about an awkward “human” taking on challenges makes me feel warm inside [i](is it weird that I feel like I’m watching a baby grow up?)[/i]. \n[*]The levels gradually get larger and the puzzles more complex. I find that this works well with the awkward movements of your character, as you progressively learn how to better control him/her. It’s almost as if you start off as a clumsy baby, learning how to move and perform simple tasks, and end up as an awkward adult, still clumsy but expected to complete harder tasks. \n[*]I’m impressed at how many interactable objects are included in this game. Paired with a pretty good physics engine and you can really have a blast. Swing on a vine like Tarzan? Why not. Row a boat? Sure. Shoot yourself out of a catapult? No one’s stopping you.\n[/list]\n\n[h1][u]Neutral:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]It’s not always clear what you are expected to do, but I guess that’s kind of the point of Human Fall Flat? From what I could tell, you can get past the obstacles in whatever way you like. Sure, there’s the intended way, but if you want you can just climb over things and rush to the end of the level. Or you can just fool around to your heart’s content. It’s essentially one big playground with a goal at the end. \n[/list]\n\n[h1][u]Negative:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]It can be frustrating when things don’t go as you expect. Since your character has the structural rigidity of jelly, you’re constantly battling the floppiness of your character. My advice is: don’t expect to move with precision and you’ll have a good time. I also encountered a few bugs, like my arms or legs getting stuck in an object. Luckily there are many checkpoints and it’s relatively quick to reload.\n[/list]\n \n[h1][u]Conclusion:[/u][/h1]\n[h1]★★★✬☆ Surprisingly fun[/h1]\nI was honestly surprised at how much fun I had playing Human Fall Flat. I tend to avoid ragdoll/physics-y games - Getting Over It, for example, looks like an absolute nightmare to me - but I don’t regret playing Human Fall Flat at all. \nHuman Fall Flat is an absolute blast if you don’t take it too seriously or just like goofing around. I wouldn’t recommend it if you prefer serious games, as it’s very likely that you will just end up getting frustrated. The choice is entirely yours. \n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th][h1]If you enjoyed this review please follow me on my [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/26827738-%27b-Reviews/?appid=241930]curator page[/url] and [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/breviews]group[/url].

      "An instant classic.\n---\n\nThe original [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/kunovega/recommended/264200]One Finger Death Punch[/url] was an unexpected treat for me. The refined simplicity of just two buttons that require masterful timing to create a legitimate fighting experience laid out to a selection of music that reminds you of the classic Kung-fu movies of the 1970's but packaged with a carefree stickman aesthetic.\n\nOne Finger Death Punch 2 is a respectable sequel in most ways. The core gameplay is fundamentally the same while the visual indicators and special attack animations have been upgraded and made more fanciful. Other things are changed simply to give you a new experience.\n\nEvery aspect of the game is polished from the interesting tutorial to the many additional modes (survival, gauntlet, etc.) that exist beyond the (very long) main campaign. Once you get into the groove there's potentially dozens if not hundreds of hours of fun to squeeze from this.\n\nThis is a game that just has to be played to truly appreciate it as the feel of your interaction along with the music is what really defines the experience. Simply watching it or looking at the screenshots doesn't do it justice.\n\nThere are a couple of (minor) controversial changes that may not appeal to some fans:\n1. The music in 2 includes a more modernized remix compared to the more traditional music from 1. Personally I love the soundtracks from both, but there are people who have a preference.\n2. The upgrades to special attacks in 2 can be a bit of visual clutter at times. I like both styles, but there are people who prefer 1 over 2.\n3. There are some sequences (like the lightsword rounds) which did not return in 2, replaced instead by other weapons. While I think it would have been cute to include all of that along with the new stuff, it's not a deal breaker. It does however mean that both games retain a bit of unique flair and a reason for you to play and experience them both. 2 is overall an upgrade, but it's also not a 100% replacement.\n\nI would strongly suggest that if you've never played either game, you should begin with the first one. I think it's a better entry point to the series and might have a slightly broader appeal. (it's also slightly cheaper).\n\nThen if you find yourself enjoying it, come back and pick up 2 and you'll find yourself with some remixed music, fancy new special attack animations and a whole new adventure to work through.\n\nJust to be very clear: Both of these games are fantastic and deserve more praise than I can properly express and I'll very likely be putting 100's of hours into this just like I did the first one.\n---\n\nBottom line: Simple to learn, hard to master, and super satisfying fighting along with a great soundtrack.\n---\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38232109/]While you are here, would you consider following my curator page?[/url]\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/kunovega/recommended/]Want to read all of my reviews and not just the curated ones?[/url]",
      "So this is what upsets me about rainbow six siege as a casual player. I bought the starter edition like a moron. Thats on me. But I wasn't sure I'd like the game. Turns out I do. So now that I realize I like the game I want to fully purchase the game. Turns out you can't upgrade starter to standard. The game legit punishes people who want to play it. Who paid money to basically test if they would enjoy the game.  Why should I pay $55 for a $40 edition? Just let me pay $25 for the $40 edition. I already paid the money. Why are you punishing me for wanting to spend more?",
      "Refunded.\n\nFeels like they released the wrong game files - half the game seems to be broken or missing...\nBasic functions such as zooming in and out, no tutorial, huge amounts of buttons that don't have any impact. Good idea, terrible execution.",
      "Such a neat concept!  Clear the table under so many \"strokes\".  Where it really shines, however, is all of the surreal bits you can add into your game like giant balls, conveyor belts, or balls that split when hit.  The game always has many challenges to complete that will require you to use the indicated table/ball/modifier and meet its requirements on your run (like make 3 long shots in a single run or pot multiple balls in a single shot).  Complete enough of these challenges and you'll unlock the next feature, but the game gives you a lot of freedom in which modifers you'll use in your run to increase your odds of completing the given challenge.",

      "Lemme give it to y'all straight, who are on the fence;\n\n- Yes, the game is very much worth it at full price.\n\n- One of the first games in a long while, that has kept me up until 5 A.M. in the morning, because of how lost I get myself into it.\n\n- Doesn't do dumb jump scares, save for a VERY FEW TIMES, and each one counted.\n\n- The game is maybe one of the best zombie based games out there, so long as you do enjoy it with action.\n\n- Parkour in the game is AMAZING. Sometimes I like just playing the game, so I can run\naround, across roof tops, and attacking zombies while talking to friends.\n\n- Co-op in story mode. Freaking amazing. No dumb lobby. Just click 'Join game' and bam,\nyou'll be thrown a few feet away from a friend without them sometimes even noticing you joined!\n\n- Single play and Co-op have a huge impact; co-op feels fun, slightly safer, and adds a lot in the form of friendly rivals! Single player feels way more tense and everything you do counts, making you second guess some choices, for fear or death. Night time in either mode is fun as heck, though four co-op makes it pretty easy.\n\n- Night and Day feel almost like two different modes. In the day, zombies shuffle around, falling off rooftops, being dumb, easy to avoid and kill. Night time? Get those UV Flares ready, and be ready to flee if they catch sight of you.\n\n- Even after beating the story, I keep coming back for more, as it's super fun.\n\n- Took me around 30 hours to do the story, which also included only HALF of the side missions. Still got a little over 50% left to go, and looking forward to it!\n\nTL;DR - Get the game, find friends to play with, enjoy the hell out of one of the few games worth it at full price.",

      "Why aren't more people playing this? Charming and challenging, and a perfect game for the Steam Deck.",
      "I didn't want to review this until I was completely done. I've now 100%'d the game. Quite simply, I think everyone should play this game! It's perfect for puzzle players with easy and difficult puzzles, most of which feel very satisfying to solve, has fantastic commentary about all of the perspectives of today's society (it's not just a one-sided view!) and is a genuinely well-crafted game.\n\nMost facets of the game are positive so I have to point out the negatives in the game.\n1: There is no save/load system, it's all automatic checkpoints and you have to go and back up the files manually if you want to see the results of different choices.\n2: The choices you can make, or miss, have some light dialog consequences but they occur over many hours of time. This is something I don't really expect from a puzzle game that used to always tell you \"you can return to any place you want at any time.\" In this game, you can't. The time of day and weather of locations can irrevocably change, the ending itself has some major changes, yet there's no way to see it all without replaying the game (a tough pill to swallow for a puzzle game) or watching the results on YouTube. I'm kinda against that sort of thing unless your game can be played multiple times and be different each time, which this won't be, because it's the same puzzles each time.\n3: The engine is Unreal 5 and it's very unfortunate. Although the game may have been easier to develop for multiple platforms in a faster time via doing this, but it has proven that Croteam's old Serious Engine was a much better engine. Unreal 5 has horrible eye adaptation, anti-aliasing, lighting, and geometry options that are all proven to be horrible via this game. Don't get me wrong, the game runs and looks fine for the most part, but all of it could look better and run better had it been built on any other engine. Yes, *any* other engine. I'd sooner have played this on the Source engine. Epic's Lumen and Nanite technology is still too unproven, early, and crappy to be the generational leap they claim to be. I hope the developer can better tune this stuff so players can have better framerates, less ghosting, better lighting, and eliminated distant object pop-in.\n4: The game's pace at the start and end are worse than they could be. The beginning spends too long (and a lot of later optional dialog depends on your exploration of this) in an open world without puzzles while the end has a final puzzle that includes a frustratingly tedious walk-about aspect that needed to be shortcutted somehow. Everything in between (including the breaks you get back in the open world bit) is perfectly crafted and paced, though.\n\nThese things said, I still insist that if you enjoy any form of puzzle game, like Antichamber or Portal, you play this game. You will enjoy it!",
      "It's just generally speaking a very bad game, but it's an interesting tech demo to play for about 10-20 hours and experience the epic fail that it is. Therefore, if you can get this at 15 USD to see for yourself how Bethesda absolutely lost their edge, then you may not regret buying it at that price point.\n\nTrying to play the game seriously is extremely tedious. Fallout 4 is a good game in 2023, but this game is not. Modded Fallout 4 on Survival is way better.\n\nThis game should be called:\n\nThe Elder Scrolls: Tedious Inventory Management Simulator\n\nI bought this for myself as well as a younger relative to impress him with the magic of Bethesda. He played it for 10 hours before cleverly throwing in the towel, while as a loyal fan I stuck it out a bit longer. I wasted about 200 USD on this absolute travesty of a Shit Simulator.",
      "I played the demo and instantly became enamored. The mix of Slay the Spire-style deck-building with elements of the ship combat from FTL: Faster Than Light is an absolutely fascinating mix, and the \"single-axis\" movement system adds a whole extra layer that I've never seen in anything except the Mega Man: Battle Network series.\n\nI bought the full game within the first hour of being available. After having played for nearly 4 hours at the time of writing, my opinion hasn't changed in the slightest. I already love what's available and so far I feel like I've barely scratched the surface.\n\nI can't wait to see what awaits in the future for this awesome title.\n\nEDIT: As a small addition, I will say: I beat my very first run, which is set to the lowest difficulty (Normal). I jumped up to Hard to try to unlock a new ship, and I haven't been able to beat a run since then. It's probably just that I'm bad, all things considered, but be aware that the changes made with difficulty increases are probably more impactful than they may seem.\n\nAlso I wanna say to the devs: thank you for launching the game with mod support and working on making it easier! But also please look into getting Steam Workshop support if you can!",
      "Why did i get this game???\n\nWell.. Mainly because i've always liked seeing those big trucks driving by me, So i wondered what it would feel like driving a big tractor trailer, And so i got this!\n\nHonestly, I can't say if it's anything like a real truck, But this game does get very very complicating when it comes to parking with your 53' container, And it makes me wonder, Wow! Those guys must really have some good practice! Because if i can't do it here, I for sure wont be able to do it in real life! xD\n\nMultiplayer is super fun as well, Driving next to other truck drivers and then honking at them, or meeting new friends, SOME actually truck drivers, and then traveling with them, Stopping to weight your freight, getting gas and such, It's a very fun experience.\n\nHonest Rating: 10/10 As of right now, Because I feel like i haven't played enough to experience any problems or bugs, But the game is very fun!! ***ONLY IF YOU LOVE SIMULATOR GAMES, If you don't, Then maybe think twice, But I enjoy simulator games.*** And if you want to give this game a try as your first Simulator game, Then i would recommend it!\n\nRecommendable? Yes, I recommend it to people who want to give Simulator games a try, This is a perfect one. (Or Euro Truck Simulator) Although if you're from the USA i recommend this one, Because Euro Truck Simulator has different driving rules than US, So you might get tickets for some things you don't know lol..",
      "Undoubtedly one of the best if not THE BEST modern video game remaster out there. I will summarize the pros and cons of this remaster into the following:\n\n[b]The Good:[/b]\n\n- Totally seamless transition into the new modern 4K visual from the old classic Win95 at a push of a key\n- Extremely faithful to the original titles (some might say that it is perhaps TOO faithful)\n- Game \"installation\" screen when you first boot up for both Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert is filled with God tier nostalgia \n- New UI with a complete revamp of the sidebar complete with higher quality artwork that totally feels in place\n- Plethora of never-before-seen bonus contents including exclusive missions and cinematic cutscenes for Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert that was only available on certain console platforms\n- You can queue multiple units while in production now\n- New multiplayer features and service is great. Finally you can now play 1v1 ranked and spectate any previous matches that was played including spectating ongoing games in the lobby\n- You can add, remove and create your very own custom music tracks in-game for both Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert however you want\n- All of Frank Klepacki's overly iconic classical and remixed tracks are here including various modern remixed that was composed solely for this remastered collection!!!\n\n[b]The Bad:[/b]\n\n- Minor bugs (though not a real dealbreaker)\n- The gameplay meta among factions/units remains as unbalanced as ever. Kinda of a tradeoff for being too faithful to the original titles\n- Multiplayer is still officially limited to a maximum of 4 players total per map in Tiberium Dawn, while in Red Alert the limit is a maximum of 8 players total\n- FMV cutscenes are all still heavily compressed in SD resolution extracted from the Playstation home console version and further artificially enhanced via AI upscaling due to the fact that the original master footage tapes for both Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert are still yet to be found\n\n[b]The Kinda Ugly:[/b]\n\n- Certain mission on hard difficulty are completely unbalanced. This is already another insult to injury as the AI blatantly cheats when it comes to resource procurement and unit build time. The fault of a clear lack of playtesting",
      "Play this game in roguelike mode (no extra lives) as that seems to be how it was designed. By letting objects of the same type touch each other you will be able to deal damage to or destroy them all with one move! Attacking enemies will damage you back so you have to use potions that also drop down to heal.\n\nI see some of the reviews here saying this game sucks and it's all randomness. It's a roguelike though, so there is a good deal of randomness but the fun comes from gaining skill with the mechanics and making the right decisions. If you can carve out lone pieces and allow a bunch of the same object to get into a big cluster, popping that huge chain is super satisfying. \n\nThe game was very intimidating at first and I would die in the first 2 stages over and over, but I eventually got the hang of things and beat the game for the first time pretty quickly. This game requires patience to get a hang of the mechanics but once you do it's a fun little time waster to open up every once in a while. There are lots of characters to unlock too and they all bring their own strategies to the table.",
      "DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU ALREADY OWN SHOVEL KNIGHT!!!!\n\nIt's a free update to the Original Shovel Knight if you purchased it.  Not a bad game by any means, has the same charm as the original S.K., but why pay for it here if you can get it free with the original (now called Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove).\n",
      "One of my favorite Rockstar games to-date (next to Max Payne).\n\nThe negative review is for the awful DRM they've implemented, where you can't play SINGLE player if the Rockstar Launcher servers are offline.\n\nThe fact that there are people who pirated this game who can play it forever, while the people who payed for it are at the mercy of Rockstar and their DRM servers being online (for an offline game) is a joke.\n\nBuyer beware.",
      "After completing every ending, completing the map, and 98%-ing my save file (I'm not going to hunt down whatever miniscule thing is left), I can sum up all my thoughts on the game with one word: Disappointing.\n\nTo go more indepth, as a standalone game, Blasphemous 2 was alright at most. But compared to the first it feels bland and boring in a number of ways. The few NPCs you see are forgettable, the bosses are forgettable, every enemy feels the exact same. \n\nThe executions, which felt like such a large part of the charm of Blasphemous 1's combat, are practically gone- not only do they happen much less often but there's almost no uniqueness to them, with nearly every enemy having the same animation. While in B1 there were 16 different executions (18/19 if you count certain bosses), B2 has.. 4 or 5 different executions? \n\nIt feels like they give no depth to anyone you meet, friend or foe, nearly all of them being left a complete mystery with not even a single sentence talking about who or what they are. Even the Penitent One feels bland, having gone from a brutal, unstoppable force hell-bent on reaching his goal no matter what, to some unremarkable silent protagonist who kills some things.\n\nThe world and its areas felt boring, less like an actual world and more like a jumble of random locations stacked like tetris blocks. The way the enemies were tossed into them makes them feel like they were all pre-made assets and they had to think of where they fit best, and the result was almost none of them fitting in with where you see them.\n\nEverything felt far too easy, far beyond the point of getting used to the gameplay and learning from the first game. Bosses especially were disappointing, all having too little health, and it felt like only a single boss in the entire game had more than three attacks. \n\nThe rewards for quests and secrets were unfulfilling and unsatisfying, whether it was giving a character an item that was obviously meant for them or slowly searching across every little corner of the whole map for tiny secrets you missed. \n\nThe endings especially were a huge disappointment, and they made it feel like everything leading up to them was entirely a waste of time and effort and took away what little enjoyment was left.\n\nEverything about Blasphemous 1 that made it unique- the worldbuilding, the gameplay, the artstyle and animations- feels like it's all been stripped away and we were left with this generic metroidvania that only vaguely resembles its predecessor.\n\nI [b]loved[/b] Blasphemous, it was and still is one of my all time favourite games, but I really can't say I liked Blasphemous 2. If you loved Blasphemous 1 I would honestly advise against playing this, the whole experience is such a letdown that it's hard to not have the first game spoiled simply by what comes after it. If you don't care, or you haven't played the first yet, then at the very least wait until there's a good sale before trying.",
      "I am a 43 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he helped me. Loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.\nThank you <3",
      "I honestly didn't think this was going to hook me as much as it did. There's something so charming about this game that I honestly can't quite pinpoint to one central thing. The characters, the art, the writing, the plot, the setting.... They're all fantastic. I haven't run into a supporting character that I dislike at all (minor characters excluded, WEIRD BOILED PEANUTS STRANGER ON THE BUS). There's a lot of layers and depth to the characters! \n\nExcept the weird boiled peanuts stranger on the bus. But we don't talk about him. Or his weird boiled peanuts. \n\nThe writing in particular I have to sing praises about. It has an excellent comedic edge to it and there's so many great lines. SO MANY. Scarlet Hollow also delivers on something a lot of other \"choice/decision\" games fail to execute: Your choices actually do matter. There's some REAL serious consequences to certain choices! Some of which are immediately apparent, some of which haven't shown up yet (but it's strongly suggested a lot of the choices you make will come back around in the later episodes). It's almost like a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure book; there's so many different little things you can choose that will affect other things. Each episode can end in vastly different outcomes.\n\nPart of what adds to the writing are the Traits you can choose when starting the game. You get to pick two out of seven, and these can affect dialogue or open up certain options you otherwise wouldn't have access to. In some cases having a particular trait can even massively swing things in your favor, where otherwise it might be a lot more difficult to get the desired outcome you want. \n\nALSO you can choose a trait that lets you talk to animals though and you get to meet Best Friend Dustin if you do. And you get the most hilarious dialogue options. It's The Best.\n\nI honestly won't even go into detail about the story. Talking about it ruins the whole point! But needless to say it's very good, and it hooked me real good. It's been going unexpectedly cool places that have been totally outside of my predictions.\n\nAs an aside, I've always been a fan of the horror aesthetic in general, but so many horror games end up trying to make you piss your pants in fear; which isn't what I'm after in a horror game. But Scarlet Hollow absolutely nails the atmospheric tension of the horror aesthetic. It's eerie and terrifying and tense, all without relying on cheap jumpscares or, actual scares. It's great if, like me, you like the theme of horror but hate being scared. It'll keep you on the edge of your seat, but rest assured your pants will remain dry.\n\nAlso there's Romance Options. A WHOLE LOT. I'm gonna smooch Stella and we're gonna hunt Cryptids together and it'll be RAD.",
      "This game is really special. I'm a 50 year old man with an emotional structure made largely of mud and thumbtacks, and I had to bite the inside of my jaw in a parts to keep from tearing up. \n\nMany people seem to equate an \"adult game\" with gore and violence or explicit imagery. Nothing wrong with those types of games, I have and will continue to enjoy them. This game explores mature themes on relationships and mortality and doesn't pull any punches, without being cheap or manipulative. In that sense, its the most adult game I've ever played. \n\nI won't ever forget it. If this sounds like something you'd be interested in, stop reading and buy it. Its a slow burn, and you won't be invested until you've spent some time with the characters in the story. In the end, the payoff is tremendous.",
      "I bought the game and the mechanics are fun! The battle system is super impactful and just FEELS fun. It really gives you a sense of satisfaction. And it has interesting elements that really every game should have... but the UI sucks, the classes are genderlocked, and there are so many systems going on at once it's annoying. Like something as simple as a constant notification in the middle of the screen of some other person or random guild you know nothing about doing quests or getting skill points. It's a fun game, but has WAAAY too many minor (except genderlocked classes. Genderlock is never a minor thing) problems that just add up making it annoying to play",
      "A new game from Zeboyd, you know I'm there! And this was such a fun game\n\nThis game is about as long as Cthulhu Saves Christmas and it's just as Linear. However given their statement on this video, that's meant to be the point these days.\n\nThe Graphics for the main game are basic but it's fitting for the Genre. Also they have dropped the random battles with on screen monsters to avoid if you want to not fight (And you still have the option to start a battle through the main menu). The fighting system is identical to CSC too which I've enjoyed but I can understand those who may not like it. The Animation for the transformations are incredible...except I'm always stuck watching them every single time which can get very tedious.\n\nThe story is clever, and they provide \"Translations\" for the Ole English of Shakespeare...but a lot of the translations are jokes and very silly ones at that.\n\nThere isn't a LOT of replay value but you will enjoy the story enough you'll want to play it again eventually.\n\nThere is no New Game Plus mode...yet but given how they patched it into CSC later on I'm certain they're do that here eventually.\n\nI say the game is incredible for the price range and is entertaining for all ages.\n\n\nVIDEO REVIEW: https://youtu.be/wuw9pJPowqM",
      "The premise is that you're a passenger on a ship, waking up on the morning after you've murdered your well-to-do husband. From that point, you're free to go anywhere on board to do whatever you can to avoid justice within the time limit. You could just try to play dumb and cover up enough evidence to put your guilt into doubt. If you're more devious you could try to frame one of your fellow passengers. You could even go the And Then There Were None route and murder everyone else on board just to be thorough, if you can pull it off.\n\nOverboard! was clearly designed for replayability. The ship is full of evidence and red herrings to tamper with, desperate schemes to attempt, and secrets to learn. The first playthrough reveals only a small slice of all this, leaving a collection of unsolved mysteries and unfollowed leads to pursue on the second. The second playthrough prepares you for the third, and so on, until finally you beat the game... but there's much more to it than that. Vague, but I don't want to spoil anything.\n\nThis game was released today without any kind of announcement beforehand from inkle. As usual, their writing and design are superb. If you're captivated by the premise, even by a little, you won't regret the purchase.",

      "coffee talk 2 is out and now everyday i look forward to making myself a cozy drink and playing my daily session of it, just like i did with the first game. it makes my day so much better☕🤎\n\nMohammad Fahmi, the creator and the writer of the first game who passed away at 32, is always in my thoughts. thank you for creating this gem.\n\nthe game is currently \"playable\" on steam deck, but in my opinion it deserves to be deck-verified. i've had no problems on the deck at all. the reason for \"playable\" status seems to be the small text, but i've also had no difficulty reading anything. it's one of those games that is better experienced handheld, curled up on the couch with a nice blanket ♡ so don't be fooled by the \"playable\" status, it works 100% fine and you don't have to tinker with anything.",
      "It has poor simulation of hand skeleton, so you can't use all fingers, benefits of Index Knuckles controller or VR gloves, etc. And, scenario doesn't allow you to do anything, actually, except one straightforward way. Some things are elaborated, but mostly it isn't worth time or money. But I'm rating it as professional developer for VR, sexual content itself is not matter nor interested for me. My advice for game developer is to add more hand tracking features and more scenarios - in this case it can be something better.",
      "Overall, there's just too many things about this game that rub me the wrong way.\n\nFirst of all, I definitely like the art, visuals, music, voice acting, and writing. They don't hold your hand when it comes to explaining the story and it forces you to pay attention and also encourages you to try lots of different function combinations so you can learn more about the characters, if you care to.\n\nOther than that, though, there's not much I like. The most important aspect of games to me is whether the gameplay is fun, and honestly transistor's gameplay isn't that much fun for me. Like others have said, not being able to do anything after you pause time and plan out a sequence of moves just sucks. They don't even give you enough mobility to dodge shots. All you can really do is try to get to cover and hide out until your meter replenishes. And if you opt to instead play without using turn (or using turn to pause and think and then unpausing and simply executing your actions manually), you'll probably disappointed by that experience when comparing it to the action oriented gameplay of bastion. One of the worst things, in my opinion, is that you lose access to functions when you lose all your health. Honestly I'd rather just die and restart from checkpoint. I can see that they're trying to encourage you to try different combinations of things, but it still just frustrates me losing the build that I was in the process of learning. And when your options are limited the gameplay just gets more and more boring because you might have to resort to gimmicky tactics depending on what functions you are left with. Overall, it's certainly a unique idea to blend the turn-based with real-time combat, but, in practice, it ends up just not being all that fun to me. I'd rather play a turn based game or an action game. My brain doesn't like switching between the two so rapidly.\n\nI would say get this heavily discounted and play it for the uniqueness and aesthetics. Don't come here expecting something very heavy or that you're going to really want to sink countless hours into or replay. My first playthrough was done in 6 hours and I was glad to be done with it. I have to complement them for not dragging it out or having some frustratingly long and tedious boss fight at the end. If the story went on even an hour longer I might've just gotten sick of it and given up.\n\nIf you're into experience games more along the lines of how you experience art or other aesthetic experiences (and not necesarilly for the thrill of challenge and victory), you should definitely consider this game. There's a lot there to process. I personally don't care much about that sort of thing when it comes to games, though.",
      "Do NOT buy this game! This game does not even have a minimap/GPS/coordinate system. You will definitely get lost.\nMultiplayer is fully of bug and lags so much.\nDo NOT buy this game!\nDo NOT buy this game!\nDo NOT buy this game!\n\nThis game is so f*** stupid",
      "Gameplay is similar to Hades. The story isn't as rich as Hades, but it's still pretty good. More forgiving than Hades, that's for sure. You see where I'm going with this - Hades is 10/10, the roguelike to compare/to beat. On a scale of 10 hades, I'd give this game a 7.5/10 Hades.",

      "I reviewed the original Mark of the Ninja more than 4 years ago. I liked its stealth-based gameplay approach and praised the learning curve experienced throughout the story. I bought the [i]Special Edition[/i] which practically meant an add-on with some more levels, a custom and the option to replay the entire game in commentary mode. \n\nYou know some games get re-released due to the availability of a new console generation. This [i]Remastered[/i] edition is what was made available for PS4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch users not long ago. We, PC gamers (who already own the original Mark of the Ninja), can get this version free-of-charge in our library.\n\nThere's not much to say, really. I do not have a 4K display so this higher resolution I cannot enjoy. Compressed in-game art or not the original already looked very good. But the creators confirmed this will give us an enhanced experience even under 1080p resolution. \n\nWell, I did complete the game once again as this is how much I love MoN. I recommend that you do the same.\n\nPS: It may be possible that you are required to have the special edition of the original version to get the remastered version.",
      "I've read some of the negative reviews and name calling is petty so instead I'll just say a lot of those opinions are dumb.\n\nLook. This isn't Firewatch. This is a seven year old game that pissed off a lot of bros and continues (apparently, christ) to do so because it embraced not only being a walking simulator but a gay one at that. And yeah bro, 15 bucks seems steep for a game that you can finish in under an hour, but hell, maybe don't speed run? It's a walking simulator after all. Or maybe support indie game devs. *Or maybe* read the Steam tags that say \"short\" and \"walking simulator\" and then don't count that against the game. You don't review CS;GO and say \"not bad, but too much shooting\" right? RIGHT? \n\nLook. I've had some wine. And I've had some feelings. And Gone Home is a piece of video game history whether people want it to be or not. It's a game I wish I would have known about when it was first released. Hell I needed it five years earlier than that. \n\nIf you're pissed that Gone Home wasn't dramatic enough or that it's \"homosexual\" then maybe realize that this game wasn't made for you and that does not qualify it as bad. \n\nAnyway, that cat journal achievement was neat.",
      "Very addictive and challenging\nAlthough the whole game is happening on the same map, with the same enemy and the same weapons, it has a lot of replayability trying and testing new builds and characters.\nMusic is good.

This game won't give you a sequal hook, it won't give you a product carved away like a thanksgiving turkey, each part sold seperately or held to ransom. \n\nThis is not a game about standing victorious over your enemies, it's not a game with some kind of adrenal rush that will leave you drained and empty afterwards.\n\nThis isn't a game about saving the world, as surprising as that may sound considering the hero's goal.\n\nThis is a game about hope. Hope for tomorrow, hope for your fellow man, hope for dreams and wishes, hope for a last shimmer of light in the encroaching darkness.\n\nThis is a game that will make you ask things about yourself, even if only subconciously. \n\nBut, most importantly of all, this is an experience that will make you say \"I was happy to be there, if only for a time.\"\n\nAnd I was, in fact, happy to be here.\n\nHats off to you ladies and gentlemen, you made a cyinical old bastard smile for a good ten hours.",

Since those were the more difficult parts of the original game, I assume this was done for a more streamlined experience. \nInstead of your flower wilting to represent your life, it is now replaced by more accurate \"points\". Although this makes it easier to tell exactly how many hits you can take, I miss the more original old design.\nAn iconic music track was also changed, likely due to licensing issues...\n \nCan't completely replace the original for me, but it's still a very worthwhile experience! \nStill wishing for a sequel a decade later.",

      "New edit: The developers have made the steam workshop available, but as an Oceanic user I don't have direct access to the workshop and I can't upload mods. It seems to be only available to Chinese modders, much like the previous 3rd party software. The problem appears to be covered up and not solved.\n\nEdit: Modding capability is now available. The devs are using a 3rd part chinese workshop that we all hate (thanks devs), however you can use Nexus Mods instead. Simply go to the Tale of Immortal nexus page and download any mod, then add it into the local mod section provided in the mod category. Then you're good to go.\n\nBe aware that currently, from what I've seen, the IDs mods use are generated at mod creation and multiple mods have a chance of ID conflict (breaking the mod/s). So if you have problems this may be the reason.\n\n\nOfficial English translation is available. The devs have mentioned 90% is translated, but I believe it won't impact gameplay. Players who haven't launched the game before will be switched to English automatically.\n\nIf you have launched the game before you will have to do the following: in the main menu select 语言 and change 简体中文 to English (Alpha) and restart the game.\n\nFor my review: Having played the game, I can say it's both good and bad. It failed to meet my expectations but I still enjoyed the game and will recommend it. The art is fantastic. The combat is fun but lacking compared to other action & slash titles (there is a lot they could do with it). Quests aren't very clear and their incentives are bad making it hard to get invested. You don't get anything really unique or interesting from quests as far as I've played.\n\nProgression is the most disappointing part of the game. It's a mix of crafting, gathering and looting to acquire items that will either enable you to advance or give you a stronger stat-boost when you do advance. Every realm does the same thing, only requiring different items at the new area/s that open up for that realm. This is a shame. Progression is the area that has the most potential in this game and yet is the most tacked on part, mostly an afterthought.\n\nThe developers could've made each realm advancement unique, with different gameplay mechanics for each one that ties into the unique aspects of the area/realm they're in. This would be a fantastic way to give a sense of freshness to each area the player explores and make them engage more actively in said area rather than rushing through it as we do now.\n\nProgression could've been the strongest part of this game but they ended up making it the weakest. Again, it's a shame. I see so much potential that just isn't capitilised on. Overall this is an experience I'd recommend. But I'd only play it once in its current state.",
      "Deathloop is definitely not your average video game.\n\nYou'll either love it or hate it.\n\nThe first few hours are the weakest. You, as a new player, don't know what to do, what's important and you never keep what you find. Only after completing several mission objectives you get the ability to collect residuum and actually infuse your found items for later use in later loops or after you die. That's why it's always better to just go straight to the objectives and not explore the map at all, otherwise it's just gonna be a big time waste.\n\nAfter you acquire the ability to make permanent items (character and weapon trinkets) which you'll be able to use in future runs and collect some crucial weapons (like silent gun) and abilities ([in-game slabs] like Shift that allows you to teleport short distances) - then the game fully opens up. \n\nReal fun begins after you learn all maps and shortcuts and how to toy with your enemies (but it takes quite a lot of time to get there).\n\nStealth is very easy, the enemy AI is dumb at best. The more trinkets and slabs you get - the more variety in gameplay opens up. \n\nAction is very smooth, Abilities are strong and versatile, that's where this game shines to be honest. \n\nThere are 4 different areas and all of them change depending of the time of the day (morning, noon, afternoon and evening). Depending of the time of the day - some areas become accessible, some become closed, The enemies and items also change their locations and sometimes you'll be able to encounter bosses (in-game they are called visionaries). They are not hard to kill, but it's quite hard to get to them. That's the fun part of this whole game. The more you replay all areas, the more information you'll acquire about visionaries and their behaviour. It's possible to deal with them all without killing a single other enemy.\n\nBut with all that comes the not so fun part - exploration and doing the same thing over and over and over again. It's gonna be hard at first, every area is very detailed and it's really easy to miss a code written on a desk or a wall, A lot of sniffing around is required for clues and multiple times per map. It definitely makes repetition your new best friend.\n\nThere are a lot of puzzles and challenges. If you are not shooting dumb NPCs - you're definitely trying to crack a solution to a puzzle. Sometimes you'll need to visit several maps on the exact time of day at which events occur and find the exact required item or piece of information in order to solve a puzzle. Yeah. It's a big hassle, but that's how this game is and how it functions. If you like puzzles, you'll enjoy Deathloop. But be prepared to use a guide or two for some of them and a lot of patience.\n\nDuring some objectives it's very easy to make mistakes and fail. Several challenges require you to be pixel perfect in execution. Didn't notice that mine placed on a generator? Too bad, you'll gonna have to restart or try in another loop.\n\nI disliked that once you find a new weapon, you have to take it with you and drop one of your 3 weapons. You will never be able to use the dropped one for the rest of the loop. Considering that you'll always find a new toy to play with - your loadout will always be half-baked. It's actually extremely annoying, the same can be said about your slab abilities too (only after you find them all, then the ability upgrades will go straight into your inventory after finishing a level).\n\nAnd of course, there is Julianna. She is your \"buddy\" the whole game and she talks to you at the start of every level and well... she is always trying to kill you. It's fun when she invades and disrupts your chill Groundhogday experience. You can even let other real players invade you as Julianna. Fun, if you like to fill yourself with some adrenaline. Either you kill her, or she kills you and you'll have to start over the whole loop ^^\n\nFunny, but Colt reminded me of Draymond Green from Golden State Warriors. In some instances he looks exactly like him haha.\n\nThere are some AI bugs and the game starts to stutter the longer you play. Kinda strage, but it was for me. Occasionally framerates can go from smooth to choppy quite fast.\n\nDeathloop is a decent game overall. Idea is good, but works much better in movies, because there you don't have to sit through the same routines every single time and you get to the next big reveal a lot quicker. \n\nI think Julianna was a bit underused. Imagine how awesome this game could be if Deahtloop worked similar to The Lost Vikings where you control 3 characters at the same time. She could have had different abilities, different strengths. A duo trying to break the loop! Pretty cool, eh? Anyway, That's just my 2 cents.",
      "After playing thousands of games both singleplayer and multiplayer, unlocking all achievements and getting every solo map medal, I think it's time for a review:\n\nIf you like tower defence games: I recommend.\nIf you like any previous Bloons games: I recommend.\nIf you want something casual and chill: I recommend.\nIf you want a bit of a challenge: I recommend.\n\nThe tower type variety is interesting and diverse, with 5 tiers of upgrades each (plus special \"paragon\" towers)\nThe game devs have been providing free updates for years.\nThere's lots of achievements and medals to get.\nThere's online co-op, boss events and even different game-modes.\n\nThe game is more expensive than it used to be, but literally any sale price makes it worth a buy!",
      "First off, just want to say this isn't a Metroidvania. This is a Zelda clone. And a good one!\n\nI bought this game because I heard it really put stress on you. You have limited time to complete the game and NPCs will begin dying if you aren't fast enough. Pretty crazy, right? Well, I do have a few gripes with that, but let me point out the good stuff first:\n+ Amazing combat. You have access to both guns and swords, but most of your damage will likely come from melee weapons since they have the ability to do an extremely-easy-to-pull-off PARRY! Parrying an enemy stuns it and gives your next attack against it a massive damage multiplier. All enemies, all bosses, and most projectiles are parryable, so this is what combat ends up revolving around. Even though I call it easy, you still get that cool feeling when you walk into an ambush and clear it without taking a hit, so it never gets dull as you go through the game.\n\n+ Good dungeon design. Since this game takes after Zelda, it's not shy about inserting a few puzzles into its dungeons. The overworld as well has quite a few surprising secrets and side quests that you won't be expecting when you play for the first time.\n\n+ Sequence breaks. This is mostly for New Game+ (or New Game Extra, a separate mode where you have access to major exploration items from the start, but not your whole endgame inventory), but it was interesting to find out how many secret paths and shortcuts there were, and how tightly they were managed. The devs thought of everything!\n\nSo now for the bad stuff.\n- Underwhelming story. Guess how much is really explained over the course of this story. If you guessed \"all of it\", you would be completely wrong and here's your dunce hat. Unsighted ends up spending so much of its time on the protagonist's relationships that it fails to answer several of the more important questions concerning the game's backstory. Why was there was a war? Who started it? Where are the humans now? Why are they so disorganized? Why do they seem to have no chain of command whatsoever? How did the automatons ever win anything at all at any point when they seem so extremely outclassed? I guess it doesn't matter. Look, there's two robot-girls kissing.\n\n- Fake pressure. I heard there was going to be pressure before I started the game, so I decided to go DEFCON 1 from the get-go and rush everything. I ended up completing the game in 10 in-game days and I felt pretty good about it. Zero NPC deaths! Zero! I'm a super awesome amazing hero, right? Well, credits roll and... the only achievement I get is the one for beating the game. No one really cares and apparently you're meant to play through multiple times anyway. So... why did I ever care? Why is this mechanic even in the game? All it did was make me shy away from general exploration and side quests since all of those things are less important than, ya know, saving the world. You can call that interesting, but when it has no payoff, it ends up being frustrating.\n\n- No post-game. Did I mention, if you bumrush the game and finish with just hours left on everyone's timers, you don't get to do any extra no-timer exploring afterwards? No, the game's over. Load the save and you get set back to where you were before fighting the final boss. If you want to do any actual exploring, that's what \"Explorer\" mode is for. You know, that mode that makes you feel like you're cheating?\n\nBasically, Unsighted is another game filled with missed opportunities. I recommend this game because the core gameplay and level design is very well done and very well executed, but you should probably know this before you start:\n\nThe only pressure here is the one you imagine. Since the game does nothing to acknowledge your successes, just play it at your own pace and don't be shy about using Explorer. Shame on the devs for hailing the agony of defeat, but not the thrill of victory.",
      "From my og demo feedback, not much changed sadly:\n\nOh boy....\n\nI will start with the most glaring issue:\n-It's friggin IMPOSSIBLE to find an online match\n\nNow some other stuff that I found odd or bad:\n-The camera.... oh god.... I get it, it's supposed to \"limit\" the playing area (specially for local gameplay) but it punishes people in first place... that's friggin dumb in a RACING game, also also if you go under other track sometimes you can't see sh*t (the going under other track piece seems to be fixed in the final release)\n\n-The car randomly drives itself ???? (maybe it's the antenna thingy I chose at car selection.... would be good a tooltip or SOMETHING so I know wtf is that about)\n\n-NO CONTROL REBINDING OPTIONS..... in 2023 \n\n-If you \"die\" near a checkpoint, though luck pal you WILL miss the next section too cause you won't respawn in time... that's.... just unfun and dumb.\n\n-The \"shortcut\" option definetly does not work, I intentionally crafted a track with cuts and the game will kill you if you try to do those..... good job devs. (This seems to be fixed or working properly in final release)\n\n-Since I couldn't find an online match EVER, I played only in local lobby or vs AI, now here comes the issue, the \"placing\" round locks everyone to the same \"screen\", there is no zoom, you can get trolled by another player preventing you to move to a place to connect track or hazards, rendering your placement turn void and useless, I don't know if this is intentional or just a downside of playing on local mode, you may have free cam in multi, but alas I couldn't try that. BTW.... WHY THERE IS NO ZOOM OPTION\n\nThe good:\n-The games runs smooth as butter, with everything maxed on my midend rig, good one devs\n\n-The cars seem to be varied and with some gimmicks, alas you have NO TOOLTIPS or info what that possible gimmick may be..... why ?\n\n-The track pieces, hazards and weapons are quite varied and some weird shennanigans are ensured to happen, feels like a Trackmania troll track being build in real time 10/10\n\nThe \"mehhh\":\n\n-The weapons/items some of them are mindbogglingly hard to understand wtf they do, there is a grey metallic ball even that seems to do nothing or I haven't figured out how to use it... again... a tool tip maybe ? a section about weapons/items in the main menu mayhaps ?\n\nAnd that's that, sorry if my writing seems a bit aggresive, I just was kinda hyped about the game and it feels a bit of a let down so far. But, IT HAS POTENTIAL.\n\nSadly, another case of developer with TONS of feedback delivering an undercooked mess. Stay away from it.",
      "I definitely would not recommend this. The aesthetic of it might appeal to some people, which is what initially drew me in, but the visual awe wears off after seeing the same scene too many times. The game is best played with paper and pencil in hand so that you waste as little time as possible wandering around in a straight line. \n\nThis game survives off of the mysterious nature of its content in the sense that if people knew how small the experience was, they would not buy it. I was thoroughly let down by this game, especially since its promotional material hyped me up for an exploration game with a unique method of interacting with the world. \n\nThe main feature that sets the game apart from other titles, the use of the telephone to access parts of the static world, becomes little more than a password screen used to pick up where you left off or were booted out of your game by a short time limit. After the first two or three times I used the game's core feature, I was tired of it and wished there was a way to play the game that was faster or had more depth.\n\nFor anyone who has played or seen any amount of gameplay from Yume Nikki, you will realise that this game's design begs the audience to compare the two. However, the most useful comparison to draw between the two is by using the game that Madotsuki can play in her room as an example. In Madotsuki's game, \"Nasu,\" is a joyless game about catching fruit. It is repetitive, intentionally annoying, has no bearing on your progression/success, and is meant to urge you toward doing something else. Unfortunately, this is a suitable comparison, as it succeeded in making me feel like Madotsuki in real life and I want to turn off the game and do almost anything else in record time.\n\nI truly wanted to like this game, but I cannot justify spending $5 for this experience when I played better flash games all the way back in middle school for free.",
      "I shall start by saying that if you are deciding to buy this game then don't let the negative reviews sway you. In general, Fallout 4 is an amazing game and can be incredibly fun.\n\nPros: \n-Very immersive and will drain so many hours, days, weeks and months from your life.\n-Far Harbour, Automotron and (first half of) NukaWorld DLC have really good stories, quests and environments.\n-Mostly fluid combat system. Everything depends on how you want to play the game.\n\nCons: \n-WIll drain so much of your life away (might've forgotten my gf's birthday ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ )\n-Main story was incredibly lackluster compared to previous Fallout games\n-Giving you the option to be literally any kind of character you want to be....except you're always tied to being a parent.\n-a few repitive quests. (although gives you opportunities to approach these quests, areas and enemies differently\n\nAll in all, If you're a Fallout fan because of previous stories then you might not feel fulfilled playing this game, however if you love character creations, lore and immersive environments with untold stories then I completely recommend this game to you.",
      "So the game can be played I believe in flat screen and VR, I played in VR. You play the game in a third person prospective controlling a spirit dog. The concept is easy, get the people to the light beam, but that's easier said than done. It was very nearly a short game play video as i become really stuck to the point i nearly quit but I tried, tried and tried again until i did it. It very much reminded of a game i use to play as a kid called lemmings only in this one it doesn't matter if the people fall of the edge. Its a very challenging game, one where you can just sit and try to figure it all out. I thought it would get repetitive but each level is very different from the last. I have a game play video in which i get a bit frustrated lol if you wanted to check out some game play. https://youtu.be/7VPsLnDDDlQ",
      "Honestly I've put over 400 hours into 20XX and this game is even better! Even though it's unfinished as of current it's still a fantastic time and truly stands out on it's own.",
      "Where to start.... in short entire game is boring and very slow paced for no aparent reason.\n\nAI: AI performs only very basic functions and does not upgrade buildings and does the opposite of whats beneficial for your empire. AI does not do very well when engaging in displomacy.\n\nUI: You will spend most of your time trying to manage/hover around very CLUMSY and absolutely disgusting UI. Other 4x games offer far superior UI and make is easier to manage your asset on the field e.g. Sword of the stars II, Star Ruler 2, Distant world, Endless Legends, Endless Space etc.\n\nGFX: Graphics are not the top notch what you would expect from a modern 4x game but they are on far with Endless Legends. GFX leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nAlien Races: I dont need to say much but like Planets most of the races are COPY / PASTE. Nothing unique or special about each. \n\nMP: Multiplayer has a mind of its own and in most cases wont let you join public games unless its a private game.\n\nStellaris bring nothing new to 4x Genre in 2016!.\n Right now everyone is almost beta testing for the developers so we can find bugs, report them  and help them fix their game. Why not let players do beta before before release? But then there is  a question of sale and refund. \n\nBut overall this game does offer amazing soundtrack.",

      "PC version doesn't have rebindable controls for controller for some reason\n\nupdate: i have finished the game, still no rebindable controls, i can give a real review now. i wouldn't rate it negative but i wouldn't rate it positive either. this is a \"eh\" review.\n\nthe game is two games at once and neither of them are great.\n\n the roguelike part is like 20% of the game and is very simple and shallow, there's like 5 weapons and they all play the same, its also super easy. its ok but its not as good as a real roguelike.\n\n the cult building part is 80% of the game and is a bit more fun but past the earlygame its a bit eh too. choosing what you get doesn't really matter since you'll unlock everything pretty fast, and the doctrines 90% of the time are a choice between 2 useless things and 10% of the time a choice between a busted thing and a useless thing. the randomly generated quests the followers give you are just chores like revisiting old dungeons you already completed and the reward is pretty much nothing. its ok but its not as good as a real colony builder.\n\nnone of the systems in either part of the game are particularly deep.\n\nas of the time of this review, the game is still quite glitchy, though being patched by the devs.\n\nthe game is about 15 hours with side content and 18 hours for a completionist run. no real replayability \n\ni'd just recommend you get a full on action roguelike if you want to play a roguelike, or a full on colony builder if you want to play a colony builder. this game does both but is not great at either of them. \n\n game is very cute tho and the soundtrack is great. like 5/10",
      "They tried to do like super smash bros and generalize controls. So all (or jsut about)  characters play the same. The problem this causes is that it makes the game very repetitive and gets stale after 5h or so of gameplay.",

      "It's about time i wrote a proper review for one of my favourite games ever.\n\nRivals of Aether is a platform fighter that tries to follow Super Smash Bros. Melee and P+'s footsteps by making a competitive focused game, but also while trying to keep it more accessible than the former. The game also has a very active workshop that allows players to create their own characters and play ones made by other creators, alongside custom made stages and buddies.\n\nI will focus on the purist aspect of the game first.\n\nAs for many \"smash clones\", the game will feel very familiar to people who already played a smash game, with the controls being nearly identical but with some key differences:\n\n1. THERE'S NO SHIELD. Rivals of Aether is probably the first game in its genre to forgo the iconic \"bubble\" shield, choosing it to replace it with a parry instead. Parries are riskier, staying out for a few frames, and will reward you immensely by either stunning the opponent or reflecting their projectiles. Since parrying is so risky, the game's neutral and defense (but also its offense) will be focused on movement, especially thanks to wavedashing, wavelanding alongside some more niche or character specific movement techs. \n\n2. THE STAGES HAVE NO LEDGES. This means your way to safety when you get knocked off the stage will be actually landing onto the main platform, rather than aiming for the ledges. Rightfully so, the game offers much more options when offstage compared to smash games, with every character having access to wall jumping, an airdodge that doesn't send in freefall and the ability to walljump and cancel special falls, allowing you to use your up special two times. This means the offstage game is a lot deeper than in other game, as there will always be a way back onto the stage since almost every character is allowed a lot of freedom while in disadvantage.\n\n3. THERE'S NO GRABS. There's not much to add here; the absence of a shield makes grabs unnecessary, and thus they're not present in the game. Some characters have command grabs, though.\n\nThere's a total of 14 characters in Rivals of Aether (free from the beginning), with 4 more to come in future patches. Although the cast might seem very slim for people who are used to smash games, it's incredibly diverse. Enough to probably warrant you to try every character. Each character has a lot of depth and can shape the stage in some way. Some fighters take inspiration from smash characters, such as Clairen having a tipper mechanic like Marth, or Absa having Ness and Mewtwo's movement turned up to 200 and Zelda's lightning kicks; this means you'll probably find a character you're familiar with in case you're not confident to play with a brand new character yet. It's also worth mentioning that the game is very balanced, with tiers being very subjective. Regardless, RoA's current top player plays the character that is considered the worst in the game by most, so that should prove that the balance state is very good.\n\nNetplay is not perfect, but it's very good and playable. As i'm writing this review, there's currently a beta build that includes rollback netcode, which presents a couple of bugs and desyncs but does its job quite well. Default build uses delay netcode, which also works just fine in case you're dissatisfied with the rollback beta. Rollback is expected to become the default build once the dev team fixes all its kinks.\n\nEvery stage has both an \"aether\" (casual, with hazards) mode and a \"basic\" (competitive, no hazards) mode. Every single stage in \"basic\" mode is tournament legal (with the exception of tempest peak in some regions), adding a lot of stage variety. Aether stages are aimed for a casual audience, with some spicy traps and whacky platform arrangements for a more casual and laidback experience.\n\nOn that topic, there's no items in this game, so the chaotic free-for-all  factor goes down by a notch, to the discomfort of players who like the party game side of platform fighters.\n\nThe community may be small, but it's very active and constantly organizes weekly and monthly tournaments, with the active (financial and whatnot) support of the game devs themselves, so you will quickly find a community in which to play. Sadly, though, having a small community means you'll be bound to experience some \"dead lobbies\" from time to time.\n\nSolo play, i'll have to be honest, is incredibly lackluster. This game was mainly thought to be played with other players and as a result, single player content is very scarce. There's an arcade-styled story mode which only features a handful of characters (the original 4+2 more), that will have you fight some random fighters until you reach your character's \"rival\" at the end of the story. The cutscenes go from average to bad, depending on the character's story. Each story is very simple and resolves itself in the course of 5 encounters, with a super boss+ a final cutscene once you complete every character's story mode\n\nThere's also \"endless abyss\" mode. It's similar to smash's multi-man mode, where you'll fight a never ending horde of weak cpus, with some minigames slapped inbetween, like a platforming section or explosive enemies. You will have to fight a weaker version of the story mode's boss after a set number of waves each time. The most interesting part of this gamemode is probably the rune system. The rune system will allow to buy runes with the in-game currency that will make your character stronger, be it by making them faster/more powerful or improving their moves. These runes can also be used in abyss versus, which is basically pvp but with runes.\nSadly, endless abyss can become repetitive very quickly, with its never changing waves and gimmicks and grind you have to go through to be able to buy (and use) your runes.\n\nThere's one more mode called Tetherball. It's actually a PvP mode, but i'm putting it in the solo play paragraph because it's a very casual mode. Simply put, the goal of this mode is to hit a beach ball that is attached to a pole by a string and make it spin around it. You score one point when the ball-on-a-string completely wraps the pole. You will have to fight your opponent to keep the control of the ball, as they can hit it as well and make the ball \"theirs\". It's a very fun but often shunned aside mode so i felt like putting it in this review. Please, play Tetherball with me. \n\n\nAs for workshop...\n\nIf you're not big on the competitive scene of platform fighters, this is probably why you came to this store page and. as you may have gathered, casual play is not very fleshed out, with only aether mode and some solo modes as your only options. That's where workshop shines! You'll be able to download hundreds of play made characters, some with the intent of being serious, competitive fighters, while others (most) are aimed to a more casual audience. Characters can go from original characters to the reckless wii mote guy, so you'll have plenty of fun by browsing the worshop page and finding the perfect character, be it an original character or a direct transposition of greninja from Smash Ultimate. Needless to say, you'll also have a huge choice of stages and music packs, alongside some hidden gems like new gamemodes that often pass under the radar. I bet you didn't know you could play Uno in Rivals of Aether!\n\n\n\nTo wrap things up, i'd like to comment on the great pixel art graphics which does its job very well and will appeal to retro gamers specifically, and give my shoutouts on the incredible OST made by flashygoodness. Every track fits the stage perfectly and gives the right atmosphere to this fast paced fighting game.\n\nIn other words this game is a very good purchase for both casual players, thanks to the workshop, and competitive players because of its deep yet accessible design. I hope this review made whoever is reading it consider buying Rivals of Aether and join the community.",

As you play it you know you're experiencing something special that comes around very seldomly and that you should do everything within your power to appreciate it.

It's a reminder that there still exists impossible beauty in what sometimes feels like a bleak hopeless materialistic world. If you remain steadfast though and look for it, you will find things that will inspire you, things that will give you hope again and things that will remind you of why life is so beautiful and worth fighting for.

      "Mysterious, claustrophobic, and psychedelic --- this is undoubtedly the most unorthodox game in The Legend of Heroes series. This game is basically what you get when you put The Legend of Heroes, Shin Megami Tensei and a certain Silent Hill title [i](which I won't specify for a good reason)[/i] into a blender machine. Nonetheless, it is still very much an LoH game at its core, though its semi-fandisc nature holds it back from being as coherent of an overall package as its two predecessors.\n\nI cannot stress this enough: [b][u]If you were a big fan of the previous two games, you will not necessarily like this game; on the other hand, if you didn't hold them in high regard, this game is still worth trying out due to its stark contrast in tone and structure from its predecessors.[/u][/b] There is a good reason this game is named [u][b]\"the 3rd\"[/b][/u] instead of \"Third Chapter\", because it is definitely not a direct continuation of SC (i.e. Trails in the Sky Second Chapter).\n\nIf you want more of the upbeat, kingdom-trotting adventure of the previous two games, you're not going to find it here.\n\nIf you want towns full of vibrant NPCs, you're not going to find it here (at least not in the main story).\n\nIf you want a protagonist who wears their heart on their sleeves and acts like your typical spunky JRPG hero, you're not going to find it here.\n\nThis game is first and foremost [u][b]a gameplay-heavy dungeon crawler[/b][/u], one that is light on (main) story but carries some very heavy themes. The most interesting aspect of the game to me is that [i][b]the protagonist Kevin Graham is not a hero[/b][/i] (which is ironic considering the name of this series). This game is his harrowing personal journey, one in which he doesn't set out to save the world, his homeland, or anyone for that matter.\n\nThere are initially only two playable characters, but more and more join your party at a steady pace throughout the game [b](16 in total)[/b]. Be sure to talk to these characters when you swap them out of your party; they are ironically the only source of \"NPC dialogue\" for the majority of the game, and their dialogue updates after every plot point like in most other Falcom games. You know Falcom has done their NPCs justice in FC&SC when their complete absence here creates an uneasy sense of isolation.\n\nThere are visual-novel-like sidequests (called Memory Doors) which serve to further flesh out the characters and setting of this series, giving all the playable (and some non-playable) characters their own spotlight to shine in. To this day the cast of Trails in the Sky still remains my favorite cast of any RPG, and I have to give a good chunk of the credit to this game's characterization of them.\n\nThese sidequests take up a sizeable chunk of the game, which one might argue distract from the dungeon-crawling main game. Fortunately, they don't expire like in FC&SC and can be accessed at any point in the game before the final dungeon (with convenient fast-travel to boot), effectively enabling the player to pace the game themselves. \n\nWord of warning though, some of these sidequests take on a much darker tone than one would expect: there's a very good reason why the console versions of this game was censored [i](don't worry, the Steam version isn't)[/i]. Please be mentally prepared for the final sidequest you come across in the game, i.e. [spoiler]Star Door 15[/spoiler].\n\nThere is also plenty of foreshadowing for the rest of the series littered throughout the game, some obvious and some very subtle [i](I'm looking at you Mr. N)[/i]. Needless to say, this game gives you lots to think about if you are into the lore of this series, especially if you have played some of the later Trails games.\n\nOh, and did I mention that the soundtrack is widely regarded as the best in the trilogy?\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nTo end on a more critical note, I'd like to elucidate the \"semi-fandisc\" nature of this game:\n\nThere is severe disconnect between the main story and side content, with the latter adding nothing to the former for the most part; the sidequests are more of an anthology of supplementary material for the entire Trails series and are only tenuously tied to the main campaign, which by itself is sparse in story.\n\nThere is also an egregious amount of asset recycling from the previous two games. Although this is mostly justified within the context of the story, it's still vexing and makes the devs look lazy. They had the opportunity to add a lot of interesting new locales, especially those pertaining to Kevin and the church, but they chose not to for the majority of the game. Get ready to traverse through lots of familiar looking areas and dungeons...\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nP.S. Advice for 1st playthrough: If you are here mostly to enjoy the story, don't play on Hard; if you value your sanity as a gamer, don't play on Nightmare. Seriously, don't.\n\nP.S.2 When you first open up the game, don't skip the \"Falcom\" logo animation; just sit back and watch. There's a bit more after that.\n\nP.S.3 If you're really curious as to which Silent Hill title I was comparing this game to, potential spoilers if you are familiar with the SH franchise: [spoiler]Silent Hill 2[/spoiler]. Just how deep the similarities run between these two games, I'll let you find out for yourself.\n\nP.S.4 A bit more on the censorship of this game: Falcom cut out large chunks of the aforementioned final sidequest when porting the 3rd from PC to the Sony consoles (PSP, PS3, and PSVita). They did this in order to keep the age rating consistent across the Sky trilogy; the PC version of the 3rd would undoubtedly have been rated \"M\" had it gone through ESRB. If you need a list of potentially distressing content in this game, feel free to PM me.",
      "Early Access Review:\nPros: \n- Hilarious flavor text in the form of Books and Proverbs. Seriously, someone took a lot of time creating all that.\n- Really enjoyable music\n- Beautiful pixel art\n- Engaging and interesting story\n- Overall very fun introduction to a huge world\n- Highly responsive dev team that's not only advacing on completion of the game but actively listens to their already large community of players\n- There's a lot of secrets and things to do that you might run out of time to do before the end of the year deadline. You may find yourself needing to play the early access a few times to find everything.\n\nCons:\n- This is early access folks, there's going to be a few bugs here and there\n- The early access content ramps up really fast and gets very interesting and then ends with you really wanting to know what's next. This is really only a con because I'm really impatient and want the full game asap. ;)",
      "I've read some of the negative reviews and name calling is petty so instead I'll just say a lot of those opinions are dumb.\n\nLook. This isn't Firewatch. This is a seven year old game that pissed off a lot of bros and continues (apparently, christ) to do so because it embraced not only being a walking simulator but a gay one at that. And yeah bro, 15 bucks seems steep for a game that you can finish in under an hour, but hell, maybe don't speed run? It's a walking simulator after all. Or maybe support indie game devs. *Or maybe* read the Steam tags that say \"short\" and \"walking simulator\" and then don't count that against the game. You don't review CS;GO and say \"not bad, but too much shooting\" right? RIGHT? \n\nLook. I've had some wine. And I've had some feelings. And Gone Home is a piece of video game history whether people want it to be or not. It's a game I wish I would have known about when it was first released. Hell I needed it five years earlier than that. \n\nIf you're pissed that Gone Home wasn't dramatic enough or that it's \"homosexual\" then maybe realize that this game wasn't made for you and that does not qualify it as bad. \n\nAnyway, that cat journal achievement was neat.",
      "Update 09/10/16\nSo they have added 'last man standing' mode which is great. The only issue is now that the controls are too difficult. If they fix this issue it would be a really fun party game and worth porting to consoles.\n\nPros:\n-Good visuals\n-Fun power ups\n-Awesome 4 player local play\n-In general the game is very fun and I believe with a few tweaks the game would be great. If they had done an early access build it would probably have been a great game on full release but there are still a few things that I and the people I played with don't like.\n\nCons:\nNOW FIXED (THEY ADDED LAST MAN STANDING' MODE) -Scoring system *the scoring system is based on how many you kill, we all thought the game would be better if you had lives instead and had to stay alive, when we played this game it was a case of constant kamakaze and not caring because it doesn't matter if you die* REPEAT THIS HAS BEEN FIXED\n-Controls *this type of game obviously can't be played with keyboard and mouse so this is only reviewed using Xbox 360 controller and it still isn't perfect, none of us felt that  had full control of the vehicle*\n\nVerdict:\nFor now I will give it a thumbs up as if they allow you to select scoring system based on kills or based on deaths we would play this a lot. And I think they could easily improve the controls. I hope the devs don't just leave this game to rot as it is a great idea for a local co-op game",

      "The classic just keeps getting better year after year.\n\nFor those new to the series, this is strictly a management sim.  No action aside from the outstanding baseball extravaganza your imagination cooks up from the play-by-play (if you so choose). (EDIT! There IS action now!  There is a 3D mode to put a little bit of animation to your imagination)  Guide your team over decades as a GM, manage your team pitch-by-pitch, or do both.  It's entirely up to you. \n\nIf you're like me and in every baseball game you've ever played you've found yourself saying \"but wouldn't it be great if it had (X) in it?\"  Well this is your dream game.  Whatever your X was, every time, since Triple Play Baseball on NES, this game has it.  And more.  It has literally everything in it that baseball has in it.  It is an outstanding work and is infinitely enjoyable for a baseball fan.  The only negative I can think of is that I imagine the learning curve is fairly steep (although I've been playing the series for 11 years now so I forget how it was to pick up).  \n\nA must have for any baseball fan.  10/10 (year, after year, after year)",
      "It's hard not to compare this with Divinity: Original Sin. Both were funded on Kickstarter, both have a 91% score on Steam, both are rich, engaging cRPGs, and they were released months apart. It's fair to say both games have been wild successes that have surprised even the developers. If you had to pick ONE of these to invest time in which should it be?\n\nTurn-based vs. Real-time with pause: I eventually came to accept and even enjoy the real-time with pause combat of Pillars, though I much prefer turn-based. Real-time combat presents many problems that aren't the result of player mistakes. On numerous occasions I'd have characters stuck in place because the pathfinding didn't work right. The real-time combat often felt like a jumbled, chaotic mess instead of the tactical plan I had set out. Divinity is much cleaner in this respect and offered a much better experience, especially with respect to using the environment as a weapon. With Divinity I felt each power had a time and place, whereas with Pillars I ended up spamming the same powers and hoping for the best.\n\nStory: Pillars of Eternity definity wins out here. While the story in Divinity:OS wasn't bad, I would call it playful to the point of campy. Pillars had a deep, mature fantasy story worthy of a novel. While it was almost too much reading at times, the story was serious, dark, and dealt with real themes. \n\nArt: Pillars harkens back to the golden age of Infinity Engine games like Balgur's Gate, Icewind Dale, Planescape Torment, etc. The scenes are appealing, but prerendered and they felt a little static. This helps stoke the nostalgia for the late 90s, but Divinity feels up-to-date and immersive. Couple the art style of Divinity with it's highly interactive environments, and the world of Original Sin ends up feeling much more alive. \n\nMusic: Both were great soundtracks but Pillars feels just a bit derivative of the Lord of the Rings movies. They aren't bad at all, but almost generically fantasy at times. Music is important here because when you spend tens of hours in these worlds, you're gonna get this music stuck in your head.\n\nIn short, you should play both if you love deep, isometric, high-fantasy, western computer RPGs. If you MUST pick, consider the following choice. Choose Pillars of Eternity if you favor story and choose Divinity: Original Sin if you prefer combat. Both are hallmarks of a great RPG and each specializes beautifully.",
      "UGH! The scariest thing about this game is that someone at Steam okayed it for being released. Absolute garbage! Frustrating as heck and not fun in the least bit. If you want a scare, you might accidentally get one through a jumpscare, but don't count on it. Avoid this game at all costs, even if its free, I would be hesitant to recommend downloading this pile of crap.

      "The cognitive dissonance in the original Space Quest games between the box cover art telling you that \"Roger Wilco is hapless!\" and the player's necessary mental exertion involved to solve the puzzles, is laid bare the moment you can type in the name you will be called by in the game.\n\nIt's one of the hardest lines to walk when narrative is the main driver of an interactive work:  balancing the player's actions with the personality of the character they are directing in a world that is clearly alive, regardless of the players's presence.\n\nThe Excavation of Hob's Barrow's succeeds in this fully with the denizens and everyday life of the town of Bewlay.\n\nFrom the moment Thomasina Bateman starts recounting the events that led to her writing a letter to her mother, any ambiguity is dispelled: the player is helping Thomasina relive her time in starkly bucolic Bewlay. But as players spend more time within the memories and stories Thomasina shares, the more off putting the narration becomes. It's not just that Thomasina is an unreliable narrator—the implications of the traumatic events that occured at Hob's Barrow are still a puzzle to be worked out. \n\nThis is the strength of the narrative design and writing in Hob's Barrow: as entertainingly crafted as linear story or film, but with eartnest player engagement required to work out what's happening in the very deep shadows of this cursed place.\n\nThe fantastic writing is supported by equally fantastic pixel art, music, and some of the best voice work I've heard in games…ever? The codgers, critters, and countryside all sound fantastic, the bleakness of the moors churning from peaceful to menacing with expert orchestration. Visual direction is solid, too, with sparingly, effectively used pixel portraits and closeups to highlight details both grotesque and filled with character. The dark undercurrent of humour throughout the game also adds some replayability for achievement hunters: some encounters are worth revisiting!\n\nI played this entirely on Steam Deck, mostly curled up in bed at night, but enjoyed the grand finale while docked on my TV. Performance and control was flawless, regardless.\n\nOne of my favorite games released in 2022, and definitely one of my favorite adventure games of all time.",
      "The Witch's House has been my most favorite RPG Maker horror game for years and now I have the remaster which I can buy to directly support the developer. Needless to say how good it is so I will only talk about what is changed and what still remains.\nThe game is still suspenseful and very atmospheric. Some people may worry that the updated graphic and engine may take that away but trust me it is still there and not going anywhere.\nSome sound effects/dialogues have been changed beside the graphic which I am not against it at all. Still very like the remaster.\nThe control is still the same which is as clunky as before when you are not used to. I think the developers know that and decided to not change it so I won't complain. Just say it out for you to know because the game is very old so the control is still there in the past with many other RPG maker games.\nI very like the new graphic and I think they deserve much more compliments for this. However, I like the weird-big-eye Viola model and her less hair skinny portrait more. It look weird and funny at the same time. The new model makes her more beautiful but the portrait makes her kinda fat (at least to me).\nThe new hard mode is.... hard that all I can say without spoiler.\nI don't know whether or not I should calll this a remake but at least it is done better than DSR. And Small indie developers should be supported more. May be \"Ib\" will be remastered some days too if this game is success\nThump Up!",

In a society that tells people that winning and success are what give us worth, it can certainly be a struggle to accept a loss. However, if someone is surrounded by healthy friendships and perhaps even a lover, their perspective can be changed, and then it turns out, losing isn’t so bad, actually. \n\n[u]Information[/u]\n    • This is a sequel to Arcade Spirits, but someone can understand this story without knowing the first one.

As someone who has struggled with depression her whole life and, once upon a time, had suicidal tendencies, I found the ways those topics were integrated into the story to be helpful. (There many instances in media about “Shadow Selves” but it reminded me of Persona 4, when characters have to face the parts of themselves they want to deny.)\n    • There is a cat and there is an option to pet it.\n\n[u]Complaints[/u]\n    • Thicc body types for the protagonist/rival are drawn awkwardly and sloppily. I also feel that the devs took a step back on thicc representation in this game vs the first one. While Zapper (a romanceable character) is slightly plump, I wouldn’t necessarily categorize her as “thicc.” There were two genuinely thicc romanceable characters in the first game.\n    • Only one afro-textured hairstyle in character creation, while straight hair has several.\n    • Beginning of the game is a bit rushed. I think it’s because it’s expected of the player to have played the first game and know all about the AI Iris. \n    • I figure the devs wanted to demonstrate what disabled people go through in terms of discrimination and disrespect from others, but I feel they could’ve done better. They gave the protagonist [i]forced[/i] problematic lines and players aren’t gonna feel great about being an a$$hole to a disabled character. \n    • Sometimes, there’s too much telling and not enough showing.\n    • More resource links should be added to help people with depression and suicidal thoughts than the hotline listed after [spoiler]Coda tries to kill himself[/spoiler]. I think it would also be better if those resources were listed in the credits as well. \n\nIt seems like the most common thing people complain about in the other reviews is political preaching being in the game. I agree: things should be shown rather than told, in this case. On the other hand, I’ve literally known gamers who talk about the issues brought up in the game. I didn’t find it [i]that[/i] unrealistic. I think it’s just that a lot of it is condensed into one story, whereas, in real life, these types of subjects come up every now and then over the course of knowing people for years. \n\nDespite the flaws mentioned, I really liked the game.

      "Ok so let me start off by saying that I absolutely loved the first game in this series. I loved the subtle changes when you compared character interaction throughout the game as you progressed playing non-lethally/lethally. Now I never buy games at launch, I always wait for sales. When I got Dishonored 1 for $2 I was blown away and mad at myself for waiting for such a sale. I would've happily spent more on that game, it was worth it. Now all that said, here we are at Dishonored 2:\n\nPros\n- Mechanics have been vastly improved upon and the gameplay is just so much more fluid. As much as I loved the previous game I can't deny it was somewhat clunky.\n- Customization is so much better! The upgrades are plentiful and the bonecharm crafting system is awesome once you realize what you are doing. It really expands on how many options you really have at your disposal.\n\nCons\n- The difficulty still just isn't there for me. I LOVED that there was a custom difficulty mode, but even making things harder than the 'very hard' difficulty I still completed the game using no powers and never getting detected with relative ease(I did save A LOT obviously). The only things that really present a challenge are the clockwork soldiers, and as the plot of the game makes evident, you really don't encounter those enough to really present a big challenge.\n- The story is weak, plain and simple. It was like you were on a storyboard that used the same format as the previous game. The story, especially the universe and how you were immersed into it, was a big part of the why I loved the first game.\n- How low vs high chaos is handled. It isn't like there are no changes, in fact I was surprised a few times in my 2nd playthrough which I was doing as a hardcore murderer of every man, woman, and child(if there was any) that crossed my path. It just never really changed the dynamic enough like Dishonored 1 did. The way the final mission in the first game played out when comparing no killing playthroughs with bloody ones was VASTLY different right from the start of the mission.\n\nAll in all it wasn't a bad game. I still definitely enjoyed it for being a niche genre game. Just maybe I would have liked the game to stand out more like the first did.",

      "An amazingly fun and short adventure from the creator of Rakuen. Mr. Saitou is a game based in the same universe as Rakuen, but follows the story a salaryman, Mr. Saitou. Mr. Saitou takes you on a journey that explores some serious undertones, but approaches the subjects with incredible sensitivity, respect and some very light and silly humor. There's tons of flavor text to be discovered, pop culture references to be recognized and if you've played Rakuen, familiar characters to meet. As you make your way through the story, there are lots of puzzles that are simplistic, but well thought out in a way that adds to the story.The game is made to be played in 1 sitting that may vary depending on how much you interact with the world. This game can also be played by many ages and is family friendly. You DO NOT have to play Rakuen first to enjoy this game or understand it, but it will definitely add a depth of sentimentality to the game, as there are some call backs. I would absolutely recommend this game to anyone and you may find yourself learning something about your own life during Mr. Saitou's journey.Have a long day!",

    "prompt": "以下の2つのデータグループを比較して、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない表現パターンや内容の特徴を特定してください。\n\n【グループA】\n- Where to start.... in short entire game is boring and very slow paced for no aparent reason.\n\nAI: AI performs only very basic functions and does not upgrade buildings and does the opposite of whats beneficial for your empire. AI does not do very well when engaging in displomacy.\n\nUI: You will spend most of your time trying to manage/hover around very CLUMSY and absolutely disgusting UI. Other 4x games offer far superior UI and make is easier to manage your asset on the field e.g. Sword of the stars II, Star Ruler 2, Distant world, Endless Legends, Endless Space etc.\n\nGFX: Graphics are not the top notch what you would expect from a modern 4x game but they are on far with Endless Legends. GFX leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nAlien Races: I dont need to say much but like Planets most of the races are COPY / PASTE. Nothing unique or special about each. \n\nMP: Multiplayer has a mind of its own and in most cases wont let you join public games unless its a private game.\n\nStellaris bring nothing new to 4x Genre in 2016!.\n Right now everyone is almost beta testing for the developers so we can find bugs, report them  and help them fix their game. Why not let players do beta before before release? But then there is  a question of sale and refund. \n\nBut overall this game does offer amazing soundtrack.\n- This game is great and is worth the cost, I have not tried it in VR yet but I imagine it's great....I have a slight urge to join the US military all of a sudden...\n- My profile pic is the reaction i have towards the game devs that made this game.\nVisually disgusting, gameplay wise impossible and over all terrible.\nWhile it's possible to beat it and get all the achievements it's difficult and also the space level is actually visual aids it's so disgusting to look at that you can't even focus on the gameplay.\nNot worth it even for free which is how i probably got it i can't remember and i don't want to...\n- A solid \"Get Va11HallA instead, unless this is on sale. Otherwise, maybe.\".\n\nCoffee Talk: Fantasy Coffee-brewing Action, is a day-by-day visual novel with slight coffee-brewing mechanics on the side. Its storyline is broken up into several days, of which customers visit your coffee shop and talk. The first few days are rather short: no longer than a few minutes, but as the story advances the days become more packed with story. The game as a whole is rather short, less than 3 hours to complete the main storyline. Overall, generally a well rounded game, but not $15. On the other hand, it compares rather poorly to Va11halla, a game with a nigh identical format, but has more characters, story, and charm. If you liked Va11halla, and really can't wait for N1RVAnnA, then get it on sale. Otherwise, just get Va11halla. But I'm still recommending it because steam doesn't allow maybes, and there's very little competition for this niche of VN.\n- Don't buy this game if you are planning a full co-op playthrough with a friend.\n\nAt first we thought only story progress wasn't shared which was fine as we'd both get to experience the missions regardless. However it turns out that all unlocks tied to completing each area such as new guns, cars and basically all the things you'd want to progress in are locked for the person who isn't hosting. This means your partner is stuck with the level 1 unlocks from start to finish unless they go back and do everything in their game as well.\n\nCompletely pointless and took us until clearing one of the lieutenants for us to realise this, bought this a while back too so not gonna be able to get a refund. Worst implemented co-op I have seen in a long time.\n- It's a cute point and click.\nI am salty though that it's tagged \"choices matter\" as they most certainly do not\n- Do I really have to write this review? I am just one in thousands of people who wrote a positive reveiw for Garry's Mod. Chances are, this review will never convince someone to buy Garry's Mod. It'll just be lost in the 100,000 positive reviews out there. Well, here I go anyway.\n\n\"Where do I start?\" This is the question asked by anyone playing Gmod for their first time. It's also my question that I ask about this review I am writing. Hmm...\n\n_The gameplay...the gameplay...hmm... Well, there's singleplayer sandbox. You can do...uh, whatever you want really. Just addon a few addons, and you can be entertained for hours. Battle NPCs, make cool scenes for cool screenshots, explore maps, be a superhero (spiderman addon!), and much, much, much, much- you get my point, right? Almost all content is user-generated. Make your own content! Multiplayer. In Multiplayer Gmod you can roleplay. I'm talking normal RP (DarkRP), Military RP, Star Wars RP, etc, etc. In multiplayer Gmod, you can battle, prophunt (yay), hide 'n seek, and much, much, more.\n\n_Graphics? I'll rate the graphics...drumroll please... 7/10. This game is and older game. Came out in 2006. I guess the graphics are good for 2006, and people enjoy the game and don't complain much about the graphics, but I'm not gonna lie, they are outdated and look old. It's not 2006 anymore.\n\n_Hear the bullets flying. The zombies growling. The people chatting. The boxes jumping... The sound in this game is great! Every sound is loud and clear, and there are a varitey of sounds.\n\n_Play this game. Play it again. Play it some more. Play some now, and play some later. Play it over and over. Play it as long as you want.\n\n_My Personal opinion. Get this game. Now. Get Gmod on sale or not. I'm not gonna stop playing it for a while and I'm already at 50+ hours of playtime. I love this game! WAIT! Before you go and buy this, then you wonder why there are all the missing maps and errors in most games, get Counter Strike: Source, so ALL the textures are supported. You need it to play MOST multiplayer games.\n\n\nGameplay: 9/10\nGraphics: 7/10\nStory: N/A\nSound: 8/10\nReplayability: 10/10\n\nOverall 8.5\n\nEven though, this is one positive review on Garry's Mod, out of the thousands of positive reviews that have been submitted Garry's Mod, I hope this one convinces you to buy... Gmod\n\n-Star_Hawk_\n- Ignore all the copers who think because they beat Celeste they're a platforming master. This game is a rage precision platformer, it's supposed to be hard, but the best part is that it doesn't even have to be. That's why there is AN OPTION TO SET THE DIFFICULTY IN THE SETTINGS, and if you somehow are too proud to just tone it down a bit to get a better experience and instead decide to blame the game and its developer, then why are you even playing video games in the first place. They're supposed to be fun. This game can be a rage platformer, but it can also be a casual one. It depends on what you want.Will you snail has a great soundtrack, great level design, and super interesting story and lore. Is the game too hard? Change the difficulty. Do you not care about the story? Ignore the optional dialogue. It's that easy. This game is really really good, and don't let anyone convince you otherwise, especially people who can't deal with the fact that the rage game is hard\n- An amazingly fun and short adventure from the creator of Rakuen. Mr. Saitou is a game based in the same universe as Rakuen, but follows the story a salaryman, Mr. Saitou. Mr. Saitou takes you on a journey that explores some serious undertones, but approaches the subjects with incredible sensitivity, respect and some very light and silly humor. There's tons of flavor text to be discovered, pop culture references to be recognized and if you've played Rakuen, familiar characters to meet. As you make your way through the story, there are lots of puzzles that are simplistic, but well thought out in a way that adds to the story.The game is made to be played in 1 sitting that may vary depending on how much you interact with the world. This game can also be played by many ages and is family friendly. You DO NOT have to play Rakuen first to enjoy this game or understand it, but it will definitely add a depth of sentimentality to the game, as there are some call backs. I would absolutely recommend this game to anyone and you may find yourself learning something about your own life during Mr. Saitou's journey.Have a long day!\n- I had to purchase Scarlet Hollow after witnessing the excitement of Episode 4 through my friends. I immediately binged the first three episodes the following day and found myself and in rather different spot compared to their playthrough. The choices you make in SH are actually impactful - which is (unfortunately) quite refreshing for the genre! I've since run through several different routes to explore more of the story (and collect those achievements!). While you have the ability to skip through previously seen text, lines within replayed conversations are shaped by your selected traits, choices, and previously selected dialogue; you won't be skipping that many lines before seeing new content. Similarly, characters may be painted in an entirely different light based on choices you've made. The cast and writing truly nails the small town feel of SH (gossip and all). \n\nMake sure you eat the takeaway container in the fridge. Thank me later.\n- ORIGINAL REVIEW Posted: Nov 27, 2016:\nExtremely fun and addictive game! That IS if you practice and learn the way the game is supposed to be played.\n\nActually requires a lot of patience, aim control, learning of map locations, etc.\n\nEdit Dec 7, 2018: Stupid crazy full with hackers, now that it's F2P i feel like it's gonna get taken over by even more hackers... RIP 2012 CSGO.\n\nEDIT 2021/09/03: Some of you are morons here... Clearly a huge \"fan\" base of CSGO. I've gathered around 9,000+ hours in total (in my other account as well) No. I wasn't a \"Noob\" or had no skill. I was GE for a very long time.\n\nThis review is from 2018. After all the new updates came into place. I LOVED the game, It was my addiction. After those updates, everything went down hill. MORE toxicity, MORE blatant hackers, and I for one wasn't a big fan of the newest updates. So I decided to leave, updated this review with my most recent experience.\nReviews are meant to talk about your experience, Not to kiss ass and make things look good when they aren't.\n- An instant classic.\n---\n\nThe original [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/kunovega/recommended/264200]One Finger Death Punch[/url] was an unexpected treat for me. The refined simplicity of just two buttons that require masterful timing to create a legitimate fighting experience laid out to a selection of music that reminds you of the classic Kung-fu movies of the 1970's but packaged with a carefree stickman aesthetic.\n\nOne Finger Death Punch 2 is a respectable sequel in most ways. The core gameplay is fundamentally the same while the visual indicators and special attack animations have been upgraded and made more fanciful. Other things are changed simply to give you a new experience.\n\nEvery aspect of the game is polished from the interesting tutorial to the many additional modes (survival, gauntlet, etc.) that exist beyond the (very long) main campaign. Once you get into the groove there's potentially dozens if not hundreds of hours of fun to squeeze from this.\n\nThis is a game that just has to be played to truly appreciate it as the feel of your interaction along with the music is what really defines the experience. Simply watching it or looking at the screenshots doesn't do it justice.\n\nThere are a couple of (minor) controversial changes that may not appeal to some fans:\n1. The music in 2 includes a more modernized remix compared to the more traditional music from 1. Personally I love the soundtracks from both, but there are people who have a preference.\n2. The upgrades to special attacks in 2 can be a bit of visual clutter at times. I like both styles, but there are people who prefer 1 over 2.\n3. There are some sequences (like the lightsword rounds) which did not return in 2, replaced instead by other weapons. While I think it would have been cute to include all of that along with the new stuff, it's not a deal breaker. It does however mean that both games retain a bit of unique flair and a reason for you to play and experience them both. 2 is overall an upgrade, but it's also not a 100% replacement.\n\nI would strongly suggest that if you've never played either game, you should begin with the first one. I think it's a better entry point to the series and might have a slightly broader appeal. (it's also slightly cheaper).\n\nThen if you find yourself enjoying it, come back and pick up 2 and you'll find yourself with some remixed music, fancy new special attack animations and a whole new adventure to work through.\n\nJust to be very clear: Both of these games are fantastic and deserve more praise than I can properly express and I'll very likely be putting 100's of hours into this just like I did the first one.\n---\n\nBottom line: Simple to learn, hard to master, and super satisfying fighting along with a great soundtrack.\n---\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38232109/]While you are here, would you consider following my curator page?[/url]\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/kunovega/recommended/]Want to read all of my reviews and not just the curated ones?[/url]\n- [h1]Borderlands 2 - Excellent Story, Solid Gameplay, Great Characters and one of the very best Coop experiences around.[/h1]\n\n[table]\n  [tr]\n    [th][h1]|| 9.5 ||[/h1][/th]\n    [th]Score[/th]\n    [th]Comment[/th]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td]Graphics[/td]\n    [td]8[/td]\n    [td]Borderlands 2 has a visual style all its own, it may not initially impress some used to a \"next generation, high definition, ultra realistic landscape\", but it is nevertheless very appealing and detailed. Some of the landscapes and views around Pandora (the world on which the story takes place) are beautiful and each area has its own look and atmosphere. Characters and enemies are detailed and extremely varied in appearance. You can customise your characters appearance with a large selection of outfits and heads which you can collect throughout the game.[/td]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td]Audio[/td]\n    [td]10[/td]\n    [td]No real killer soundtrack here (apart from the the introduction video), just really good atmospheric music throughout. Where this game really shines is the voice acting for characters, enemies, audio logs and even weapons (yes some of them can talk!). The dialogue is often very funny, helping to explain and drive the story, fill in background and really adds the the immersion.[/td] \n [/tr]\n [tr]\n    [td]Gameplay[/td]\n    [td]9[/td]\n    [td]A mix of FPS and RPG, Borderlands 2 is a lot of fun to play. So many missions to complete, so many enemies to kill, so much loot to grab. You are given massive area's to explore all over the world of pandora filled with creatures, quests, secrets and homages to lots of popular culture. Controls are responsive, intuitive and the game mechanics (even at higher difficulties) feel fair and well thought through. As you progress through the game you will earn xp and levels which allow you to customise your characters skills giving a large variety of gameplay styles.[/td]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td]Story[/td]\n    [td]9[/td]\n    [td]The story in Borderlands 2 is rich and engaging. The action is character driven, and while the main story is fairly linear, the open world nature of the game allows you to take a break from the main story arc and explorer the hundreds of characters and side missions that can be found all over Pandora. It also has one of the most badass, charasmatic and handsome villians of all time... [/td]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td]Replayability[/td]\n    [td]9[/td]\n    [td]So many reasons to replay this game. Firstly the story can be completed at least 3 times with the same character at increasing difficulty and xp levels (normal, true vault hunter and ultimate vault hunter) with progressively better rewards. There is so much detail in the story and so many optional missions that each play through feels different. Next you have at least 4 (more with DLC) characters each with their own skills, playstyle and story to explore. Finally you have tons of loot in the form of Guns, Shields, Grenades, Relics and Class Mods you can collect for your character. These increase in rarity from white (basic) to orange (legendary) generally the rarer the weapon the more damage it will do and many will have additional unique abilities (red text). [/td]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td]Multiplayer[/td]\n    [td]10[/td]\n    [td]For me, this game remains simply the best cooperative multiplayer experiences you can have. Your character's skills really augment and compliment each other when playing as a team. Enemy and mission difficulty automatically adjusts to the amount of players, requiring real teamwork and synergy to avoid dying at higher levels. The multiplayer allows you to connect (drop in and out midgame) to your steam friends games or to public games, connections for the most part feel quick and responsive even with 4 players and with only a small delay on audio communication. [/td]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td][h1]Overall[/h1][/td]\n    [td]9.5[/td]\n    [td]I can't recommend this game enough, while a minority of missions feel like you are just a glorified delivery boy, most are creative, funny and packed full of classic moments and great characters. So much fun to pick up and play with friends. - I haven't really mentioned the DLC (of which there is a lot) in this review but the main ones (Mr Torgue's, Captain Scarlett and especially Tiny Tina's) are all well worth getting (these are included in the Game of the Year edition), great fun to play and add loads more content to the game. To progress to the highest level in the game (level 72 +overpower levels) you will also need the ultimate vault hunter pack 2 so I would recommend that if you reach the end and still want more. [/td]\n  [/tr]\n[/table]\n\nAslo Free DLC (until the 8th July)  \nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/872280\n\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/fancyfishie/recommended]More reviews by Fancy Fish[/url]\n[i]Agree / Disagree? Please leave me a comment[/i]\n- The EOS stands for End of Service. I am sure someone has fun with this or there wouldn't be a reason to keep bringing it back. Right? The usual Tab Target MMO. I do like that you can teleport to quest givers and mobs instead of the usual auto or manual run. Aside from that there isn't anything modern here.\n- This game made me so miserable . \nThe writing can be as funny as heartbreaking \nThe Voice acting is one of the greatest i've ever heard \nA lot of the time , the many side quest were as awesome or even better than the main story (That is already amazing )\n\nPro : The whole game \nCon : Absolutely nothing \n\nIt's one of the greatest gaming experience I've ever had in my 24 years on this earth.\n- This isn't a game. This is the beginning of a crippling JRPG series addiction. 10/10.\n- Fun Tower-Defense style indie game. Definitely one where your skill improves every time you die. And you will die, repeatedly. :P Expect to try out many monster combinations per floor before you find something that can delay the hordes of adventurers long enough to set up the floor beneath! I would probably enjoy some more horizontal progression + permanent upgrades for long term re-playability, but it seems like a solo dev/small scoped project. Definitely worth the price for the current amount of content!\n- Their last privacy agreement update (January 1st, 2021) states they will \"sell\" users information, including name, email and billing address to third party companies (including social media and advertising). There is no other way of playing the game without accepting those terms, very sad practices for a paid game really.\n- This game has (while this review is being written) 10076 reviews. 221 of these reviews are negative. I think this ratio of reviews is deserved and here's why:\n\n- It's a fun story, but not something outstandingly new or anything\n- No one ever can deny that it has an amazing soundtrack\n- The combat is a bit bland, but this is compensated by the fact that the game is pretty short\n- It's a short game, but definitely worth it\n\nOverall: it's just a fun short game to play on a day off. Also, I can't get this soundtrack out of my head! PLEASE SEND HELP!\n- Trash.\nAbsolutely destroyed the game to modify it to give it away for free on epic, to make a shit Chinese company happy.\nStabbing regular and veteran players in the back, that have been playing on steam since the beginning. The stellar update will;\n\n-Reset your side job progression,\n-Reset your skill tree\n-Remove all mod compatibility\n-Remove Linux support.\n\nAll of this for no reason except greed. You have lost my support and confidence.\nWell done Overkill, enjoy your crossplay.\n- This game surprised me in how good it was. I had heard about it, like everyone, and also like a lot of people I had dismissed it as a watered-down Dark Souls clone with a Star Wars skin, and let it collect dust in my Steam collection.\n\nI was wrong. The game's combat is tight and polished, just the right difficulty on Normal. The movement, the general game feel, is superb. The game has a competent story with excellent characterizations, character arcs, dialogue, exposition, world-building, and pacing.  The music feels like top-shelf Star Wars without being a lazy copypasta of John Williams's score (though you'll hear sprinklings of familiar motifs throughout, of course). \n\nThere are collectibles (they are all cosmetics), but it's a tasteful, reasonable amount of them, and they are distributed in a way that feels fun instead of like a chore, and you're never pressured into collecting them with menus or reminders; they are entirely optional in both a technical and a psychological sense. I actually found it fun to collect new appearances in order to play dress-up \"Fashion Souls\". \n\nThere are bosses, and they are challenging but not frustrating. Definitely easier than Dark Souls's harder bosses like Ornstein or Artorias, but still tricky enough that it feels rewarding to overcome them.\n\nIf I had to describe this game in two words, it would be \"just right\". There is just the right amount of each little element that it feels fun, never tedious, never like a grind. I'm a jaded old man who has seen it all and who is not easy to entertain, and I found this game extremely refreshing. If you read this review during the sale where it's only 3.99 USD, get it immediately.\n- PC version doesn't have rebindable controls for controller for some reason\n\nupdate: i have finished the game, still no rebindable controls, i can give a real review now. i wouldn't rate it negative but i wouldn't rate it positive either. this is a \"eh\" review.\n\nthe game is two games at once and neither of them are great.\n\n the roguelike part is like 20% of the game and is very simple and shallow, there's like 5 weapons and they all play the same, its also super easy. its ok but its not as good as a real roguelike.\n\n the cult building part is 80% of the game and is a bit more fun but past the earlygame its a bit eh too. choosing what you get doesn't really matter since you'll unlock everything pretty fast, and the doctrines 90% of the time are a choice between 2 useless things and 10% of the time a choice between a busted thing and a useless thing. the randomly generated quests the followers give you are just chores like revisiting old dungeons you already completed and the reward is pretty much nothing. its ok but its not as good as a real colony builder.\n\nnone of the systems in either part of the game are particularly deep.\n\nas of the time of this review, the game is still quite glitchy, though being patched by the devs.\n\nthe game is about 15 hours with side content and 18 hours for a completionist run. no real replayability \n\ni'd just recommend you get a full on action roguelike if you want to play a roguelike, or a full on colony builder if you want to play a colony builder. this game does both but is not great at either of them. \n\n game is very cute tho and the soundtrack is great. like 5/10\n- WTF, this isn’t gaming! Where are my lootboxes and micro transactions?!\n\nMy main thought after I beat GRIS was, \"I don't really understand anything that just happened, but it sure was pretty.\"\n\nI was absolutely amazed how a game with zero actual dialogue could move me to tears, just on strenght of its visuals and music. In general, the whole theme of dealing with grief/depression spoke to me in a way that I didn't expect.  It's one of those games you play to \"feel\" more than for the gameplay itself.\n\nI have PTSD from dealing with my wife getting a boyfriend, and this game made me cry several times while playing it. Especially during the scene where you're swimming away from the eel. That symbolism to me perfectly captures the feeling of trauma recovery. I'd spent time finding the little lights throughout that section of the game and activating the turtle which ultimately saved me from my own darkness and helplessness.\n\nIt felt like hope. It was such a good representation of how the coping skills I'd learned and the hard work I'd put in were finally seeming to pay off. It's when you're at your weakest that you learn how strong you actually are. I cried like a baby during and after that scene. It made me realize how much I've actually overcome, and how grateful I am to be free.\n\nGris truly is a beautiful game and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a slow paced experience. The only bit of criticism I have for the game is it certainly gives \"not like the other girls\" vibes at times, but I think this is quite easy to get over.\n\nIn conclusion: the visuals are stunning,  the music is beautiful and knows exactly when to kick in, the platforming elements are fantastic, and it’s story and themes are spectacular without a single word. Truly a must-play.\n\n10/10\n- This is a review about the port, not the game. The game itself is fantastic. I reference Moguri Mod throughout the review - this is a fan made mod that aims to improve the visual quality of the port.\n\nThe port is a lazy outdated mess:\n- It's lacking visual FX present in the original, such as the mist in the overworld of the Mist Continent. [b]This was fixed in a patch.[/b]\n- There is no way to restore the original font. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- Dialogue is rendered at a static pace, unlike the original. In the original game, lines of dialogue would show up on screen depending on how fast the character was talking. In this port, there is no distinction. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- There are multiple problems with the battle UI:\n-- It takes 40% of the screen. Square Enix patched this in the console versions, but the PC version was never patched. [b]This patch was released on PC in an update on the 6th of August 2020.[/b]\n-- It's rendered at what feels like 15fps, making navigation feel extremely clunky. In the original game, all menus were rendered at either 30fps interpolated or 60fps (don't know which one exactly), which made the browsing very fluid. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- All menus are clunky to browse because of the crippling low framerate. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- It's missing sound effects from the original. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- Despite porting the game to Unity, Square couldn't be bothered to re-write the animation code to speed up battle animations independently of buff/debuff tick timers, arguably the original game's biggest problem. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- The music in this port is a lower sample version of the original. [u]This is fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- The backgrounds clash horribly with the new character models. [u]This is fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n\nThe ONLY positive of this version is that you can skip the introduction to every battle. Except not really, because the option doesn't work half the time.\n\nThanks to the Moguri Mod, it is arguable that this version comes close to the original. Regardless of my opinion though, I'm not about to praise Square Enix for a port that the fans patched up. Moguri Mod is the only reason to buy this game on Steam.\n- In all honesty, I became a little bored in the middle of playing it. It wasn't until I was almost through with the story that I realized why it had gotten such high ratings. You have no idea how hard it hit me when I realized why he was at the hospital [him being at the hospital is not a spoiler btw], and how relieved I was when he had at last found peace. It was in that moment that I had no regrets in purchasing it and how it was worth my time. Despite how brief the game was, I'm gonna remember it for a while. \n\n\n- [h1] Risk of rain 2 is the kind of roguelike where you wanna have just one more quick run before bed but end up playing till dawn. [/h1]\n\n[b] Visuals: [/b] \nThe art style is easy on the eyes early on, but as the run continues and your screen starts to fill with clutter, the diarrhoea christmas lights at later stages can be seizure inducing.\n\n[b] Story and Setting: [/b] \nRoR2 doesn’t hold hands and guide you through its story because honestly there is not much story going on here. There is rich lore to explore for people who want to.\n\n[b] Music: [/b] \nThe lo-fi melody perfectly fits the perilous environment and matches the gameplay with synced rhythm and tempo. Sound design is good too.\n\n[b] Gameplay and progression: [/b]\nDrop into a planet, kill monsters, get money, buy items. Rinse and repeat until you become powerful to one shot God himself. Fast paced with constant running, jumping, sliding and juggling between primary weapon, secondary weapon, abilities and equipment. In each run the difficulty increases over time, which is an innovative approach to deal with difficulty. The roster is filled with unique characters who each have their own gameplay mechanics, making the game feel completely different. \nMost items can be obtained by completing specific challenges. You can also unlock game modifiers to make the game easier or more difficult to your liking. The challenges are one-of-a-kind, and the rewards are meaningful enough to keep players interested.\n\n[b] Game time: [/b]\nThere is no limit. It stops being fun when you decide so.\n\n[b] Online: [/b]\nThere is co-op to enjoy with friends and difficulty scales with the number of players. And if you have no friends, rest assured because all achievements are attainable through single player.\n\n[b] Bugs: [/b]\nNo bugs or technical issues.\n\n[b] PC Requirement: [/b] \nWithout a decently powerful PC the game faces severe lags and occasional crashes in long runs where you loop multiple times and a million things are happening in the background. Lowering graphical settings can help to an extent.\n\n[b] DLC: [/b]\nSurvivors of the Void DLC adds excellent new characters, stages, items,  enemies and alternate endings.\n\n[b] Price: [/b]\nWorth every penny.\n\n[b] My only problem with the game is it doesn’t have a save system. Once you start a run, you will have to see it through to the end. I want to be able to stop at any stage and continue from there later on. I don’t always have hours required to do multiple loops in one sitting. Although there is a mod for saving, I would love a native option. [/b]\n\n[b] Rating: [/b] \nThe Devs are continuously supporting and updating the game which is commendable. The community is very active and you can add tons of community made [b] mods [/b] to breathe new life into your game. \nI highly recommend it. [b] 10/10 [/b]\n- Based on the generic, cartoonish-sounding name and (at first glance) Hearthstone-looking graphics, I initially ignored Monster Train. But I later read some praise for it that made me think it might be worth a look. Especially since it turned out that I already owned it from a bundle or something. \n\nAnd what I discovered was a compelling mix of the best elements of Slay the Spire and My Life as a Darklord. A run generally takes less than an hour, and with so many possible combinations there's always something new to explore and try to exploit.\n- To be completely honest, throughout my entire playthrough, I was thinking on giving this game a \"Not Recommended\" but it really wouldn't have deserved it. This game is at the same time both very difficult to recommend as to not recommend. It is really a beatiful and extremely original game, with a pretty well told interesting story. However, the problem it has is that it doesn't really work as a puzzle game. Puzzle solutions don't make logical sense most of the time and you end up brute forcing your way through most of the game. This means trying every posibility until something works and moves the story foward, and this is just not good puzzle design. This also distracts you from the story being told, which is in itself not so easy to understand, it requirers you to be paying attention to details, so your brain has to be constantly switching between \"puzzle mode\" and \"story mode\". Anyway, you can tell a lot of love was put into this game, and that is why I ultimately recommend it.\n7.5/10-\n- Read all the 10 negative reviews for the game, and not a single positive review is present. All the reviews are fairly accurate to what the game presents to its players. A tacky First-Person Shooter with bad FPS rates, mediocre animations and effects, as well as a cursor that is not even aligned to the target pointer. No comment on the goal, as it is either self-explanatory, or the audio and Sound effects, as it was nothing note-worthy.\n\nIn short, not a single pro is evident in this game, or in my experience during playing. By the end of it, I simply ran Tales of Destruction for the Trading Cards, then uninstalled, and proceeded to Hide from library.\n\nTales of Destruction is not worth a single cent, nor is it worth playing.\n- Took me a while to play this because there were some critical bugs during release day, but the devs worked hard to fix everything up.\n\nNow, this is the premium version of Mad Father which is not just a straight re-release of the free version, but an upgraded one (in many ways, I'm told). Better graphics, better level design, better everything. It's a really tight experience without any filler and with an interesting story, so any fans of RPGMaker-type horror games will find this a highly enjoyable experience.\n\nYou can also increase the game's window size, so don't worry if you're running a high-resolution display. This is a feature that is not exactly common for these types of games, but this game has got you covered.\n\nI'm looking forward to future games from the dev!\n- And that's it, after 278 hours of play, the adventure is over... \nThis type of game that you wish you could forget so you could rediscover it like the 1st time, where you discover everything, a bit like a child\nIt's a game made with passion for video games, to tell a story, to make the player laugh too, and to make him a little melancholic or horrified or even sickened sometimes\n\n[u]Divinity OS 2 will have marked my young adult life[/u], like Sonic and megadrive games, Pokémon, FFTactics, Zelda and gameboy / gamecube games, Warcraft3 (TT), or Mass Effect and other PC games did in my childhood and adolescence (I surely forget so much excellent games)\n\nIt's a 20/20 for me. The work is titanic. The game is really made with passion. The studio is very talented.\n\nSo when Steam asks me [i]\"Do you recommend this game\"[/i], I say:\nYes! Because this is where you feel that video games are an experience, an adventure to live! \nI went through Rivellion with my buddy, like I went through Kanto (Pokémon), or Ivalice in FF Tactics as a kid!\n\n\n[u][b]Atmosphere:[/b][/u]\nMany of us probably remember our adventures in Pokémon or other games in our childhood. We roamed, discovered and lived in these worlds!\n\nHere, it's the same thing, and not alone this time: I was with a very good friend! \nWe met frequently to venture into the world of Divinity as a lightning lizard warrior or a skeletal assassin with a mysterious past...\n\nWith our companions Lohse and Ifan, and Maladie, and Gareth, and Jahan and Han the survivor kid and Sir Lora and so many others. Impossible to forget... \n[i]They exist! Stop lying, I know they exist ![/i]\n\nOur choices were important: We decided to do justice to this or that person, provoking reactions (or death) in certain characters, slapping a few Magisters around when necessary\nAnd of course, we STRONGLY decided to stea... Borrow a lot of spells and equipments from the merchants, while the other one was distracting by chatting...\n... What? We didn't have the money and we had to save the world ! Well, we had the money, but you never know, maybe one day we will need it... !\nAnd then stealing, it's fun. And exhilarating hehehe\n\n\n[u][b]Gameplay:[/b][/u]\nA 3D tactical turn-based game, to play with friends. Really ! Don't play this game alone, I'm sure that with at least 1 buddy (or 3!), you will exploit the game to its full potential!\n\nAlso, [u]you can change your skills and class at any moment in the game[/u], it's very flexible ! I played rogue all my game, and in the last chapiter, I decided to play with spear and War skills ! I really enjoyed being able to switch like this, as I want ! The game want you to take FUN, not \"suffering\" your \"bad\" class choices !\n\nToo bad, I don't know anyone who is ready to take on the role of a GM (Game Master), to live a personalized campaign! Because it is a mode apart from the main campaign!\n\n\n[u][b]Music:[/b][/u]\nExtremely good and fits perfectly with the atmosphere of the game. This kind of OST that we listen to when we work and that makes us live our adventures again when the song becomes EPIC!\n\n\n[u][b]In summary:[/b][/u]\nTitanic content, assured re-playability for those who wish to know what would have happened if they had answered something else than \"FIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT\", and I repeat, the fact of being able to play with friends makes the game so much more pleasant to do!\n\n\n[b]*Sob*[/b]\nBut no, I'm not crying... I'm just allergic to emotions!\n\nI would like so much to forget this game to be able to rediscover it\n\nPlease play it, at least give it a try, and let yourself be immersed in Div's world!\n\nIn our case, we will do it again in HARDCORE mode !\n\nPeace guys !\n- Overall the concept and idea of the game is good and I would recommend it. It is worth the price for the amount of fun time you can have with it.\n\nPositives:\n+ Initially the game gives you some good frights and tension\n+ Variety of characters, ethnics and aesthetics to pick and chose from\n+ Variety of skills and abilities that are mostly unique and some have good synergy\n+ Variety of maps\n+ DLC costs are fair\n+ Skin costs are fair\n+ One of very few companies who communicates with the community\n+ A lot of good license characters available\n+ The game has a tutorial that explains the basics\n+ Various ways to play the game (stealth / agressive)\n\nNegatives:\n- A few bugs here and there\n- Some really annoying perks / addons on killers / survivors like 1 shot long range axes (to name an example), keys and moris (to name a few more)\n- Toxic community - Not everyone is toxic but a large portion of players are but lets be real you get that in every game these days\n- Matchmaking is pretty bad (but DBD is trying to fix this)\n- Sometimes unfair hit detection - Some hits look like you are being smacked way out of range or as a killer you see the grab animation on a survivor and then it just cancels out\n- Steep learning curve / unforgiving gameplay. You either have to learn and improve and adapt and overcome or you will be having a bad time as you climb ranks.\n- Some of the tightest controls, buttery smooth animation and gorgeous scenes you'll see all year. I've bought it three times now, (once for me, twice as gifts for friends) and each time was worth it.\n\nSupport developers like these.\n- EDIT:\nRobot Entertainment has decided to dump Gameforge as the EU publisher and publish the game themselves. I would like to applaud their decision. Better late (in this case quite late) than never. However, I will not change this review to recommended for the simple fact that they shouldn't have selected that publisher in the first place. This is what ultimately ruined the EU version of the game, and it should be a good example to any other developers who consider Gameforge as their publisher (although more are more developers are duming Gameforge nowadays). I am not going to edit any of the details below since I haven't played the game after I wrote the original review, but I will most certainly consider returning to the game after the migration of the servers is complete.\n\nHere's the original review:\nPart 1:\nHow To Kill A Potentially Good Game (For Dummies):\n- Make a potentially good game.\n- Give the publishing rights to Gameforge.\n- Done!\n\nI mean, let's take a look at some of the games that Gameforge ruined:\n- Aion EU (utterly dead)\n- Tera EU (completely dead)\n- Soldier Front 2 EU (a.k.a. \"S.K.I.L.L., although the only skill you need for that game is a wallet)\n- Raiderz EU (shut down)\n- Mythos (shut down)\n- Katsuro: Path of Honor (shut down)\n- Hellbreed (shut down)\n... the list goes on ...\n\nWhy would ANYONE in their right mind allow Gameforge to publish their game?! Gameforge is known as the WORST European publisher. No one does business with them anymore and they're close to filing for bankruptcy. They already closed their location in Berlin. Why would you do that, Robot Entertainment?\n\nIt could have been a great game...\n\nPart 2:\nSince some lovely folks commented that they would REALLY (real-time executive realness) want me to review the game itself, and not its publisher, here you go:\n\nPros:\n- Great voice acting. The way they went with it (overly sarcastic) could have ended up being cringy, like the one in Wildstar, but instead, they did a good job with it.\n- Good animations. The game feels like it's polished and well executed.\n- Short queues and loading screens.\n- Interesting tower defence gameplay (as far as the Survival mode goes).\n- Character development and a crafting system.\n- Runs great on a high-end laptop.\n\nCons:\n- Poorly optimized for computers that are supposed to be able to run the game on its minimal settings.\n- Gets quite repetitive quite fast.\n- Grinding for materials can be tedious.\n- The Siege mode needs a lot of work. It is nowhere near as polished as the Survival mode.\n- The Survival mode can be too short at the early levels.\n- The developer decided to give the game to the worst publisher in Europe, and probably even the world. I mean, even EA isn't that bad anymore. I guess Gameforge could compete against Webzen for the first place.\n- You are able to buy almost everything with real cash, and if you don't want to, you better prepare for a long grind.\n- Did I mention how stupid the decision to give the publishing rights to Gameforge was? I think I did, but oh well...\n- The game is basically a cash shop oriented version of OMD! 2.\n\nThere you go! You're welcome.\n\nP.S.: Needless to say, I won't be spending a dime on this game, as long as Failforge gets a cut. I encourage everyone to do the same. Robot Entertainment might get their heads out of their... (you got the point) and change the publisher before it's too late for the game.\n- A Short Hike is a relaxing, casual game about exploring an expansive, mountainous island park and eventually making your way to its summit so you can get cell phone reception.\n\nYou play as Claire, a bird who can climb, glide, and flap to great heights using a stamina system based upon how many golden and silver feathers you’ve collected. Along the path to the mountaintop you’ll encounter Animal Crossing-style characters who are friendly, punny, and usually have some minor task for you to solve, ranging from finding lost items to making deliveries.\n\nHelping residents of the island is completely optional, as is just about every activity in the game other than locating a few feathers and reaching the summit; as a result, length can range from an hour if you don’t stop to smell the roses to a few hours if you decide to make friends with everyone and see all the park has to offer.\n\nActivities include filling out a fishing journal by trading in your catches, digging in suspicious spots, solving treasure map clues, parkour racing, and opening up shortcuts by breaking blocked entrances and watering bouncy flowers. \n\nA Short Hike has a charming aesthetic and a lovely, peaceful soundtrack. I felt driven to see everything the game had to offer despite not being forced into any of it and never lost interest until I did so. It’s a beautiful little world that will make fans of Animal Crossing feel right at home.\n- Only one word to describe this game\n\nOutdated.\n\nThere is no real point to get this game unless you want a slightly better looking UI and atmosphere. L4D2 already contains the campaigns from L4D1 and is where the entire Left 4 Dead community is. Only a small playerbase still plays l4d1, mostly out of nostalgia. But there is quite literally no reason to get the game.\n\nYou can grab it if you are into achievements, but only do so when it goes on sale, i grabbed it for a couple penny, still a bad idea.\n- [I received this product for free from a giveaway]. Only played for a short time, but sheesh, it's a bit of a mess both visually and gameplay wise. There's not much I can really say that would differ from what's shown in the trailer (rather crude MS-paint looking drawings with a few short looping backgrounds). You jump when moving right or left, flappy-bird esque, you dodge stuff going across the screen and from the top, which is a bit boring to me, but some may enjoy it more. You also have to go out of the screen to dodge sometimes, but also if you go too far out (who knows how far) you'll die as well. It might be an okay time waster for free (like old flash games), but I wouldn't recommend spending your money on this.\n- Great game, Horrible new publishers who stole the IP from the original creators. Do not support these thieves\n- If you notice that Kagami voice sounds different, that’s because the guy who voiced him in the first game, Brad Venable, died at the beginning of last year. This time, Kagami is voiced by Austin Lee Mathews, who voiced Roche (Final Fantasy VII Remake) and Ash Carbide (Cold Steel III and IV). \n\nRest In Peace, Brad. We may forget Kaniza’s name, but we won’t forget yours. And thank you for being one of the funniest character in the game.\n- Is Duskers a fun game? Yes. Would I recommend it? No, because of one simple reason:\n\nA lack of content with no mod support.\n\nDuskers is a little like No Man's Sky in the sense that the first few hours are filled with fun and wonder, but everything afterwards becomes a disappointment because the game turns out to be far more shallow than it initially seemed. As a player, I yearned to explore more of the randomly generated galaxy in Duskers because I wanted to see what other horrors, mods, and derelict types I would encounter in the empty universe - but in the end, it turned out that there was really very little else to see besides what you find in the first couple of hours. \n\nHere's a quick rundown of where the content was most lacking:\n\n--Enemy types: there's only 4 different enemies. FOUR. They also behave pretty much identically with the exception of the last one.  This was definitely the biggest interest-killer for me. \n\n--Derelict types end up mattering very little. Government A? Salvage C? Military B? It really doesn't change the layout in a particularly noticeable fashion, with the only differences being 1-2 extra ship defense turrets or something like that. \n\nI really, really wanted to give Duskers a thumbs up - I loved the aesthetic, I loved the atmosphere, and I loved the unique command line interface - but unfortunately, after a few hours, I came to realize that there's really just not enough actual content here, and that's heartbreaking for fans of this niche genre like myself.\n\n\n- The Steam trailer really doesn't do this game justice.\n\nIts extremely early access right now, and the gameplay itself is nothing too spectacular (yet), but the super dynamic proximity chat is what really makes this game for me.\nHearing the muffled screams of someone getting choked out by a bug, followed shortly after by the panicked wails of another crewmember running for the life, is likely one of the funniest things I have ever experienced in a video game.\nIt truly is such a simple, yet infinitely expandable mechanic that I am really exited to see build upon in the future.\n\nPERSONAL IDEA IF THE DEVS READ THIS REVIEW:\nA monster that picks a target to stalk and follow silently. While stalking, the monster records whatever its target says, then, after it has stalked enough and kills it target, it turns from a hunter to an ambush predator. Staying stationary in the dark and playing the recorded sounds of its now dead target in order to lure in their friends.\nImagine hearing your friend, rounding the corner, and realizing that your friend is already long dead...\n- As a current spec op who has seen conflict in China, North Korea and Dust II, it's clear to me this game is barely mil-sim YET much more than another arcade type shooter ala COD. Within the weapon systems selection, well I'd say its pretty sparse as are the clothing options but where this game shines is in the finite number of deaths one can suddenly have, somewhat similar to the amount of coronary artery blockages the average American can withstand before succumbing to a cheeto dust infused death ride to St. Michaels gate.\n\nGraphically it is fine, runs well on my beastly PC (which is to be expected given the salary i earn putting my life on the line daily), seems to have very few glitches/bugs.\n\nThe sounds are way off though and needs a revamp on what actually body dismemberment should actually be like.\n\nUltimately what makes this game worth it is the player based, often I find myself among enthusiastic Aussies calling me the roo rider and exclaiming how fast my fast twitch reflexes are.\n\n8.3/10\n- First off, the graphics pictured here are NOT what the game looks like. Even in Ultra mode it doesn't come close to looking this \"good.\" \n\nSecond, this game is best played with a controller. Not that I mind this, but after years of mouse + keyboard play it was difficult to get used to switching over.\n\nThird, it says you can alter the dungeon and create new paths and doorways and etc. I received an item that supposedly allowed me to do this but I couldn't get it to work.\n\nFinally, for the price of this game, it should be something spectacular. It wasn't. I've purchased $10 games on Steam that are much better than this. Wait for a big sale if you're interested in this game.\n- WHERE ARE MY OG DS FANS OF THIS GAME? REJOICE BRUDDAS!\n\nNo but seriously, I loved this game to DEATH when it first came out on the DS and to now see an HD version of this game on steam. It's quite a whiplash but a good one! To anyone who loves mystery/ detective games, YOU NEED TO GET THIS!!! Good story, soundtrack and gameplay <3 AHHHHHH!!!\n- Instant uninstall after reading the privacy policy.\n\nShort version: \"We may collect any data we want (including sensible personal data) from the user and transmit it to anyone the laws allow us to. Also we may transmit your data to any foreign country where other (read: laxer) data protection laws may apply.\"\n\nUpon installation and booting up the game, the very first thing you will be asked to do is accept these conditions and enter your age so they can send it (together with other data) to third parties which will then show you \"appropriate\" advertisement ingame.\n\nYeah SEGA, aint no way I am saying yes to that. Uninstalled and refund requested.\n- One of my favorite Rockstar games to-date (next to Max Payne).\n\nThe negative review is for the awful DRM they've implemented, where you can't play SINGLE player if the Rockstar Launcher servers are offline.\n\nThe fact that there are people who pirated this game who can play it forever, while the people who payed for it are at the mercy of Rockstar and their DRM servers being online (for an offline game) is a joke.\n\nBuyer beware.\n- Tentative review of game in progress, but so far it is amazing and I had to leave a review in support of it.  As far as the game itself goes, I'm giving it a 9/10.  As far as the port goes, the lack of keyboard input prompts seems frustrating when they already have the ability to change between xbox and ps4 buttons, but I use a controller and expect most will for this, but it's worth mentioning in the sake of fairness and accuracy.  There is a certain graphics setting called \"effects\" with high and low.  High is causing major fps drops under certain conditions even on a pc with an rtx 3080 and a 5800x cpu.  Devs have acknowledged it and are working on improving it.  Other than these issues though, no problems at all.  Online play has been smooth and i haven't experienced any disconnects.  The game itself has only crashed once in 93 hours, but that was also during excessive alt tabbing while the game was in true fullscreen mode, and it crashed on an alt-tab itself, so I'm not really blaming the game on that one given it was the only time.  Again, overall the game is playing great and I have no problems with it on a functional level as well as an entertainment level, I just want to be as fair and accurate as I can, and these were really the only problems I could find with it.\n- Today I stooped playing this game and uninstalled the game because it has a very bad development, very bad events, the worst reward, messy customer support and poor player' gaming, all my friends quit this game until me at the last movement, today a player was attacking and killing troops in the farming nodes for gain a event ranking, 20K a 30K troops vs. 100K troops nice balance very funny, I will not recommend this game.\n- So this is what upsets me about rainbow six siege as a casual player. I bought the starter edition like a moron. Thats on me. But I wasn't sure I'd like the game. Turns out I do. So now that I realize I like the game I want to fully purchase the game. Turns out you can't upgrade starter to standard. The game legit punishes people who want to play it. Who paid money to basically test if they would enjoy the game.  Why should I pay $55 for a $40 edition? Just let me pay $25 for the $40 edition. I already paid the money. Why are you punishing me for wanting to spend more?\n- This is how a Remake should be made, feels and plays much better than the original. The overall game design be it characters or the level is amazing! No doubt this is the best RE game ever, a true Masterpiece! Definitely recommended!! \nThe first playthrough should last anywhere between 15-17hrs.\n- Yeah sooooo I went 1k words past the max...had to pare this down...it's ok...I'm mentally stable...\n\nCrossCode is a top-notch indie in its genre. I'd mention it in the same breath as Celeste, Hades, and Outer Wilds. (guess I just did.) If you can at least enjoy both puzzles and real-time combat, this game is for you; it's not as much of a JRPG as it might look. The only real flaw I care to levy is that it isn’t incredible out of the gate; it’s merely good, and gets much better. I was going to summarize my reactions and add a \"what is the premise/gameplay loop\" section and have longer sections but I had to cut it all out so have _/5 ratings on the section titles instead. It's fine. I'm fine. Everything is fine.\n\nOk, review time.\n\nSTORY 4/5 NEATO\n\nThe story is great, and not quite what you might expect. It starts pretty light and cozy, with solid (and often meta) humor interspersed with cryptic moments. I like how casually the in-universe MMO is treated by the players. I enjoyed all the characters, including our mostly-mute but personable Lea. Once it ramps up, the story takes some exciting turns, too; the devs really know how to do drama without doing overdrama. I didn't relate too much to the story but I think it was told quite well. I like the portrayal of the antagonists for the most part, though I wish I could have felt their presence more often. The lore is also fascinating, if occasionally hard to grasp because the line between real and virtual is very thin due to the game’s particular premise. (The difference between real people and NPCs is sometimes unclear, for instance.) The ending was good, but I think the DLC epilogue wraps the game up far better.\n\nCOMBAT 5/5 WOWIE\n\nWhen you start out, combat feels almost hack-n-slashy. You can spam melee attacks and bullets for days, but you also have a charged projectile, a dodge-dash, and a shield. The elemental modes are absolutely the highlight due to the way enemies work, and the sort of limiter gauge they have forces strategy. Special moves are stylish and borderline absurd at higher levels. A huge skill tree controls them and much more; unlike some skill trees, this one requires choices, which is always a good sign. Oh and consumables are your main source of healing and buffs, and they aren't overpowered! Balancing win.\n\nThe enemies are really what make the combat fantastic. Almost every enemy has at least one gimmick and one visible weakness. The stun gauge mechanic is vital to all battles, forcing you to exploit those weaknesses to stun enemies and give you time to use your extra-long special moves. Bosses love to give you iterative micro-puzzles to fill their stun gauges, while minibosses are comfortably in-between. Bosses commonly have armor or invulnerability when not stunned, forcing even overleveled players to figure out the micro-puzzles to hit hard. (More great balancing.) Most weaknesses involve the element system, eventually encouraging you to swap elements multiple times mid-fight. The micro-puzzles will build on what you’ve been learning in a dungeon if it’s a dungeon fight. I'll mention that some normal enemies do feel like damage sponges at first, but you'll get used to this; the simple enemy design in the early game makes it seem worse than it is imo.\n\nPUZZLES 5/5 FUN COOL\n\nFor puzzles you've got your common environmental \"platforming\" puzzles, your specialized quest puzzles, your dynamic mini-puzzles in battles, and your iterative puzzling gauntlets in dungeons. Also almost everything is secretly part puzzle? Like, everything. They're an invasive species. They draw most of their complexity from the element system too. Each element has its own effects on certain objects and structures, and mainly you use charge shots to interact, though each attack has its own uses. Not much to say here; they're great puzzles. A couple may stump you for a while, but that's impossible to avoid, and I think CrossCode strikes a perfect challenge balance.\n\nQUESTS 5/5 WHEEEEEE\n\nWhile some quests conform to the typical hunting/gathering quests of MMOs, most boast some entirely unique content. Challenges range from unique bosses to puzzles to platforming to other familiar gimmicks that are secretly also puzzles. I won't spoil them. Quests generally use mechanics you have seen already in new, often very different, scenarios. NPCs are mostly there to be amusing or set up the gameplay, and that didn't bother me tbh.\n\nITEM MANAGEMENT 5/5 AAAAA\n\nItem and equipment acquisition? Engaging? WTF? Technically you get them like you do in any RPG. But, rare plants have high rare item drop rates, so if you know the platforming puzzle to reach em you don't have to waste much time. Enemies' drop rates rise with a high Combat Rank, which you get by killing many enemies in a row before the post-fight cooldown period ends and you get to heal to full and level up. This is tough until you're very comfortable with the area. Once you are, it's a whole new way of battling, using area knowledge to string together sequential fights. And what does the game do but give you a piece of upgradable equipment that grants the Combat Rating bonus to plants too?\n\nI actually cared about the equipment in the game too! *kisses Life Fiber Uniform* (yes they really make this reference) Equipment also matters more than level so the devs can control your power level better. Most times you can buy some basic equipment to explore, then return with items to trade to NPCs for stronger gear. Stronger gear has unique traits and you might prefer one over another, so it's nice that with trading you get to focus your resources on what you want. Sometimes you can trade some enemy drops for other ones, as I recall, which is a nice...uh, trade-off to get to make.\n\nQUALITY OF LIFE 5/5 HELP\n\nCONVENIENCE REIGNS in CrossCode. Text log like in visual novels? Check. Encyclopedia of story recaps, character summaries, CrossWorlds lore & terminology, etc.? Check. Enemy index? Check. Item drop rates? Check. Available trades? You beck. This is EXTREMELY helpful for an RPG, which otherwise would require a guide or plain luck to find rare item drops. Oh yeah also there's UI? I forgot about it cuz it's really good. Also the keyboard controls for swapping elements are a bit janky but I managed.\n\nAesthetics 3/5-5/5 SUBJECTIVITY WOOOOOO\n\nYeah if ya like what you see in the trailers and screenshots, that oughta be enough. I thought the art was average-good in the beginning, but like everything else the art improves as you go. They must’ve gone back and worked on old stuff, but not too much. The music is great. No complaints there. My one objective critique is, Lea has no depth perception -- the art makes similar-height platforms look identical. I ran into so many walls and stared at so many small flat gaps I thought I couldn't cross. I'm not a fool! It's the game's fault! But actually this time!\n\nA NEW HOME DLC 6/5 WTF OMG\n\nThe paid DLC is The Culmination of CrossCode. The epilogue is complex and fascinating and rewarding. The dungeon is an incredible all-elements send-off. I adore the new quests. And the art?? The environments, the enemies, the NPC portraits are all so pretty. Don't be fooled by the letters \"DLC\": this is not Discretionary Leisure Content. If you liked the base game, this is...Deluxe...eLite...C-content??? look these are not great letters to work with ok\n\nCONCDLUDSIONO\n\nWhat else to say? CrossCode good. Buy it. Do the thing. Also, look out for Project Terra, Radical Fish's next project. It translates their current style into a 3D environment with dynamic lighting. It’s pretty & it reduces that height perspective issue. There isn’t much info about it out yet, but keep your eyes out! (figuratively pls) I'm excited for what they'll come up with.\n\nHOLY **** I MADE IT AND WITH CHARACTERS TO SPARE YESSSS — ohnowai\n- When I show new games to one of my friends she always asks if it is possible to pee in the game and sadly I usually must tell her that it isnt possible because there is so few games where this special detail is being paid attention to. But this here my dude! I tried to show her the game yesterday so I got her setup on the valve index and start the game all good, but we couldn’t move at all... We tried everything! We tried physically move in our vr room to see the boards that had text written on them because we spawned behind them which I found a little weird as well. On the board it said eat the hamburger to start the game or eat the poo to guit. I saw a box on the street and I remembered by seeing the trailer there was a box where inside there was a burger so immediately we worked hard to try and reach the burger so we could start the game. It was too far away for us to try and actually in real life walk to it so we had to just accept defeat. She didn’t get to see her first vr game where it would be possible to urinate. I saw a update post a few minutes ago where you were saying something about movemnet in the game that you have to grip and throw arms around or something? This I guess we didn’t try since usually moving is one of the triggers to teleport or just the stick like in any controller. Today we will try again and hopefully succeed in our task to urinate in a vr game! You could be making history today my friend. And for all the bad reviews for this game I want to just say a couple things: cmon dude. Its one guy whos making this game! It is cheap and early access... those already tell you a lot about the game and you should not expect a triple a title and the experience of the century. I went through a video game making school or whatever which took 3 years so it was not 2 weeks online course I just quit after the first week so I actually know a lot what it takes to make games and with this I can tell there has been some hours used to it, but again it’s only one dude. My game didn’t work either, but it might have been because we didn’t know how to play. I’m not complaining for 4 dollars, I’m not a hobo ;)\n\nEDIT: And there it is! A day after my review and a 170mb update with new features and a fix for not been able to play at all :) I wasn't able to walk earlier either, but I suppose yo may not be able to in the \"mainmenu\". Gotta go try the update once my friend visits again!\n- Early Access Review:\nPros: \n- Hilarious flavor text in the form of Books and Proverbs. Seriously, someone took a lot of time creating all that.\n- Really enjoyable music\n- Beautiful pixel art\n- Engaging and interesting story\n- Overall very fun introduction to a huge world\n- Highly responsive dev team that's not only advacing on completion of the game but actively listens to their already large community of players\n- There's a lot of secrets and things to do that you might run out of time to do before the end of the year deadline. You may find yourself needing to play the early access a few times to find everything.\n\nCons:\n- This is early access folks, there's going to be a few bugs here and there\n- The early access content ramps up really fast and gets very interesting and then ends with you really wanting to know what's next. This is really only a con because I'm really impatient and want the full game asap. ;)\n- So this game was very fun to play with my friend... that is until it began to stop working on starting the game i have looked at the ubisoft forums and guess what many other people have had this problem starting from the games release and ubisoft has done nothing to fix this problem. i got off easy i paid $20 for this game on sale the people who payed $60+ not so lucky so dont risk it and DONT by this ubishit game\n- Homeworld is typically known as the very first 3D RTS -- despite this distinguishing trait, it's not very popular. It's rather obscure, which I find odd for a game that was made with so much love and detail. The story of the two Homeworld campaigns is very nice, the aesthetic of the game is excellent in my opinion, but when it comes to the multiplayer, in vanilla 2.1 Homeworld, the current version, you will face severe balancing issues between the races.\nFortunately, the community has come up with a solution, one that took a lot of time and effort to be. Thanks to them, the multiplayer is now playable with the patch that they made -- the 2.3 players patch. It's still being updated and is worked on by people who understand the overall concept of the game and the genre it belongs to.\nIt's available to everyone in the workshop and is in my opinion (and a lot of others's) the best way to experience both multiplayer and the game itself.\n- \"It has guns, swords, sexy characters, cheesy dialogues, and a whole lot of action. What more do you want?\" somebody posted and is recommending this pile of poo. How about not some random boring braindead splatterfest like this crap? Apparently a good lot of people actually have a need filled with this random gore generator. Should have bought some dinner instead of wasting money on this bollox.\n- This is one of the most beautiful games I played since Shadow of the Colossus. And much like SOTC This game is a visual delight not all the visual feel pointless or feel to in your face no all of it is PURE atmosphere and really enhances the experience when exploring the many levels in the game. The game's ability to tell a very deep story visually without any dialog or exposition to undermine the player is absolutely brilliant. the game be very diffult the first time playing but feels rewarding after you level up Ori as you continue to fight bad guys.\n\n My rating is 10/10\n A stunning game with a compelling storyline that worth every penny\n- [h1]Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Save scumming is a game-play mechanic and the game is balanced around the player being able to quick-save and reload whenever they want.\n[*] The game seems highly objective oriented, and I wish there was more optional treasures to collect, as I am a pirate.\n[*] While many guard situations appear to have a clear solution,  you can always just brute-force your way through or take another less contrived route, so the game doesn't devolve into a stealth puzzle game.\n[*] Post-game summary shows your route and enemy eliminations at hyper speed, and is always a fun watch at the end of a level.\n[/list]\nI really enjoy finally having a top-down style stealth game. Games such as Hard West and Divinity: Original Sin 2 also featured stealth elements but they were sorely lacking in favor of the turn based combat of the game. Furthermore, this game has pirates, making it an instant hit (for me).\n- This game can be great at times but extremely frustrating most of the time. 80% change to hit, miss every time. I can't keep playing a game with so much crappy coding.\n- How the hell did I not hear about this until the very end of 2021?\n\nA beautiful blend of all your favourite action-adventures: Your Zeldas, Metroidvanias, Dark Souls, Megamans (more Zero/ZX), Features local/steam play-together co-op. \n\nThe OST also slaps. I don't expect very moody noir piano in my dystopian cybernetic future but here we are.\n- 5/10 Too difficult to be any fun playing the game on normal. got at least 10 more hours offline\n+ they put in cheats to make the game actually playable. turned them on after finishing the 2nd world\ni went with 2 dashes and dash assist after all those wrong way dashes.....\n- people who cheat get the same achievements as people who dont, so whats the point???\n- no steam workshop, people could make fun levels unlike the entire game.....\n- one of those dumb meta storys\n- dashes got me killed all the time, janky. towerfall had way better dash system\n+ you can skip the storys, helps when replying levels over and over looking for that dumb B side track\n- Not what the developers promised.\nFeels like a graphics mod for Chivalry.\n\nI'm not a fan of Chivalry either. I had some fun with it, but couldn't bear the clunkiness and wished for intuitive controls and realistic fights. Mordhau promised exactly that. \nAlthough it's equally clunky und even more buggy.\n\nAlso it doesn't offer the option to play in private rooms with your friends (duel mode) or only on paid servers. Inviting a friend to a local match should be a standard feature.\n\nAll the new content and features don't really matter - it's a PvP fighting game. I need only a couple of weapons that work, not 100+ that don't.\n-     \nI was impatient for this game and i am very satisfied with it!\n\nThe Graphics are polished as would expect, the new circuits in Las Vegas and Losail in Qatar are very good together with others that we run at night the effects of the lights in conjunction with the illuminated buildings are incredible!\n\nBraking Point 2 is so satisfying it takes between 8 to 10 hours to complete, no spoilers i think but we have a lot of characters and some familiar faces from the past!\n\nNew F1 World, offers a structure of different Series, each one is a chain of events with having a primary objective that needs to complete to progress to the next, secundary objectives can be pursued for extra rewards!\n\nCareer Mode identical to the previous ones!\n\nRed Flag Deploying will teleport the cars to the pits where we can change our strategy to restart the race!\n\nDriving and Feedback, overall there is a big improvement more precise and dynamic the ffb on the steering wheel is very good, with Gamepad it's easy to adapt and get top times!\n\n\nWhen an update comes out just don't screw up the handling!\n\nF1 23 is better than the previous ones in every way!\n  \n\n- [i]While the artwork and combat remain enjoyable, the story, writing, and pacing were a major letdown.[/i]  \n\n***\nMINOR SPOILERS BELOW. If you're going to play the game, play before reading.\n***\n\n[b]The mature storylines, hard-hitting decisions, beautiful worldbuilding, and tight writing that made the first two so immersive is not present in this game.[/b] (You'll notice immediately that the writing for the caravan in the capital is [i]particular[/i] trite, awkward to read, and uninteresting.)\n\nUnfortunately, it's not just the writing that's weak. [i]The pacing is off.[/i] Antecedents are confusing, characters you'd expect to speak don't, events that should have been foreshadowed come out of nowhere. More frustrating are the serious character continuity \"errors,\" and arcs that disappear, change, or go nowhere. [i]In short, the events, decisions, and conflict from the previous games do not appear or resolve in a way that was suggested by the previous two[/i].\n\n\nHere's one example. In Banner Saga 2, Fosolt is unexpectedly rescued by Bolverk. [i]\"I have a message for Alette from the dead varl king,\" [/i]he said. That's pretty intriuging! Maybe there's a mystery, an oracle, an item, or just cool information about the Varl and their strange king? Maybe there'll finally be context about the bridge decision!\n\n[i]No! He has nothing interesting to say or add, and then his storyline just gets dropped and forgotten.[/i]\n\nWell, Bolverk's been possessed by Bellower! Gosh, who knows what Bellower will say? In fact, I can't wait to find out what happens to Bellower's body! \n\nWell, actually, Bolver's [i]not[/i] possessed, not really, certainly not like it was implied last game, and Bellower's body -- [i]a primary focus of the first two games[/i] -- isn't mentioned [i]once[/i]\n\nOr how about how they casually mention that Eyvyn is not only the [i]head[/i] of the Valka order, but also that he's had periodic bursts of hereditary madness all along? That's... odd. And it's not presented as an well-thought out [i]reveal[/i] or anything. It's presented matter-of-factly, like they were trying to ret-con in a less interesting story, or were tone deaf.\n\nYou'll notice that all the characters are underutilized and have unfulfilled storylines/tensions. Hakon has hard choices to make; Canary's a little crazy; Yrsa is mysterious; Gil's in love with Alette, etc. Will these build into choices? Reveals? Dependent endings based on choices? Will there be discussions referencing the past? Reflections on travels? Hints of despair?\n\nNo. In mine, Gil was [i]murdered[/i] and no one even bothered to reference it. Canary's situation never comes to a head. You never have to choose between Varls and Humans. Murdering people doesn't make people threaten to leave. Ubin returns randomly as an uber Varl and he's... learned the horseborne's language? Travelled the southlands? In like, a month? In a way that doesn't advance the plot? It's just... weakly done.\n\n\nThere are [i]so many[/i] examples like this, where the stories don't quite fit correctly, where what you picked up on in the early games about the [i]mysteries[/i] and the [i]world[/i] and what made it a [i]vibrant[/i] place were forgotten about by the writers. [b]The result is that it the game plays out in unsatisfying ways, in tenseless scenarios made vapid by watered-down morality, an inability to leverage the situation in fun ways, and low-quality writing, paucity of choice-making, a lack of exploration, lack of plot twists, simplified overworld mechanics -- all culminating in an almost staggeringly one-dimensional and shallow ending.[/b]\n\nThe Banner Saga series was always an experience that was greater than the sum of its part. An [i]experience[/i]. Of being [i]riveted[/i] to the computer, checking the map, worrying over supplies, guessing at mysteries, having my breath taken away at each hill. Unfortunately, that's not the case in this game. \n\n\nGameplay-wise, it's also a bit of a letdown. Combat is fun-ish, but you can make invincible character combinations and the mechanics don't even try to deal with this. There's an interesting new reinforcement mechanic that's not used heavily, and never pushes you like you think the end of the world would. You never really have to split up your forces. There's no novelty. Like maybe using a hero in a battle makes them fatigued, so you have to switch them up? Maybe you can station them different places, making them unusable for combat? Maybe you need to choose eight for a secret mission caravan? Maybe dream sequences? No, nothing like that. \n\nThe overworld gameplay had some changes that never really felt significant. Moreover, quite a bit felt taken away. You can't rest, do training missions, no longer weigh food vs upgrades. One example of all thise tone deafness was Iver's march through the destroyed world was consistently at \"Great Morale!\"\n\nThere didn't seem to be many flavor choices (\"Do we hang the criminals or let them join us?\"), including much less on social themes (\"Should women fight, if it disturbs the traditionally-minded men?\" \"One clan's rowdy, what do we do?\" \"They threaten to leave if so and so isn't banished\"), and less delayed results and fewer significant decisions, including among the game's built-up tensions among the factions. \n\n\nThere's also some cases of development [i]feeling[/i] cheap. Remember opening Banner Saga 2, and feeling that it was [i]fresh[/i], and [i]upgraded[/i]? There's little to make you feel that way here. The artwork is okay, but the environments feel more generic, with less variety, and the surreal landscapes in the darkness aren't especially interesting to look at for long periods of time. Iver is voiced by Bolverk's voice actor, and they sound exactly the same. The new title system is a fun idea, but is visually integrated into the game's menu system with the finesse of a cheap mod. \n\nThere's a moment in the game where the screen goes black for scrolling text and voiceover narration explaining the upcoming mechanic. Um, a character can't explain that? It was similar how the many two second animations are used, not to supplement the story, but to [i]replace[/i] written portions, making you feel unsure about what's going on. And finally, the game's pretty short, without fun combat challenges or interesting newgame+ challenges. \n\n\nWhat's [i]particularly[/i] frustrating is that the game's release date was moved forward four months. I don't know the story why, but I do know that a few more months of polish and story embellishment might have delivered the beautiful, grippingly interactive story we were hoping for. Because this is a watered down version of the previous two in just about every way.\n\nThis negative review is for whatever processes lead to this mediocre finale.\n\n---\n\n[i]Here's a plot that would have made more sense. Zephyr arrives and speaks to you secretly. There's a god that's still alive! Neat, now we'll finally get more story on that. Yay, fun caravan mode, now we need to take longships somewhere interesting!\n\nBut uh-oh! There's a Sundr villain going there as well, with an army of dredge! But at least now we'll finally get more story about the Sundr! \n\nThe god reveals something interesting, talks about Juno, the sun, gives a means to protect the city and help Iver. But when you return to the city, now the king and rugga and the factions have devolved into fighting based on your choices. How are you going to handle this? Which of many possibilities will ascend to the throne? How will you defend the city? And what mystery lies beneath the mountain of the city...\n\nFor Iver's caravan, there should be pockets of dredge villages kept alive by Spellsingers. Now you need to decide to plunder them or not! More stuff to do! Maybe go to the remains of the Varl capital first? Fight warped Valka? Realize deceptions, machinations, corruption, hear stories? Find new characters, have old ones die?\n\nInstead there... wasn't a plot?[/i]\n- This is, simply put, what I always wanted Minecraft to be. I played MC on and off for over ten years and generally, you get over that sense of impending danger, and bases built with teamwork don't feel that fulfilling. \n\nValheim fixes all that. Real physics, real combat, real skill levelling (use it to improve it), real teamwork, but most importantly, real danger.\n\nI love it.\n- Game does not become better with release.\nDups AI still retarded, they literally wasting time instead of doing work.\n\nJust a quick example:\nDup can go to the left side of map dig !!ONE!! block, then go to right side of the map and harvest !!ONE!! plant, then go back to the left side of map and dig second block. It's unbelivable boring watching all these.\n\nAnd you still can't destroy ruins, OMG. You can lunch rocket but can't destroy some ruins.\n- Everytime I browser my library, looking something to play, I see this game and I think: Rayman is cool, I gonna play, but then I remember this \"Requires 3rd-Party Account: Uplay\", and then I give up.\n- I pirated this game first and loved it so much I ended up buying it. It's that good!\n\nIt's worth your money and time. I promise.\n- As a Spider-Man fan, this game is a real treat. It was fantastic 4 years ago on release for the PS4, and it's even more fantastic now that it's finally on PC. If you're a Spidey fan, especially one who deeply appreciates the mythos and the message is represents, then this game is 100% for you. The writing, visuals, audio and gameplay are all wonderful, through and through. It's a true labour of love, Insomniac did an incredible job. Bring on the Miles Morales port!\n- A game that isnt afraid to be fun for the sake of it, a great game and one you dont see much anymore\n\nA great game to pick up after a long day of work, and you just want to hear some heavy rifts and kill some things.\n- Know your History: \n\nMany of you will already know this, but this game has ties much deeper than you think. It's no secret that Bethesda's Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim had extended it's life through an extensive modding community. For decades, literally, ENBs, shaders, textures, companions, and even story-lines added THOUSANDS of hours to an already sizable game. One story-line mod was called \"The Forgotten City\".  Over the next few years since it's release, the mod had acquired awards such as the 2016 Australian Writers' Guild Award, Zero Period Top 5 Quest Mods of 2015, and others. It was an astounding mod that threw the dragon born into a deeply profound, well written, and engaging story. It was a staple for my personal mod list for years. I've played the Skyrim version countless times, but as soon as I saw this release I immediately bought this and booted it up. \nObviously this is nothing like the mod, both visually or engine wise, but the spirit of the game is still there. It's more defined, expanded, and developed. It deserves every award and accolade it's received. When I walked into the opening scene and fell down the tunnel I couldn't help but shake my head and smile as a wave of nostalgia mixed with new expectations flooded my mind:\n\n\"My god, they've done it.\" \n\nHere's to you, Modern Storyteller, all the best and more to come!\n- This was a impulse buy for me just have seeing the new \"Fury Road\", but its a great game so far was kinda shocked it ran smooth right out the gate seems like today you gotta wait a week or month before a game can run proper though. Anyways beatufiful lighting, models / textures look good, vehicle combat / driving is fun, and vehicle customization is cool too. The on foot combat feels a little too straight foward though, the gore animations are kinda boring though, like feels like its a Xbox/360 game in that way, and collecting scrap can get a little repetitive. My final thought yea this game is worth getting but if you haven't played id's \"RAGE\", I'd reccomend getting that first, it's a extremely simmilar although kinda diffrent scenario game that will quench your Mad Max thirst.\n- Plants, please: A horticultural document thriller.\nGlory to Undermere.\nPros: \n- the writing and its illusion of effortless brilliance\n- attention to detail and consequences for player actions\n- \"gotta catch 'em all\" mentality that actually makes you feel smart\n- the intrigue, world-building, and game flow\n- petting the cat\n\nCons: I wish there was more music, or just none at all most of the time.\n- i would recomend it because the physics are great, the game has 8 or 9 level packs (i dont know if there will be a 9th because there are 7 at the time of this review) the units are diverse, there are a lot of secret units to find and i dont know for the final boss because the most expensive unit artimis isnt a good final boss like the dark pesant in the alphas but i hope that the games final boss unit is actually hard to kill and requires more than 7 archers because that wasnt hard or anything hopefully they will make the most expensive unit actually overpowered and unballanced because that would be a great final boss, the sandbox mode is great i like the custom campains , the custom units arent out yet so i cant say anything about that over all this game is worth the money and if its near a sale time like a few days away from a sale then get it on sale if not then just get it you wont regret it and if it lage turn off all the graphics settings\n- [h1]A game meant to bring back memories that is similar to Super Mario World on the SNES and it does this with relatively few gameplay and gimmick elements.

After all, it has to be ready for take-off in order for children everywhere to receive their presents on schedule. But a wicked troll blasts us out of the sky just as the test drive is about to end. He went over the line and wants to ruin Christmas for everyone on Earth. It is up to us to bring the troll to his senses and save Christmas for everyone.\n\nTLoS brings players to one world and six levels of great platforming that are reminiscent of Super Mario World (SNES) but simplified. There are only six levels total, one of which is a castle, before the final battle with the troll. The only difference is that we will be collecting chocolate cookies rather than the traditional yellow coins. We also lose part of our cloak when we are injured, so it's not uncommon for you to find yourself jumping through the levels wearing nothing but red boxer shorts. For instance, red blocks can give you a new coat, which means extra life, or Santa socks and hats, which give a power-up or simply chocolate cookies. The power-up allows you to throw stones as if you had collected the Fire Flower from Super Mario, and that's about it. TLoS also offers a 2-4 co-op player mode, in which players will be able to work together to complete this short and family-friendly adventure.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3009359595\n\nSimilar to Super Mario World, you walk to a level to choose them in the Overworld. Once we reach a certain level, we are allowed to walk, leap, and even sprint. Additionally, there are other indications on the screen that show you how many cookies you have already gathered and how much time is remaining to finish the level. We get an extra life when 100 cookies are collected. We can activate a checkpoint about halfway through the level to pick up exactly where the checkpoint was reached, instead of having to do the entire level all over again. The game also features side-scrolling and underwater levels. The only problem is that if you quit at level three, close the game and start again, you have to start from level one, so you have to play the game in one go. This means that there are no save points or \"save states\". Considering the length of the game, this is not a big deal, but it's still \"annoying\".\n\n[h3] My Specs [/h3]\n\n[code]CPU: i9 9900k\nGPU: RTX 2080 Ti\nRAM: DDR4 32 GB RAM\nOS: Win10\nResolution: 1440p @144hz\n[/code]\n\n[h3] Conclusion [/h3]\n\nWe are all hoping that Nintendo will release their IPs on Steam so that we can play with them one more time. We may all agree, based on experience, that this is probably never going to happen, but Indie developers are there to make it happen. To avoid the tedious teachings at school, you used to be able to play these types of games in class on the usual Flash Player websites, and now you can play them on Steam. Though it's not a masterpiece, it's extremely minimalistic, and it's unquestionably too short, the 20 minutes I spent playing it were nevertheless a lot of fun, especially because the platforming is accurate and not wonky at all. Just remember, it's very minimalistic and may be too minimalistic for some, but if that doesn't bother you, feel free to go ahead and try it out.\n\nIt would be my personal highlight if there were additional levels, more secret exits, more power-up alternatives, and more hours of overall playtime.\n\n[h2] Final Verdict: 8/10 A typical gas station snack that turns out to be a surprisingly good one.🎅 [/h2]\n- After sailing around for an hour or so, killing some huge crabs and collecting some reports from new islands I had discovered, I was running low on fuel and supplies. The game reminded me of this with a prompt titled \"Desperate Measures,\" so I was left with little choices on the matter.\n\n I tried to use my last two boxes of supplies in a vain attempt to desperately scrape together some fuel so I could reach the port of Fallen London -- I failed. Now I was faced with the problem of starvation, on top of the whole fuel fiasco. \n\n  Fear was setting in, as was hunger, fuel was low, as was hope, so I decided to beseech the gods of the Unter-Zee for help, and help they did. I was, for lack of a better word, teleported to some kind of temple dedicated to the gods, and that was where things went from bad to worse. \n  \n   This temple couldn't be further away from Fallen London, and therefore aid, than I could have gotten on my own. So I decided to beseech the gods again, this time my pleading went unanswered, a cruel cold-shoulder delivered to an ingrateful neophyte. The only purpose my inane begging to a higher power served was to unsettle my crew and drive us all to the brink of sanity.\n\nSo I abandoned ship and we all died, lol. 11/10.\n- Absolutely dated graphics that make visibility in this game a total exercise for your eyes, enemies and teammates blend into the background and scenery constantly, friendly markers everywhere obstructing your vision, insanely fast TTK with frustrating bleed mechanics...\n\nAnd the list goes on, it's beyond me how this game is being called a better one than Battlefield, are we even playing the same game at all? This game made me go back playing Battlefield 3. If you want to play a better game than 2042, play any of the others. BF3, BF4, BF1 or even 5, but please, stop shilling games like this and trying to justify it with the price and how many worked on it, this game is not even close to being better than a battlefield game at all\n- Wow! Let me start by saying that for the last year, I worked in what could be called a high tech arcade. We featured a number of VR stations there, and I watched people playing Beast Pets that entire time. I ended up leaving the arcade before being able to try the game (the stations were only on when customers came in, which is when I left for the day), but since I had watched enough people try it, I felt like I had a pretty good grasp of the gameplay -- cute and light. When I saw it hit the Steam store, I was curious to finally play it. I'm more of an FPS/RPG kind of gamer, so I wasn't sure how much I'd be playing it. Well...it's really fun!! There's an immersive aspect to interacting with little AI's in VR that completely changes the experience. For example, while playing Skyrim, you get to have little companions. You interact with them a bit, they follow you around, and that's basically it. But when you're in VR, it actually feels the same as when I'm playing with my puppies. These little guys can fetch, follow a laser, and interact with the environment. There are places for you to explore, and each location offers something unique for the dragons (and you) to play with. And speaking of the environments, they're really pretty! The art style is low-poly, and it works perfectly to create ambiance while allowing you to interact with your new pets. The creators came up with some really clever conventions for interaction that make the experience smooth and hassle-free. This game is great for everyone, and I promise you it's absolutely worth your time.\n- lmao they made tetris into a full blown religious experience\n- Oh boy. This is a beautiful game. There's unlockable items, a hidden boss, lots of enemies, and characters that change your play styles. Numerous ways to make the game accessible for you!\n\nBut is the game fun? I'd say no, the game was just ok. I wasn't really solving puzzles so much dealing with a RNG generator. Ironically the bosses felt slower and more boring than the levels, they are a battle of patience, wait until the potions fall - hit them 3 or 4 times - repeat.\n\nWould I revisit this game after some patches or dlc? No, probably not. Unfortunately I think this game has some base design problems and not content or quality problems.\n- It's horrible. It's annoying to play, it freaks you out, it insults you relentlessly. Yeah, of course I'm recommending it, why do you ask?\n\nWill You Snail is what it says it is. A platformer with traps popping on your predicted path with some meta plot and an evil AI commenting on your actions, mostly with clever insults. But it's also a little more than that, mainly due to the quality of its elements - so the game becomes more than the sum of its parts.\n\nYou're probably wondering about the difficulty. Well, good news: there are four settings, and by default they change depending on your performance. You struggle with the level too much? It's lowered. You beat it on the first few tries? It goes up. All with a (not) nice comment from Squid, the antagonist. I personally found the design annoying rather than actually challenging, but I'm quite sure that's intentional. The game's got it all: conveyor belts (that randomly change direction), underwater currents, perfectly timed spikes falling on your head, blocks that cave in on you after you break them. PhD in twatologist design. Due to the ever-shifting nature of the levels, I wouldn't even call this game a precision platformer - it's not about learning the level, but about adaptation. Luckily, the platforming segments are only one part of the game and there's some downtime between them, with optional (but fun) puzzles.\n\nOh, and for reference: I played mostly on difficulty 3 out of 4, sometimes dropping to 2 and rose to 4 towards the end. I found it roughly as difficult as Ori and the Blind Forest's latter sections, harder than Celeste ignoring strawberries, and easier than Garlic.\n\nLet's talk about Squid, the antagonist. The misanthropic, fatalistic, super-intelligent AI trope is pretty old at this point - but Squid is a very good refinement of that trope. It feels like he's really insulting you - the player - not the player character, like GLaDOS did. Mainly because he really reacts to the exact things that you do. You died just before the end? He'll point that out. You keep dying in one spot? He'll let you have it. You died to a spike? Comments about hitting your head incoming. Ran into a bomb? He'll tell you not to collect them. And so on. There so many lines, I never, ever, not once ran into a duplicate. That really makes him feel like a living, breathing person, not an NPC. I mean, he's not living and breathing... you know what I mean.\n\nOn that topic: if you've watched the trailer, you've probably noticed that Squid speaks with a non-native accent. That's because he's voiced by the dev, who's German; and indeed the general writing has this sardonic, matter-of-fact yet earnest quality that will be familiar to you if you know the German style of communication. No, no angry screaming, that's not how Germans talk. Stop watching WW2 speeches and watch some Staplerfahrer Klaus instead.\n\nAnd finally, there's the story. It's a bit meta, no surprises there. I won't write too much about it because I don't want to spoil it. Let's just say that it leaves many things out, but gives you just enough info to fill in the blanks. It's rather suspenseful; more importantly, it slowly builds up to... cosmic horror? Existential terror? Perhaps both. Also, it has a very clear message, delivered quite convincingly. Up to you to decide what to do with it.\n\nOverall, Will You Snail is pretty good. I don't think it's as flawless as many reviews make it out to be; the annoying design is still annoying in the end, even if it's thematically correct. Also, the music relies a little too much on the central leitmotif of the game, and it simply doesn't have the grace and variety to pull it off like Toby Fox did with UNDERTALE's soundtrack. Still; those little things aren't enough to wear down the emotional feast presented by this game. I'd say \"Guten appetit\" to this fine escargot meal, but in this case, we are the snails. Enjoy!\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42922988]Curator page[/url]\n- After completing every ending, completing the map, and 98%-ing my save file (I'm not going to hunt down whatever miniscule thing is left), I can sum up all my thoughts on the game with one word: Disappointing.\n\nTo go more indepth, as a standalone game, Blasphemous 2 was alright at most. But compared to the first it feels bland and boring in a number of ways. The few NPCs you see are forgettable, the bosses are forgettable, every enemy feels the exact same. \n\nThe executions, which felt like such a large part of the charm of Blasphemous 1's combat, are practically gone- not only do they happen much less often but there's almost no uniqueness to them, with nearly every enemy having the same animation. While in B1 there were 16 different executions (18/19 if you count certain bosses), B2 has.. 4 or 5 different executions? \n\nIt feels like they give no depth to anyone you meet, friend or foe, nearly all of them being left a complete mystery with not even a single sentence talking about who or what they are. Even the Penitent One feels bland, having gone from a brutal, unstoppable force hell-bent on reaching his goal no matter what, to some unremarkable silent protagonist who kills some things.\n\nThe world and its areas felt boring, less like an actual world and more like a jumble of random locations stacked like tetris blocks. The way the enemies were tossed into them makes them feel like they were all pre-made assets and they had to think of where they fit best, and the result was almost none of them fitting in with where you see them.\n\nEverything felt far too easy, far beyond the point of getting used to the gameplay and learning from the first game. Bosses especially were disappointing, all having too little health, and it felt like only a single boss in the entire game had more than three attacks. \n\nThe rewards for quests and secrets were unfulfilling and unsatisfying, whether it was giving a character an item that was obviously meant for them or slowly searching across every little corner of the whole map for tiny secrets you missed. \n\nThe endings especially were a huge disappointment, and they made it feel like everything leading up to them was entirely a waste of time and effort and took away what little enjoyment was left.\n\nEverything about Blasphemous 1 that made it unique- the worldbuilding, the gameplay, the artstyle and animations- feels like it's all been stripped away and we were left with this generic metroidvania that only vaguely resembles its predecessor.\n\nI [b]loved[/b] Blasphemous, it was and still is one of my all time favourite games, but I really can't say I liked Blasphemous 2. If you loved Blasphemous 1 I would honestly advise against playing this, the whole experience is such a letdown that it's hard to not have the first game spoiled simply by what comes after it. If you don't care, or you haven't played the first yet, then at the very least wait until there's a good sale before trying.\n- game is good and perfect graphics but i have a big big problem that the machines like harvesters dosent harvest all the crops and leave a lot behind !! and also sowing and planting machines !!!! what a big problem \n\ni been playing farming simulator since farming simulator 2011 and i never had a problem like this before ..\n\nHELP ME PLEASEEEEE\n\nPlus This game is just like every farm before :) only with a better graphics\n- [h1]Sum-Up[/h1]\n[h3]In-depth analysis further down.[/h3]\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th]🟩 [b]Pros[/b][/th]\n[th]🟥 [b]Cons[/b][/th]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]\n- A vast, detailed and impressive recreation of Hogwarts and its neighboring regions, packed to the brim with locations to discover, collectibles and activities to clear.

Rowling, at a time far before Harry & friends were even born. You’ll play as a fifth year student in the titular magics academy, admitted this late because of unspecified ‘special circumstances’. The virtual rendition of Rowling’s works is nothing short of exceptional, with not only Hogwarts itself, but also its environs (like the town of Hogsmeade or the dangerous Forbidden Forest), all recreated faithfully and down to the most minute details. Of course, some things will differ from movies and books, with the game being set in the 1800s. \n\nThe main story follows the classic ‘manifest destiny’ archetype, where your custom-made character will discover hidden potential that ties them to a greater purpose. Despite some genuinely memorable characters and some interesting side- and main-quests, the overall narrative can’t help but fall a little flat and stale, especially towards the ending phases. Nonetheless, many enjoyable adventures await you. Notably, there are no romance or love/hate dichotomies in the relationships you have with side-characters, as your choices will always end up in pretty much the same results during questlines.\n\n[h3]Exploration, Collectibles & Secrets[/h3]\nThe world is vast and visually magnificent, peppered to no-end with points of interest that often hold collectibles, currency or other utilities. Initially on foot, and later on with the iconic enchanted brooms and even flying magical creatures, you’ll be able to explore at leisure and clear the enormous amount of side-activities. A good portion of these, however, will prove inaccessible until you gain the right spells or abilities, in a sort-of ‘metroidvania’ fashion that promotes meaningful backtracking. Fast travel and an item-highlighting spell prove invaluable in saving time while exploring. Collectibles are mostly cosmetic, enabling the customization of both your wizard and your own private room once you unlock it, to suit various styles. \n\nMost dungeons and locations have additional puzzles or hidden paths that often lead to collectibles or extra resources; exploration feels rewarding, with a genuine sense of mystery surrounding each new point of interest you’ll find. Despite that, most dungeons and locations play out in the same way, and become repetitive in the long haul.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2933385898\n\n[h3]Combat System & Bosses[/h3]\nMagical battles use spells as sole means of offense and defense. Usually against multiple enemies at once, sometimes supported by allied NPCs, you’ll have to time your protection spell right in order to deflect incoming attacks, or dodge-roll away in case of unblockable ones. Enemies are varied and range from magical creatures to dark wizards and goblin soldiers, to name a few. Some of them may be weak to specific charms, others have shields you can break by using specific spell categories (damage, utility, movement) or other special abilities, like immunity to certain effects. \n\nCombat feels engaging, well-paced and is more than a little gory for this universe’s standards, death will be far more common than in the movies or books. The way you can combine spell effects to your advantage and use the environment further adds to the base system, while the amount of passive upgrades with item traits and spell-related talents you can gain progressively add another layer of depth. In late-game however you’ll become overpowered between potions, passive traits, talents and endgame spells - so much that supposedly fearsome dark wizards will prove little more than a nuisance due to power creep.\n\n[h3]Quests, Minigames & Challenges[/h3]\nQuests usually involve retrieving something, talking to a specific NPC, solving a treasure hunt based on visual clues, getting the solution to logic-based puzzles and more, depending on the case. While some side-quests are unique and memorable, most will be fetch chores or dry open-world shenanigans that you’ll have to repeat over and over in the same fashion. Less, but more meaningful and unique quests would have been better than this bloat, for sure. \n\nChallenges are paramount in unlocking unique bonuses like increased inventory capacity, many cosmetics, and even unique passive upgrades to equip in gear pieces. They often require you to slay X of a specific enemy, finish X of the same activity, and such “long-term” goals. Some of them are a massive grind and will only give you the 25th pair of gloves you don’t need, or other cosmetics that aren’t worth the effort.\n- I'm 17 years old. I'm sitting in front of my Pentium II PC and I've just finished installing Baldur's Gate. I've crafted my perfect character, and I'm now adventuring through a gorgeous world. I've fallen headfirst into the game reading novels worth of text and not noticing as hours melt away.\n\nIt's 17 years later. I'm 34 years old. I'm doing it all over again and it's like I'm travelling through time.\n\nEvery aspect of this game is perfect. I wouldn't change it even if I could. I find myself wondering how in-game mechanics work and I'm tempted to alt+tab and google what spell is best. Instead I just keep playing and figure it out myself. I can't even *remember* the last time I didn't look up this sort of info in a game. Who cares if this sword does a little more damage than that spear? My character likes that spear and he looks awesome wielding it.\n\nThis is the first Kickstarter decision I've made that I am completely happy with. Thanks Obsidian for taking me back in time and reminding me that you don't need gamefaqs to enjoy a game.\n- A very good recursive Sokoban.

[/h1]\n\nFallout 76 is boring. There's no other way to put it. The Core objective of Fallout 76 was to gear the Fallout 4 engine for multiplayer. They succeeded! The art is visually amazing, even down to the 2D art shown all over this store page, so what's wrong?\n\nConsider who's still playing this game. Who's desperate enough to play this game? Well, It's not a lot of people. And they aren't very good people. It's just people. Existing. I had 0 conversations during my 4 hours. \n\nLets talk playing. The game is boring. Since I just mentioned the objective, lets talk about the NPC's ETC. [b] I got this game for free, I cannot emphasize how little this game means to me. It's terrible. [/b] The NPC's & story were not part of core development therefore the game suffers. You get stuck doing some quests you don't care about and play a game you'd rather not play. The NPC's are essential as expected so, you cannot kill them either. \n\nMicrotransactions Via Atomic Shop & Premium plague the game [i] but lets talk about more! [/i] There's free events like a crate dropping & player trading outposts. Wanna know what's wrong here? The game boils down to, find a player trading outpost and buy sh*t, or just dropping crates? well the crates are full of nothing. the games gear-towards premium really gives you nothing in terms of loot so you're playing what is a hollow, unfinished, boring, game. Even in 2021! \n\nCreatures & enemies are cool however there's a big issue of the game not being cool. You may say its worth it to play just to engage the wild-life but even they feel soul-less and void of life. I don't know how you make a game so devoid of soul really. I've met mannequins with more personality than anything I met in Fallout 76. \n\nThe world isn't interesting, it's a barren void forestry area. Sometimes you get a tiny bit of quest, however aside from this game being a complete and utter lore-destroyer for those interested, what it does leave is not good enough to compensate for all of the cons. Honestly, if this was a mod for 4, I'd feel better. But even when getting this for free, I feel scammed.\n\n[b] I'll end this by repeating my hours. 4. At no point was I excited. Enthralled. Interested. I sat for 4 hours, wanting to tear my hair out and scream, because I was so bored. I had tests in school, more interesting than this. The entire 4 hours I spent playing, I wish I had played anything else, & I got this for free! I genuinely wish you the best of help if you end up buying this game. It's horrific. [/b]\n- I have never cried so damn much at a game\n- I play 100+ puzzle games every year and this is likely my favourite release of 2020.\n\nDraknek and his team have truly advanced the state of the art in how the game's world is put together and how exploration and puzzle-solving are interconnected. There is no other puzzle game that does quite what this one does in terms of the interaction between mechanics design, navigation, and secret-finding. It's not just a game about pushing and rolling cylinders around, it's a game about really interesting cause-and-effect relationships between the cylinders, the spaces they're placed in, and the places that you wanna get to but can't.\n\nIf you're a serious puzzle gamer, don't be put off by the game's pastel appearance and the choice of marketing and press quotes that emphasize the soothing or cozy nature of the gameplay. The game's content, including the low-difficulty puzzles, are still very interesting even if you're an experienced puzzle-solver. \n\nThe approachability of the game is achieved by having an \"easy path\" through most of the areas. In this case, easy does not mean \"uninteresting\", but instead means \"interesting puzzles that are rigged so that low-skill solvers are highly likely to stumble upon the solution\". If you're a veteran puzzle-solver, you may not even realize this. It's quite clever. The puzzles off the \"easy path\" are quite challenging (some mind-bogglingly so) and many are incredible feats of design that you will not want to miss.\n\nThe art, sound, and writing are competently executed, and the controls, audio, and visuals do not get in the way of the puzzle-solving. The narrative is entirely flavourtext and is completely irrelevant to the puzzle content, so you can ignore it if you don't care for it (but some of it is hilarious).\n\nThere is one \"thing I wish I knew before I started playing\", and this is that if you want to find all the secrets, you should first rush to complete to the game (get to the credits) before spending a lot of time trying to find secrets. Trying to 100% each area individually during your first playthrough will lead to a lot of frustration and wasted time.\n\nThis game is wonderful. I hope Drak makes an expansion/sequel with another 500+ islands. There are enough unused tricks and unexplored design space here that he could easily fill it (but adding 3x1 logs might also be fun).\n- Valve ignored this game because it doesn't rake in the money like tf2/dota/csgo and thats why its good\n- I backed this game back at the end of September 2013 and have finally played it through to completion. \n\nCandle is a beautifully unique game which takes elements from puzzle, platforming and point and click adventures. The puzzles, although sometimes frustratingly difficult, are all different and use different mechanics keeping the game engaging and fresh. Teku's Candle is such a interesting game mechanic that I really enjoyed getting to know and learn. As previously said, the game looks and sounds absolutely stunning. I don't think I have seen a game that looks this good before and that is attritubuted to every character and scene being hand drawn. Controls can be a bit finicky but not game breaking and you can easily adjust too. I would recommend getting this game because it provides a great whole experience.\n- Stephen's Sausage Roll is a game that the developer doesn't want normal people to buy, it seems. The description is literally, \"A simple 3d puzzle game.\", there is one video that shows you nothing about the game, and it's priced at $32 CND.\n\nFortunately, I'm here to tell you to get off your ass and to buy this wonderful game. The graphics are alright, the music is OK, but the puzzles are sublime.\n\nIn each level, the goal is the same: cook all the sausages and exit the level by standing on the exit level sign in the right orientation. You cook sausages by pushing them over a grill. Like in sokoban games, you can't pull the sausage (yet...), only push it. Another huge wrinkle is that sides of the sausage can only touch the grill once. If you touch a cooked side of a sausage to the grill, it will be burned and you fail the level. This little wrinkle will make you pull your hair out in some levels as you try and figure out how the hell you are going to maneuver the sausages around so they get cooked properly. A neat thing about the game is that if you fail, you can still continue playing the level, which might help you figure out how to play it.\n\nYou'll have a section (part of an island) that has a number of puzzles for you to solve in any order, so if you get stuck, you can try another one (until you get to the last puzzle of the section). Once you complete a section, a new section will open up with more puzzles.\n\nYour little guy has tank controls, which you will find extremely useful, as turning to the left or right near a sausage will push it in different directions. A nice detail is that the all of the puzzles make up the island section. When you activate a puzzle, the rest of the island drops away into the sea, leaving you on a tiny puzzle island.\n\nEach section introduces new mechanics into the game. First you'll just be pushing the sausages, but then you'll be stacking them, skewering them (you would think this would make things easier, but no! You can't turn when you have a skewered sausage!), walking on them...\n\nI would say that these levels are on the level of Snakebird, though I found many of them easier than Snakebird's puzzles (maybe I'm better at sokoban games than I know?). These are the kind of puzzles that you walk away from frustrated, but come back to a few hours later with the solution. This is the game where there are so many ah-ha! moments that make you feel smart. You have no idea what to do at first, but eventually you get better and better. You might not see solutions at first, but you begin to see where you need to go to solve the puzzle, and then work backwards from there. It's wonderful!\n\nIf you're having trouble, there's a community guide that has all the solutions, which is super helpful (though not as much when I was playing because it wasn't complete!).\n\nIt might be expensive, but I took 36 hours to solve all the puzzles and it was worth every penny.\n- New edit: The developers have made the steam workshop available, but as an Oceanic user I don't have direct access to the workshop and I can't upload mods. It seems to be only available to Chinese modders, much like the previous 3rd party software. The problem appears to be covered up and not solved.\n\nEdit: Modding capability is now available. The devs are using a 3rd part chinese workshop that we all hate (thanks devs), however you can use Nexus Mods instead. Simply go to the Tale of Immortal nexus page and download any mod, then add it into the local mod section provided in the mod category. Then you're good to go.\n\nBe aware that currently, from what I've seen, the IDs mods use are generated at mod creation and multiple mods have a chance of ID conflict (breaking the mod/s). So if you have problems this may be the reason.\n\n\nOfficial English translation is available. The devs have mentioned 90% is translated, but I believe it won't impact gameplay. Players who haven't launched the game before will be switched to English automatically.\n\nIf you have launched the game before you will have to do the following: in the main menu select 语言 and change 简体中文 to English (Alpha) and restart the game.\n\nFor my review: Having played the game, I can say it's both good and bad. It failed to meet my expectations but I still enjoyed the game and will recommend it. The art is fantastic. The combat is fun but lacking compared to other action & slash titles (there is a lot they could do with it). Quests aren't very clear and their incentives are bad making it hard to get invested. You don't get anything really unique or interesting from quests as far as I've played.\n\nProgression is the most disappointing part of the game. It's a mix of crafting, gathering and looting to acquire items that will either enable you to advance or give you a stronger stat-boost when you do advance. Every realm does the same thing, only requiring different items at the new area/s that open up for that realm. This is a shame. Progression is the area that has the most potential in this game and yet is the most tacked on part, mostly an afterthought.\n\nThe developers could've made each realm advancement unique, with different gameplay mechanics for each one that ties into the unique aspects of the area/realm they're in. This would be a fantastic way to give a sense of freshness to each area the player explores and make them engage more actively in said area rather than rushing through it as we do now.\n\nProgression could've been the strongest part of this game but they ended up making it the weakest. Again, it's a shame. I see so much potential that just isn't capitilised on. Overall this is an experience I'd recommend. But I'd only play it once in its current state.\n- First off, just want to say this isn't a Metroidvania. This is a Zelda clone. And a good one!\n\nI bought this game because I heard it really put stress on you. You have limited time to complete the game and NPCs will begin dying if you aren't fast enough. Pretty crazy, right? Well, I do have a few gripes with that, but let me point out the good stuff first:\n+ Amazing combat. You have access to both guns and swords, but most of your damage will likely come from melee weapons since they have the ability to do an extremely-easy-to-pull-off PARRY! Parrying an enemy stuns it and gives your next attack against it a massive damage multiplier. All enemies, all bosses, and most projectiles are parryable, so this is what combat ends up revolving around. Even though I call it easy, you still get that cool feeling when you walk into an ambush and clear it without taking a hit, so it never gets dull as you go through the game.\n\n+ Good dungeon design. Since this game takes after Zelda, it's not shy about inserting a few puzzles into its dungeons. The overworld as well has quite a few surprising secrets and side quests that you won't be expecting when you play for the first time.\n\n+ Sequence breaks. This is mostly for New Game+ (or New Game Extra, a separate mode where you have access to major exploration items from the start, but not your whole endgame inventory), but it was interesting to find out how many secret paths and shortcuts there were, and how tightly they were managed. The devs thought of everything!\n\nSo now for the bad stuff.\n- Underwhelming story. Guess how much is really explained over the course of this story. If you guessed \"all of it\", you would be completely wrong and here's your dunce hat. Unsighted ends up spending so much of its time on the protagonist's relationships that it fails to answer several of the more important questions concerning the game's backstory. Why was there was a war? Who started it? Where are the humans now? Why are they so disorganized? Why do they seem to have no chain of command whatsoever? How did the automatons ever win anything at all at any point when they seem so extremely outclassed? I guess it doesn't matter. Look, there's two robot-girls kissing.\n\n- Fake pressure. I heard there was going to be pressure before I started the game, so I decided to go DEFCON 1 from the get-go and rush everything. I ended up completing the game in 10 in-game days and I felt pretty good about it. Zero NPC deaths! Zero! I'm a super awesome amazing hero, right? Well, credits roll and... the only achievement I get is the one for beating the game. No one really cares and apparently you're meant to play through multiple times anyway. So... why did I ever care? Why is this mechanic even in the game? All it did was make me shy away from general exploration and side quests since all of those things are less important than, ya know, saving the world. You can call that interesting, but when it has no payoff, it ends up being frustrating.\n\n- No post-game. Did I mention, if you bumrush the game and finish with just hours left on everyone's timers, you don't get to do any extra no-timer exploring afterwards? No, the game's over. Load the save and you get set back to where you were before fighting the final boss. If you want to do any actual exploring, that's what \"Explorer\" mode is for. You know, that mode that makes you feel like you're cheating?\n\nBasically, Unsighted is another game filled with missed opportunities. I recommend this game because the core gameplay and level design is very well done and very well executed, but you should probably know this before you start:\n\nThe only pressure here is the one you imagine. Since the game does nothing to acknowledge your successes, just play it at your own pace and don't be shy about using Explorer. Shame on the devs for hailing the agony of defeat, but not the thrill of victory.\n- This is trash, I mean if you eat shit for breakfast I'm sure you'll like it.  You have to pay to have access to graphics better than the PS2's, also your stuff gets deleted every week. All there is to do is punch a couple zombies.  Don't get this game.\n- 1. Mea Culpa > Ruego Al Alba\n2. combat feels much better\n3. oops no instakill traps\n4. [strike]bleeding crown prayer is too strong[/strike] wtf, just got the time stop prayer\n- So before i begin with this review : Yeah we all know Rust is a laggy piece of sh*t sometimes, so i won`t discuss this here.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n- Great concept.\n- Stunning graphics\n- Game mechanics are great\n- The combat system is good\n- The crafting system is very good\n- Weekly updates! Which is one of the most important things for an Early Access game!\n- Good and serious developers, who listen to the community\n- Modding is easy, and the community has almost full access to modding\n- Skins.\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n- Not optimised for extreme potato users, but that is not a main problem i.m.o\n- The community can be cancerous at times, but that is life! Not everyone you meet will be nice or help you!\n- Server creation is a little complicated, but if you are stubborn enough you will learn how to do it / manage it\n- You finally don't need a guide on how to purchase the game.\n\n- 21 different story missions that each take approximately 20 to 50 minutes to complete.\n- DLC sidestory contracts - different targets but same maps.\n- Escalation contracts on those same maps; think of this as a puzzle mode.\n- The new roguelike Freelancer mode that gives randomly generated targets in a randomly generated campaign.\n\nThis game now has such a vast wealth of content that it would take you months to complete it all. I genuinely recommend it.\n- First of all - Subnautica is a good game. Very atmospheric, very scary and overall a really overwhelming experience. At first. \nThis might be the only negative review in this month, but I think some of you might appreciate a different view than \"omg this game is just awesome\". Which it kinda is, but in some points it maybe isnt.\n\nThis first section of the review doesnt contain any major spoilers for the story, just a comment on the overall progress through the game stages.\nAt the time of writing this review, I played the game for ~ 35 hours, I have advanced quite a bit. The first few hours were fantastic, I was looking for new things to explore, the blueprints for all the stuff that I need and every new thing felt like I made a progress. But then at a certain point nothing new happend. It seemed to me like I had all resources I could ever need (even the blue crystals), I had all the vehicles you could build, all the upgrades I needed.\nAnd then there was no challenge anymore. You build your submarines, your bases and the game gets too easy, its not a challenge anymore. Don't continue reading after this point, if you havent played the game yet.\n\n[spoiler] The big strength of this game is the immersion in the seemingly endless underwater worlds. But at a certain point this immersion breaks (at least it did for me).\nNone of the monsters can really harm you, not even the biggest ones are a real threat. Just hop into you seamoth and out-speed everything. If there is a leviathan, just hug the walls or strave, they cant catch you. And if they do, just step out, repair your ship and continue. None of the threats is really dangerous. You really need to have bad luck to die. And if you do ... nothing happens. You just respawn.\nAt first the map seems endless, since you cant move fast. But once you get the seamoth, the map is very finite. Sure, there are deeper levels you cant access with the moth, but everything on the surface is within reach. Its the same with the deeper levels and the prawnsuit.\nSurvival is hard at first, since you constantly need to get water and food. Once you can plant you own food, you have unlimited supply and the survival aspect becomes just an annoyence.\n\nAnother thing that bothers me is the amount of resources you need to build stuff. In the later part of the game you need to build a giant structure. But the necessary resources are just like \"get 3 wooden planks, 2 nails and a hammer\". And with these resources you build the statue of liberty.\n\nMy last point is about the storyline. After something like 15 hours into the game there was a major stall for me - I had no clue where to go, to me it seemed like I searched everything I had access to at that time. I searched for 10 hours and found nothing. I went to the Islands twice to check if I missed anything, but no. I dont know, maybe I just had bad luck and something didnt trigger right, I missed a hint somewhere or something. It eventually went on, but on that point I already had the big submarine, the prawnsuit and everything. The story felt like I just need to run from A to B and back, there was no challenge anymore. \n [/spoiler]\n\nSo anyways. If you made it this far in the review, thanks for reading. If you disagree with me, thats totally fine for me. I don't want to ruin the game for anyone, maybe the points that bother me dont mean much to you.\nI know that my critique is pretty harsh. There are many positive aspects in this game. If you can really dive into this game and fully roleplay it, submerge in its story and ignore some flaws, this is a fantastic game.\nBut maybe some of you are like me, so some of my mentioned points could bother you too.\nThanks for reading, I hope I didnt butcher the English language too badly, feel free to comment, if you like.\n- With almost 300 hours of Destiny 2 (D2) back on Battle.net (the Blizzard launcher), let me give this perspective/advice for new players, specifically with regards for the F2P offering that is Destiny 2: New Light, with a few more holistic thoughts sprinkled throughout:\n\nThis overall game is very good. It doesn't always live up to its promise (the first mission of every campaign is always the most polished thing aside from the raids/dungeons), but when it does, it [b]really[/b] shines.\n\nThe gunplay is unrivaled. The visual/audio feedback is great, the handling feels really good, and enemies really pop when you take them out. Expect nothing less from the studio that brought us grunt birthday parties.\n\nThe game is better in a fireteam. Now that the base game is F2P [though with considerably less content than it used to be/I would like], this should be easier than ever for most activities. That said, a huge majority of my playtime was done solo. It can get tricky at times (\"Darkness Zones\" in certain missions prevent respawning but allow for revives, so solo players have a distinct disadvantage there). \n\nWith that said, dungeons (currently 'The Shattered Throne', 'Pit of Heresy', 'Prophecy' which is free to all players, 'Grasp of Avarice', 'Duality', and 'Spire of the Watcher') and raids (\"Last Wish\" from Forsaken, \"Garden of Salvation\" from Shadowkeep, \"The Deep Stone Crypt\" from Beyond Light, 'Vow of the Disciple' from Witch Queen, as well as 'Vault of Glass' and 'King's Fall' from D1 - both of which are both free to all players) are best experienced with a team, so don't shy away from LFG group-finder options like the Discord, official app, or any number of other sites (just make sure to accurately describe your experience, level, and gear. 'Tis only polite). \n\nOf the matchmade multiplayer offerings, I enjoy Gambit (PvPvE, reminds me of the Black Ops Zombies 4z4 mode done right), jump into the occasional Strike (PvE, matchmade fireteams running campaign-like missions), and have no interest in Crucible (PvP, it's fine I guess, but I've never liked PvP that's dependent in large part on personal progression - especially in the competitive modes like Trials of Osiris and Iron Banner)\n\nDon't be afraid to ignore content - this is absolutely the kind of game where you can set your own goals. Want a specific exotic gun? Look up where it drops and focus on grinding that content. Want a specific roll on a random roll gun? Find the best possible farming (or crafting) method and go to town. Chase down some of the exotic questions that the game clutters up your quest page with, or just goof around doing things that you find fun while absolutely ignoring all signposts.\n\nSome stuff just won't be explained in game. It's not as bad as Warframe (much less need for a wiki) but some things are still obscured. Feel free to look up Xur (exotic weapon vendor who visits on weekends) and other hidden exotics tied to specific activities, lost sectors, patrol locations, or quest chains.\n\nFor anything that you can't easily find online - reach out and find a sherpa. The community for this game tends to be pretty great, and enough of us have spent enough time leaning specific parts of it (e.g. raids) or just mechanics in general (\"What are random rolls? Which do I keep?\") that we'd be happy to jump onto discord (there are a bunch for PC, just check out the subreddit sidebar linked below) and answer any and all questions you may have. \n\nThe fact that a representative chunk of this game is free makes this the perfect time to dip your toes in without emptying out your wallet. Any other questions about this game as a product (\"Should I pay for DLC? Is Eververse worth it?\") should absolutely be researched elsewhere.\n\nIf you're looking for a place to start with the F2P content, finish the intro missions in the Cosmodrome. New and returning players are semi-regularly upgraded to a new light level floor, but means that you can miss out on the \"learning the ropes\" parts of the game that come with working your way through the New Light quest chain or unlocking different subclasses. [As of Beyond Light, all of the campaign content through Forsaken are not currently accessible. Release order was Red War (launch campaign) > Forsaken > Shadowkeep > Beyond Light > Witch Queen, followed by the upcoming expansions Lightfall > Final Shape.]\n\nEyes up, guardian.\n\nFootnotes for people yelling at me in the comments:\n-All of this is my opinion. Feel free to hold your own and disagree with mine.\n-I generally enjoy grinding, looter shooters, FPS's, and weird sci-fi space magic. Halo, Borderlands, Warframe, and CoD Zombies are some of my most-played and favorite games.\n-As far as I can tell, anything that is not strictly subjective in the above is factually correct [as of Season of Plunder, with updates noted throughout. This game changes quite a bit over time, so make sure to do your own research before spending money on it]. If I've missed something, feel free to point it out in the comments and I'll do my best to update this periodically. \n-This review previously made mention of both content vaulting and weapon sunsetting. These practices have both been discontinued as of Season of Plunder. However, it is not clear at this if or when power capped or vaulted may return/be uncapped, if ever.\n\n-----------------\nTL:DR: It's good. Not perfect, but really good. And since it's free, you can get a really good sense of if this game is for you without paying for any of it. You can play almost any activity solo pretty easily except for a handful of endgame activities. If you're overwhelmed at first, just play through the Cosmodrome missions while you get your feet under you, or ask a veteran player for help.\n-----------------\n\nSites to use (List was compiled at Shadowkeep launch, but most of it should still be relevant/useful)\n\n    \nBeginner's Guide (Current as of Beyond Light) - https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/49007\n\nThe DTG Subreddit - /r/DestinyTheGame on Reddit - https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/\n\nDestiny Item Manager (mange your inventory from your browser even while in-game, essential to avoid unneeded trips back to the tower) - app.destinyitemmanager.com\n\nDestiny 2 Checklist (Lists out everything to do as well as when it resets in-game) - www.d2checklist.com/\n\nLight gg (Database of in-game items, useful for looking up random rolls) - https://www.light.gg/\n\nBraytech org (Lots of overlapping features, but I really like their maps) - braytech.org/\n\nDatto (Destiny Youtuber / 24:02 Raider who posts lots of useful/educational content, including exotic guides) - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkmAjbIecTIjTQctolYeuDw\n\nIf you've played D2 on another system, check out the CrossSave page (https://www.bungie.net/7/en/crosssave) on the Bungie net official site respectively to get all of your content and progression moved over to Steam.\n\nStory Recap up through Shadowkeep (Spoilers Destiny 1 / D1, and D2, obviously) (My name is Byf on YouTube: The Complete Story of Destiny!

So you are telling me that I have to purchase this faction as well as US & OBERKOMANDO to play offline VS AI?? WTH is wrong with gaming companies nowadays?\n- Edit: ARCANE HALLOWS REVIEW (Written Feb. 19 2021)\n\nRoguelike Enthusiast's Caveat: The player's progression is directed in a much longer scale over multiple playthroughs due to the nonlinear nature of exploration unlike Hades or Skul. There is also a higher focus on evading stage hazards than said roguelites, with more control in how you start your run than needing to worry about coordinating a build throughout.\n\nNew Player's Verdict: The most recent large update for the game now makes the game well worth the price. Overall changes to the game makes the early-game far more approachable and increased the player's survivability all around while easing power progression.\n\nNew Resolve system for making powerups far less punishing is great. They added features to reroll power up selections as they add more, same with being able to rerolling character selection now that they added (two more very fun and powerful) new classes. The Skeleton Key, one such new randomized power up, addressed my issues with Fairy Chests which are a major source of character progression. \n\nEvery class offers such a unique playstyle while also having great power in their own right (though right now I feel the weakest classes are Ranger and Mage)\n\nNow if we could be able to rechallenge bosses we've beaten that would put me over the moon\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW (Written Feb. 4 2021)\n\nAbridged Verdict: Wait for Arcane Hallows Update (Feb. 18 2021) before purchasing for total content volume that matches RL1 along with additional QoL changes\n\nThe latest update as of writing this review (Far Shores) added 2 whole new areas, I bought EA awhile back but didn't really play much until this update, as the amount of content in the game effectively tripled between the areas, new classes, and QoL additions.\n\nGame is more accessible than RL1 for sure, but seems harder to get into than Hades, especially for people not used to roguelites. Namely, its far more punishing and harder to recover from mistakes.\n\nThings I love: The whimsical charm, the much more varied aesthetics of biomes as well as each biome having unique structures (Axis Mundi being a long hallway that makes it more akin to a Classicvania stage is genius). Classes having much more unique and pronounced playstyles adds much replayability. Boss mechanics and designs are much more complex this time around and the way they test your mastery of heirlooms is excellent. The new Armor System as a separate way to reinforce HP and the Mastery system to get steady stat increases go a long way to helping player progression. I'm seriously hooked on the gameplay loop in a way that I wasn't with RL1, every class is so much fun, and I'm so looking forward to the next update!\n\nMy Gripes: Runes are a total gamechanger that can make your life so much easier. Unfortunately the Fairy Chests that contain them are randomly spawned, and as a new player whether you can actually find and survive to one is a steep uphill road, and sometimes they just aren't possible without a specific class. The execution required for some challenges will be extremely difficult for more casual players and thus their ability to progress overall will be greatly hampered without the likes of things such as a soulsteal rune to recover HP. If there's an algorithm that sorts relative difficulty of Fairy Chest rooms, I would like if there were a way to increase the likelihood of creating Fairy Chest rooms if the player hasn't found any, and gradually make them more accessible until the player finds one. Additionally I would like if every Fairy Chest contained runes until you find them all in a biome, as I've gotten hordes of Gemstones from Fairy Chests before getting another rune or rune upgrade\n\nRelics. I'm looking forward to the Resolve system update because as of now, the hits to max HP are incredibly devastating, especially if you don't find a room that can give you the nectar to increase your max HP again (and even then its a huge gamble since you take a lot of damage from it). Most of them don't really feel worth the tradeoff as of right now, unless you find the War Drum to continually increase damage. If we can get a vendor to \"rent\" one (1) relic among a selection of ones we found for a certain amount of gold or something, similar to heirs that start with a relic without losing max HP would add a certain level of accessibility without removing the randomness aspect of roguelikes\n\nWhile all enemy attacks are technically possible to evade, this isn't always the case when you have certain combinations of enemies (Frostens and Aqua Braces in a room with a floor thats all spikes is so mean ; A;). Sometimes you'll spawn into a room next to a Warg that will immediately headbutt you before you can react and suddenly you take 70 damage. I would appreciate if certain enemies were stationary upon entering a room so you have time to process and react accordingly.\n\nEnemy damage scales extremely fast as you move through the map, along with their attacks becoming more frantic or complex, without means to restore HP and Armor through the specific runes, most classes' having lower max HP get real squishy.\n\nOne of the Duelist class's main attraction is that their talent gives them invulnerability windows with a roll, but it can't always be used of you're in a tight position without much room to move. I hope that they add a small invul window to the Dash heirloom, with runes to increase that window, but make it much smaller than the Duelist's (say 1/5th the time of whatever the window is of Duelist's talent)\n\nAnyways, despite my misgivings with the game I listed here, the game is really fun and a lot more accessible and varied than the original game, wait for it to go on sale and pick it up!\n- Events that took place:\n\nDid not want to sell player,\nGot an offer for said player,\nRejected the offer,\nPlayer demaned to be allowed to speak to the club,\nGot a second offer from said club,\nEssentially forced to accept the offer,\nPlayer reached an agreement with the club,\nWished player the \"best of luck\" in his future endeavours,\nPlayer is angry that he is leaving,\nPlayer considerers his new club a \"step down\" in his career,\nReminder: Player demanded to go to said club,\nMe finding solice in the fact that FM19 although lacking in the football department, delivers a brilliant experience in dealings with manic and psychotic people.\n\nAllow me to grant you an insight into SI's employee knowledge on the subject their games are about. I once engaged in a conversation with a developer at SI about FM, and football in general. After some talking about premier league, and me slightly confused, I eventually understood that this developer thought that Tottenham Hotspurs were located in Liverpool. So I posed him the following question: \"Then why do they call any matches between Tottenham and Arsenal the 'North London Derby'?\" to which he responded that he did not know, but he assured me that Tottenham F.C was located in Liverpool. I had to resort to showing him the borough of Tottenham in London for him to understand that Tottenham Hotspurs is not lovated in Liverpool, but in fact in London.\n\nThis will be the last edition of this game series I will ever purchase. In a football management simulator such as this, letting SI and their employees (including the one that responded to this review) tell you various aspects of football, is like having a pervert preach to you about the virtues of sexual absitence. They know nothing, and since the core game has not progressed the slightest in 10 years, it would be a fair assumption that they do not care neither.\n\nFuck SI, Fuck their beloved \"devs\" and fuck Charlton Heston while you're at it.\n- Probaly the best game ive ever told people to hold back on\n\nIts fun, its rude, it's the best Southpark Game ever made, but its only a 10 to 14 hour game. Its a satisfying 10 hours mind you, i dont think i have played a game in recent memory good enough to hold me the way this game has, the atmosphere and envoriment just puts you right in a long southpark episode, and youll love every minute of it.\n\nSadly, there are not enough minutes of it for $59.99, and thats why i sadly don't recomend this excelent game.\n\nAnd to clarify, its 10 hours if you just take your time enjoying the story, its plausible to 100% this game in under 20 hours, and thats if you are in no hurry, with no game guide.\n- If you're a STAR RAIDERS fan, look elsewhere, it's broken.\nFirst off, I  think they did a fantastic job on the Star Raiders port,\nthe controls are spot on, it works seamlessly with a controller,\nall the keyboard controls were mapped brilliantly, great job.\n\nBut....\n\nAlthough the NOVICE and PILOT missions work well, those who adorn the game will\nselect WARRIOR or COMMANDER and sadly, these higher levels are broken.\n\nOnce you get down to the remaining 8 enemies or so on the map, the difficulty ramps up to insanity.\nCome out of a warp, get plummeted by 3+ meteors in a row.\nPhotons gone.\nRinse and repeat until you just give up, it's relentless, and I've yet to be able to finish a game on COMMANDER\nlevel because of this.\n\nI've tried all the different speed modes, original, opengl and direct3d, nothing helps, it's broken.\n\nAnother minor gripe is that the \"Destroyed Engines\" mode is just the \"Damaged Engines\" and barely impacts\nyour speed.\n\nI really hope that this is patched, I'll gladly revise the review once it is.\n\nEverything else is great, the arcade ports are fine, the controls are practically 1:1 in the trackball games,\nthey all feel just like the arcade (unlike Atari Vault, cough cough).\n\nThe Jaguar games are a blast, T2K still rules. I would have loved to see AvP, perhaps a future DLC.\n\nBut the main reason I spent $40 was for Star Raiders, one of my all time favorite games, and in it's current\nstate, I feel like I've wasted my money, sadly I spent so much time troubleshooting it, my refund window is gone.\n\nI'd say wait for this on a heavy sale and if you're a die hard Star Raiders fan, don't do it until it's patched!\n\nAnd still no word from the developers on any patches.........you guys out there?!? \n\n- ULTRAKILL is a fine game with cool movement mechanics. However most of the guns don't feel beefy at all and, really, there's not much content to be had. Wait for ACT 3 before forking out $20 for this.\n\nedit: after getting every p rank, gaming\n- One of the few exceptions of \"dont buy games on Early Access\".\n\nThis game, on early access, has more gameplay value than a lot of games on full access + 5 dlcs.\n\n- unprofessional review:\n\nits a really deep lore kind of game, very cool!\nit has some horror and grinding elements which i always love\ni havent finished the game just yet tho \nthe visuals are very cute\nas soon as i bought it was hooked!\noke theres many more but im to lazy to type :joy:\n\nover all ill give it a 10/10\nvery interesting lore wise\n- Loved the original, and this updated version is just as good.\n\nThe additions along the way are very nice, and the improved graphics are noticeable. \nBeing able to converse with your partners whenever you want is also amazing.\n\nHowever...\n\nWas disappointed to have a few areas and puzzles removed. Since those were the more difficult parts of the original game, I assume this was done for a more streamlined experience. \nInstead of your flower wilting to represent your life, it is now replaced by more accurate \"points\". Although this makes it easier to tell exactly how many hits you can take, I miss the more original old design.\nAn iconic music track was also changed, likely due to licensing issues...\n \nCan't completely replace the original for me, but it's still a very worthwhile experience! \nStill wishing for a sequel a decade later.\n- If you want to cut your teeth on the Final Boss of box-pushing puzzle games, then have I got the game for you.\n\nRight out of the gate SSR offers a somewhat uneven mix of real head-scratchers and what I can only describe as pity puzzles, but quickly reveals itself to be the sort of puzzler that mandates particularly extensive sessions of staring at the seemingly inconsequential number of tiles onscreen and poking experimentally at them until something starts to click. This demands a little more patience than I ordinarily have, but I was starting to appreciate the design as I acclimatized to it.\n\nThen I arrived at The Great Tower level (in only the second subsection of the overworld), which all at once foists about 4 times more pieces on you than you've dealt with previously, while simultaneously introducing a Z-axis and the concept of using pieces as platforms mid-puzzle.\n\nSSR does have a well-executed and forgiving Undo function with basically unlimited storage which is a great thing to have up until the time spent rewinding would outweigh the time spent to simply restart the puzzle and do over; the only way it could be made practical on a level that large would be if you had a full-on timeline scrubber like in the rerelease of Duke Nukem 3D.\n\nThere's patience, there's logic, and then there's [b]this.[/b] I play puzzle games to try and [i]relieve[/i] stress, not the other way round. It's a solid design, and I'd probably recommend it to the REALLY die-hard logicians and puzzle fanatics. To the sort like me who enjoy puzzles but prefer there to be some sort of ceiling to their complexity, Gaben help you if you're going to try and soldier through this thing. I would even call Infinifactory a lot more accessible than this is.\n- 1. What is \"Pyre\"?\nThe game \"Pyre\" was made by Supergiant Games and was released on the 25th of July in 2017. After \"Bastion\" and \"Transistor\" this is their third game. \"Pyre\" is an indie-action-rpg, which story is mostly told in form of a novel. The gameplay is very different to the experience you probably made in \"Bastion/Transistor\", which lead a few people to put a negative review on steam. Now you will no longer play as one single character like before, but you are responsible for a group of exiles. The gameplay at it´s heart can be declared as 3 parts:\n \npart 1 contains travelling/exploring the world\n\npart 2 contains social interactivity with your group (talking/trading/decision-making)\n\npart 3 contains to take part in the rites, that means a fast-paced action ball game (3 vs 3) without        a planning phase (like in \"Transistor\")\n\n\n2. Technical details\n-the game runs fine on my windows 10 64 bit machine and it needs about 8.2 gb space of your hard drive. Unfortunately the game runs bad on old machines, because you need about 4 gb ram to run it without an error (my other 3 gb ddr2-system couldn´t run it, I received a ram-error-message when starting the game).\n\n-controls with mouse+keyboard or gamepad are good and well implemented.\n\n\n3. What does the game do right?\n-great rpg-novel-mixture as a whole unique and emotional experience\n-despite the linear progression (mentioned \"phases/parts\" above) the game stays interesting enough to continue\n-a colourful and fantastic world to explore (no open-world)\n-great character-design and a good variety of different creatures, which affects the gameplay during the rites\n-beautiful artstyle with a lot of detail and smooth animations \n-believable and fleshed-out storyline (NOT \"black and white\") with a personalised ending! \n-wonderful soundtrack (mostly ambient)\n-the creatures of the world speak their own language, subtitle is displayed in old-fashioned English\n-rites: the thrilling-faced-paced-action-game has a lot of depth to it (skill tree/character selection/items/area of the rite)\n-selectable difficulty level (rites can be optionally restartet), which can be changed during the game (+ \"titan-mode\": advanced challenges you can add separately like in \"Bastion/Transistor\")\n-meaningful and emotional decisions to be made (I´m looking at you mass effect), thankfully there are no dead-ends but different endings (personalised!)\n-\"Pyre\" is \"2-3 times\" longer compared to \"Bastion\"/\"Transistor\" without getting boring\n-good mouse+keyboard and gamepad support\n-\"versus-mode\": you can play against friends together on your pc or alone against CPU (with all the characters in the game!)\n\n\n4. What does the game do wrong?\n-the fast-paced-gameplay during the rites can be very fast and too stressful at times (I experienced some unfair situations here and there)\n-controls are sometimes not precise enough, especially when the gameplay is getting hot\n-hardware requirements (like \"Transistor\") with 4 gb ddr-ram are over the top regarding old rigs with dual-core cpu´s \n-some minor bugs during the rites (ball gets stuck, switching between characters over distance, bad camera angles over distance)\n-\"versus mode\" can only be played as local multiplayer\n-no bonus material for fans at all \n\n\n5. tl;dr\nPyre offers a fantastic but linear action-rpg-experience with a great story, which is told in form of a novel with a personalised ending. The gameplay is a mixture of exploration, social interactivity and a 3 vs 3 ball-sports-game. The level of creativity considering world-building, character design, music and the way the story is being told is on an insanely high level. If you liked \"Bastion\" and \"Transistor\" you need to know that you don´t play just as one character anymore. But what you can expect is a game with a heart, just like their games before. Pyre is in my opinion a masterpiece and the best Supergiant game so far.\n\n\n6. Final thoughts\nAs a child of the 80´s I played a lot of pc games. Sometimes I look back and remember how I bought game boxes from a company called \"Lucas Arts\". There were times I didn´t even inform myself about the upcoming games, I just bought them because I loved their games I purchased before. For me Supergiant reached that status in the present time. \n\n\n\nUntil the stars align!\nIf you liked this review be sure to hit the like button to help other players with helpful reviews. Thanks!\n- The British Forces give the Allies a bit of the German defensive capacities. It has the problem of adding too many buildings to a game that is, in its core, dynamic and based on movement and aggressiveness instead of turtling. The British units are diverse and interesting, bringing much to the table. \n\nThe DLC lacks a proper campaign for the Brits, unfortunately, even though Caen, Goodwood, Arnhem and Walcheren could have been done in some interesting missions. But, for a game focused on multiplayer, the Tommies are obligatory in everybody's library.\n- very fun there is lots to do \nit runs well\nglitches are very funny\nable to download community made maps and mutators from workshop\ncan unlock different mutators as you play\nyour a goat\nyou do goat things\nyou can do non goat thing such as being a shopping cart or a microwave\nyou can also be a goat\n**Spoiler**\n[spoiler] Im a goat [/spoiler]\n\n GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!\n- i helped a little girl who talks like a mafia gangster get prizes from a crane game, then went a seedy bar to help a large, gay anime loving gator exorcise ghosts from his phone, then went a practice date with alligator Goro Majima.\n\nUpdate: After League of Legends made my girlfriend hate video games, Later Alligator made her love them again.\n- #BringBackKI\n\n[list]\n    [*]Rollback netcode\n    [*]Large roster of 29 characters\n    [*]Unique characters\n    [*]Great tutorial\n    [*] Free form combo system\n    [*] Tons of single player content\n    [*] Fairly easy controls and execution for beginners\n    [*] Tons of mindgames and the possibility of breaking out of combos\n    [*] Best Fighting game resource ever [url=https://ki.infil.net/index.html]Complete Killer Instinct Guide[/url]\n[/list]\n- I bought this game in order to review it, seeing as there were no current reviews for it. \nI thought I'd help the game out by maybe giving it that tiny bit of publicity it needed to get off the ground.\nIn doing so I have failed. As this game isn't worth reviewing, there is nothing to review. Well, I should say there is stuff to review but I feel as though the dev's didn't even attempt to make this a game that anyone would enjoy. Well actually I'll let them off of the target of \"enjoy\", I'd go further to say it doesn't even feel like they tried to make a game that someone who had nothing to do and was bored out of their mind would say maybe I'll play this for a bit\nI jumped straight in, ignored the help in menu and started playing. It took me at least 4-5 mins before I even had the slightest concept of what was going on and what I had to achieve. Once I did get the hang of it I still thought \"I must be missing something, I'm not really doing anything\" so I ventured to the help menu to find that nope, thats it buddy.\nThe controls are lacking, the soundtrack and the sound effects (which happen to be a melody playing) do not blend at all, (they play completely out of time on top of the soundtrack).\nYou can buy it and prove me wrong, go ahead. This is just my opinion.\n- My wife left and took the kids\n- After the past few years of broken, buggy AAA games I've started to lose the passion I once had for the industry. This masterpiece came out of no where and completely reignited my love for gaming. PLEASE do not sleep on this game, it's such a breath of fresh air from the garbage you'd normally expect from modern day companies. Definitely taking a spot in my top 5 favorites and I haven't even scratched the surface of the game yet, it's just that good. Beautiful art style, crisp animations, a unique concept, FUN gameplay, its everything I've been wanting and more. Kudos to the devs for making this absolute banger <3\n- I've been playing this game since it was in Kickstarter! It is the best Story Rich game that I have ever played and the most unique. I have played through maybe 7 times and it's different every time. The ability to replay this game countless times is what makes it such a great game. Tons of questions that change based on the questions you've asked, you see a question that might not be there after you ask another question instead. Every version of this game that I played kept my interest and had me sitting on the edge of my seat waiting for more. I have reached 2 endings so far and I can't wait to see what happens next. The Developers are great, I can't wait to see what they create next.\n- I am over 50. \nI have played a lot of games.\nThe Return of the Obra Dinn is one of the best games I have ever played.\n\nIt is one of those rare cases (though certainly by design) where everything comes together.  Story, game play, graphics, challenge level, feeling of accomplishment on advancement. Simply an outstanding piece of work that I enjoyed every moment (even when frustrated) and will remember fondly.\n- So this game was very fun to play with my friend... that is until it began to stop working on starting the game i have looked at the ubisoft forums and guess what many other people have had this problem starting from the games release and ubisoft has done nothing to fix this problem. i got off easy i paid $20 for this game on sale the people who payed $60+ not so lucky so dont risk it and DONT by this ubishit game\n- i helped a little girl who talks like a mafia gangster get prizes from a crane game, then went a seedy bar to help a large, gay anime loving gator exorcise ghosts from his phone, then went a practice date with alligator Goro Majima.\n\nUpdate: After League of Legends made my girlfriend hate video games, Later Alligator made her love them again.\n- came for the cleaning mechanics and total lack of privacy, stayed for the secret lesbian love affairs\n- Plants, please: A horticultural document thriller.\nGlory to Undermere.\nPros: \n- the writing and its illusion of effortless brilliance\n- attention to detail and consequences for player actions\n- \"gotta catch 'em all\" mentality that actually makes you feel smart\n- the intrigue, world-building, and game flow\n- petting the cat\n\nCons: I wish there was more music, or just none at all most of the time.\n- I was a playtester on this game, and I can say with authority, love and joy and care all radiate out of the work that was put into making this game. It still has the same Psychonauts wackiness and great comedy, but it's also become more mature, more understanding, more willing to tackle dark topics head on and acknowledge that human beings are flawed, and need help, and make mistakes, and sometimes even do awful things. But Psychonauts 2 understands that human beings aren't defined by any of this, and that people can learn from their wrongs and can change for the better. And it tells all this through a delicious array of gorgeous, varied mental landscapes, through creative collectibles that reveal the memories, loves, and regrets of the colorful cast, and through a combat and platforming system that is much improved from its predecessor. I can't recommend this game enough. It's an emotional triumph.\n- What starts as a simple game of jumping over some spikes quickly becomes something so much more. Geometry dash is like Minecraft. No matter how many times you quit, you always come back to it (as you can see by my 700 hours of playtime). For $3.99 you get such an amazing and memorable experience. This game tests your patience and persistence. It tests your emotions. It encourages you to push yourself, overcoming challenges you once thought impossible.\n\n(SHORT ANSWER)\nGet this game.\n- Heartbound is a fantastic indie game with a lot of heart and fantastical mysteries.\nIf you enjoy beautiful 2D gaming experiences this is the game for you! \n\nPlay as a young boy on his journey to find his doggo, Baron. \nYou will explore various, unique worlds on this journey each with mysteries of their own...\n\nThe music I must draw particular attention to: It is wonderful to listen to. Honestly do yourself a favour and pick up this game- it is still in development but you will be glad to know that the updates are (thankfully) free!\n\nGive this game the love and attention it deserves!\n- 3 things:\n\n-Flatten land\n\n-Click citadel to get warriors\n\n-Click warriors at their warriors\n\nGood job, you've just mastered the entire game.\n\nThe game includes such crazy moments as:\n\n-Flattening land\n\n-Seeing the enemy flatten land\n\n-flattening your land faster\n\n-Clicking trees and rocks since your workers can't do shit\n\n-Clicking your warriors into their town\n\n-Watching your warriors fight their warriors\n\n-Accidentliy Alt+Tabing and having the game get stuck in windowed mode\n\n10/10 Would trust Peter Moloneux and be dissapointed again... apparently.\n\nProtip, send this to someone that loves you and watch them try to pretend that they enjoy it.\n- Saw a few youtube videos on this and decided to check it out.  Only played 30 min but here's my review from that. \n\nCustomization options are disappointing and boring. All of the character skins were white guys (and a possible vanilla Mexican). The option not to add other races at least to the Allied side is weird. As a gamer, when given the option for customization I expect to be able to create a character I at least somewhat feel represents me so I can get immersed (and don't even talk about 'historical accuracy'). They're also level locked for some reason. The uniforms are basic as they should be and you have a very limited weapon selection depending on the class you choose which is standard for these kinds of games. The character customization is very lacking and the only real reason I see it being there is to create DLC uniforms to buy. \n\nThe game itself seems like it's going in slow motion and maybe it's something people get used to after a while but I couldn't deal with it. The run is more like a speed walk and it feels like the soldier is considering being a conscientious objector with the amount of hesitation in aiming. Also everyone was kind just playing the game like Battlefield anyway.\n\nThis is probably a game that's more fun to play in a serious MilSim community.\n- Something I've been needing to get off my chest, despite how much maxis and EA go on about how much they care for the LGBTQ community, it's clear to me that they don't. First if they did they wouldn't be pushing the community the whey and as hard as they have. When things get pushed like they are, hateful people just harden there harts more, and just become infuriated. The sympathetic the become hatful towards it. The more something gets pushed, after awhile the more it gets hatted. A better approach would be, (if they really did care,) would be to put what they are talking about into a FREE pack, and get people whom make amazing custom content to contribute to it. If there is enough nice stuff in the pack people will download it, and talk people whom are on the fence to download it, and maybe to come over, and might start to get the people on the other side to at least get on the fence. That whey the LGBTQ community would get there representation, and acceptance would be pushed in a whey that won't burn people out.\n\n\nAnother resin why they should do it like this, and is part of why people are getting mad, is that they bought this game a certain whey, paid a lot for it and it's DLC, now they are changing, it and braking it to do so. Changing the experience against there will. Evan something you love like chocolate, or bacon, or anything will become something you hate if it's shoved down your throat ageist you will. If you want people to take it just offer it, most of the time people will take it. And if they don't just make it just make it more appealing. IE instead of braking the main game to add something even the LGBTQ community can't enjoy with a broken game. Make a free pack, and to tempt more people to get the pack, just add more nice CAS and build mode stuff. And maybe update the pack and add more stuff to it every once in awhile.\n\n\nI just had to say this for two resins, one companies being this careless or ignorant is just killing the public sentiment for LGBTQ and similar groups. And two, they are just killing interest in what they are selling, it will cut the Sims 4's life short, and will cut the Sims 5's life much, much sorter. \nIt's good to give options, as long as they are options. Or you are just like Hennery Ford, “The people can have the model T in any color! so long as it's black.”\n\n- I don't understand why everyone is saying to stay out of the house? I went inside, they were super nice loving and caring people. The dude that owns the place is a butcher and has all kinds of quality meat. We had BBQ and showed me around the wheat farm. And his grandma, she can't see or hear very well, but she's incredibly sweet. They're both looking after a baby that's ABSOLUTELY ADORABLE!\n\nI don't get what all the fuss is about, I enjoyed my visit.\n- Ok so... \n\nFar From Noise is a narrative game in which you play a woman stuck in its car, balancing on the edge of a cliff. \n\nIt's about life, death, nature, purpose, creativity, dreams, stars and badgers. \n\nThe thing about Far From Noise is that it'll ask you something very special, something that we all forget to do nowadays, something that I've forgotten. This game will ask you to take your time. Don't rush things. Sit down and relax as you'll be forced to follow the slow pace of the game, but you'll enjoy it, for sure.\n\nThis game is for you if you come home after a rough day at work. This game is for you if you're searching for a meaning, a purpose in your life. This game is for you if you just want to experiment something new.\n\nBecause Far From Noise is offering you something new. It gives a vibe that is between Firewatch and Life is Strange, but without all the forced action, stress, adrenaline those game wanted to give. Don't misunderstand me, I loved those 2 games, but Far From Noise chose a direction more... pure. It's just you and the nature that evolves around you.\n\nI've finished the game within 90 mins, but I heard they were several endings, so I might as well try to get some more (but the one I've got fully satisfied me, to be honest).\n\nBeing more pragmatic, the art and sound coincide perfectly. The visuals are gorgeous and the musics hit just right where it needs to. You'll be lifted by the compositions as you'll stare into the beautiful sunset, and the dark starry sky.\n\nYou may find it expensive, as the game costs 8$ for one hour and a half of experience, but hey, think about a cinema ticket. Far From Noise is cheaper and the experience you'll live in it is wayyyyy more unique than most of the movies you go see. \n\nI recommend it. Play it. It'll put your mind at ease.\n\n\n\nPS: the main character is one of the most well-written i've seen in video games.\n- Digital Eclipse’s Making of Karateka is a fantastic interactive documentary giving a Criterion Collection quality exploration of a game as well as persevering it to allow people to play it. The collection focuses on Jordan Mechner’s early years in game dev up until the release of Karateka and its ports. The collection is structured in chapters chronologically with each chapter being comprised of timelines that showcase a smorgasbord of information dealing with Mechner’s early works and Karateka. This information includes content such as concept art, magazine articles, interactive viewers that allow you to see how the animation process of Karateka was designed, and present day interviews with people like Mechner, some of the old Broderbund crew who worked on Karateka, and game devs inspired by the game such as Tom Hall and John Tobias. The way this all is structured is really engaging. The interviews dealing with Mechner’s early years are especially charming as he and his dad reminisce how the whole family inspired and worked to help Jordan make Karateka like how his dad dressed up in a karate gi and essentially did the motion capture for the Karateka MC and how he composed the whole soundtrack. Making of Karateka also does a splendid job preserving not only Karateka and two of its most popular ports, but it also has playable prototype builds. It also has previously unreleased games Mechner made before Karateka complete with earlier design builds as well, one of them being Death Bounce, an Asteroids inspired space shooter. There’s just so much clear love and care put in this collection’s creation and it’s truly splendid to see, especially because video game history and preservation isn’t considered as a serious undertaking compared to older artistic mediums such as literature and film. Video games, being the youngest of the mediums, was born in the age of mass corporatization where being a product that sells is considered to be far more important than being of piece of artistic media that should be celebrated. Films managed to emerge right before rampant commercialization happened so they were still able to be considered art that needed to be preserved, but games haven’t been as lucky and tend to just be considered expendable products, especially by major publishers. It’s just so heartening to see something like this exist. I do have one problem when it comes to this whole package though, I think Karateka is just a straight up bad game. \n\nKarateka may have been a technical marvel at the time, as the documentary materials extensively shows, but it has completely aged like milk and is just not a good game to actually play anymore, especially in the present when a vast plethora of games have surpassed it in all regards. It’s slow, clunky, and repetitive, combat is just mainly spamming kick and moving and back forth, the hitbox on the eagle is an absolute pain in the ass, and running is super awkward and can lead to enemies’ one-shotting you if you don’t get into combat stance fast enough. There’s no lives or continues so you just gotta slog through all those boring fights and unskippable cutscenes all over again. I’m admittedly not a big fan of 80’s games, but I can pick up games like Super Mario Bros., Tetris, or Galaga and have fun with them and respect their quality, plus they’re still quite accessible. Karateka is just miserable, to the point I’m surprised people even liked it at the time. Like it’s kinda sad to me the most fun I had with Jordan Mechner’s older games in this collection was his blatant ripoff of Asteroids he made in high school. Similar to my thoughts on Night Dive’s remaster of Rise of the Triad this year, I feel Digital Eclipse gave a gold star treatment polishing to a turd, an influential one, but a turd nonetheless. Digital Eclipse also did their own remasters of Karateka and Death Bounce, they’re more playable but they still don’t really salvage the games at all to me. The Karateka remaster does add the option of giving yourselves extra lives and it does play a little better but it adds the leopard that got the cut from the original game and that section is just awful. The Death Bounce remaster is okay, though I feel the Rover is just kind of bullshit, though arcade space shooters ain’t really my forte.\n\nOverall Making of Karateka is a wonderful documentary and preservation package for a game that has unfortunately not stood the test of time at all. Regardless if you have any interest in video game history I whole-heartedly recommend it. Definitely looking forward to Digital Eclipse possibly making this an entire series and cover games that were influential and actually good, like Doom or Monkey Island. Man, I want a Doom one so bad…\n- This game will seem frustrating for probably 99% of new players, but after putting the time in, it's proven itself to be the most exciting game I've ever played. The creativity you get to test is on levels way above any other competitive game and for this it feels like every game is unique, unlike in other games (that I have also put many hours into), in which it feels like games can get repetitive and sometimes boring. Don't get me wrong, the game has it's flaws, and it can sometimes feel like you've lost games due to unprecedented levels of luck for your opponents, but no game is perfect and often it's unnoticed when the luck swings your way. \n\nAfter going to #Landon and experiencing the atmosphere in a stadium with thousands of people, watching the greatest pro games I think many of us players will ever see, I think it's safe to say that my love for this game will never truly die.\n- oh good god how do i remove things from my library\n- Originally a Skyrim mod known for its story and interesting main driving mechanic is made 100 times better here by having its own fleshed out art style and textures, deeper story and characters\n- Please, bare with me here...I NEVER write reviews for anything (this is probably the third review I have ever written), but I feel like I need to write this one for so many reasons!!!  I grew up playing the Telltale/Lucas Arts Series: Monkey Island. After discovering and playing those, I figured out that I have an infinite amount of love for Point and Click adventure games. After finishing that series, I really only played the other games made by either Lucas Arts or Telltale (Mostly because I thought they were the only creators of Point and Click games...until about a year ago, when I discovered there's an entire genre/world of Point and Click).  Of course, I must also note: The Curse of Monkey Island will always be my fav, as it was the first Point and Click I ever played. Ok...NOW...with all of that being said, I recently discovered WADJET EYE GAMES and I am SO happy I did. I would recommend EVERY.SINGLE,GAME they sell. I have played all of their MAC/iOS compatible Point and Clicks, and I have yet to be (even slightly) disappointed. I had very high expectations going in as the Monkey Island games, Day of the Tentacle, Full Throttle, Grim Fandago, etc. are some of the best games in the history of Point and Click; however, all of the games I have played from Wadjet Eye have been amazing. They have actually been so amazing that I can 100% say Wadjet Eye is at the top of my list, right there with the Telltale/Lucas Arts games. I 100% recommend purchasing and playing every game made by Wadjet Eye to anyone who likes (even those who kinda sorta like) Point and Click games.\n- \"You've played for 1000 hours. Would you recommend this game to other players?\"\n- Bioshock Infinite is the third and (presumably) final game in the venerable Bioshock series of narrative driven FPS action games.  Gameplay, as always, consists of somewhat linear FPS combat with a \"genetic\" progression advancement system that lets you upgrade your abilities through \"splicing\" \"plasmids\".  This gives you somewhat supernatural abilities to augment the more traditional shooting of enemies with guns that we all enjoy from FPS games.  There's also the usual gamut of minigames, with a carnival theme to them. \n\nFrom the technical perspective, even though this is getting a little old, it's a AAA game and it shows.  Everything gamers expect is delivered here in terms of visual tweaks, control customisation, 4K support and a lot of graphics fine tuning options to allow gamers to experience a perfectly optimised experience.  There's not much else to say when developers get it right!  The visuals are equally top notch. \n\nWhile a great technical implementation is a must, and a minimum requirement for a recommendable game, of course Bioshock Infinite goes beyond that to deliver a masterpiece story that will leave gamers hooked, and perhaps a little bereft once it's over, but that's how all great stories should be.\n\nBioshock Infinite is a must-play for fans of narrative FPS games, although I do recommend trying Bioshock 1 & 2 first.  It's not required, but just like you wouldn't enjoy it as much if you watched Return of the Jedi first, you should try the first two episodes of Bioshock before the third one.\n- Buy if you want an average sandbox game. Don't buy for the mediocre story, boss battles or repetitive missions.\n\n\nMGO: I want to like it, but it has so many problems.\n\n-until recently had no push-to-talk\n-peer-to-peer connections meaning lag depending on the host, and being sent back to lobby if the host leaves. CQC also will lag where you will grapple back and forth.\n-no text chat\netc.\n- Update 09/10/16\nSo they have added 'last man standing' mode which is great. The only issue is now that the controls are too difficult. If they fix this issue it would be a really fun party game and worth porting to consoles.\n\nPros:\n-Good visuals\n-Fun power ups\n-Awesome 4 player local play\n-In general the game is very fun and I believe with a few tweaks the game would be great. If they had done an early access build it would probably have been a great game on full release but there are still a few things that I and the people I played with don't like.\n\nCons:\nNOW FIXED (THEY ADDED LAST MAN STANDING' MODE) -Scoring system *the scoring system is based on how many you kill, we all thought the game would be better if you had lives instead and had to stay alive, when we played this game it was a case of constant kamakaze and not caring because it doesn't matter if you die* REPEAT THIS HAS BEEN FIXED\n-Controls *this type of game obviously can't be played with keyboard and mouse so this is only reviewed using Xbox 360 controller and it still isn't perfect, none of us felt that  had full control of the vehicle*\n\nVerdict:\nFor now I will give it a thumbs up as if they allow you to select scoring system based on kills or based on deaths we would play this a lot. And I think they could easily improve the controls. I hope the devs don't just leave this game to rot as it is a great idea for a local co-op game\n- When I say this game changed the way I thought about life, I mean it. And before you say this game isn't worth 44 dollars, you are wrong. I would pay more than double just for this once in a lifetime experience.\n\nWhile this game may look like a stupid bishoujo romance game, it is so much more. Don't let the weird artstyle or obnoxious eyes fool you, this game will make you laugh. cry, depressed, happy, and everything in between. It is so extensive, so great, that there are over 13 character routes and stories to play in this game, all of which are good (some are incredible) and have some of the best, most fleshed our characters I have seen. This game is about life, change, friends, love, and most importantly, family. Every route in this game has a connection to family. (Clannad is a close-enough translation of family in Irish)\n\nIn case it helps, I'm a grown man who had a rather negative outlook on life, and this game me cry buckets. If you ever have thought about getting married and having kids, this game will MAKE you want to have a family. The clever writing and how the protagonist, Okazaki, changes throughout his life is all done so well. It made me realize how much we complain about our lives, but we don't need much to be happy or be motivated. In case it helps again, my mom loves this game, she connects with it quite a bit. Yet again, nothing bad to say here, only to say that Key is incredible and I will be reading some of their other works like Little Busters and Kanon.\n- Absolutely the second best (half-life Alyx is the best game) VR game I have played in the last 5+ years.  Both RM1 and RM2 are fantastic, superb graphics, excellent story and game play.  I took my time and explored and the game time ended up just over 13 hours.  But the big diff is this game was developed by a very small non-AAA team while Half life Alyx was created with a large AAA dev team with unlimited budget.  The quality/game play of recently released VR games has been exceptionally poor and very disappointing to say the least.  But NOT THIS GAME, RED MATTER 2 excels in every area and is simply a great game that will keep you playing.     \n\nI played using Vive Pro 1 wireless with vive wands and had no issues with controllers or my HMD.  I am saddened that the game play for me is over now that I beat the game......i really enjoyed playing this game and can only hope that Vertical Robot will soon release another similar game........or MAYBE RM3!\n\nGREAT WORK DEVS..........this game must be selected as game of the year!\n- +Long (&quality) story mode\n\n-Sometimes utterly lost so I have to backtrack or look at playthroughs\n-No skill tree\n-Loading screens\n-Some game breaking bugs so I had to cheat to pass it (e.g. pistons in tunnel) \n-Repetitive: turn this wheel, kill this bunch of enemies to open the lock,...\n-Enemies become bullet sponges on higher difficulty modes\n-No Xen chapters, so quite a cliffhanger...\n\nIn short: it is a decent game because of the good story, but people that recommend it are probably just on a nostalgia trip.\n- Honestly I've put over 400 hours into 20XX and this game is even better! Even though it's unfinished as of current it's still a fantastic time and truly stands out on it's own.\n- I'll lay it out. If you're really interested in the hacking mechanic, that might be sufficient reason to play this game. Otherwise, I'd be inclined to give it a miss.\n\nFrom a gameplay perspective, there's not really much to hook a new player. There's a long period at the start where you're expected to randomly interact with people, but given no reason why you should do so. The whole socializing and partying thing isn't intuitive unless you're a person who'd normally be into that, and there's little in the game that pushes you in that direction. As a result, progressing as far as the story actually starting is often the result of accident at best. It took me 4 hours of just wandering around, not knowing what I was supposed to be doing or why.\n\nOnce you're able to program there's a bit more direction and less frustration, but you're still not given much reason for doing it until later on.\n\nAll in all, stick around if you're really invested in getting to the programming. Otherwise, it's an exercise in frustration and shallow conversations that's not really a lot of fun.\n\nArt's gorgeous though, so the game has that going for it at least.\n- Zor strikes again, but agent phoenix is there to stop him! Another great VR puzzle game from Schell, with lot of jokes, hidden stuff and extra challenges for replayability. Took me 4h to finish base game, now time for achievements hunt!\n- The good:\n+ Great story with satisfying finale.\n+ Endearing main cast/characters.\n+ Great world building meets with 90s Indonesia culture.\n+ Pleasant pixel artstyle. The cutscenes visual is amazing, even though i notice few awkward animation.\n+ Nice soundtrack.\n+ Puzzle is mostly well balanced. Not too difficult and doesn't make you feel bored/annoyed either.\n\nThe bad: - \n\nThe ugly:\n* Some pacing problem. There are so many sidetrack a.k.a. \"To complete sub-task C you also must complete sub-sub-task X, Y and Z\" during chapter 2-4.\n* Sometimes you might have to going around in circles to solve certain task or accidentally skipped something.\n\nDespite few flaws, A Space for the Unbound is definitely best game developed by Mojiken Studio and best story-driven/adventure game among all games created by Indonesian developer. If you like side-scrolling/adventure game (such as GRIS, Unreal Life or Oneshot) or game made by Mojiken Studio/Toge production (such as Coffee Talk or When The Past Was Around), you should give this game a try.\n- I purposefully went into this game looking for bugs, seeing that it was in early access, and I have yet to find any. The only reason I stopped playing was because there was a fence that wasn't fully secured to the ground that I was able to get underneath, allowing me to get out of bounds. This lead to me falling into an area where I couldn't get out, and it wouldn't let me respawn at my most recent checkpoint. This would mean I'd have to start from the beginning, which I very much didn't want to do. Anyway, the biggest tips I can give to the developers is to make sure the map is 100% how they want it, and to make the audio design better. That's it. I may come back and change my review in the future.\n\nFINAL RATING: 4 / 10\n- Do you kinda like 4X games, but mostly the first 2-3 hours of the game where you're exploring and hacking a basic civilization out of the wilderness and desperately fending off natural threats while trying to keep people fed and productive? If so, this game is for you. Nice tight gameplay loop where things never get stagnant for too long; always novel threats and opportunities, and you're not tied to any one settlement for very long, so victory and defeat alike are more temporary. Not to mention a really astounding amount of fun, polished content for an early access game! Eremite, Hooded Horse, I salute you.\n- [h1] Indie Mario Maker [/h1]\n\nLevelhead is a 2D platformer that's heavily focused on building, sharing, and playing user levels. For those of us that don't own a Nintendo Switch, this game is a fine replacement for the Mario Maker games, and might even be better? \n\n\n[h1] CHARACTER [/h1]\n\nThe controls feel pretty tight and fluid. There are a ton of powerups that you can use, and each of them serves a different purpose. Compared to mario powerups, there's some unique ones here. One powerup lets you wall jump, but also lets you sneak by enemies. Another has a jetpack and propellers. Levelhead allows for some decent precision and very rarely did I feel it was my character's fault when I died. \n\n\n[h1] CAMPAIGN [/h1]\n\nThe first main goal when you boot up Levelhead is to go through the extensive campaign. It's sort of a tutorial, but at the same time is fleshed out and takes a pretty decent amount of time to beat and has some challenge to it. From what I have played of the campaign, levels are fun and well designed. Now, I have played very little of the campaign, it's not what I purchased this game for. I asked a friend for a 100% save file so I could skip the campaign and go right to creating levels. Why did I do this? because of Levelhead's biggest problem: the unlock system. To unlock things to create levels with, you have to beat the campaign and find secrets. So basically they gated off Levelhead's largest appeal, the level editor, behind a campaign that's several hours long and requires you to do some secret hunting. I understand they did this for tutorial reasons, but it still annoys me. \n\n\n[h1] LEVEL EDITOR [/h1]\n\nOnce you finally get your hands on the level editor, you'll quickly notice how accessible and easy to use it is. The UI has nice big and understandable buttons. Almost everything is as simple as pressing left click on what you want and where. Even more complicated things such as a timer or a switch connected to a door are made very simple and understandable. It has to be the best level editor I've ever used, purely for the simplicity of it. \n\n\n[h1] SECOND GOAL [/h1]\n\nThe second primary goal of Levelhead is to create levels and have them become apart of The Tower. The tower is where all the good levels go, and you can sort levels there by difficulty, release date, tags, etc. First you have to get through the Marketing Depertment. To do this, you need Exposure Bux, which is a currency you earn while playing marketing department levels. It's a neat system that works pretty well and encourages you to play other people's levels. \n\n\n[h1] MINOR ISSUES [/h1]\n\nI wish you could name levels without using preset words. I understand why they did this (their target audience is young), but at times I have a genius level name and am unable to use it. Another issue is more of a community-based issue. A lot of the levels in the marketing department are garbage (including my own levels probably). It's kind of rough to sift through the mess to find great works. I also wish you could filter levels in the marketing department the same way you can in the tower. The Rumpus system for friending others is frustrating and borderline useless. People can't search others by name, but rather by a randomly generated code. All of these issues are pretty minor and don't effect the game enough to bother me too much.\n\n\n[h1] CONCLUSION [/h1]\n\nLevelhead is absolutely worth owning, especially for those without a Switch. It's polished in nearly every way, and is just very fun to play. The price point is pretty high though, so possibly wait for a sale unless you think you desperately need to play this. Fully recommended!\n\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/34946548/] Check out my curator! [/url]\n- Yes and No.\n\nSo many mixed feelings about this game. It does a lot of unexpected things and gamifies some deep and haunting concepts within the human psyche( the game centers around a POWERFUL subject, very hard to discuss without spoiling the game), sports combat that's tough but honestly very satisfying at times through the use of unorthodox party members and antagonists, but the rpg economy, pacing, and sheer grinding within tends to rob a lot of scenes of their emotional impact. I had a lot of fun with Jimmy, but honestly speaking I don't know if I could recommend this game to anyone who isn't used to a big jrpg-length commitment.\n\nIt's not so much that I hated the grinding, but it's that you're presented with symbolically themed enemies (not crazy about a lot of the in-battle art, some of it is phenomenal but a lot of it feels half baked which is something Kasey O has discussed in interviews but this is besides the point) Enemies an make you think and elicit actual emotions...\n\n...but then you have to stare at them for hours as you grind to be able to even last a few turns against each new boss. I found myself resorting to [spoiler]Clean Getaway[/spoiler] a lot throughout the game just to get to the other side of a room in a manageable timeframe. The symbolism loses its impact very quickly, and the momentum of the story is constantly slamming on the brakes to make you grind, and to me, it just dulls the sharp edges off of a lot of otherwise deeply impactful moments. It robs itself.\n\nIt'll present you with something powerful, but then it'll do that 30 more times before the end of a dungeon and it can become a bit tiring, like someone telling you the same knock-knock joke over and over.\n\n[spoiler]Shinryu[/spoiler] and certain aspects of [spoiler]The Pulsating Central Hub[/spoiler] are definitely some of the more outstanding examples.\n\nalso [spoiler]Heart Prison[/spoiler] is a ridiculous ask of a player. You finish the game and can wipe out any leftover superbosses at around Lv.60, and the [spoiler]family battle[/spoiler] requires Lv.90+. I'm not going to sit down and literally grind for 30 levels for the only battle left that I could watch on YouTube in 3 minutes.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I really loved this game, it brought me to tears at points. SO much work was clearly put into this and I'm scouring the rest of Kasey's work right now to get more of this excellent writing, I but I feel like Jimmy just barely misses the mark when viewed as a whole package. Any RPGmaker/Earthboundlike fans are sure to enjoy, and I can't stop thinking about the story, but as a gaming experience, I'd hesitate a little to recommend it.\n- ---{ Graphics }---\n☐ You forget what reality is\n☐ Beautiful\n☐ Good\n☐ Decent\n☐ Bad\n☑ Don‘t look too long at it\n☐ MS-DOS\n\n---{ Gameplay }---\n☐ Very good\n☐ Good\n☐ It's just gameplay\n☑ Mehh\n☐ Watch paint dry instead\n☐ Just don't\n\n---{ Audio }---\n☑ Eargasm\n☐ Very good\n☐ Good\n☐ Not too bad\n☐ Bad\n☐ I'm now deaf\n\n---{ Audience }---\n☑ Kids\n☑ Teens\n☑ Adults\n☑ Grandma\n\n---{ PC Requirements }---\n☑ Check if you can run paint\n☐ Potato\n☐ Decent\n☐ Fast\n☐ Rich boi\n☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{ Difficulty }---\n☐ Just press 'W'\n☐ Easy\n☐ Easy to learn / Hard to master\n☐ Significant brain usage\n☑ Difficult\n☐ Dark Souls\n\n---{ Grind }---\n☐ Nothing to grind\n☑ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n☐ Isn't necessary to progress\n☐ Average grind level\n☐ Too much grind\n☐ You'll need a second life for grinding\n\n---{ Story }---\n☑ No Story\n☐ Some lore\n☐ Average\n☐ Good\n☐ Lovely\n☐ It'll replace your life\n\n---{ Game Time }---\n☑ Long enough for a cup of coffee\n☐ Short\n☐ Average\n☐ Long\n☐ To infinity and beyond\n\n---{ Price }---\n☐ It's free!\n☐ Worth the price\n☐ If it's on sale\n☐ If u have some spare money left\n☐ Not recommended\n☑ You could also just burn your money\n\n---{ Bugs }---\n☐ Never heard of\n☐ Minor bugs\n☐ Can get annoying\n☐ ARK: Survival Evolved\n☑ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n---{ ? / 10 }---\n☐ 1\n☑ 2\n☐ 3\n☐ 4\n☐ 5\n☐ 6\n☐ 7\n☐ 8\n☐ 9\n☐ 10\n\n\n\n\n- Alpha, Beta, Finished Product... I hear lots of Blah blah blahs complaining about this game not being out of Alpha after years and years, but it isn't like we've been paying a monthly fee for it.  I paid one time to support this game and I've got years of play out of a product that I enjoy.  There aren't too many games that scratch an itch like this game for me... Open World, completely editable/buildable environment and zombies!  One of my biggest issues with a game that I like is that after I buy it, they release a few DLCs and then move on to their next product.  Alpha, Beta, Finished or Not... the developers have given me years of standing by their product and many updates with new content and mechanics.  For that alone, I love their game!\n\nGraphics: 3 outta 5 graphics, she looks a little dated but they keep updating it... It looks better than it originally did.  There's growth\nReplayability: 5 outta 5\nGameplay:3 outta 5... sometimes she's a little clunky\n\nI definitely still believe that this game is worth buying and that they devs and their product is worth supporting.  Hopefully this is helpful to someone.\n- Fun JRPG with some action commands thrown in, good variety of enemies, and a pretty decent skill development tree.\n\nEnemies can feel pretty tough later in the game, but its more of a puzzle when trying to complete these fights so it doesn't feel cheap.\n\nGreat soundtrack too.\n\nRuns great on Steamdeck\n- ironic that the best sonic game was the one not made by sonic team\n- i would recomend it because the physics are great, the game has 8 or 9 level packs (i dont know if there will be a 9th because there are 7 at the time of this review) the units are diverse, there are a lot of secret units to find and i dont know for the final boss because the most expensive unit artimis isnt a good final boss like the dark pesant in the alphas but i hope that the games final boss unit is actually hard to kill and requires more than 7 archers because that wasnt hard or anything hopefully they will make the most expensive unit actually overpowered and unballanced because that would be a great final boss, the sandbox mode is great i like the custom campains , the custom units arent out yet so i cant say anything about that over all this game is worth the money and if its near a sale time like a few days away from a sale then get it on sale if not then just get it you wont regret it and if it lage turn off all the graphics settings\n- Would be nice to get a definitive upgrade rather than paying full price for dragon quest xi definitive version\n- This game will seem frustrating for probably 99% of new players, but after putting the time in, it's proven itself to be the most exciting game I've ever played. The creativity you get to test is on levels way above any other competitive game and for this it feels like every game is unique, unlike in other games (that I have also put many hours into), in which it feels like games can get repetitive and sometimes boring. Don't get me wrong, the game has it's flaws, and it can sometimes feel like you've lost games due to unprecedented levels of luck for your opponents, but no game is perfect and often it's unnoticed when the luck swings your way. \n\nAfter going to #Landon and experiencing the atmosphere in a stadium with thousands of people, watching the greatest pro games I think many of us players will ever see, I think it's safe to say that my love for this game will never truly die.\n- I had seen this in the steam store and wanted it. I put it on my wish list and a friend got it for me. I have to say from start until now it's amazing and keeps me busy. I do take breaks from it from time to time. However the game keeps growing and always something neat to come back to. I was amazed to that right off the bat the game was made well, and wasn't like 20 patches later and it was good to go. It was a few little hot-fixes but it was already good from start in. I am super glad that I got this game from my friend. \n\nupside\n- Was well made from the start \n- developers are still working with the game and adding in new content when they can\n- Game you can play for hours if you are willing \n- Good strategy game \n\nsmall down sides \n-Not a city builder to me , so like not like sim city etc... more like a strategy game that involves having a small town ^^\n- Does take a bit to learn all the little mechanics but once you do , you are good to go \n-Still early access so from time to time you lose saves as they add content\n- Where to start.... in short entire game is boring and very slow paced for no aparent reason.\n\nAI: AI performs only very basic functions and does not upgrade buildings and does the opposite of whats beneficial for your empire. AI does not do very well when engaging in displomacy.\n\nUI: You will spend most of your time trying to manage/hover around very CLUMSY and absolutely disgusting UI. Other 4x games offer far superior UI and make is easier to manage your asset on the field e.g. Sword of the stars II, Star Ruler 2, Distant world, Endless Legends, Endless Space etc.\n\nGFX: Graphics are not the top notch what you would expect from a modern 4x game but they are on far with Endless Legends. GFX leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nAlien Races: I dont need to say much but like Planets most of the races are COPY / PASTE. Nothing unique or special about each. \n\nMP: Multiplayer has a mind of its own and in most cases wont let you join public games unless its a private game.\n\nStellaris bring nothing new to 4x Genre in 2016!.\n Right now everyone is almost beta testing for the developers so we can find bugs, report them  and help them fix their game. Why not let players do beta before before release? But then there is  a question of sale and refund. \n\nBut overall this game does offer amazing soundtrack.\n- Horrible game couldn't learn how to drift in 13 hours i was using a wheel btw apparently its harder but like wheel is cool I'm not gonna play it on controller that's lame. My dad also couldn't drift either and he knows how to drift irl. I also cant get a refund because i spent so long try to drift :(\n- Know your History: \n\nMany of you will already know this, but this game has ties much deeper than you think. It's no secret that Bethesda's Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim had extended it's life through an extensive modding community. For decades, literally, ENBs, shaders, textures, companions, and even story-lines added THOUSANDS of hours to an already sizable game. One story-line mod was called \"The Forgotten City\".  Over the next few years since it's release, the mod had acquired awards such as the 2016 Australian Writers' Guild Award, Zero Period Top 5 Quest Mods of 2015, and others. It was an astounding mod that threw the dragon born into a deeply profound, well written, and engaging story. It was a staple for my personal mod list for years. I've played the Skyrim version countless times, but as soon as I saw this release I immediately bought this and booted it up. \nObviously this is nothing like the mod, both visually or engine wise, but the spirit of the game is still there. It's more defined, expanded, and developed. It deserves every award and accolade it's received. When I walked into the opening scene and fell down the tunnel I couldn't help but shake my head and smile as a wave of nostalgia mixed with new expectations flooded my mind:\n\n\"My god, they've done it.\" \n\nHere's to you, Modern Storyteller, all the best and more to come!\n- I have played enough of this game to say that I really, really love it.\n\nI have played every Assassin's Creed game, even the ones on the DS and the mediocre PSP game. This is by far the best Assassin's Creed.\n\nFirst of all, the naval combat is intuitive and really fluid and satisfying. The combat is the same \"Press B to counter\", but the addition of guns and darts do make things more interesting.\n\nWhile most of the time you are at sea \"pirating\", the sections on land are also really good. While the tailing and eavesdropping sessions are frustrating at times and boring at others, the free running is more fluid than ever, with realistic animations and few obstacles that can stop you.\n\nThe story is interesting and does encourage you to play all the main missions. However, there is a huge variety of side missions that can be played as soon as you get your ship to sail the enormous maps, where many ships sail and where whales swim.\n\nI have not played a lot of the multiplayer because I don't find it that interesting and varied.\n\nOverall, this is the best AC game so far: improved gameplay, lenghty and fun, it only makes me more pumped for Assassin's Creed Unity.\n\nSCORE: 90/100\n- Dave the Diver is a charming little 'Indie'* that still surprises you with new mechanics even hours in. The various activity cutscenes are pretty funny as well.\n\nJust a word of warning though. Mintrocket is NOT a indie studio, it's a subsidiary of NEXON, so DtD is entirely a NEXON game, and with how their reputation is it's pretty understandable to not buy this game just because of that.\n- EDIT: they made putting easier!  I can finally shoot even and below on the first few courses.  Ignore my complaints about impossible putting below.  I'm back playing this again and enjoying it much more since the putting changes.\n\nI have a love/hate relationship with this game.  It's the closest thing to an enjoyable disc golf game on the PC that I've ever seen, and on that basis I recommend it.  Unlike most sports games, where I can play better on the computer than I can in real life, in this game that's not the case.  After six miserable hours of failure in this game I can safely promise you that I'm wildly better at real life disc golf than I ever will be with this game.\n\nPositives:\n\n- Discs mostly work the way they should (assuming you understand from IRL play how a particular disc should  behave depending on speed and throwing angle) though I feel like flight paths when you're throwing up or down in elevation are off sometimes, but if you throw a fast understable disc at too low a speed it will tail off into the left immediately and when you want to crank up and hyzer bomb the same disc at high speed it gives you the long S you expect and so forth\n- No bugs really (a couple of times the character model went wonky when a disc landed on/next to a rock wall)\n- Graphics are fine by me\n\nCons (possibly only for me, you may not suck at this):\n\n- The entire game is based on a \"stop the tick mark on a spot as it circles a ring\" type swing meter, and I'm absolute trash at it\n- Feels like no progress, other than buying discs--I've upgraded the three skill meters a lot and it has never felt like game play changed much (lol, it certainly hasn't gotten any easier!)\n- Putting is im-fucking-possible, at least for me, it's way too hard--putts that would be gimmes for a novice in real life are a crapshoot, especially if there's any elevation difference\n- After six hours I have only unlocked the first course and half of the second course . . . I may try to go back to this at some point, but for now I've given up on this sucker which is a shame--there are a bunch of other courses that I will never see (my fault, to be sure--I'm terrible at that stupid swing meter)\n\nI haven't played any better options, so while I'm probably giving up at six hours in I'd still recommend it to anyone who's into disc golf.  It's clearly too hard for me, but assuming you're not a complete klutz you will probably have better luck with it.\n- There is no skill requirement to play this game; everything seems pretty randomized including when and where the demon attacks you. Its rather difficult to play alone or just with two players. So if your looking for a game to play alone for a fright or just with one other buddy of yours. Make sure your ready to lose, This game has a great concept I just hope it will get more refined with the attacks. It seems like you get killed before you can even attempt to complete the objective.\n- Ni no kuni II: Revenant Kingdom is a great RPG that, while a little dissapointing in some aspects, makes up for it with it's positives.\n\nLet's start talking about the negatives: \n\n- the characters are a little bland, most of them barely get anything added to their backstories nor are there any specific sidequests for them (yet). They're not bad, and Evan/Roland are good characters, but the rest falls a bit short.\n\n- The soundtrack is a little forgetable, even if it does have a few good gems in there\n\nNow the \"neutral\" points:\n\n- The main gameplay is simple, with only a few attack buttons and barely any combos, so if you're looking for a deep combat you're going to be a little dissapointed.\n\n- The story is simple; i personally enjoy it and how it ends but i could see someone who's looking for some deep story to be left unsatisfied.\n\nNow for the good aspects:\n\n- The graphics are beautiful, it's basically a playable Ghibli Studio movie\n- The gameplay (both combat and army based) is fun, fast and rewarding to do, especially when you unlock more spells\n- The kingdom management is simple to do and it gives you a sense of pride and accomplishment (unlike EA) when you expand it with new building and bigger borders\n- The sidequests are for the most time fun with cool citizens to meet and recruit\n- The random dungeons are cool to explore\n\nI played 85 hours of this game and i enjoyed every second. If you're a fan of Action RPG with a touch of base management and \"tactical\" combat you're certainly enjoy this beauty of a game.\n- I hated Undertale.\n\nIt was, pretty clearly, a game about sexy skeletons. I did not care about sexy skeletons. I refused to play a game about sexy skeletons.\n\nThen my friend made me listen to the soundtrack, and I decided I could deal with a few hours of sexy skeletons if I got to listen to the best video game music I had ever heard while doing it. \n\nI played Undertale. It's not a game about sexy skeletons. It's a game about choices, maybe, or morality, or curiosity. It's a game about pushing the limits. It's a game about experiences, about \"what would happen if I did this?\", about storytelling so intricate and complex and raw that it shouldn't be able to fit into seven hours of bullet hell and pixel graphics. But, somehow, it does. Every choice you make has an impact. Every object you check has a story. The soundtrack, the witty yet profound writing, the simple pixel graphics, and even the menu screens and bullet patterns themselves all intertwine in order to tell a story that only you decide the ending of.\n\nAlso, the skeletons aren't even sexy.\n\nMy advice to you: Go in as blind as you can. Don't read walkthroughs. Don't watch playthroughs. Don't prepare yourself. Don't even look at overviews. Hell, don't even read the Steam page description. Just buy the game (and give some well-earned money to a little white dog), and, as it were, climb the mountain yourself. Don't let anyone backseat. Don't listen to people who tell you there's a right way to play.\n\nAnd when you think you've reached the end, just think--what other choices could you have made?\n\nSo, yes. I hated Undertale.\n\nAnd then I played it.\n- You can return to character customization whenever you want. Game of the year.\n- 1. Mea Culpa > Ruego Al Alba\n2. combat feels much better\n3. oops no instakill traps\n4. [strike]bleeding crown prayer is too strong[/strike] wtf, just got the time stop prayer\n- I have played OSU!, Muse Dash and stepmania plenty and I gotta say that this does not feel like a rhythm game at all. The premise of matching the shape of the map to music sounds interesting but some of the songs I feel like are not mapped out correctly. Or in general this game relies less on music cues and more on visual cues? It felt like maps are only 50% related to the song and you have to ignore what you hear because the map randomly demands patterns that have no matching audio equivalent and everything becomes pure visual memorization.\n- I have made a Deviless cry.\nI have fled from, fought, and died to a Mountain of Black Glass.\nI have sold souls, the honey of dreams, and forbidden books.\nI have explored the Dead Letter Office and will/am/have visited the Dream Serpent in the Pillars.\nI have sank pirates, betrayed anarchists, and been humiliated by a child.\nI have broken mirrors, freed tigers, and opened a gate to the stars.\nI have acquired strange hungers, seen too much of the dawn, and bargained with the King of the Drowned.\nI have fought rats with machine guns, feed pirates to colours, and traded coffins for the future. \nI have died bravely, died fleeing for my life, died of hunger, and found boredom in safety.\n\nI will sail the Sunless Sea. I have sailed the Sunless Sea. I will always sail the Sunless Sea...\n\n(Sunless Sea is an evocative, atmospheric, story-driven game. If you go in expecting to \"win\" you'll be sorely disappointed. If you dive in, start making bad decisions, dying, and trying over again, there's so much to this game and so many ways that it can proceed, at a pace you set, that it will keep you busy for weeks.)\n- ---{ Graphics }---\n☐ You forget what reality is\n☐ Beautiful\n☐ Good\n☐ Decent\n☐ Bad\n☑ Don‘t look too long at it\n☐ MS-DOS\n\n---{ Gameplay }---\n☐ Very good\n☐ Good\n☐ It's just gameplay\n☑ Mehh\n☐ Watch paint dry instead\n☐ Just don't\n\n---{ Audio }---\n☑ Eargasm\n☐ Very good\n☐ Good\n☐ Not too bad\n☐ Bad\n☐ I'm now deaf\n\n---{ Audience }---\n☑ Kids\n☑ Teens\n☑ Adults\n☑ Grandma\n\n---{ PC Requirements }---\n☑ Check if you can run paint\n☐ Potato\n☐ Decent\n☐ Fast\n☐ Rich boi\n☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{ Difficulty }---\n☐ Just press 'W'\n☐ Easy\n☐ Easy to learn / Hard to master\n☐ Significant brain usage\n☑ Difficult\n☐ Dark Souls\n\n---{ Grind }---\n☐ Nothing to grind\n☑ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n☐ Isn't necessary to progress\n☐ Average grind level\n☐ Too much grind\n☐ You'll need a second life for grinding\n\n---{ Story }---\n☑ No Story\n☐ Some lore\n☐ Average\n☐ Good\n☐ Lovely\n☐ It'll replace your life\n\n---{ Game Time }---\n☑ Long enough for a cup of coffee\n☐ Short\n☐ Average\n☐ Long\n☐ To infinity and beyond\n\n---{ Price }---\n☐ It's free!\n☐ Worth the price\n☐ If it's on sale\n☐ If u have some spare money left\n☐ Not recommended\n☑ You could also just burn your money\n\n---{ Bugs }---\n☐ Never heard of\n☐ Minor bugs\n☐ Can get annoying\n☐ ARK: Survival Evolved\n☑ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n---{ ? / 10 }---\n☐ 1\n☑ 2\n☐ 3\n☐ 4\n☐ 5\n☐ 6\n☐ 7\n☐ 8\n☐ 9\n☐ 10\n\n\n\n\n- Game does not become better with release.\nDups AI still retarded, they literally wasting time instead of doing work.\n\nJust a quick example:\nDup can go to the left side of map dig !!ONE!! block, then go to right side of the map and harvest !!ONE!! plant, then go back to the left side of map and dig second block. It's unbelivable boring watching all these.\n\nAnd you still can't destroy ruins, OMG. You can lunch rocket but can't destroy some ruins.\n- Just finished it. Having trouble putting words together.\n\nI went on a road trip around the US last year, and on my way down the west coast was surprised by how many giant factories passed by, puffing smoke into the air. One even had Google reviews, where it became clear that the town residents who worked there posted good reviews, and everyone else wanted the factory gone.\n\nThose did not compare to the oil refineries in Louisiana, one of which I had to pull off of the highway to properly behold. Certainly I'd seen images of them, but in real life their scale is hard to believe. And they're so bright, both because of innumerable light bulbs and the infamous refinery flame spouts. Even going through the pictures I took while worried the refinery security was going to attack, the size of these things accurately portrayed in none of them. I'd already played the NORCO demo by this point, and had it in my mind throughout my time in the area. There was even an encounter with an old man working at a convenience store somewhere around 1-2am who asked me if I believed in God with a crazed look in his eye, something I would not know was reality foreshadowing this game until the past week.\n\nSo my impression here, forming as I type this, is as follows: \n\nThe surreal imagery and sublime writing in NORCO combine to seem more accurate to my brief experience in the places resembling the real life Norco than any photo or video I've seen.\n\nA lot more can be said about this game, but I'm currently trying to untie my thoughts. So maybe later. For now, just know that I'd thoroughly recommend this game.\n- The Award for the worst Cancer Game 2017 goes to: Friday the 13th! \nCongrats! *clapping Hands with bloody Babytears in my eyes*\nThis Game is a complete waste of Money. Don't buy it - don't even think of buying this crappy Master Piece.\nIt's not worth it, to be honest.\nI played it for almost 200 Hours. And it's awful. Never saw a Game with these bugs, with these massive salty Community. There exactly 0 Bugfixes, so many exploits, the horrible earbleeding intro, the Community that is pure Cancer, the horrible Graphic that looks like it's straight out of the Kindergarten and the huge amount of Bugs. Bugs are normal, but MAN there are Bugs everywhere! I mean, yeah the Hype was real, but now i wish i could refund this crap.\nNever had to dream about uninstalling a game before.\nI mean, the Devs. are just Human like you and me - but honestly - never saw someone who failed his job like this.\nJust do me a favor, don't buy it. It's not worth the Ragequits, the broken Keyboards, the Heartattacks and it's definitely not the Money worth!\nNever want to touch it again.\n\nAnd btw. thank you for killing the Sealmothers and making the babyseals crying bloody sad little Tears. </3\n- First, there was Guitar Hero. Now you've got Guitar Nero. \n\nIt's wild that this came out of nowhere, because this is easily one of the best games I've ever played. This is what I've been waiting for rhythm games to be like since Space Channel 5 on Dreamcast.\n- load in get attacked by a man named pizza team up with a guy named dylan to kill pizza, pizza runs a way loot all the bags from dead ppl on the ground go with dylan up north meet one more to add to the group find dylans friend adds him to the group keep goingf north meet 3 more on the way and add to the group get to a town in the north take it over kill every in site find a cowboy hat and a backpack start a gang called the motorcycle cowboy cap gang get into a fight with 3 other players get shot in the back of head by an arrow say my fairwells to my gang and than respawn\n\n9000/10\nWould do it again in a heartbeat\n- SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT.\n\nAs the store page states, NOREN is supposedly a 'simple' keyfinding game. That would be true if there were any keys actually in the game, but as it stands it seems that NOREN is a simple abandoned shovelware game that's impossible to progress in, let alone beat. You play as some soldier in a massive, dark castle, equipped only with a dying lantern. The light fades quickly, and you can regain light slowly by... standing by a light source. That'd be simple enough if you weren't endlessly pursued by dinosaurs that are programmed with AI which knows your exact location at all times; three chomps and you're 'aparted' from the world, where you respawn with whatever amount of light and sanity you have left. Additionally, the translation attempt is abysmal at best. \n\nBoth NOREN and its developer, ThroneLab, should be banned from Steam. I do not blow the 'scam' whistle lightly, and I only do such when I am 100% certain of something actually being a scam. There are a handful of videos of this title on YouTube as well, with only one being over 5 minutes long. No one found a key. If evidence can be presented to me that there is in fact a way to progress in this game, I will rewrite this review. Until then, beware and stay vigilant.\n\n[h1]Rating: [b]0.0/5.0[/b] - WARNING. Scam developer. Abandon all hope, ye who enter.[/h1]\nThe Horror Network [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28221963/]Curator[/url] | [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thehorrornetwork]Group[/url] Click for Gore\n- Developers should be proud of themselves for this awful game.\nAfter a 3 hour session with a friend, my legs are stiff, my heart is confused with constant beating and my brain is extremely satisfied and wants more.\n\nIf you like being scared and the horror genre, just find a like-minded friend and play it. Even when you are simply running in and out, it's going be a lot of fun. I have no idea how one would play a medium map but maybe with 4 people one might have the courage to walk inside that cursed high school more than we did - which was 2 meters into the entrance. We didn't have the heart for more.\n\nOn a serious note: It is worth the price, hands down.\n\nPS: Devs, I hate you for how good this game is.\n\nEdit: I'm back after about two weeks and 50~ more hours. I've played at least a couple of rounds every single day and I still love the game.\n\nMy suggestion is to find a friend who'd enjoy this, get the game both and play. DON'T READ ABOUT IT! Just play for a while, enjoy screwing up, getting spooked, killed, whatever happens! The more you learn about the mechanics, the more you lose the fear, so don't read about it!\nI mean I'm still a coward at level 60 something but that's me. Of course if you are like me, then why are you reading this and not buying the game?\n\nFinal word: Check their discord to find like-minded people in the LFG! You won't be alone, I promise!\n- It's hard to recommend Spelunky 2. Not because it is a bad game, but because it can be frustrating. As with most roguelikes, dying means going back to the beginning. In Spelunky however, nothing carries over to future runs. All you get to bring in to your next run is your own experience and knowledge; And when half the things in the game kill you instantly or stunlock you to death, having a great run end in a quick death can be damaging to one's will.\n\nThankfully, your own experiences count a great deal towards your progress. Most hazards and enemies in Spelunky 2 have a very simple and predictable behaviour. But keeping track of everything on the screen is still a challenge. Enemies and traps will also work together (or against each other) and still bring your demise somehow. Either by bumping your helplessly stunned body into other enemies and traps, or enemies having their own flaming corpse launched towards you and your flammable jetpack. It's actually quite funny sometimes. A good deal of entertainment can be had recording your own amazingly nonsensical deaths.\n\nSpelunky 2 improves upon Spelunky HD's gameplay by adding split paths, which allow for more variety and decision-making in your runs while staying true to the feeling and style of previous entries. It also adds a back layer to each level, allowing for more secrets to be kept. After successfully completing your first run, you can try to discover these secrets and find hidden bosses and areas and even different endings!\n\nAnyway, you might enjoy the game if you're a masochist or something.\n- Played the original back in 2017/2018, and I must say what a hell of a remaster, everything is enhanced, the visual the UI the user experience, its amazing to see this game in a fullscreen i can finally see the tiny details!\n- Good game, one of the best in the series but I can not recommend. \nDO NOT BUY.\nWhile it is still possible to play zombies safely with the use of community patches you can not play public servers safely and activision are actively removing safe ways of playing the game.\n\n*DO NOT OPEN ANY COD PRIOR TO IW*\nThey took away Xlabs, Sm2, and soon will take away Plutonium which are all the ONLY safe way to play these older CoDs.\nOpening any CoD prior to IW will result in a chance for people to gain access to your pc. 2 security breaches are known:\nCVE-2018-20817\n(SV_SteamAuthClient in various Activision Infinity Ward Call of Duty games before 2015-08-11 is missing a size check when reading authBlob data into a buffer, which allows one to execute code on the remote target machine when sending a steam authentication request.

This masterpiece came out of no where and completely reignited my love for gaming. PLEASE do not sleep on this game, it's such a breath of fresh air from the garbage you'd normally expect from modern day companies. Definitely taking a spot in my top 5 favorites and I haven't even scratched the surface of the game yet, it's just that good. Beautiful art style, crisp animations, a unique concept, FUN gameplay, its everything I've been wanting and more. Kudos to the devs for making this absolute banger <3\n- This is the fighting game that you give to a friend who doesn't play fighting games to learn, the Steam Edition of Killer Instinct comes with all of the characters as well as the extra premium skins that were added into the game. Killer Instinct has arguably one of the best tutorial systems that I have played with in recent years, if not one of the best period. It allows you to learn at a reasonable pace each and every one of the specific features of the game, including assists so that people are able to learn what combo breaker they need to use versus specific attacks. Combo Assist in this is less a crutch or a hand hold mechanic and more of a guide when it comes to using combos, it will automatically add in linkers to combos so that people who are unfamiliar with the game aren't left mashing buttons and making a fool of themselves because they don't know what they are doing, it will free flow the fight as best as it can to help guide people toward what they need to be doing, showing off what specials people could be doing to link the combo together and maximize the amount of damage they could possibly get, and due to the combo meter it stops people from being locked into combos forever since once a combo ends you are forced away, either by the opponent's combo ender or the combo forcing itself closed.\n\nThe price that they ask for on Steam you will get more out of the game than you could expect from something this priced. There are two story modes specific to the first two seasons of characters that came out, then with Season 3, which brought back the two original bosses from the franchise, Shadow Lords, a seperate scenario style campaign in which you pick the team that you wish to take in your attempt to overthrow the Shadow Lord himself. That's without taking into account the Shadow Lab mode which allows you to train a Shadow of yourself, an AI that learns and builds off your own patterns to fight in a similar manner to yourself, these Shadows are used within its own unique survival mode, as well as special missions that can crop up within the Shadow Lord mode.\n\nIf you're after a fighting game to get into, or you're looking to get a friend into fighting games, this is the best one that you could possibly start with, since it will not only teach the specific mechanics to this one, but also allow you to learn in time a lot of the mechanics that other competitive fighters share, though this one, eases you into it, so that it is a less daunting experience, as well as being much friendlier to new players.\n- I even set a calendar reminder so that I could get this on release. I wish I hadn't bothered. Going great guns until I got to the passage. Game over as I can't progress. Tried allsorts to drop the jammer but unable to do so. I guess it is a case of waiting for all the bugs to get resolved.\n- [h1]First of all, NISA... the elephant in the room needs addressing.[/h1]\nIf you're going to use D3D11 and try to do stuff multi-threaded, use a 64-bit executable.\n\nMemory allocation and thread pooling work much better in a 64-bit environment. 32-bit doesn't really expand your market share any but causes several compatibility headaches (including memory fragmentation in your resource manager). Please, NISA, stop fooling around with legacy APIs (i.e. WinMM for gamepad input and OpenGL 1.x as you did in Disgaea) and outdated ABIs.  D3D11 / 64-Bit should be the target environment for software longevity.\n\nI get the impression you believe that OLDER means more compatible, but you've got the whole PC development paradigm upside down. Old stuff is simply old, period.\n\nI would encourage you to review the guidelines for authoring Windows Store software, Microsoft's policies for Windows Store are designed to reduce legacy software maintenance problems. You need not follow them, but they will give you a pretty good idea of the APIs and ABIs that are relevant / native / not running through compatibility layer redtape. Do this and I believe you will find PC development much less troublesome.\n\n\n\n\n[list][i]With that out  of the way, I would like to point out that NISA patches their games more than any developer I have ever seen.[/i][/list]\n\n\nI personally believe this game is best suited for the Nintendo Switch, but PC will have a stable version by the time the Switch version ships. I have already authored a number of fixes for texture aliasing that guarantee image quality-wise, the PC version is where you would expect it to be. We just need NISA to polish the rest of the stuff :)\n\nTake early reviews with a grain of salt because NISA's going to be busy patching this game for months if Disgaea is any indication. Price complaints are probably the only aspect of current reviews that will remain valid. I tend to agree, the asking price is not what it should be for a game that's not exactly finished.\n\n\n\n[h1]I am leaving a positive review because I have faith NISA will stick with it, but ...[/h1]\n\n[list][list]You shouldn't rush to buy this game by any means. [b]Wait it out.[/b][/list][/list]\n- It's horrible. It's annoying to play, it freaks you out, it insults you relentlessly. Yeah, of course I'm recommending it, why do you ask?\n\nWill You Snail is what it says it is. A platformer with traps popping on your predicted path with some meta plot and an evil AI commenting on your actions, mostly with clever insults. But it's also a little more than that, mainly due to the quality of its elements - so the game becomes more than the sum of its parts.\n\nYou're probably wondering about the difficulty. Well, good news: there are four settings, and by default they change depending on your performance. You struggle with the level too much? It's lowered. You beat it on the first few tries? It goes up. All with a (not) nice comment from Squid, the antagonist. I personally found the design annoying rather than actually challenging, but I'm quite sure that's intentional. The game's got it all: conveyor belts (that randomly change direction), underwater currents, perfectly timed spikes falling on your head, blocks that cave in on you after you break them. PhD in twatologist design. Due to the ever-shifting nature of the levels, I wouldn't even call this game a precision platformer - it's not about learning the level, but about adaptation. Luckily, the platforming segments are only one part of the game and there's some downtime between them, with optional (but fun) puzzles.\n\nOh, and for reference: I played mostly on difficulty 3 out of 4, sometimes dropping to 2 and rose to 4 towards the end. I found it roughly as difficult as Ori and the Blind Forest's latter sections, harder than Celeste ignoring strawberries, and easier than Garlic.\n\nLet's talk about Squid, the antagonist. The misanthropic, fatalistic, super-intelligent AI trope is pretty old at this point - but Squid is a very good refinement of that trope. It feels like he's really insulting you - the player - not the player character, like GLaDOS did. Mainly because he really reacts to the exact things that you do. You died just before the end? He'll point that out. You keep dying in one spot? He'll let you have it. You died to a spike? Comments about hitting your head incoming. Ran into a bomb? He'll tell you not to collect them. And so on. There so many lines, I never, ever, not once ran into a duplicate. That really makes him feel like a living, breathing person, not an NPC. I mean, he's not living and breathing... you know what I mean.\n\nOn that topic: if you've watched the trailer, you've probably noticed that Squid speaks with a non-native accent. That's because he's voiced by the dev, who's German; and indeed the general writing has this sardonic, matter-of-fact yet earnest quality that will be familiar to you if you know the German style of communication. No, no angry screaming, that's not how Germans talk. Stop watching WW2 speeches and watch some Staplerfahrer Klaus instead.\n\nAnd finally, there's the story. It's a bit meta, no surprises there. I won't write too much about it because I don't want to spoil it. Let's just say that it leaves many things out, but gives you just enough info to fill in the blanks. It's rather suspenseful; more importantly, it slowly builds up to... cosmic horror? Existential terror? Perhaps both. Also, it has a very clear message, delivered quite convincingly. Up to you to decide what to do with it.\n\nOverall, Will You Snail is pretty good. I don't think it's as flawless as many reviews make it out to be; the annoying design is still annoying in the end, even if it's thematically correct. Also, the music relies a little too much on the central leitmotif of the game, and it simply doesn't have the grace and variety to pull it off like Toby Fox did with UNDERTALE's soundtrack. Still; those little things aren't enough to wear down the emotional feast presented by this game. I'd say \"Guten appetit\" to this fine escargot meal, but in this case, we are the snails. Enjoy!\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42922988]Curator page[/url]\n- THERE IS ONLINE CO-OP with REMOTE PLAY!  Im not sure why that guy put misinformation in the beginning of his review.\n\nIf you have 3 friends, only one of you needs to buy this and invite them through remote play and you will have a BLAST. First session we played 3 hours straight and laughed so hard we gave ourselves a headache.\n\nAlot of love went into making this game and a lot of hidden easter eggs nodding to other games. If you need something to play with your group of friends during quarantine, this is the game!\n- The only marginally interesting or entertaining part of this game is it's history.\n\nJanuary 15, 2015: It's sold under the name of H1Z1. It was marketed as an open world zombie survival game, akin to DayZ. I bought it for 20$. The game does not run.\n\nAfter a time, they release a new gamemode; King of the Kill. It's a battle royale mode, made specifically because PLAYERUNKNOWN made a hugely successful battle royale mod for the game but then split off to make his own game (PUBG).\n\nFebruary 5, 2016: KOTK is doing well, so they split it off from the game, both of them costing 20$. They silently abandon the original game, only doing small feature updates and adding nothing but bugs. H1Z1 (The survival game.) is renamed to H1Z1 Just Survive.  KOTK is renamed H1Z1: King of the Kill. Not long after they rename H1Z1 Just Survive to simply Just Survive (Which sounds like a terrible 3$ app game.) and rename H1Z1 King of the Kill to just H1Z1. (H1Z1 Battle Royale on consoles.) Development of the original survival game, \"Just Survive\", is still mostly halted.\n\nOctober 24, 2018: Just Survive, the survival game i paid for, is shut down. The game is removed from my, and everyone else's steam library, with no refund. KOTK, or H1Z1, or H1Z1 Battle Royale...or...whatever the crap they named it, is shut down as well, and re-published and renamed as a different game, Z1 Battle Royale, obviously done to alienate the game from it's wretched history.\n\nThe kicker? It's free. Also, it's still called H1Z1 Battle Royale on consoles, and when Z1 BR is run, the window is named H1Z1. \n\nThey made a game said it was like DayZ. It didn't even work. Then they simply deleted it from my library with no refund. Z1 BR is dead, it garners about 3 active players. They actually, legitimately built a fake game and then deleted it for money.\n\nUtterly disgusting development team. When everyone said the original game was going down in flames due to terrible updates, horrible balancing fix attempts that only worsened the balance, and endless amounts of bugs spilling into the game, i sat there, with hope. This is what i got.\n\nThey said the original H1Z1 was originally going to be made free. I was fine, 20$ for instant beta access to a DayZ game was fine. What they didn't say is that it was a blatant lie and they would toss the game in the trash in favor of another random game they made using the original games assets (I told you. They're terrible. Too lazy to even make new assets.) simply because Fortnite was getting popular.\n\nAnd after all that?\n\nThe game sucks balls.\n\nDon't [strike]buy[/strike] download this game.\n- It's an asset flip. I know that's a bit obvious, but just in case you were in doubt, there you go.\n\nFull of bugs, rushed, empty, poor sound/animation/ai/overall design quality, completely broken english, barely functioning UI, you get the picture, it's a cash grab.\n- Upon further play, the game wasn't super luck based, it just doesn't do a great job explaining core mechanics that are crucial to gameplay. It has a more hands off, let the player discover how this works type of playstyle, but a simple line of dialogue alluding to these features would have been nice. That said, the story is really gripping, the gameplay (once learned) is fun, and overall, I definitely think it's worth $20.\n- This is more than a game for me.  It has become a hobby.  What started as a random purchase for myself last Christmas -- I had an old electric guitar I never played in the closet, so this gave me an excuse to see if I can learn -- has become an expensive obsession for me.  Warning -- but a good warning -- you'll find that you're learning guitar very quickly on this game, and it will become the start of an expensive habit!  I have downloaded hundreds of dollars worth of songs, bought a brand new guitar, I've signed up for music theory and guitar lessons at the local county college ... this has become a genuine hobby for me.  Literally, it is one of those rare games which has genuinely made an impact on my life.  Six months later, and the game has not gotten old.  I look forward to new songs, I laugh when a new chord I've never seen magically appears on the song that I've practiced the hell out and achieved a new difficulty.  The game is, most importantly, fun.  It remains fresh and only gets better as you get better.  I highly recommend.\n- As a historical novelist and former high school English teacher with over 700 books in my home devoted to ancient Greek literature, history and culture I had to try this game.\n\nI should mention that I am pushing 60 years old and although I like strategy games like Creative Assembly’s Rome II, I’m not a fan of ‘gopher’ games that make you run around collecting items, rescuing damsels in distress, delivering messages, and murdering politicians to level your character.  The whole premises seems rather tedious and unimaginative.  \n\nSo right from the start I expected to hate Assassin’s Creed Odyssey.  Combine that with the fact that I’d never played an Assassin’s Creed game before, and I am not the most nimble finger clicker, I was prepared to spend a good portion of my playing time getting my head lopped off.  \n\nNone of that happened.  Well, yeah, there is a pretty steep learning curve here.  I did spend a lot of my initial hours zigging when I should have been zagging, and with my opponent’s spear in my head, but I stuck with it and eventually even an old poop like me was able to figure out the mechanics.\n\nWhat kept me going was the sheer majesty of the game and the beauty of the surroundings.  \n\nI’ve been to Athens, Sparta, Argos, Mycenae, Delos, Aegina, Hydra, Crete, Melos (now Santorini), and dozens of other locales on the campaign map multiple times.  I’ve walked around the ruins at Delphi, strolled the docks of Piraeus and walked through valley of Laconia for research for my books.  I wanted to see these places at they might have looked 2,500 years ago and that for me is the true joy of Assassin’s Creed Odyssey.\n\nThe team at Ubisoft deserves a lot of credit.  They did their homework.  Sure, you’d expect to see historical figures like Pericles, Socrates, Alcibiades and Archidamas in a game about the Peloponnesian War.  But that anyone outside of academia even knows who Brasidas, Aspasia, Herodotus and Pausanias were, is impressive.  Kudos to you.\n\nI’m probably an oddball gamer because I was not motivated by stabbing people in the back to gain levels and steal loot.  The entire idea of stabbing people in the back goes against the grain of the Greek ethos of ‘kleos’ or honor.  What kept me going was the desire to see more of the world that Ubisoft created.  \n\nI wanted to visit the Athenian Acropolis and see the Propylaea, Erechtheion and Parthenon as they were shiny and new, instead of in piles of rubble.  I wanted to gaze up at Phidias' statue of Zeus in Olympus (one of the wonders of the ancient Greek world that no longer exists), speak to the Pythia at the temple of Delphi, and see the five villages of Sparta as they might have looked.  Getting to walk the streets of Athens, Argos and Elis was like taking a trip back in time.  Magical.\n\nOkay, the game isn’t perfect.  The pronunciation of common names like Pericles and Socrates and the character’s accents were maddening.  I can only guess that Ubisoft believes we’ve Americanized the real pronunciations, or at least I hope that’s what they were thinking.  Ultimately it’s a minor annoyance.\n\nThe hoplite battles were a major disappointment.  The Greeks fought in a phalanx formation.  Shoulder to shoulder.  Shield to shield.  The battles here are a 300 movie style free for all.  Oh well, guess you can’t have everything.  \n\nAlso I could not fathom how Alexios and Kassandra could be descended from Leonidas, but have no connection to the Agiad royal family.  By rights they should have been Pausanias’ cousins, but they’re not.  I don’t know who they are. The whole Pythagoras-is-my-father thing is rather bizarre and makes no sense at all.  \n\nI won’t go off the charts here listing the historical inaccuracies that drove me batsh!t crazy, as it serves no purpose.  Suffice it to say that I enjoyed the game.  \n\nIf you ever wanted to unravel the labyrinth of the minotaur beneath King Minos palace at Knossos, get drunk and sing songs with Socrates at an Athenian symposium, feel the Aegean Sea roll beneath your feet on the deck of a  trireme, or stare out in wonder at the lights twinkling over Attica at twilight, try this game.  You won’t be disappointed.\n- Alpha, Beta, Finished Product... I hear lots of Blah blah blahs complaining about this game not being out of Alpha after years and years, but it isn't like we've been paying a monthly fee for it.  I paid one time to support this game and I've got years of play out of a product that I enjoy.  There aren't too many games that scratch an itch like this game for me... Open World, completely editable/buildable environment and zombies!  One of my biggest issues with a game that I like is that after I buy it, they release a few DLCs and then move on to their next product.  Alpha, Beta, Finished or Not... the developers have given me years of standing by their product and many updates with new content and mechanics.  For that alone, I love their game!\n\nGraphics: 3 outta 5 graphics, she looks a little dated but they keep updating it... It looks better than it originally did.  There's growth\nReplayability: 5 outta 5\nGameplay:3 outta 5... sometimes she's a little clunky\n\nI definitely still believe that this game is worth buying and that they devs and their product is worth supporting.  Hopefully this is helpful to someone.\n- This does what I wish AAA RPGs with narratives would do; choices actually feel like they make an impact and the gameplay changes that reflect this are dynamic in nature and provide meaningful differences in the conversations.\n\nIt doesn't feel this way on a macro scale, the meaning is more in the individual encounters with some exceptions. To word it a little differently, I felt like my choices had very little impact on the story as a whole and I could easily (a little too easily) steer the final outcome at any time but, within individual interrogations, what I chose to do had a major affect on the immediate narrative.\n\nThat being said, it is a wonderful game to play for four to six hours on a Sunday and at $15 USD it is cheap and entertaining enough to only need a single playthrough to feel like you've gotten your money's worth. Although I haven't started my second playthrough, I'm already thinking about when I want to sit down and have another go.\n- Smooth beats, sick moves.\n\nOlliOlli was the best endless runner/rock hard skateboard move combo game I'd played in months. Well, the best just got better!\n\nWhy's it better? Polish, nollies, the aforementioned beats and some added smoothing.\n\nRad.\n- A dude looked at you funny? Punch him. Some guy is chilling by the river? Kick him in. A girl has a cute outfit on? Divekick her from across the street. Bought pizza at a food truck? Uppercut the staff. Violence is never the answer; It is in fact the question, and the answer is YES.\n- This game will leave you satisfied.\n\nI know that doesn't sound like much of a selling point, but it is. This game won't give you a sequal hook, it won't give you a product carved away like a thanksgiving turkey, each part sold seperately or held to ransom. \n\nThis is not a game about standing victorious over your enemies, it's not a game with some kind of adrenal rush that will leave you drained and empty afterwards.\n\nThis isn't a game about saving the world, as surprising as that may sound considering the hero's goal.\n\nThis is a game about hope. Hope for tomorrow, hope for your fellow man, hope for dreams and wishes, hope for a last shimmer of light in the encroaching darkness.\n\nThis is a game that will make you ask things about yourself, even if only subconciously. \n\nBut, most importantly of all, this is an experience that will make you say \"I was happy to be there, if only for a time.\"\n\nAnd I was, in fact, happy to be here.\n\nHats off to you ladies and gentlemen, you made a cyinical old bastard smile for a good ten hours.\n\n英語で5-10単語程度で、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない主要な違いを簡潔に回答してください。\n\n回答：\n",

AI does not do very well when engaging in displomacy.\n\nUI: You will spend most of your time trying to manage/hover around very CLUMSY and absolutely disgusting UI. Other 4x games offer far superior UI and make is easier to manage your asset on the field e.g. Sword of the stars II, Star Ruler 2, Distant world, Endless Legends, Endless Space etc.\n\nGFX: Graphics are not the top notch what you would expect from a modern 4x game but they are on far with Endless Legends. GFX leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nAlien Races: I dont need to say much but like Planets most of the races are COPY / PASTE. Nothing unique or special about each. \n\nMP: Multiplayer has a mind of its own and in most cases wont let you join public games unless its a private game.\n\nStellaris bring nothing new to 4x Genre in 2016!.\n Right now everyone is almost beta testing for the developers so we can find bugs, report them  and help them fix their game. Why not let players do beta before before release? But then there is  a question of sale and refund. \n\nBut overall this game does offer amazing soundtrack.\n- This game is great and is worth the cost, I have not tried it in VR yet but I imagine it's great....I have a slight urge to join the US military all of a sudden...\n- My profile pic is the reaction i have towards the game devs that made this game.\nVisually disgusting, gameplay wise impossible and over all terrible.\nWhile it's possible to beat it and get all the achievements it's difficult and also the space level is actually visual aids it's so disgusting to look at that you can't even focus on the gameplay.\nNot worth it even for free which is how i probably got it i can't remember and i don't want to...\n- A solid \"Get Va11HallA instead, unless this is on sale. Otherwise, maybe.\".\n\nCoffee Talk: Fantasy Coffee-brewing Action, is a day-by-day visual novel with slight coffee-brewing mechanics on the side. Its storyline is broken up into several days, of which customers visit your coffee shop and talk. The first few days are rather short: no longer than a few minutes, but as the story advances the days become more packed with story. The game as a whole is rather short, less than 3 hours to complete the main storyline. Overall, generally a well rounded game, but not $15. On the other hand, it compares rather poorly to Va11halla, a game with a nigh identical format, but has more characters, story, and charm. If you liked Va11halla, and really can't wait for N1RVAnnA, then get it on sale. Otherwise, just get Va11halla. But I'm still recommending it because steam doesn't allow maybes, and there's very little competition for this niche of VN.\n- Don't buy this game if you are planning a full co-op playthrough with a friend.\n\nAt first we thought only story progress wasn't shared which was fine as we'd both get to experience the missions regardless. However it turns out that all unlocks tied to completing each area such as new guns, cars and basically all the things you'd want to progress in are locked for the person who isn't hosting. This means your partner is stuck with the level 1 unlocks from start to finish unless they go back and do everything in their game as well.\n\nCompletely pointless and took us until clearing one of the lieutenants for us to realise this, bought this a while back too so not gonna be able to get a refund. Worst implemented co-op I have seen in a long time.\n- It's a cute point and click.\nI am salty though that it's tagged \"choices matter\" as they most certainly do not\n- Do I really have to write this review? I am just one in thousands of people who wrote a positive reveiw for Garry's Mod. Chances are, this review will never convince someone to buy Garry's Mod. It'll just be lost in the 100,000 positive reviews out there. Well, here I go anyway.\n\n\"Where do I start?\" This is the question asked by anyone playing Gmod for their first time. It's also my question that I ask about this review I am writing. Hmm...\n\n_The gameplay...the gameplay...hmm... Well, there's singleplayer sandbox. You can do...uh, whatever you want really. Just addon a few addons, and you can be entertained for hours. Battle NPCs, make cool scenes for cool screenshots, explore maps, be a superhero (spiderman addon!), and much, much, much, much- you get my point, right? Almost all content is user-generated. Make your own content! Multiplayer. In Multiplayer Gmod you can roleplay. I'm talking normal RP (DarkRP), Military RP, Star Wars RP, etc, etc. In multiplayer Gmod, you can battle, prophunt (yay), hide 'n seek, and much, much, more.\n\n_Graphics? I'll rate the graphics...drumroll please... 7/10. This game is and older game. Came out in 2006. I guess the graphics are good for 2006, and people enjoy the game and don't complain much about the graphics, but I'm not gonna lie, they are outdated and look old. It's not 2006 anymore.\n\n_Hear the bullets flying. The zombies growling. The people chatting. The boxes jumping... The sound in this game is great! Every sound is loud and clear, and there are a varitey of sounds.\n\n_Play this game. Play it again. Play it some more. Play some now, and play some later. Play it over and over. Play it as long as you want.\n\n_My Personal opinion. Get this game. Now. Get Gmod on sale or not. I'm not gonna stop playing it for a while and I'm already at 50+ hours of playtime. I love this game! WAIT! Before you go and buy this, then you wonder why there are all the missing maps and errors in most games, get Counter Strike: Source, so ALL the textures are supported.

This game is a rage precision platformer, it's supposed to be hard, but the best part is that it doesn't even have to be. That's why there is AN OPTION TO SET THE DIFFICULTY IN THE SETTINGS, and if you somehow are too proud to just tone it down a bit to get a better experience and instead decide to blame the game and its developer, then why are you even playing video games in the first place. They're supposed to be fun. This game can be a rage platformer, but it can also be a casual one. It depends on what you want.Will you snail has a great soundtrack, great level design, and super interesting story and lore. Is the game too hard? Change the difficulty. Do you not care about the story? Ignore the optional dialogue. It's that easy. This game is really really good, and don't let anyone convince you otherwise, especially people who can't deal with the fact that the rage game is hard\n- An amazingly fun and short adventure from the creator of Rakuen. Mr. Saitou is a game based in the same universe as Rakuen, but follows the story a salaryman, Mr. Saitou. Mr. Saitou takes you on a journey that explores some serious undertones, but approaches the subjects with incredible sensitivity, respect and some very light and silly humor. There's tons of flavor text to be discovered, pop culture references to be recognized and if you've played Rakuen, familiar characters to meet. As you make your way through the story, there are lots of puzzles that are simplistic, but well thought out in a way that adds to the story.The game is made to be played in 1 sitting that may vary depending on how much you interact with the world. This game can also be played by many ages and is family friendly. You DO NOT have to play Rakuen first to enjoy this game or understand it, but it will definitely add a depth of sentimentality to the game, as there are some call backs. I would absolutely recommend this game to anyone and you may find yourself learning something about your own life during Mr. Saitou's journey.Have a long day!\n- I had to purchase Scarlet Hollow after witnessing the excitement of Episode 4 through my friends. I immediately binged the first three episodes the following day and found myself and in rather different spot compared to their playthrough. The choices you make in SH are actually impactful - which is (unfortunately) quite refreshing for the genre! I've since run through several different routes to explore more of the story (and collect those achievements!). While you have the ability to skip through previously seen text, lines within replayed conversations are shaped by your selected traits, choices, and previously selected dialogue; you won't be skipping that many lines before seeing new content. Similarly, characters may be painted in an entirely different light based on choices you've made. The cast and writing truly nails the small town feel of SH (gossip and all). \n\nMake sure you eat the takeaway container in the fridge. Thank me later.\n- ORIGINAL REVIEW Posted: Nov 27, 2016:\nExtremely fun and addictive game! That IS if you practice and learn the way the game is supposed to be played.\n\nActually requires a lot of patience, aim control, learning of map locations, etc.\n\nEdit Dec 7, 2018: Stupid crazy full with hackers, now that it's F2P i feel like it's gonna get taken over by even more hackers... RIP 2012 CSGO.\n\nEDIT 2021/09/03: Some of you are morons here... Clearly a huge \"fan\" base of CSGO. I've gathered around 9,000+ hours in total (in my other account as well) No. I wasn't a \"Noob\" or had no skill. I was GE for a very long time.\n\nThis review is from 2018. After all the new updates came into place. I LOVED the game, It was my addiction. After those updates, everything went down hill. MORE toxicity, MORE blatant hackers, and I for one wasn't a big fan of the newest updates. So I decided to leave, updated this review with my most recent experience.\nReviews are meant to talk about your experience, Not to kiss ass and make things look good when they aren't.\n- An instant classic.\n---\n\nThe original [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/kunovega/recommended/264200]One Finger Death Punch[/url] was an unexpected treat for me. The refined simplicity of just two buttons that require masterful timing to create a legitimate fighting experience laid out to a selection of music that reminds you of the classic Kung-fu movies of the 1970's but packaged with a carefree stickman aesthetic.\n\nOne Finger Death Punch 2 is a respectable sequel in most ways. The core gameplay is fundamentally the same while the visual indicators and special attack animations have been upgraded and made more fanciful. Other things are changed simply to give you a new experience.\n\nEvery aspect of the game is polished from the interesting tutorial to the many additional modes (survival, gauntlet, etc.) that exist beyond the (very long) main campaign. Once you get into the groove there's potentially dozens if not hundreds of hours of fun to squeeze from this.\n\nThis is a game that just has to be played to truly appreciate it as the feel of your interaction along with the music is what really defines the experience. Simply watching it or looking at the screenshots doesn't do it justice.\n\nThere are a couple of (minor) controversial changes that may not appeal to some fans:\n1. The music in 2 includes a more modernized remix compared to the more traditional music from 1. Personally I love the soundtracks from both, but there are people who have a preference.\n2. The upgrades to special attacks in 2 can be a bit of visual clutter at times. I like both styles, but there are people who prefer 1 over 2.\n3. There are some sequences (like the lightsword rounds) which did not return in 2, replaced instead by other weapons. While I think it would have been cute to include all of that along with the new stuff, it's not a deal breaker. It does however mean that both games retain a bit of unique flair and a reason for you to play and experience them both. 2 is overall an upgrade, but it's also not a 100% replacement.\n\nI would strongly suggest that if you've never played either game, you should begin with the first one. I think it's a better entry point to the series and might have a slightly broader appeal. (it's also slightly cheaper).\n\nThen if you find yourself enjoying it, come back and pick up 2 and you'll find yourself with some remixed music, fancy new special attack animations and a whole new adventure to work through.\n\nJust to be very clear: Both of these games are fantastic and deserve more praise than I can properly express and I'll very likely be putting 100's of hours into this just like I did the first one.\n---\n\nBottom line: Simple to learn, hard to master, and super satisfying fighting along with a great soundtrack.\n---\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38232109/]While you are here, would you consider following my curator page?[/url]\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/kunovega/recommended/]Want to read all of my reviews and not just the curated ones?[/url]\n- [h1]Borderlands 2 - Excellent Story, Solid Gameplay, Great Characters and one of the very best Coop experiences around.[/h1]\n\n[table]\n  [tr]\n    [th][h1]|| 9.5 ||[/h1][/th]\n    [th]Score[/th]\n    [th]Comment[/th]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td]Graphics[/td]\n    [td]8[/td]\n    [td]Borderlands 2 has a visual style all its own, it may not initially impress some used to a \"next generation, high definition, ultra realistic landscape\", but it is nevertheless very appealing and detailed. Some of the landscapes and views around Pandora (the world on which the story takes place) are beautiful and each area has its own look and atmosphere. Characters and enemies are detailed and extremely varied in appearance. You can customise your characters appearance with a large selection of outfits and heads which you can collect throughout the game.[/td]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td]Audio[/td]\n    [td]10[/td]\n    [td]No real killer soundtrack here (apart from the the introduction video), just really good atmospheric music throughout. Where this game really shines is the voice acting for characters, enemies, audio logs and even weapons (yes some of them can talk!). The dialogue is often very funny, helping to explain and drive the story, fill in background and really adds the the immersion.[/td] \n [/tr]\n [tr]\n    [td]Gameplay[/td]\n    [td]9[/td]\n    [td]A mix of FPS and RPG, Borderlands 2 is a lot of fun to play. So many missions to complete, so many enemies to kill, so much loot to grab. You are given massive area's to explore all over the world of pandora filled with creatures, quests, secrets and homages to lots of popular culture. Controls are responsive, intuitive and the game mechanics (even at higher difficulties) feel fair and well thought through. As you progress through the game you will earn xp and levels which allow you to customise your characters skills giving a large variety of gameplay styles.[/td]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td]Story[/td]\n    [td]9[/td]\n    [td]The story in Borderlands 2 is rich and engaging. The action is character driven, and while the main story is fairly linear, the open world nature of the game allows you to take a break from the main story arc and explorer the hundreds of characters and side missions that can be found all over Pandora. It also has one of the most badass, charasmatic and handsome villians of all time... [/td]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td]Replayability[/td]\n    [td]9[/td]\n    [td]So many reasons to replay this game. Firstly the story can be completed at least 3 times with the same character at increasing difficulty and xp levels (normal, true vault hunter and ultimate vault hunter) with progressively better rewards. There is so much detail in the story and so many optional missions that each play through feels different. Next you have at least 4 (more with DLC) characters each with their own skills, playstyle and story to explore. Finally you have tons of loot in the form of Guns, Shields, Grenades, Relics and Class Mods you can collect for your character. These increase in rarity from white (basic) to orange (legendary) generally the rarer the weapon the more damage it will do and many will have additional unique abilities (red text). [/td]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td]Multiplayer[/td]\n    [td]10[/td]\n    [td]For me, this game remains simply the best cooperative multiplayer experiences you can have. Your character's skills really augment and compliment each other when playing as a team. Enemy and mission difficulty automatically adjusts to the amount of players, requiring real teamwork and synergy to avoid dying at higher levels. The multiplayer allows you to connect (drop in and out midgame) to your steam friends games or to public games, connections for the most part feel quick and responsive even with 4 players and with only a small delay on audio communication. [/td]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td][h1]Overall[/h1][/td]\n    [td]9.5[/td]\n    [td]I can't recommend this game enough, while a minority of missions feel like you are just a glorified delivery boy, most are creative, funny and packed full of classic moments and great characters. So much fun to pick up and play with friends. - I haven't really mentioned the DLC (of which there is a lot) in this review but the main ones (Mr Torgue's, Captain Scarlett and especially Tiny Tina's) are all well worth getting (these are included in the Game of the Year edition), great fun to play and add loads more content to the game. To progress to the highest level in the game (level 72 +overpower levels) you will also need the ultimate vault hunter pack 2 so I would recommend that if you reach the end and still want more. [/td]\n  [/tr]\n[/table]\n\nAslo Free DLC (until the 8th July)  \nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/872280\n\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/fancyfishie/recommended]More reviews by Fancy Fish[/url]\n[i]Agree / Disagree? Please leave me a comment[/i]\n- The EOS stands for End of Service. I am sure someone has fun with this or there wouldn't be a reason to keep bringing it back. Right? The usual Tab Target MMO. I do like that you can teleport to quest givers and mobs instead of the usual auto or manual run. Aside from that there isn't anything modern here.\n- This game made me so miserable . \nThe writing can be as funny as heartbreaking \nThe Voice acting is one of the greatest i've ever heard \nA lot of the time , the many side quest were as awesome or even better than the main story (That is already amazing )\n\nPro : The whole game \nCon : Absolutely nothing \n\nIt's one of the greatest gaming experience I've ever had in my 24 years on this earth.\n- This isn't a game. This is the beginning of a crippling JRPG series addiction. 10/10.\n- Fun Tower-Defense style indie game. Definitely one where your skill improves every time you die. And you will die, repeatedly. :P Expect to try out many monster combinations per floor before you find something that can delay the hordes of adventurers long enough to set up the floor beneath! I would probably enjoy some more horizontal progression + permanent upgrades for long term re-playability, but it seems like a solo dev/small scoped project. Definitely worth the price for the current amount of content!\n- Their last privacy agreement update (January 1st, 2021) states they will \"sell\" users information, including name, email and billing address to third party companies (including social media and advertising). There is no other way of playing the game without accepting those terms, very sad practices for a paid game really.\n- This game has (while this review is being written) 10076 reviews. 221 of these reviews are negative. I think this ratio of reviews is deserved and here's why:\n\n- It's a fun story, but not something outstandingly new or anything\n- No one ever can deny that it has an amazing soundtrack\n- The combat is a bit bland, but this is compensated by the fact that the game is pretty short\n- It's a short game, but definitely worth it\n\nOverall: it's just a fun short game to play on a day off. Also, I can't get this soundtrack out of my head! PLEASE SEND HELP!\n- Trash.\nAbsolutely destroyed the game to modify it to give it away for free on epic, to make a shit Chinese company happy.\nStabbing regular and veteran players in the back, that have been playing on steam since the beginning. The stellar update will;\n\n-Reset your side job progression,\n-Reset your skill tree\n-Remove all mod compatibility\n-Remove Linux support.\n\nAll of this for no reason except greed. You have lost my support and confidence.\nWell done Overkill, enjoy your crossplay.\n- This game surprised me in how good it was. I had heard about it, like everyone, and also like a lot of people I had dismissed it as a watered-down Dark Souls clone with a Star Wars skin, and let it collect dust in my Steam collection.\n\nI was wrong. The game's combat is tight and polished, just the right difficulty on Normal. The movement, the general game feel, is superb. The game has a competent story with excellent characterizations, character arcs, dialogue, exposition, world-building, and pacing.  The music feels like top-shelf Star Wars without being a lazy copypasta of John Williams's score (though you'll hear sprinklings of familiar motifs throughout, of course). \n\nThere are collectibles (they are all cosmetics), but it's a tasteful, reasonable amount of them, and they are distributed in a way that feels fun instead of like a chore, and you're never pressured into collecting them with menus or reminders; they are entirely optional in both a technical and a psychological sense. I actually found it fun to collect new appearances in order to play dress-up \"Fashion Souls\". \n\nThere are bosses, and they are challenging but not frustrating. Definitely easier than Dark Souls's harder bosses like Ornstein or Artorias, but still tricky enough that it feels rewarding to overcome them.\n\nIf I had to describe this game in two words, it would be \"just right\". There is just the right amount of each little element that it feels fun, never tedious, never like a grind. I'm a jaded old man who has seen it all and who is not easy to entertain, and I found this game extremely refreshing. If you read this review during the sale where it's only 3.99 USD, get it immediately.\n- PC version doesn't have rebindable controls for controller for some reason\n\nupdate: i have finished the game, still no rebindable controls, i can give a real review now. i wouldn't rate it negative but i wouldn't rate it positive either. this is a \"eh\" review.\n\nthe game is two games at once and neither of them are great.\n\n the roguelike part is like 20% of the game and is very simple and shallow, there's like 5 weapons and they all play the same, its also super easy. its ok but its not as good as a real roguelike.\n\n the cult building part is 80% of the game and is a bit more fun but past the earlygame its a bit eh too. choosing what you get doesn't really matter since you'll unlock everything pretty fast, and the doctrines 90% of the time are a choice between 2 useless things and 10% of the time a choice between a busted thing and a useless thing. the randomly generated quests the followers give you are just chores like revisiting old dungeons you already completed and the reward is pretty much nothing. its ok but its not as good as a real colony builder.\n\nnone of the systems in either part of the game are particularly deep.\n\nas of the time of this review, the game is still quite glitchy, though being patched by the devs.\n\nthe game is about 15 hours with side content and 18 hours for a completionist run. no real replayability \n\ni'd just recommend you get a full on action roguelike if you want to play a roguelike, or a full on colony builder if you want to play a colony builder. this game does both but is not great at either of them. \n\n game is very cute tho and the soundtrack is great. like 5/10\n- WTF, this isn’t gaming! Where are my lootboxes and micro transactions?!\n\nMy main thought after I beat GRIS was, \"I don't really understand anything that just happened, but it sure was pretty.\"\n\nI was absolutely amazed how a game with zero actual dialogue could move me to tears, just on strenght of its visuals and music. In general, the whole theme of dealing with grief/depression spoke to me in a way that I didn't expect.  It's one of those games you play to \"feel\" more than for the gameplay itself.\n\nI have PTSD from dealing with my wife getting a boyfriend, and this game made me cry several times while playing it. Especially during the scene where you're swimming away from the eel. That symbolism to me perfectly captures the feeling of trauma recovery. I'd spent time finding the little lights throughout that section of the game and activating the turtle which ultimately saved me from my own darkness and helplessness.\n\nIt felt like hope. It was such a good representation of how the coping skills I'd learned and the hard work I'd put in were finally seeming to pay off. It's when you're at your weakest that you learn how strong you actually are. I cried like a baby during and after that scene. It made me realize how much I've actually overcome, and how grateful I am to be free.\n\nGris truly is a beautiful game and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a slow paced experience. The only bit of criticism I have for the game is it certainly gives \"not like the other girls\" vibes at times, but I think this is quite easy to get over.\n\nIn conclusion: the visuals are stunning,  the music is beautiful and knows exactly when to kick in, the platforming elements are fantastic, and it’s story and themes are spectacular without a single word. Truly a must-play.\n\n10/10\n- This is a review about the port, not the game. The game itself is fantastic. I reference Moguri Mod throughout the review - this is a fan made mod that aims to improve the visual quality of the port.\n\nThe port is a lazy outdated mess:\n- It's lacking visual FX present in the original, such as the mist in the overworld of the Mist Continent. [b]This was fixed in a patch.[/b]\n- There is no way to restore the original font. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- Dialogue is rendered at a static pace, unlike the original. In the original game, lines of dialogue would show up on screen depending on how fast the character was talking. In this port, there is no distinction. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- There are multiple problems with the battle UI:\n-- It takes 40% of the screen. Square Enix patched this in the console versions, but the PC version was never patched. [b]This patch was released on PC in an update on the 6th of August 2020.[/b]\n-- It's rendered at what feels like 15fps, making navigation feel extremely clunky. In the original game, all menus were rendered at either 30fps interpolated or 60fps (don't know which one exactly), which made the browsing very fluid. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- All menus are clunky to browse because of the crippling low framerate. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- It's missing sound effects from the original. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- Despite porting the game to Unity, Square couldn't be bothered to re-write the animation code to speed up battle animations independently of buff/debuff tick timers, arguably the original game's biggest problem. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- The music in this port is a lower sample version of the original. [u]This is fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- The backgrounds clash horribly with the new character models. [u]This is fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n\nThe ONLY positive of this version is that you can skip the introduction to every battle. Except not really, because the option doesn't work half the time.\n\nThanks to the Moguri Mod, it is arguable that this version comes close to the original. Regardless of my opinion though, I'm not about to praise Square Enix for a port that the fans patched up. Moguri Mod is the only reason to buy this game on Steam.\n- In all honesty, I became a little bored in the middle of playing it. It wasn't until I was almost through with the story that I realized why it had gotten such high ratings. You have no idea how hard it hit me when I realized why he was at the hospital [him being at the hospital is not a spoiler btw], and how relieved I was when he had at last found peace. It was in that moment that I had no regrets in purchasing it and how it was worth my time. Despite how brief the game was, I'm gonna remember it for a while. \n\n\n- [h1] Risk of rain 2 is the kind of roguelike where you wanna have just one more quick run before bed but end up playing till dawn. [/h1]\n\n[b] Visuals: [/b] \nThe art style is easy on the eyes early on, but as the run continues and your screen starts to fill with clutter, the diarrhoea christmas lights at later stages can be seizure inducing.\n\n[b] Story and Setting: [/b] \nRoR2 doesn’t hold hands and guide you through its story because honestly there is not much story going on here. There is rich lore to explore for people who want to.\n\n[b] Music: [/b] \nThe lo-fi melody perfectly fits the perilous environment and matches the gameplay with synced rhythm and tempo. Sound design is good too.\n\n[b] Gameplay and progression: [/b]\nDrop into a planet, kill monsters, get money, buy items. Rinse and repeat until you become powerful to one shot God himself. Fast paced with constant running, jumping, sliding and juggling between primary weapon, secondary weapon, abilities and equipment. In each run the difficulty increases over time, which is an innovative approach to deal with difficulty. The roster is filled with unique characters who each have their own gameplay mechanics, making the game feel completely different. \nMost items can be obtained by completing specific challenges. You can also unlock game modifiers to make the game easier or more difficult to your liking. The challenges are one-of-a-kind, and the rewards are meaningful enough to keep players interested.\n\n[b] Game time: [/b]\nThere is no limit. It stops being fun when you decide so.\n\n[b] Online: [/b]\nThere is co-op to enjoy with friends and difficulty scales with the number of players. And if you have no friends, rest assured because all achievements are attainable through single player.\n\n[b] Bugs: [/b]\nNo bugs or technical issues.\n\n[b] PC Requirement: [/b] \nWithout a decently powerful PC the game faces severe lags and occasional crashes in long runs where you loop multiple times and a million things are happening in the background. Lowering graphical settings can help to an extent.\n\n[b] DLC: [/b]\nSurvivors of the Void DLC adds excellent new characters, stages, items,  enemies and alternate endings.\n\n[b] Price: [/b]\nWorth every penny.\n\n[b] My only problem with the game is it doesn’t have a save system. Once you start a run, you will have to see it through to the end. I want to be able to stop at any stage and continue from there later on. I don’t always have hours required to do multiple loops in one sitting. Although there is a mod for saving, I would love a native option. [/b]\n\n[b] Rating: [/b] \nThe Devs are continuously supporting and updating the game which is commendable. The community is very active and you can add tons of community made [b] mods [/b] to breathe new life into your game. \nI highly recommend it. [b] 10/10 [/b]\n- Based on the generic, cartoonish-sounding name and (at first glance) Hearthstone-looking graphics, I initially ignored Monster Train. But I later read some praise for it that made me think it might be worth a look. Especially since it turned out that I already owned it from a bundle or something. \n\nAnd what I discovered was a compelling mix of the best elements of Slay the Spire and My Life as a Darklord. A run generally takes less than an hour, and with so many possible combinations there's always something new to explore and try to exploit.\n- To be completely honest, throughout my entire playthrough, I was thinking on giving this game a \"Not Recommended\" but it really wouldn't have deserved it. This game is at the same time both very difficult to recommend as to not recommend. It is really a beatiful and extremely original game, with a pretty well told interesting story. However, the problem it has is that it doesn't really work as a puzzle game. Puzzle solutions don't make logical sense most of the time and you end up brute forcing your way through most of the game. This means trying every posibility until something works and moves the story foward, and this is just not good puzzle design. This also distracts you from the story being told, which is in itself not so easy to understand, it requirers you to be paying attention to details, so your brain has to be constantly switching between \"puzzle mode\" and \"story mode\". Anyway, you can tell a lot of love was put into this game, and that is why I ultimately recommend it.\n7.5/10-\n- Read all the 10 negative reviews for the game, and not a single positive review is present. All the reviews are fairly accurate to what the game presents to its players. A tacky First-Person Shooter with bad FPS rates, mediocre animations and effects, as well as a cursor that is not even aligned to the target pointer. No comment on the goal, as it is either self-explanatory, or the audio and Sound effects, as it was nothing note-worthy.\n\nIn short, not a single pro is evident in this game, or in my experience during playing. By the end of it, I simply ran Tales of Destruction for the Trading Cards, then uninstalled, and proceeded to Hide from library.\n\nTales of Destruction is not worth a single cent, nor is it worth playing.\n- Took me a while to play this because there were some critical bugs during release day, but the devs worked hard to fix everything up.\n\nNow, this is the premium version of Mad Father which is not just a straight re-release of the free version, but an upgraded one (in many ways, I'm told). Better graphics, better level design, better everything. It's a really tight experience without any filler and with an interesting story, so any fans of RPGMaker-type horror games will find this a highly enjoyable experience.\n\nYou can also increase the game's window size, so don't worry if you're running a high-resolution display. This is a feature that is not exactly common for these types of games, but this game has got you covered.\n\nI'm looking forward to future games from the dev!\n- And that's it, after 278 hours of play, the adventure is over... \nThis type of game that you wish you could forget so you could rediscover it like the 1st time, where you discover everything, a bit like a child\nIt's a game made with passion for video games, to tell a story, to make the player laugh too, and to make him a little melancholic or horrified or even sickened sometimes\n\n[u]Divinity OS 2 will have marked my young adult life[/u], like Sonic and megadrive games, Pokémon, FFTactics, Zelda and gameboy / gamecube games, Warcraft3 (TT), or Mass Effect and other PC games did in my childhood and adolescence (I surely forget so much excellent games)\n\nIt's a 20/20 for me. The work is titanic. The game is really made with passion. The studio is very talented.\n\nSo when Steam asks me [i]\"Do you recommend this game\"[/i], I say:\nYes! Because this is where you feel that video games are an experience, an adventure to live! \nI went through Rivellion with my buddy, like I went through Kanto (Pokémon), or Ivalice in FF Tactics as a kid!\n\n\n[u][b]Atmosphere:[/b][/u]\nMany of us probably remember our adventures in Pokémon or other games in our childhood. We roamed, discovered and lived in these worlds!\n\nHere, it's the same thing, and not alone this time: I was with a very good friend! \nWe met frequently to venture into the world of Divinity as a lightning lizard warrior or a skeletal assassin with a mysterious past...\n\nWith our companions Lohse and Ifan, and Maladie, and Gareth, and Jahan and Han the survivor kid and Sir Lora and so many others. Impossible to forget... \n[i]They exist! Stop lying, I know they exist ![/i]\n\nOur choices were important: We decided to do justice to this or that person, provoking reactions (or death) in certain characters, slapping a few Magisters around when necessary\nAnd of course, we STRONGLY decided to stea... Borrow a lot of spells and equipments from the merchants, while the other one was distracting by chatting...\n... What? We didn't have the money and we had to save the world ! Well, we had the money, but you never know, maybe one day we will need it... !\nAnd then stealing, it's fun. And exhilarating hehehe\n\n\n[u][b]Gameplay:[/b][/u]\nA 3D tactical turn-based game, to play with friends. Really ! Don't play this game alone, I'm sure that with at least 1 buddy (or 3!), you will exploit the game to its full potential!\n\nAlso, [u]you can change your skills and class at any moment in the game[/u], it's very flexible ! I played rogue all my game, and in the last chapiter, I decided to play with spear and War skills ! I really enjoyed being able to switch like this, as I want ! The game want you to take FUN, not \"suffering\" your \"bad\" class choices !\n\nToo bad, I don't know anyone who is ready to take on the role of a GM (Game Master), to live a personalized campaign! Because it is a mode apart from the main campaign!\n\n\n[u][b]Music:[/b][/u]\nExtremely good and fits perfectly with the atmosphere of the game. This kind of OST that we listen to when we work and that makes us live our adventures again when the song becomes EPIC!\n\n\n[u][b]In summary:[/b][/u]\nTitanic content, assured re-playability for those who wish to know what would have happened if they had answered something else than \"FIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT\", and I repeat, the fact of being able to play with friends makes the game so much more pleasant to do!\n\n\n[b]*Sob*[/b]\nBut no, I'm not crying... I'm just allergic to emotions!\n\nI would like so much to forget this game to be able to rediscover it\n\nPlease play it, at least give it a try, and let yourself be immersed in Div's world!\n\nIn our case, we will do it again in HARDCORE mode !\n\nPeace guys !\n- Overall the concept and idea of the game is good and I would recommend it. It is worth the price for the amount of fun time you can have with it.\n\nPositives:\n+ Initially the game gives you some good frights and tension\n+ Variety of characters, ethnics and aesthetics to pick and chose from\n+ Variety of skills and abilities that are mostly unique and some have good synergy\n+ Variety of maps\n+ DLC costs are fair\n+ Skin costs are fair\n+ One of very few companies who communicates with the community\n+ A lot of good license characters available\n+ The game has a tutorial that explains the basics\n+ Various ways to play the game (stealth / agressive)\n\nNegatives:\n- A few bugs here and there\n- Some really annoying perks / addons on killers / survivors like 1 shot long range axes (to name an example), keys and moris (to name a few more)\n- Toxic community - Not everyone is toxic but a large portion of players are but lets be real you get that in every game these days\n- Matchmaking is pretty bad (but DBD is trying to fix this)\n- Sometimes unfair hit detection - Some hits look like you are being smacked way out of range or as a killer you see the grab animation on a survivor and then it just cancels out\n- Steep learning curve / unforgiving gameplay. You either have to learn and improve and adapt and overcome or you will be having a bad time as you climb ranks.\n- Some of the tightest controls, buttery smooth animation and gorgeous scenes you'll see all year. I've bought it three times now, (once for me, twice as gifts for friends) and each time was worth it.\n\nSupport developers like these.\n- EDIT:\nRobot Entertainment has decided to dump Gameforge as the EU publisher and publish the game themselves. I would like to applaud their decision. Better late (in this case quite late) than never. However, I will not change this review to recommended for the simple fact that they shouldn't have selected that publisher in the first place. This is what ultimately ruined the EU version of the game, and it should be a good example to any other developers who consider Gameforge as their publisher (although more are more developers are duming Gameforge nowadays). I am not going to edit any of the details below since I haven't played the game after I wrote the original review, but I will most certainly consider returning to the game after the migration of the servers is complete.\n\nHere's the original review:\nPart 1:\nHow To Kill A Potentially Good Game (For Dummies):\n- Make a potentially good game.\n- Give the publishing rights to Gameforge.\n- Done!\n\nI mean, let's take a look at some of the games that Gameforge ruined:\n- Aion EU (utterly dead)\n- Tera EU (completely dead)\n- Soldier Front 2 EU (a.k.a. \"S.K.I.L.L., although the only skill you need for that game is a wallet)\n- Raiderz EU (shut down)\n- Mythos (shut down)\n- Katsuro: Path of Honor (shut down)\n- Hellbreed (shut down)\n... the list goes on ...\n\nWhy would ANYONE in their right mind allow Gameforge to publish their game?! Gameforge is known as the WORST European publisher. No one does business with them anymore and they're close to filing for bankruptcy. They already closed their location in Berlin. Why would you do that, Robot Entertainment?\n\nIt could have been a great game...\n\nPart 2:\nSince some lovely folks commented that they would REALLY (real-time executive realness) want me to review the game itself, and not its publisher, here you go:\n\nPros:\n- Great voice acting. The way they went with it (overly sarcastic) could have ended up being cringy, like the one in Wildstar, but instead, they did a good job with it.\n- Good animations. The game feels like it's polished and well executed.\n- Short queues and loading screens.\n- Interesting tower defence gameplay (as far as the Survival mode goes).\n- Character development and a crafting system.\n- Runs great on a high-end laptop.\n\nCons:\n- Poorly optimized for computers that are supposed to be able to run the game on its minimal settings.\n- Gets quite repetitive quite fast.\n- Grinding for materials can be tedious.\n- The Siege mode needs a lot of work. It is nowhere near as polished as the Survival mode.\n- The Survival mode can be too short at the early levels.\n- The developer decided to give the game to the worst publisher in Europe, and probably even the world. I mean, even EA isn't that bad anymore. I guess Gameforge could compete against Webzen for the first place.\n- You are able to buy almost everything with real cash, and if you don't want to, you better prepare for a long grind.\n- Did I mention how stupid the decision to give the publishing rights to Gameforge was? I think I did, but oh well...\n- The game is basically a cash shop oriented version of OMD! 2.\n\nThere you go! You're welcome.\n\nP.S.: Needless to say, I won't be spending a dime on this game, as long as Failforge gets a cut. I encourage everyone to do the same. Robot Entertainment might get their heads out of their... (you got the point) and change the publisher before it's too late for the game.\n- A Short Hike is a relaxing, casual game about exploring an expansive, mountainous island park and eventually making your way to its summit so you can get cell phone reception.\n\nYou play as Claire, a bird who can climb, glide, and flap to great heights using a stamina system based upon how many golden and silver feathers you’ve collected. Along the path to the mountaintop you’ll encounter Animal Crossing-style characters who are friendly, punny, and usually have some minor task for you to solve, ranging from finding lost items to making deliveries.\n\nHelping residents of the island is completely optional, as is just about every activity in the game other than locating a few feathers and reaching the summit; as a result, length can range from an hour if you don’t stop to smell the roses to a few hours if you decide to make friends with everyone and see all the park has to offer.\n\nActivities include filling out a fishing journal by trading in your catches, digging in suspicious spots, solving treasure map clues, parkour racing, and opening up shortcuts by breaking blocked entrances and watering bouncy flowers. \n\nA Short Hike has a charming aesthetic and a lovely, peaceful soundtrack. I felt driven to see everything the game had to offer despite not being forced into any of it and never lost interest until I did so. It’s a beautiful little world that will make fans of Animal Crossing feel right at home.\n- Only one word to describe this game\n\nOutdated.\n\nThere is no real point to get this game unless you want a slightly better looking UI and atmosphere. L4D2 already contains the campaigns from L4D1 and is where the entire Left 4 Dead community is. Only a small playerbase still plays l4d1, mostly out of nostalgia. But there is quite literally no reason to get the game.\n\nYou can grab it if you are into achievements, but only do so when it goes on sale, i grabbed it for a couple penny, still a bad idea.\n- [I received this product for free from a giveaway]. Only played for a short time, but sheesh, it's a bit of a mess both visually and gameplay wise. There's not much I can really say that would differ from what's shown in the trailer (rather crude MS-paint looking drawings with a few short looping backgrounds). You jump when moving right or left, flappy-bird esque, you dodge stuff going across the screen and from the top, which is a bit boring to me, but some may enjoy it more. You also have to go out of the screen to dodge sometimes, but also if you go too far out (who knows how far) you'll die as well. It might be an okay time waster for free (like old flash games), but I wouldn't recommend spending your money on this.\n- Great game, Horrible new publishers who stole the IP from the original creators. Do not support these thieves\n- If you notice that Kagami voice sounds different, that’s because the guy who voiced him in the first game, Brad Venable, died at the beginning of last year. This time, Kagami is voiced by Austin Lee Mathews, who voiced Roche (Final Fantasy VII Remake) and Ash Carbide (Cold Steel III and IV). \n\nRest In Peace, Brad. We may forget Kaniza’s name, but we won’t forget yours. And thank you for being one of the funniest character in the game.\n- Is Duskers a fun game? Yes. Would I recommend it? No, because of one simple reason:\n\nA lack of content with no mod support.\n\nDuskers is a little like No Man's Sky in the sense that the first few hours are filled with fun and wonder, but everything afterwards becomes a disappointment because the game turns out to be far more shallow than it initially seemed. As a player, I yearned to explore more of the randomly generated galaxy in Duskers because I wanted to see what other horrors, mods, and derelict types I would encounter in the empty universe - but in the end, it turned out that there was really very little else to see besides what you find in the first couple of hours. \n\nHere's a quick rundown of where the content was most lacking:\n\n--Enemy types: there's only 4 different enemies. FOUR. They also behave pretty much identically with the exception of the last one.  This was definitely the biggest interest-killer for me. \n\n--Derelict types end up mattering very little. Government A? Salvage C? Military B? It really doesn't change the layout in a particularly noticeable fashion, with the only differences being 1-2 extra ship defense turrets or something like that. \n\nI really, really wanted to give Duskers a thumbs up - I loved the aesthetic, I loved the atmosphere, and I loved the unique command line interface - but unfortunately, after a few hours, I came to realize that there's really just not enough actual content here, and that's heartbreaking for fans of this niche genre like myself.\n\n\n- The Steam trailer really doesn't do this game justice.\n\nIts extremely early access right now, and the gameplay itself is nothing too spectacular (yet), but the super dynamic proximity chat is what really makes this game for me.\nHearing the muffled screams of someone getting choked out by a bug, followed shortly after by the panicked wails of another crewmember running for the life, is likely one of the funniest things I have ever experienced in a video game.\nIt truly is such a simple, yet infinitely expandable mechanic that I am really exited to see build upon in the future.\n\nPERSONAL IDEA IF THE DEVS READ THIS REVIEW:\nA monster that picks a target to stalk and follow silently. While stalking, the monster records whatever its target says, then, after it has stalked enough and kills it target, it turns from a hunter to an ambush predator. Staying stationary in the dark and playing the recorded sounds of its now dead target in order to lure in their friends.\nImagine hearing your friend, rounding the corner, and realizing that your friend is already long dead...\n- As a current spec op who has seen conflict in China, North Korea and Dust II, it's clear to me this game is barely mil-sim YET much more than another arcade type shooter ala COD. Within the weapon systems selection, well I'd say its pretty sparse as are the clothing options but where this game shines is in the finite number of deaths one can suddenly have, somewhat similar to the amount of coronary artery blockages the average American can withstand before succumbing to a cheeto dust infused death ride to St. Michaels gate.\n\nGraphically it is fine, runs well on my beastly PC (which is to be expected given the salary i earn putting my life on the line daily), seems to have very few glitches/bugs.\n\nThe sounds are way off though and needs a revamp on what actually body dismemberment should actually be like.\n\nUltimately what makes this game worth it is the player based, often I find myself among enthusiastic Aussies calling me the roo rider and exclaiming how fast my fast twitch reflexes are.\n\n8.3/10\n- First off, the graphics pictured here are NOT what the game looks like. Even in Ultra mode it doesn't come close to looking this \"good.\" \n\nSecond, this game is best played with a controller. Not that I mind this, but after years of mouse + keyboard play it was difficult to get used to switching over.\n\nThird, it says you can alter the dungeon and create new paths and doorways and etc. I received an item that supposedly allowed me to do this but I couldn't get it to work.\n\nFinally, for the price of this game, it should be something spectacular. It wasn't. I've purchased $10 games on Steam that are much better than this. Wait for a big sale if you're interested in this game.\n- WHERE ARE MY OG DS FANS OF THIS GAME? REJOICE BRUDDAS!\n\nNo but seriously, I loved this game to DEATH when it first came out on the DS and to now see an HD version of this game on steam. It's quite a whiplash but a good one! To anyone who loves mystery/ detective games, YOU NEED TO GET THIS!!! Good story, soundtrack and gameplay <3 AHHHHHH!!!\n- Instant uninstall after reading the privacy policy.\n\nShort version: \"We may collect any data we want (including sensible personal data) from the user and transmit it to anyone the laws allow us to. Also we may transmit your data to any foreign country where other (read: laxer) data protection laws may apply.\"\n\nUpon installation and booting up the game, the very first thing you will be asked to do is accept these conditions and enter your age so they can send it (together with other data) to third parties which will then show you \"appropriate\" advertisement ingame.\n\nYeah SEGA, aint no way I am saying yes to that. Uninstalled and refund requested.\n- One of my favorite Rockstar games to-date (next to Max Payne).\n\nThe negative review is for the awful DRM they've implemented, where you can't play SINGLE player if the Rockstar Launcher servers are offline.\n\nThe fact that there are people who pirated this game who can play it forever, while the people who payed for it are at the mercy of Rockstar and their DRM servers being online (for an offline game) is a joke.\n\nBuyer beware.\n- Tentative review of game in progress, but so far it is amazing and I had to leave a review in support of it.  As far as the game itself goes, I'm giving it a 9/10.  As far as the port goes, the lack of keyboard input prompts seems frustrating when they already have the ability to change between xbox and ps4 buttons, but I use a controller and expect most will for this, but it's worth mentioning in the sake of fairness and accuracy.  There is a certain graphics setting called \"effects\" with high and low.  High is causing major fps drops under certain conditions even on a pc with an rtx 3080 and a 5800x cpu.  Devs have acknowledged it and are working on improving it.  Other than these issues though, no problems at all.  Online play has been smooth and i haven't experienced any disconnects.  The game itself has only crashed once in 93 hours, but that was also during excessive alt tabbing while the game was in true fullscreen mode, and it crashed on an alt-tab itself, so I'm not really blaming the game on that one given it was the only time.  Again, overall the game is playing great and I have no problems with it on a functional level as well as an entertainment level, I just want to be as fair and accurate as I can, and these were really the only problems I could find with it.\n- Today I stooped playing this game and uninstalled the game because it has a very bad development, very bad events, the worst reward, messy customer support and poor player' gaming, all my friends quit this game until me at the last movement, today a player was attacking and killing troops in the farming nodes for gain a event ranking, 20K a 30K troops vs. 100K troops nice balance very funny, I will not recommend this game.\n- So this is what upsets me about rainbow six siege as a casual player. I bought the starter edition like a moron. Thats on me. But I wasn't sure I'd like the game. Turns out I do. So now that I realize I like the game I want to fully purchase the game. Turns out you can't upgrade starter to standard. The game legit punishes people who want to play it. Who paid money to basically test if they would enjoy the game.  Why should I pay $55 for a $40 edition? Just let me pay $25 for the $40 edition. I already paid the money. Why are you punishing me for wanting to spend more?\n- This is how a Remake should be made, feels and plays much better than the original. The overall game design be it characters or the level is amazing! No doubt this is the best RE game ever, a true Masterpiece! Definitely recommended!! \nThe first playthrough should last anywhere between 15-17hrs.\n- Yeah sooooo I went 1k words past the max...had to pare this down...it's ok...I'm mentally stable...\n\nCrossCode is a top-notch indie in its genre. I'd mention it in the same breath as Celeste, Hades, and Outer Wilds. (guess I just did.) If you can at least enjoy both puzzles and real-time combat, this game is for you; it's not as much of a JRPG as it might look. The only real flaw I care to levy is that it isn’t incredible out of the gate; it’s merely good, and gets much better. I was going to summarize my reactions and add a \"what is the premise/gameplay loop\" section and have longer sections but I had to cut it all out so have _/5 ratings on the section titles instead. It's fine. I'm fine. Everything is fine.\n\nOk, review time.\n\nSTORY 4/5 NEATO\n\nThe story is great, and not quite what you might expect. It starts pretty light and cozy, with solid (and often meta) humor interspersed with cryptic moments. I like how casually the in-universe MMO is treated by the players. I enjoyed all the characters, including our mostly-mute but personable Lea. Once it ramps up, the story takes some exciting turns, too; the devs really know how to do drama without doing overdrama. I didn't relate too much to the story but I think it was told quite well. I like the portrayal of the antagonists for the most part, though I wish I could have felt their presence more often. The lore is also fascinating, if occasionally hard to grasp because the line between real and virtual is very thin due to the game’s particular premise. (The difference between real people and NPCs is sometimes unclear, for instance.) The ending was good, but I think the DLC epilogue wraps the game up far better.\n\nCOMBAT 5/5 WOWIE\n\nWhen you start out, combat feels almost hack-n-slashy. You can spam melee attacks and bullets for days, but you also have a charged projectile, a dodge-dash, and a shield. The elemental modes are absolutely the highlight due to the way enemies work, and the sort of limiter gauge they have forces strategy. Special moves are stylish and borderline absurd at higher levels. A huge skill tree controls them and much more; unlike some skill trees, this one requires choices, which is always a good sign. Oh and consumables are your main source of healing and buffs, and they aren't overpowered! Balancing win.\n\nThe enemies are really what make the combat fantastic. Almost every enemy has at least one gimmick and one visible weakness. The stun gauge mechanic is vital to all battles, forcing you to exploit those weaknesses to stun enemies and give you time to use your extra-long special moves. Bosses love to give you iterative micro-puzzles to fill their stun gauges, while minibosses are comfortably in-between. Bosses commonly have armor or invulnerability when not stunned, forcing even overleveled players to figure out the micro-puzzles to hit hard. (More great balancing.) Most weaknesses involve the element system, eventually encouraging you to swap elements multiple times mid-fight. The micro-puzzles will build on what you’ve been learning in a dungeon if it’s a dungeon fight. I'll mention that some normal enemies do feel like damage sponges at first, but you'll get used to this; the simple enemy design in the early game makes it seem worse than it is imo.\n\nPUZZLES 5/5 FUN COOL\n\nFor puzzles you've got your common environmental \"platforming\" puzzles, your specialized quest puzzles, your dynamic mini-puzzles in battles, and your iterative puzzling gauntlets in dungeons. Also almost everything is secretly part puzzle? Like, everything. They're an invasive species. They draw most of their complexity from the element system too. Each element has its own effects on certain objects and structures, and mainly you use charge shots to interact, though each attack has its own uses. Not much to say here; they're great puzzles. A couple may stump you for a while, but that's impossible to avoid, and I think CrossCode strikes a perfect challenge balance.\n\nQUESTS 5/5 WHEEEEEE\n\nWhile some quests conform to the typical hunting/gathering quests of MMOs, most boast some entirely unique content. Challenges range from unique bosses to puzzles to platforming to other familiar gimmicks that are secretly also puzzles. I won't spoil them. Quests generally use mechanics you have seen already in new, often very different, scenarios. NPCs are mostly there to be amusing or set up the gameplay, and that didn't bother me tbh.\n\nITEM MANAGEMENT 5/5 AAAAA\n\nItem and equipment acquisition? Engaging? WTF? Technically you get them like you do in any RPG. But, rare plants have high rare item drop rates, so if you know the platforming puzzle to reach em you don't have to waste much time. Enemies' drop rates rise with a high Combat Rank, which you get by killing many enemies in a row before the post-fight cooldown period ends and you get to heal to full and level up. This is tough until you're very comfortable with the area. Once you are, it's a whole new way of battling, using area knowledge to string together sequential fights. And what does the game do but give you a piece of upgradable equipment that grants the Combat Rating bonus to plants too?\n\nI actually cared about the equipment in the game too! *kisses Life Fiber Uniform* (yes they really make this reference) Equipment also matters more than level so the devs can control your power level better. Most times you can buy some basic equipment to explore, then return with items to trade to NPCs for stronger gear. Stronger gear has unique traits and you might prefer one over another, so it's nice that with trading you get to focus your resources on what you want. Sometimes you can trade some enemy drops for other ones, as I recall, which is a nice...uh, trade-off to get to make.\n\nQUALITY OF LIFE 5/5 HELP\n\nCONVENIENCE REIGNS in CrossCode. Text log like in visual novels? Check. Encyclopedia of story recaps, character summaries, CrossWorlds lore & terminology, etc.? Check. Enemy index? Check. Item drop rates? Check. Available trades? You beck. This is EXTREMELY helpful for an RPG, which otherwise would require a guide or plain luck to find rare item drops. Oh yeah also there's UI? I forgot about it cuz it's really good. Also the keyboard controls for swapping elements are a bit janky but I managed.\n\nAesthetics 3/5-5/5 SUBJECTIVITY WOOOOOO\n\nYeah if ya like what you see in the trailers and screenshots, that oughta be enough. I thought the art was average-good in the beginning, but like everything else the art improves as you go. They must’ve gone back and worked on old stuff, but not too much. The music is great. No complaints there. My one objective critique is, Lea has no depth perception -- the art makes similar-height platforms look identical. I ran into so many walls and stared at so many small flat gaps I thought I couldn't cross. I'm not a fool! It's the game's fault! But actually this time!\n\nA NEW HOME DLC 6/5 WTF OMG\n\nThe paid DLC is The Culmination of CrossCode. The epilogue is complex and fascinating and rewarding. The dungeon is an incredible all-elements send-off. I adore the new quests. And the art?? The environments, the enemies, the NPC portraits are all so pretty. Don't be fooled by the letters \"DLC\": this is not Discretionary Leisure Content. If you liked the base game, this is...Deluxe...eLite...C-content??? look these are not great letters to work with ok\n\nCONCDLUDSIONO\n\nWhat else to say? CrossCode good. Buy it. Do the thing. Also, look out for Project Terra, Radical Fish's next project. It translates their current style into a 3D environment with dynamic lighting. It’s pretty & it reduces that height perspective issue. There isn’t much info about it out yet, but keep your eyes out! (figuratively pls) I'm excited for what they'll come up with.\n\nHOLY **** I MADE IT AND WITH CHARACTERS TO SPARE YESSSS — ohnowai\n- When I show new games to one of my friends she always asks if it is possible to pee in the game and sadly I usually must tell her that it isnt possible because there is so few games where this special detail is being paid attention to. But this here my dude! I tried to show her the game yesterday so I got her setup on the valve index and start the game all good, but we couldn’t move at all... We tried everything! We tried physically move in our vr room to see the boards that had text written on them because we spawned behind them which I found a little weird as well. On the board it said eat the hamburger to start the game or eat the poo to guit. I saw a box on the street and I remembered by seeing the trailer there was a box where inside there was a burger so immediately we worked hard to try and reach the burger so we could start the game. It was too far away for us to try and actually in real life walk to it so we had to just accept defeat. She didn’t get to see her first vr game where it would be possible to urinate. I saw a update post a few minutes ago where you were saying something about movemnet in the game that you have to grip and throw arms around or something? This I guess we didn’t try since usually moving is one of the triggers to teleport or just the stick like in any controller. Today we will try again and hopefully succeed in our task to urinate in a vr game! You could be making history today my friend. And for all the bad reviews for this game I want to just say a couple things: cmon dude. Its one guy whos making this game! It is cheap and early access... those already tell you a lot about the game and you should not expect a triple a title and the experience of the century. I went through a video game making school or whatever which took 3 years so it was not 2 weeks online course I just quit after the first week so I actually know a lot what it takes to make games and with this I can tell there has been some hours used to it, but again it’s only one dude. My game didn’t work either, but it might have been because we didn’t know how to play. I’m not complaining for 4 dollars, I’m not a hobo ;)\n\nEDIT: And there it is! A day after my review and a 170mb update with new features and a fix for not been able to play at all :) I wasn't able to walk earlier either, but I suppose yo may not be able to in the \"mainmenu\". Gotta go try the update once my friend visits again!\n- Early Access Review:\nPros: \n- Hilarious flavor text in the form of Books and Proverbs. Seriously, someone took a lot of time creating all that.\n- Really enjoyable music\n- Beautiful pixel art\n- Engaging and interesting story\n- Overall very fun introduction to a huge world\n- Highly responsive dev team that's not only advacing on completion of the game but actively listens to their already large community of players\n- There's a lot of secrets and things to do that you might run out of time to do before the end of the year deadline. You may find yourself needing to play the early access a few times to find everything.\n\nCons:\n- This is early access folks, there's going to be a few bugs here and there\n- The early access content ramps up really fast and gets very interesting and then ends with you really wanting to know what's next. This is really only a con because I'm really impatient and want the full game asap. ;)\n- So this game was very fun to play with my friend... that is until it began to stop working on starting the game i have looked at the ubisoft forums and guess what many other people have had this problem starting from the games release and ubisoft has done nothing to fix this problem. i got off easy i paid $20 for this game on sale the people who payed $60+ not so lucky so dont risk it and DONT by this ubishit game\n- Homeworld is typically known as the very first 3D RTS -- despite this distinguishing trait, it's not very popular. It's rather obscure, which I find odd for a game that was made with so much love and detail. The story of the two Homeworld campaigns is very nice, the aesthetic of the game is excellent in my opinion, but when it comes to the multiplayer, in vanilla 2.1 Homeworld, the current version, you will face severe balancing issues between the races.\nFortunately, the community has come up with a solution, one that took a lot of time and effort to be. Thanks to them, the multiplayer is now playable with the patch that they made -- the 2.3 players patch. It's still being updated and is worked on by people who understand the overall concept of the game and the genre it belongs to.\nIt's available to everyone in the workshop and is in my opinion (and a lot of others's) the best way to experience both multiplayer and the game itself.\n- \"It has guns, swords, sexy characters, cheesy dialogues, and a whole lot of action. What more do you want?\" somebody posted and is recommending this pile of poo. How about not some random boring braindead splatterfest like this crap? Apparently a good lot of people actually have a need filled with this random gore generator. Should have bought some dinner instead of wasting money on this bollox.\n- This is one of the most beautiful games I played since Shadow of the Colossus. And much like SOTC This game is a visual delight not all the visual feel pointless or feel to in your face no all of it is PURE atmosphere and really enhances the experience when exploring the many levels in the game. The game's ability to tell a very deep story visually without any dialog or exposition to undermine the player is absolutely brilliant. the game be very diffult the first time playing but feels rewarding after you level up Ori as you continue to fight bad guys.\n\n My rating is 10/10\n A stunning game with a compelling storyline that worth every penny\n- [h1]Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Save scumming is a game-play mechanic and the game is balanced around the player being able to quick-save and reload whenever they want.\n[*] The game seems highly objective oriented, and I wish there was more optional treasures to collect, as I am a pirate.\n[*] While many guard situations appear to have a clear solution,  you can always just brute-force your way through or take another less contrived route, so the game doesn't devolve into a stealth puzzle game.\n[*] Post-game summary shows your route and enemy eliminations at hyper speed, and is always a fun watch at the end of a level.\n[/list]\nI really enjoy finally having a top-down style stealth game. Games such as Hard West and Divinity: Original Sin 2 also featured stealth elements but they were sorely lacking in favor of the turn based combat of the game. Furthermore, this game has pirates, making it an instant hit (for me).\n- This game can be great at times but extremely frustrating most of the time. 80% change to hit, miss every time. I can't keep playing a game with so much crappy coding.\n- How the hell did I not hear about this until the very end of 2021?\n\nA beautiful blend of all your favourite action-adventures: Your Zeldas, Metroidvanias, Dark Souls, Megamans (more Zero/ZX), Features local/steam play-together co-op. \n\nThe OST also slaps. I don't expect very moody noir piano in my dystopian cybernetic future but here we are.\n- 5/10 Too difficult to be any fun playing the game on normal. got at least 10 more hours offline\n+ they put in cheats to make the game actually playable. turned them on after finishing the 2nd world\ni went with 2 dashes and dash assist after all those wrong way dashes.....\n- people who cheat get the same achievements as people who dont, so whats the point???\n- no steam workshop, people could make fun levels unlike the entire game.....\n- one of those dumb meta storys\n- dashes got me killed all the time, janky. towerfall had way better dash system\n+ you can skip the storys, helps when replying levels over and over looking for that dumb B side track\n- Not what the developers promised.\nFeels like a graphics mod for Chivalry.\n\nI'm not a fan of Chivalry either. I had some fun with it, but couldn't bear the clunkiness and wished for intuitive controls and realistic fights. Mordhau promised exactly that. \nAlthough it's equally clunky und even more buggy.\n\nAlso it doesn't offer the option to play in private rooms with your friends (duel mode) or only on paid servers. Inviting a friend to a local match should be a standard feature.\n\nAll the new content and features don't really matter - it's a PvP fighting game. I need only a couple of weapons that work, not 100+ that don't.\n-     \nI was impatient for this game and i am very satisfied with it!\n\nThe Graphics are polished as would expect, the new circuits in Las Vegas and Losail in Qatar are very good together with others that we run at night the effects of the lights in conjunction with the illuminated buildings are incredible!\n\nBraking Point 2 is so satisfying it takes between 8 to 10 hours to complete, no spoilers i think but we have a lot of characters and some familiar faces from the past!\n\nNew F1 World, offers a structure of different Series, each one is a chain of events with having a primary objective that needs to complete to progress to the next, secundary objectives can be pursued for extra rewards!\n\nCareer Mode identical to the previous ones!\n\nRed Flag Deploying will teleport the cars to the pits where we can change our strategy to restart the race!\n\nDriving and Feedback, overall there is a big improvement more precise and dynamic the ffb on the steering wheel is very good, with Gamepad it's easy to adapt and get top times!\n\n\nWhen an update comes out just don't screw up the handling!\n\nF1 23 is better than the previous ones in every way!\n  \n\n- [i]While the artwork and combat remain enjoyable, the story, writing, and pacing were a major letdown.[/i]  \n\n***\nMINOR SPOILERS BELOW. If you're going to play the game, play before reading.\n***\n\n[b]The mature storylines, hard-hitting decisions, beautiful worldbuilding, and tight writing that made the first two so immersive is not present in this game.[/b] (You'll notice immediately that the writing for the caravan in the capital is [i]particular[/i] trite, awkward to read, and uninteresting.)\n\nUnfortunately, it's not just the writing that's weak. [i]The pacing is off.[/i] Antecedents are confusing, characters you'd expect to speak don't, events that should have been foreshadowed come out of nowhere. More frustrating are the serious character continuity \"errors,\" and arcs that disappear, change, or go nowhere. [i]In short, the events, decisions, and conflict from the previous games do not appear or resolve in a way that was suggested by the previous two[/i].\n\n\nHere's one example. In Banner Saga 2, Fosolt is unexpectedly rescued by Bolverk. [i]\"I have a message for Alette from the dead varl king,\" [/i]he said. That's pretty intriuging! Maybe there's a mystery, an oracle, an item, or just cool information about the Varl and their strange king? Maybe there'll finally be context about the bridge decision!\n\n[i]No! He has nothing interesting to say or add, and then his storyline just gets dropped and forgotten.[/i]\n\nWell, Bolverk's been possessed by Bellower! Gosh, who knows what Bellower will say? In fact, I can't wait to find out what happens to Bellower's body! \n\nWell, actually, Bolver's [i]not[/i] possessed, not really, certainly not like it was implied last game, and Bellower's body -- [i]a primary focus of the first two games[/i] -- isn't mentioned [i]once[/i]\n\nOr how about how they casually mention that Eyvyn is not only the [i]head[/i] of the Valka order, but also that he's had periodic bursts of hereditary madness all along? That's... odd. And it's not presented as an well-thought out [i]reveal[/i] or anything. It's presented matter-of-factly, like they were trying to ret-con in a less interesting story, or were tone deaf.\n\nYou'll notice that all the characters are underutilized and have unfulfilled storylines/tensions. Hakon has hard choices to make; Canary's a little crazy; Yrsa is mysterious; Gil's in love with Alette, etc. Will these build into choices? Reveals? Dependent endings based on choices? Will there be discussions referencing the past? Reflections on travels? Hints of despair?\n\nNo. In mine, Gil was [i]murdered[/i] and no one even bothered to reference it. Canary's situation never comes to a head. You never have to choose between Varls and Humans. Murdering people doesn't make people threaten to leave. Ubin returns randomly as an uber Varl and he's... learned the horseborne's language? Travelled the southlands? In like, a month? In a way that doesn't advance the plot? It's just... weakly done.\n\n\nThere are [i]so many[/i] examples like this, where the stories don't quite fit correctly, where what you picked up on in the early games about the [i]mysteries[/i] and the [i]world[/i] and what made it a [i]vibrant[/i] place were forgotten about by the writers. [b]The result is that it the game plays out in unsatisfying ways, in tenseless scenarios made vapid by watered-down morality, an inability to leverage the situation in fun ways, and low-quality writing, paucity of choice-making, a lack of exploration, lack of plot twists, simplified overworld mechanics -- all culminating in an almost staggeringly one-dimensional and shallow ending.[/b]\n\nThe Banner Saga series was always an experience that was greater than the sum of its part. An [i]experience[/i]. Of being [i]riveted[/i] to the computer, checking the map, worrying over supplies, guessing at mysteries, having my breath taken away at each hill. Unfortunately, that's not the case in this game. \n\n\nGameplay-wise, it's also a bit of a letdown. Combat is fun-ish, but you can make invincible character combinations and the mechanics don't even try to deal with this. There's an interesting new reinforcement mechanic that's not used heavily, and never pushes you like you think the end of the world would. You never really have to split up your forces. There's no novelty. Like maybe using a hero in a battle makes them fatigued, so you have to switch them up? Maybe you can station them different places, making them unusable for combat? Maybe you need to choose eight for a secret mission caravan? Maybe dream sequences? No, nothing like that. \n\nThe overworld gameplay had some changes that never really felt significant. Moreover, quite a bit felt taken away. You can't rest, do training missions, no longer weigh food vs upgrades. One example of all thise tone deafness was Iver's march through the destroyed world was consistently at \"Great Morale!\"\n\nThere didn't seem to be many flavor choices (\"Do we hang the criminals or let them join us?\"), including much less on social themes (\"Should women fight, if it disturbs the traditionally-minded men?\" \"One clan's rowdy, what do we do?\" \"They threaten to leave if so and so isn't banished\"), and less delayed results and fewer significant decisions, including among the game's built-up tensions among the factions. \n\n\nThere's also some cases of development [i]feeling[/i] cheap. Remember opening Banner Saga 2, and feeling that it was [i]fresh[/i], and [i]upgraded[/i]? There's little to make you feel that way here. The artwork is okay, but the environments feel more generic, with less variety, and the surreal landscapes in the darkness aren't especially interesting to look at for long periods of time. Iver is voiced by Bolverk's voice actor, and they sound exactly the same. The new title system is a fun idea, but is visually integrated into the game's menu system with the finesse of a cheap mod. \n\nThere's a moment in the game where the screen goes black for scrolling text and voiceover narration explaining the upcoming mechanic. Um, a character can't explain that? It was similar how the many two second animations are used, not to supplement the story, but to [i]replace[/i] written portions, making you feel unsure about what's going on. And finally, the game's pretty short, without fun combat challenges or interesting newgame+ challenges. \n\n\nWhat's [i]particularly[/i] frustrating is that the game's release date was moved forward four months. I don't know the story why, but I do know that a few more months of polish and story embellishment might have delivered the beautiful, grippingly interactive story we were hoping for. Because this is a watered down version of the previous two in just about every way.\n\nThis negative review is for whatever processes lead to this mediocre finale.\n\n---\n\n[i]Here's a plot that would have made more sense. Zephyr arrives and speaks to you secretly. There's a god that's still alive! Neat, now we'll finally get more story on that. Yay, fun caravan mode, now we need to take longships somewhere interesting!\n\nBut uh-oh! There's a Sundr villain going there as well, with an army of dredge! But at least now we'll finally get more story about the Sundr! \n\nThe god reveals something interesting, talks about Juno, the sun, gives a means to protect the city and help Iver. But when you return to the city, now the king and rugga and the factions have devolved into fighting based on your choices. How are you going to handle this? Which of many possibilities will ascend to the throne? How will you defend the city? And what mystery lies beneath the mountain of the city...\n\nFor Iver's caravan, there should be pockets of dredge villages kept alive by Spellsingers. Now you need to decide to plunder them or not! More stuff to do! Maybe go to the remains of the Varl capital first? Fight warped Valka? Realize deceptions, machinations, corruption, hear stories? Find new characters, have old ones die?\n\nInstead there... wasn't a plot?[/i]\n- This is, simply put, what I always wanted Minecraft to be. I played MC on and off for over ten years and generally, you get over that sense of impending danger, and bases built with teamwork don't feel that fulfilling. \n\nValheim fixes all that. Real physics, real combat, real skill levelling (use it to improve it), real teamwork, but most importantly, real danger.\n\nI love it.\n- Game does not become better with release.\nDups AI still retarded, they literally wasting time instead of doing work.\n\nJust a quick example:\nDup can go to the left side of map dig !!ONE!! block, then go to right side of the map and harvest !!ONE!! plant, then go back to the left side of map and dig second block. It's unbelivable boring watching all these.\n\nAnd you still can't destroy ruins, OMG. You can lunch rocket but can't destroy some ruins.\n- Everytime I browser my library, looking something to play, I see this game and I think: Rayman is cool, I gonna play, but then I remember this \"Requires 3rd-Party Account: Uplay\", and then I give up.\n- I pirated this game first and loved it so much I ended up buying it. It's that good!\n\nIt's worth your money and time. I promise.\n- As a Spider-Man fan, this game is a real treat. It was fantastic 4 years ago on release for the PS4, and it's even more fantastic now that it's finally on PC. If you're a Spidey fan, especially one who deeply appreciates the mythos and the message is represents, then this game is 100% for you. The writing, visuals, audio and gameplay are all wonderful, through and through. It's a true labour of love, Insomniac did an incredible job. Bring on the Miles Morales port!\n- A game that isnt afraid to be fun for the sake of it, a great game and one you dont see much anymore\n\nA great game to pick up after a long day of work, and you just want to hear some heavy rifts and kill some things.\n- Know your History: \n\nMany of you will already know this, but this game has ties much deeper than you think. It's no secret that Bethesda's Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim had extended it's life through an extensive modding community. For decades, literally, ENBs, shaders, textures, companions, and even story-lines added THOUSANDS of hours to an already sizable game. One story-line mod was called \"The Forgotten City\".  Over the next few years since it's release, the mod had acquired awards such as the 2016 Australian Writers' Guild Award, Zero Period Top 5 Quest Mods of 2015, and others. It was an astounding mod that threw the dragon born into a deeply profound, well written, and engaging story. It was a staple for my personal mod list for years. I've played the Skyrim version countless times, but as soon as I saw this release I immediately bought this and booted it up. \nObviously this is nothing like the mod, both visually or engine wise, but the spirit of the game is still there. It's more defined, expanded, and developed. It deserves every award and accolade it's received. When I walked into the opening scene and fell down the tunnel I couldn't help but shake my head and smile as a wave of nostalgia mixed with new expectations flooded my mind:\n\n\"My god, they've done it.\" \n\nHere's to you, Modern Storyteller, all the best and more to come!\n- This was a impulse buy for me just have seeing the new \"Fury Road\", but its a great game so far was kinda shocked it ran smooth right out the gate seems like today you gotta wait a week or month before a game can run proper though. Anyways beatufiful lighting, models / textures look good, vehicle combat / driving is fun, and vehicle customization is cool too. The on foot combat feels a little too straight foward though, the gore animations are kinda boring though, like feels like its a Xbox/360 game in that way, and collecting scrap can get a little repetitive. My final thought yea this game is worth getting but if you haven't played id's \"RAGE\", I'd reccomend getting that first, it's a extremely simmilar although kinda diffrent scenario game that will quench your Mad Max thirst.\n- Plants, please: A horticultural document thriller.\nGlory to Undermere.\nPros: \n- the writing and its illusion of effortless brilliance\n- attention to detail and consequences for player actions\n- \"gotta catch 'em all\" mentality that actually makes you feel smart\n- the intrigue, world-building, and game flow\n- petting the cat\n\nCons: I wish there was more music, or just none at all most of the time.\n- i would recomend it because the physics are great, the game has 8 or 9 level packs (i dont know if there will be a 9th because there are 7 at the time of this review) the units are diverse, there are a lot of secret units to find and i dont know for the final boss because the most expensive unit artimis isnt a good final boss like the dark pesant in the alphas but i hope that the games final boss unit is actually hard to kill and requires more than 7 archers because that wasnt hard or anything hopefully they will make the most expensive unit actually overpowered and unballanced because that would be a great final boss, the sandbox mode is great i like the custom campains , the custom units arent out yet so i cant say anything about that over all this game is worth the money and if its near a sale time like a few days away from a sale then get it on sale if not then just get it you wont regret it and if it lage turn off all the graphics settings\n- [h1]A game meant to bring back memories that is similar to Super Mario World on the SNES and it does this with relatively few gameplay and gimmick elements.

After all, it has to be ready for take-off in order for children everywhere to receive their presents on schedule. But a wicked troll blasts us out of the sky just as the test drive is about to end. He went over the line and wants to ruin Christmas for everyone on Earth. It is up to us to bring the troll to his senses and save Christmas for everyone.\n\nTLoS brings players to one world and six levels of great platforming that are reminiscent of Super Mario World (SNES) but simplified. There are only six levels total, one of which is a castle, before the final battle with the troll. The only difference is that we will be collecting chocolate cookies rather than the traditional yellow coins. We also lose part of our cloak when we are injured, so it's not uncommon for you to find yourself jumping through the levels wearing nothing but red boxer shorts. For instance, red blocks can give you a new coat, which means extra life, or Santa socks and hats, which give a power-up or simply chocolate cookies. The power-up allows you to throw stones as if you had collected the Fire Flower from Super Mario, and that's about it. TLoS also offers a 2-4 co-op player mode, in which players will be able to work together to complete this short and family-friendly adventure.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3009359595\n\nSimilar to Super Mario World, you walk to a level to choose them in the Overworld. Once we reach a certain level, we are allowed to walk, leap, and even sprint. Additionally, there are other indications on the screen that show you how many cookies you have already gathered and how much time is remaining to finish the level. We get an extra life when 100 cookies are collected. We can activate a checkpoint about halfway through the level to pick up exactly where the checkpoint was reached, instead of having to do the entire level all over again. The game also features side-scrolling and underwater levels. The only problem is that if you quit at level three, close the game and start again, you have to start from level one, so you have to play the game in one go. This means that there are no save points or \"save states\". Considering the length of the game, this is not a big deal, but it's still \"annoying\".\n\n[h3] My Specs [/h3]\n\n[code]CPU: i9 9900k\nGPU: RTX 2080 Ti\nRAM: DDR4 32 GB RAM\nOS: Win10\nResolution: 1440p @144hz\n[/code]\n\n[h3] Conclusion [/h3]\n\nWe are all hoping that Nintendo will release their IPs on Steam so that we can play with them one more time. We may all agree, based on experience, that this is probably never going to happen, but Indie developers are there to make it happen. To avoid the tedious teachings at school, you used to be able to play these types of games in class on the usual Flash Player websites, and now you can play them on Steam. Though it's not a masterpiece, it's extremely minimalistic, and it's unquestionably too short, the 20 minutes I spent playing it were nevertheless a lot of fun, especially because the platforming is accurate and not wonky at all. Just remember, it's very minimalistic and may be too minimalistic for some, but if that doesn't bother you, feel free to go ahead and try it out.\n\nIt would be my personal highlight if there were additional levels, more secret exits, more power-up alternatives, and more hours of overall playtime.\n\n[h2] Final Verdict: 8/10 A typical gas station snack that turns out to be a surprisingly good one.🎅 [/h2]\n- After sailing around for an hour or so, killing some huge crabs and collecting some reports from new islands I had discovered, I was running low on fuel and supplies. The game reminded me of this with a prompt titled \"Desperate Measures,\" so I was left with little choices on the matter.\n\n I tried to use my last two boxes of supplies in a vain attempt to desperately scrape together some fuel so I could reach the port of Fallen London -- I failed. Now I was faced with the problem of starvation, on top of the whole fuel fiasco. \n\n  Fear was setting in, as was hunger, fuel was low, as was hope, so I decided to beseech the gods of the Unter-Zee for help, and help they did. I was, for lack of a better word, teleported to some kind of temple dedicated to the gods, and that was where things went from bad to worse. \n  \n   This temple couldn't be further away from Fallen London, and therefore aid, than I could have gotten on my own. So I decided to beseech the gods again, this time my pleading went unanswered, a cruel cold-shoulder delivered to an ingrateful neophyte. The only purpose my inane begging to a higher power served was to unsettle my crew and drive us all to the brink of sanity.\n\nSo I abandoned ship and we all died, lol. 11/10.\n- Absolutely dated graphics that make visibility in this game a total exercise for your eyes, enemies and teammates blend into the background and scenery constantly, friendly markers everywhere obstructing your vision, insanely fast TTK with frustrating bleed mechanics...\n\nAnd the list goes on, it's beyond me how this game is being called a better one than Battlefield, are we even playing the same game at all? This game made me go back playing Battlefield 3. If you want to play a better game than 2042, play any of the others. BF3, BF4, BF1 or even 5, but please, stop shilling games like this and trying to justify it with the price and how many worked on it, this game is not even close to being better than a battlefield game at all\n- Wow! Let me start by saying that for the last year, I worked in what could be called a high tech arcade. We featured a number of VR stations there, and I watched people playing Beast Pets that entire time. I ended up leaving the arcade before being able to try the game (the stations were only on when customers came in, which is when I left for the day), but since I had watched enough people try it, I felt like I had a pretty good grasp of the gameplay -- cute and light. When I saw it hit the Steam store, I was curious to finally play it. I'm more of an FPS/RPG kind of gamer, so I wasn't sure how much I'd be playing it. Well...it's really fun!! There's an immersive aspect to interacting with little AI's in VR that completely changes the experience. For example, while playing Skyrim, you get to have little companions. You interact with them a bit, they follow you around, and that's basically it. But when you're in VR, it actually feels the same as when I'm playing with my puppies. These little guys can fetch, follow a laser, and interact with the environment. There are places for you to explore, and each location offers something unique for the dragons (and you) to play with. And speaking of the environments, they're really pretty! The art style is low-poly, and it works perfectly to create ambiance while allowing you to interact with your new pets. The creators came up with some really clever conventions for interaction that make the experience smooth and hassle-free. This game is great for everyone, and I promise you it's absolutely worth your time.\n- lmao they made tetris into a full blown religious experience\n- Oh boy. This is a beautiful game. There's unlockable items, a hidden boss, lots of enemies, and characters that change your play styles. Numerous ways to make the game accessible for you!\n\nBut is the game fun? I'd say no, the game was just ok. I wasn't really solving puzzles so much dealing with a RNG generator. Ironically the bosses felt slower and more boring than the levels, they are a battle of patience, wait until the potions fall - hit them 3 or 4 times - repeat.\n\nWould I revisit this game after some patches or dlc? No, probably not. Unfortunately I think this game has some base design problems and not content or quality problems.\n- It's horrible. It's annoying to play, it freaks you out, it insults you relentlessly. Yeah, of course I'm recommending it, why do you ask?\n\nWill You Snail is what it says it is. A platformer with traps popping on your predicted path with some meta plot and an evil AI commenting on your actions, mostly with clever insults. But it's also a little more than that, mainly due to the quality of its elements - so the game becomes more than the sum of its parts.\n\nYou're probably wondering about the difficulty. Well, good news: there are four settings, and by default they change depending on your performance. You struggle with the level too much? It's lowered. You beat it on the first few tries? It goes up. All with a (not) nice comment from Squid, the antagonist. I personally found the design annoying rather than actually challenging, but I'm quite sure that's intentional. The game's got it all: conveyor belts (that randomly change direction), underwater currents, perfectly timed spikes falling on your head, blocks that cave in on you after you break them. PhD in twatologist design. Due to the ever-shifting nature of the levels, I wouldn't even call this game a precision platformer - it's not about learning the level, but about adaptation. Luckily, the platforming segments are only one part of the game and there's some downtime between them, with optional (but fun) puzzles.\n\nOh, and for reference: I played mostly on difficulty 3 out of 4, sometimes dropping to 2 and rose to 4 towards the end. I found it roughly as difficult as Ori and the Blind Forest's latter sections, harder than Celeste ignoring strawberries, and easier than Garlic.\n\nLet's talk about Squid, the antagonist. The misanthropic, fatalistic, super-intelligent AI trope is pretty old at this point - but Squid is a very good refinement of that trope. It feels like he's really insulting you - the player - not the player character, like GLaDOS did. Mainly because he really reacts to the exact things that you do. You died just before the end? He'll point that out. You keep dying in one spot? He'll let you have it. You died to a spike? Comments about hitting your head incoming. Ran into a bomb? He'll tell you not to collect them. And so on. There so many lines, I never, ever, not once ran into a duplicate. That really makes him feel like a living, breathing person, not an NPC. I mean, he's not living and breathing... you know what I mean.\n\nOn that topic: if you've watched the trailer, you've probably noticed that Squid speaks with a non-native accent. That's because he's voiced by the dev, who's German; and indeed the general writing has this sardonic, matter-of-fact yet earnest quality that will be familiar to you if you know the German style of communication. No, no angry screaming, that's not how Germans talk. Stop watching WW2 speeches and watch some Staplerfahrer Klaus instead.\n\nAnd finally, there's the story. It's a bit meta, no surprises there. I won't write too much about it because I don't want to spoil it. Let's just say that it leaves many things out, but gives you just enough info to fill in the blanks. It's rather suspenseful; more importantly, it slowly builds up to... cosmic horror? Existential terror? Perhaps both. Also, it has a very clear message, delivered quite convincingly. Up to you to decide what to do with it.\n\nOverall, Will You Snail is pretty good. I don't think it's as flawless as many reviews make it out to be; the annoying design is still annoying in the end, even if it's thematically correct. Also, the music relies a little too much on the central leitmotif of the game, and it simply doesn't have the grace and variety to pull it off like Toby Fox did with UNDERTALE's soundtrack. Still; those little things aren't enough to wear down the emotional feast presented by this game. I'd say \"Guten appetit\" to this fine escargot meal, but in this case, we are the snails. Enjoy!\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42922988]Curator page[/url]\n- After completing every ending, completing the map, and 98%-ing my save file (I'm not going to hunt down whatever miniscule thing is left), I can sum up all my thoughts on the game with one word: Disappointing.\n\nTo go more indepth, as a standalone game, Blasphemous 2 was alright at most. But compared to the first it feels bland and boring in a number of ways. The few NPCs you see are forgettable, the bosses are forgettable, every enemy feels the exact same. \n\nThe executions, which felt like such a large part of the charm of Blasphemous 1's combat, are practically gone- not only do they happen much less often but there's almost no uniqueness to them, with nearly every enemy having the same animation. While in B1 there were 16 different executions (18/19 if you count certain bosses), B2 has.. 4 or 5 different executions? \n\nIt feels like they give no depth to anyone you meet, friend or foe, nearly all of them being left a complete mystery with not even a single sentence talking about who or what they are. Even the Penitent One feels bland, having gone from a brutal, unstoppable force hell-bent on reaching his goal no matter what, to some unremarkable silent protagonist who kills some things.\n\nThe world and its areas felt boring, less like an actual world and more like a jumble of random locations stacked like tetris blocks. The way the enemies were tossed into them makes them feel like they were all pre-made assets and they had to think of where they fit best, and the result was almost none of them fitting in with where you see them.\n\nEverything felt far too easy, far beyond the point of getting used to the gameplay and learning from the first game. Bosses especially were disappointing, all having too little health, and it felt like only a single boss in the entire game had more than three attacks. \n\nThe rewards for quests and secrets were unfulfilling and unsatisfying, whether it was giving a character an item that was obviously meant for them or slowly searching across every little corner of the whole map for tiny secrets you missed. \n\nThe endings especially were a huge disappointment, and they made it feel like everything leading up to them was entirely a waste of time and effort and took away what little enjoyment was left.\n\nEverything about Blasphemous 1 that made it unique- the worldbuilding, the gameplay, the artstyle and animations- feels like it's all been stripped away and we were left with this generic metroidvania that only vaguely resembles its predecessor.\n\nI [b]loved[/b] Blasphemous, it was and still is one of my all time favourite games, but I really can't say I liked Blasphemous 2. If you loved Blasphemous 1 I would honestly advise against playing this, the whole experience is such a letdown that it's hard to not have the first game spoiled simply by what comes after it. If you don't care, or you haven't played the first yet, then at the very least wait until there's a good sale before trying.\n- game is good and perfect graphics but i have a big big problem that the machines like harvesters dosent harvest all the crops and leave a lot behind !! and also sowing and planting machines !!!! what a big problem \n\ni been playing farming simulator since farming simulator 2011 and i never had a problem like this before ..\n\nHELP ME PLEASEEEEE\n\nPlus This game is just like every farm before :) only with a better graphics\n- [h1]Sum-Up[/h1]\n[h3]In-depth analysis further down.[/h3]\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th]🟩 [b]Pros[/b][/th]\n[th]🟥 [b]Cons[/b][/th]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]\n- A vast, detailed and impressive recreation of Hogwarts and its neighboring regions, packed to the brim with locations to discover, collectibles and activities to clear.

Rowling, at a time far before Harry & friends were even born. You’ll play as a fifth year student in the titular magics academy, admitted this late because of unspecified ‘special circumstances’. The virtual rendition of Rowling’s works is nothing short of exceptional, with not only Hogwarts itself, but also its environs (like the town of Hogsmeade or the dangerous Forbidden Forest), all recreated faithfully and down to the most minute details. Of course, some things will differ from movies and books, with the game being set in the 1800s. \n\nThe main story follows the classic ‘manifest destiny’ archetype, where your custom-made character will discover hidden potential that ties them to a greater purpose. Despite some genuinely memorable characters and some interesting side- and main-quests, the overall narrative can’t help but fall a little flat and stale, especially towards the ending phases. Nonetheless, many enjoyable adventures await you. Notably, there are no romance or love/hate dichotomies in the relationships you have with side-characters, as your choices will always end up in pretty much the same results during questlines.\n\n[h3]Exploration, Collectibles & Secrets[/h3]\nThe world is vast and visually magnificent, peppered to no-end with points of interest that often hold collectibles, currency or other utilities. Initially on foot, and later on with the iconic enchanted brooms and even flying magical creatures, you’ll be able to explore at leisure and clear the enormous amount of side-activities. A good portion of these, however, will prove inaccessible until you gain the right spells or abilities, in a sort-of ‘metroidvania’ fashion that promotes meaningful backtracking. Fast travel and an item-highlighting spell prove invaluable in saving time while exploring. Collectibles are mostly cosmetic, enabling the customization of both your wizard and your own private room once you unlock it, to suit various styles. \n\nMost dungeons and locations have additional puzzles or hidden paths that often lead to collectibles or extra resources; exploration feels rewarding, with a genuine sense of mystery surrounding each new point of interest you’ll find. Despite that, most dungeons and locations play out in the same way, and become repetitive in the long haul.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2933385898\n\n[h3]Combat System & Bosses[/h3]\nMagical battles use spells as sole means of offense and defense. Usually against multiple enemies at once, sometimes supported by allied NPCs, you’ll have to time your protection spell right in order to deflect incoming attacks, or dodge-roll away in case of unblockable ones. Enemies are varied and range from magical creatures to dark wizards and goblin soldiers, to name a few. Some of them may be weak to specific charms, others have shields you can break by using specific spell categories (damage, utility, movement) or other special abilities, like immunity to certain effects. \n\nCombat feels engaging, well-paced and is more than a little gory for this universe’s standards, death will be far more common than in the movies or books. The way you can combine spell effects to your advantage and use the environment further adds to the base system, while the amount of passive upgrades with item traits and spell-related talents you can gain progressively add another layer of depth. In late-game however you’ll become overpowered between potions, passive traits, talents and endgame spells - so much that supposedly fearsome dark wizards will prove little more than a nuisance due to power creep.\n\n[h3]Quests, Minigames & Challenges[/h3]\nQuests usually involve retrieving something, talking to a specific NPC, solving a treasure hunt based on visual clues, getting the solution to logic-based puzzles and more, depending on the case. While some side-quests are unique and memorable, most will be fetch chores or dry open-world shenanigans that you’ll have to repeat over and over in the same fashion. Less, but more meaningful and unique quests would have been better than this bloat, for sure. \n\nChallenges are paramount in unlocking unique bonuses like increased inventory capacity, many cosmetics, and even unique passive upgrades to equip in gear pieces. They often require you to slay X of a specific enemy, finish X of the same activity, and such “long-term” goals. Some of them are a massive grind and will only give you the 25th pair of gloves you don’t need, or other cosmetics that aren’t worth the effort.\n- I'm 17 years old. I'm sitting in front of my Pentium II PC and I've just finished installing Baldur's Gate. I've crafted my perfect character, and I'm now adventuring through a gorgeous world. I've fallen headfirst into the game reading novels worth of text and not noticing as hours melt away.\n\nIt's 17 years later. I'm 34 years old. I'm doing it all over again and it's like I'm travelling through time.\n\nEvery aspect of this game is perfect. I wouldn't change it even if I could. I find myself wondering how in-game mechanics work and I'm tempted to alt+tab and google what spell is best. Instead I just keep playing and figure it out myself. I can't even *remember* the last time I didn't look up this sort of info in a game. Who cares if this sword does a little more damage than that spear? My character likes that spear and he looks awesome wielding it.\n\nThis is the first Kickstarter decision I've made that I am completely happy with. Thanks Obsidian for taking me back in time and reminding me that you don't need gamefaqs to enjoy a game.\n- A very good recursive Sokoban.

[/h1]\n\nFallout 76 is boring. There's no other way to put it. The Core objective of Fallout 76 was to gear the Fallout 4 engine for multiplayer. They succeeded! The art is visually amazing, even down to the 2D art shown all over this store page, so what's wrong?\n\nConsider who's still playing this game. Who's desperate enough to play this game? Well, It's not a lot of people. And they aren't very good people. It's just people. Existing. I had 0 conversations during my 4 hours. \n\nLets talk playing. The game is boring. Since I just mentioned the objective, lets talk about the NPC's ETC. [b] I got this game for free, I cannot emphasize how little this game means to me. It's terrible. [/b] The NPC's & story were not part of core development therefore the game suffers. You get stuck doing some quests you don't care about and play a game you'd rather not play. The NPC's are essential as expected so, you cannot kill them either. \n\nMicrotransactions Via Atomic Shop & Premium plague the game [i] but lets talk about more! [/i] There's free events like a crate dropping & player trading outposts. Wanna know what's wrong here? The game boils down to, find a player trading outpost and buy sh*t, or just dropping crates? well the crates are full of nothing. the games gear-towards premium really gives you nothing in terms of loot so you're playing what is a hollow, unfinished, boring, game. Even in 2021! \n\nCreatures & enemies are cool however there's a big issue of the game not being cool. You may say its worth it to play just to engage the wild-life but even they feel soul-less and void of life. I don't know how you make a game so devoid of soul really. I've met mannequins with more personality than anything I met in Fallout 76. \n\nThe world isn't interesting, it's a barren void forestry area. Sometimes you get a tiny bit of quest, however aside from this game being a complete and utter lore-destroyer for those interested, what it does leave is not good enough to compensate for all of the cons. Honestly, if this was a mod for 4, I'd feel better. But even when getting this for free, I feel scammed.\n\n[b] I'll end this by repeating my hours. 4. At no point was I excited. Enthralled. Interested. I sat for 4 hours, wanting to tear my hair out and scream, because I was so bored. I had tests in school, more interesting than this. The entire 4 hours I spent playing, I wish I had played anything else, & I got this for free! I genuinely wish you the best of help if you end up buying this game. It's horrific. [/b]\n- I have never cried so damn much at a game\n- I play 100+ puzzle games every year and this is likely my favourite release of 2020.\n\nDraknek and his team have truly advanced the state of the art in how the game's world is put together and how exploration and puzzle-solving are interconnected. There is no other puzzle game that does quite what this one does in terms of the interaction between mechanics design, navigation, and secret-finding. It's not just a game about pushing and rolling cylinders around, it's a game about really interesting cause-and-effect relationships between the cylinders, the spaces they're placed in, and the places that you wanna get to but can't.\n\nIf you're a serious puzzle gamer, don't be put off by the game's pastel appearance and the choice of marketing and press quotes that emphasize the soothing or cozy nature of the gameplay. The game's content, including the low-difficulty puzzles, are still very interesting even if you're an experienced puzzle-solver. \n\nThe approachability of the game is achieved by having an \"easy path\" through most of the areas. In this case, easy does not mean \"uninteresting\", but instead means \"interesting puzzles that are rigged so that low-skill solvers are highly likely to stumble upon the solution\". If you're a veteran puzzle-solver, you may not even realize this. It's quite clever. The puzzles off the \"easy path\" are quite challenging (some mind-bogglingly so) and many are incredible feats of design that you will not want to miss.\n\nThe art, sound, and writing are competently executed, and the controls, audio, and visuals do not get in the way of the puzzle-solving. The narrative is entirely flavourtext and is completely irrelevant to the puzzle content, so you can ignore it if you don't care for it (but some of it is hilarious).\n\nThere is one \"thing I wish I knew before I started playing\", and this is that if you want to find all the secrets, you should first rush to complete to the game (get to the credits) before spending a lot of time trying to find secrets. Trying to 100% each area individually during your first playthrough will lead to a lot of frustration and wasted time.\n\nThis game is wonderful. I hope Drak makes an expansion/sequel with another 500+ islands. There are enough unused tricks and unexplored design space here that he could easily fill it (but adding 3x1 logs might also be fun).\n- Valve ignored this game because it doesn't rake in the money like tf2/dota/csgo and thats why its good\n- I backed this game back at the end of September 2013 and have finally played it through to completion. \n\nCandle is a beautifully unique game which takes elements from puzzle, platforming and point and click adventures. The puzzles, although sometimes frustratingly difficult, are all different and use different mechanics keeping the game engaging and fresh. Teku's Candle is such a interesting game mechanic that I really enjoyed getting to know and learn. As previously said, the game looks and sounds absolutely stunning. I don't think I have seen a game that looks this good before and that is attritubuted to every character and scene being hand drawn. Controls can be a bit finicky but not game breaking and you can easily adjust too. I would recommend getting this game because it provides a great whole experience.\n- Stephen's Sausage Roll is a game that the developer doesn't want normal people to buy, it seems. The description is literally, \"A simple 3d puzzle game.\", there is one video that shows you nothing about the game, and it's priced at $32 CND.\n\nFortunately, I'm here to tell you to get off your ass and to buy this wonderful game. The graphics are alright, the music is OK, but the puzzles are sublime.\n\nIn each level, the goal is the same: cook all the sausages and exit the level by standing on the exit level sign in the right orientation. You cook sausages by pushing them over a grill. Like in sokoban games, you can't pull the sausage (yet...), only push it. Another huge wrinkle is that sides of the sausage can only touch the grill once. If you touch a cooked side of a sausage to the grill, it will be burned and you fail the level. This little wrinkle will make you pull your hair out in some levels as you try and figure out how the hell you are going to maneuver the sausages around so they get cooked properly. A neat thing about the game is that if you fail, you can still continue playing the level, which might help you figure out how to play it.\n\nYou'll have a section (part of an island) that has a number of puzzles for you to solve in any order, so if you get stuck, you can try another one (until you get to the last puzzle of the section). Once you complete a section, a new section will open up with more puzzles.\n\nYour little guy has tank controls, which you will find extremely useful, as turning to the left or right near a sausage will push it in different directions. A nice detail is that the all of the puzzles make up the island section. When you activate a puzzle, the rest of the island drops away into the sea, leaving you on a tiny puzzle island.\n\nEach section introduces new mechanics into the game. First you'll just be pushing the sausages, but then you'll be stacking them, skewering them (you would think this would make things easier, but no! You can't turn when you have a skewered sausage!), walking on them...\n\nI would say that these levels are on the level of Snakebird, though I found many of them easier than Snakebird's puzzles (maybe I'm better at sokoban games than I know?). These are the kind of puzzles that you walk away from frustrated, but come back to a few hours later with the solution. This is the game where there are so many ah-ha! moments that make you feel smart. You have no idea what to do at first, but eventually you get better and better. You might not see solutions at first, but you begin to see where you need to go to solve the puzzle, and then work backwards from there. It's wonderful!\n\nIf you're having trouble, there's a community guide that has all the solutions, which is super helpful (though not as much when I was playing because it wasn't complete!).\n\nIt might be expensive, but I took 36 hours to solve all the puzzles and it was worth every penny.\n- New edit: The developers have made the steam workshop available, but as an Oceanic user I don't have direct access to the workshop and I can't upload mods. It seems to be only available to Chinese modders, much like the previous 3rd party software. The problem appears to be covered up and not solved.\n\nEdit: Modding capability is now available. The devs are using a 3rd part chinese workshop that we all hate (thanks devs), however you can use Nexus Mods instead. Simply go to the Tale of Immortal nexus page and download any mod, then add it into the local mod section provided in the mod category. Then you're good to go.\n\nBe aware that currently, from what I've seen, the IDs mods use are generated at mod creation and multiple mods have a chance of ID conflict (breaking the mod/s). So if you have problems this may be the reason.\n\n\nOfficial English translation is available. The devs have mentioned 90% is translated, but I believe it won't impact gameplay. Players who haven't launched the game before will be switched to English automatically.\n\nIf you have launched the game before you will have to do the following: in the main menu select 语言 and change 简体中文 to English (Alpha) and restart the game.\n\nFor my review: Having played the game, I can say it's both good and bad. It failed to meet my expectations but I still enjoyed the game and will recommend it. The art is fantastic. The combat is fun but lacking compared to other action & slash titles (there is a lot they could do with it). Quests aren't very clear and their incentives are bad making it hard to get invested. You don't get anything really unique or interesting from quests as far as I've played.\n\nProgression is the most disappointing part of the game. It's a mix of crafting, gathering and looting to acquire items that will either enable you to advance or give you a stronger stat-boost when you do advance. Every realm does the same thing, only requiring different items at the new area/s that open up for that realm. This is a shame. Progression is the area that has the most potential in this game and yet is the most tacked on part, mostly an afterthought.\n\nThe developers could've made each realm advancement unique, with different gameplay mechanics for each one that ties into the unique aspects of the area/realm they're in. This would be a fantastic way to give a sense of freshness to each area the player explores and make them engage more actively in said area rather than rushing through it as we do now.\n\nProgression could've been the strongest part of this game but they ended up making it the weakest. Again, it's a shame. I see so much potential that just isn't capitilised on. Overall this is an experience I'd recommend. But I'd only play it once in its current state.\n- First off, just want to say this isn't a Metroidvania. This is a Zelda clone. And a good one!\n\nI bought this game because I heard it really put stress on you. You have limited time to complete the game and NPCs will begin dying if you aren't fast enough. Pretty crazy, right? Well, I do have a few gripes with that, but let me point out the good stuff first:\n+ Amazing combat. You have access to both guns and swords, but most of your damage will likely come from melee weapons since they have the ability to do an extremely-easy-to-pull-off PARRY! Parrying an enemy stuns it and gives your next attack against it a massive damage multiplier. All enemies, all bosses, and most projectiles are parryable, so this is what combat ends up revolving around. Even though I call it easy, you still get that cool feeling when you walk into an ambush and clear it without taking a hit, so it never gets dull as you go through the game.\n\n+ Good dungeon design. Since this game takes after Zelda, it's not shy about inserting a few puzzles into its dungeons. The overworld as well has quite a few surprising secrets and side quests that you won't be expecting when you play for the first time.\n\n+ Sequence breaks. This is mostly for New Game+ (or New Game Extra, a separate mode where you have access to major exploration items from the start, but not your whole endgame inventory), but it was interesting to find out how many secret paths and shortcuts there were, and how tightly they were managed. The devs thought of everything!\n\nSo now for the bad stuff.\n- Underwhelming story. Guess how much is really explained over the course of this story. If you guessed \"all of it\", you would be completely wrong and here's your dunce hat. Unsighted ends up spending so much of its time on the protagonist's relationships that it fails to answer several of the more important questions concerning the game's backstory. Why was there was a war? Who started it? Where are the humans now? Why are they so disorganized? Why do they seem to have no chain of command whatsoever? How did the automatons ever win anything at all at any point when they seem so extremely outclassed? I guess it doesn't matter. Look, there's two robot-girls kissing.\n\n- Fake pressure. I heard there was going to be pressure before I started the game, so I decided to go DEFCON 1 from the get-go and rush everything. I ended up completing the game in 10 in-game days and I felt pretty good about it. Zero NPC deaths! Zero! I'm a super awesome amazing hero, right? Well, credits roll and... the only achievement I get is the one for beating the game. No one really cares and apparently you're meant to play through multiple times anyway. So... why did I ever care? Why is this mechanic even in the game? All it did was make me shy away from general exploration and side quests since all of those things are less important than, ya know, saving the world. You can call that interesting, but when it has no payoff, it ends up being frustrating.\n\n- No post-game. Did I mention, if you bumrush the game and finish with just hours left on everyone's timers, you don't get to do any extra no-timer exploring afterwards? No, the game's over. Load the save and you get set back to where you were before fighting the final boss. If you want to do any actual exploring, that's what \"Explorer\" mode is for. You know, that mode that makes you feel like you're cheating?\n\nBasically, Unsighted is another game filled with missed opportunities. I recommend this game because the core gameplay and level design is very well done and very well executed, but you should probably know this before you start:\n\nThe only pressure here is the one you imagine. Since the game does nothing to acknowledge your successes, just play it at your own pace and don't be shy about using Explorer. Shame on the devs for hailing the agony of defeat, but not the thrill of victory.\n- This is trash, I mean if you eat shit for breakfast I'm sure you'll like it.  You have to pay to have access to graphics better than the PS2's, also your stuff gets deleted every week. All there is to do is punch a couple zombies.  Don't get this game.\n- 1. Mea Culpa > Ruego Al Alba\n2. combat feels much better\n3. oops no instakill traps\n4. [strike]bleeding crown prayer is too strong[/strike] wtf, just got the time stop prayer\n- So before i begin with this review : Yeah we all know Rust is a laggy piece of sh*t sometimes, so i won`t discuss this here.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n- Great concept.\n- Stunning graphics\n- Game mechanics are great\n- The combat system is good\n- The crafting system is very good\n- Weekly updates! Which is one of the most important things for an Early Access game!\n- Good and serious developers, who listen to the community\n- Modding is easy, and the community has almost full access to modding\n- Skins.\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n- Not optimised for extreme potato users, but that is not a main problem i.m.o\n- The community can be cancerous at times, but that is life! Not everyone you meet will be nice or help you!\n- Server creation is a little complicated, but if you are stubborn enough you will learn how to do it / manage it\n- You finally don't need a guide on how to purchase the game.\n\n- 21 different story missions that each take approximately 20 to 50 minutes to complete.\n- DLC sidestory contracts - different targets but same maps.\n- Escalation contracts on those same maps; think of this as a puzzle mode.\n- The new roguelike Freelancer mode that gives randomly generated targets in a randomly generated campaign.\n\nThis game now has such a vast wealth of content that it would take you months to complete it all. I genuinely recommend it.\n- First of all - Subnautica is a good game. Very atmospheric, very scary and overall a really overwhelming experience. At first. \nThis might be the only negative review in this month, but I think some of you might appreciate a different view than \"omg this game is just awesome\". Which it kinda is, but in some points it maybe isnt.\n\nThis first section of the review doesnt contain any major spoilers for the story, just a comment on the overall progress through the game stages.\nAt the time of writing this review, I played the game for ~ 35 hours, I have advanced quite a bit. The first few hours were fantastic, I was looking for new things to explore, the blueprints for all the stuff that I need and every new thing felt like I made a progress. But then at a certain point nothing new happend. It seemed to me like I had all resources I could ever need (even the blue crystals), I had all the vehicles you could build, all the upgrades I needed.\nAnd then there was no challenge anymore. You build your submarines, your bases and the game gets too easy, its not a challenge anymore. Don't continue reading after this point, if you havent played the game yet.\n\n[spoiler] The big strength of this game is the immersion in the seemingly endless underwater worlds. But at a certain point this immersion breaks (at least it did for me).\nNone of the monsters can really harm you, not even the biggest ones are a real threat. Just hop into you seamoth and out-speed everything. If there is a leviathan, just hug the walls or strave, they cant catch you. And if they do, just step out, repair your ship and continue. None of the threats is really dangerous. You really need to have bad luck to die. And if you do ... nothing happens. You just respawn.\nAt first the map seems endless, since you cant move fast. But once you get the seamoth, the map is very finite. Sure, there are deeper levels you cant access with the moth, but everything on the surface is within reach. Its the same with the deeper levels and the prawnsuit.\nSurvival is hard at first, since you constantly need to get water and food. Once you can plant you own food, you have unlimited supply and the survival aspect becomes just an annoyence.\n\nAnother thing that bothers me is the amount of resources you need to build stuff. In the later part of the game you need to build a giant structure. But the necessary resources are just like \"get 3 wooden planks, 2 nails and a hammer\". And with these resources you build the statue of liberty.\n\nMy last point is about the storyline. After something like 15 hours into the game there was a major stall for me - I had no clue where to go, to me it seemed like I searched everything I had access to at that time. I searched for 10 hours and found nothing. I went to the Islands twice to check if I missed anything, but no. I dont know, maybe I just had bad luck and something didnt trigger right, I missed a hint somewhere or something. It eventually went on, but on that point I already had the big submarine, the prawnsuit and everything. The story felt like I just need to run from A to B and back, there was no challenge anymore. \n [/spoiler]\n\nSo anyways. If you made it this far in the review, thanks for reading. If you disagree with me, thats totally fine for me. I don't want to ruin the game for anyone, maybe the points that bother me dont mean much to you.\nI know that my critique is pretty harsh. There are many positive aspects in this game. If you can really dive into this game and fully roleplay it, submerge in its story and ignore some flaws, this is a fantastic game.\nBut maybe some of you are like me, so some of my mentioned points could bother you too.\nThanks for reading, I hope I didnt butcher the English language too badly, feel free to comment, if you like.\n- With almost 300 hours of Destiny 2 (D2) back on Battle.net (the Blizzard launcher), let me give this perspective/advice for new players, specifically with regards for the F2P offering that is Destiny 2: New Light, with a few more holistic thoughts sprinkled throughout:\n\nThis overall game is very good. It doesn't always live up to its promise (the first mission of every campaign is always the most polished thing aside from the raids/dungeons), but when it does, it [b]really[/b] shines.\n\nThe gunplay is unrivaled. The visual/audio feedback is great, the handling feels really good, and enemies really pop when you take them out. Expect nothing less from the studio that brought us grunt birthday parties.\n\nThe game is better in a fireteam. Now that the base game is F2P [though with considerably less content than it used to be/I would like], this should be easier than ever for most activities. That said, a huge majority of my playtime was done solo. It can get tricky at times (\"Darkness Zones\" in certain missions prevent respawning but allow for revives, so solo players have a distinct disadvantage there). \n\nWith that said, dungeons (currently 'The Shattered Throne', 'Pit of Heresy', 'Prophecy' which is free to all players, 'Grasp of Avarice', 'Duality', and 'Spire of the Watcher') and raids (\"Last Wish\" from Forsaken, \"Garden of Salvation\" from Shadowkeep, \"The Deep Stone Crypt\" from Beyond Light, 'Vow of the Disciple' from Witch Queen, as well as 'Vault of Glass' and 'King's Fall' from D1 - both of which are both free to all players) are best experienced with a team, so don't shy away from LFG group-finder options like the Discord, official app, or any number of other sites (just make sure to accurately describe your experience, level, and gear. 'Tis only polite). \n\nOf the matchmade multiplayer offerings, I enjoy Gambit (PvPvE, reminds me of the Black Ops Zombies 4z4 mode done right), jump into the occasional Strike (PvE, matchmade fireteams running campaign-like missions), and have no interest in Crucible (PvP, it's fine I guess, but I've never liked PvP that's dependent in large part on personal progression - especially in the competitive modes like Trials of Osiris and Iron Banner)\n\nDon't be afraid to ignore content - this is absolutely the kind of game where you can set your own goals. Want a specific exotic gun? Look up where it drops and focus on grinding that content. Want a specific roll on a random roll gun? Find the best possible farming (or crafting) method and go to town. Chase down some of the exotic questions that the game clutters up your quest page with, or just goof around doing things that you find fun while absolutely ignoring all signposts.\n\nSome stuff just won't be explained in game. It's not as bad as Warframe (much less need for a wiki) but some things are still obscured. Feel free to look up Xur (exotic weapon vendor who visits on weekends) and other hidden exotics tied to specific activities, lost sectors, patrol locations, or quest chains.\n\nFor anything that you can't easily find online - reach out and find a sherpa. The community for this game tends to be pretty great, and enough of us have spent enough time leaning specific parts of it (e.g. raids) or just mechanics in general (\"What are random rolls? Which do I keep?\") that we'd be happy to jump onto discord (there are a bunch for PC, just check out the subreddit sidebar linked below) and answer any and all questions you may have. \n\nThe fact that a representative chunk of this game is free makes this the perfect time to dip your toes in without emptying out your wallet. Any other questions about this game as a product (\"Should I pay for DLC? Is Eververse worth it?\") should absolutely be researched elsewhere.\n\nIf you're looking for a place to start with the F2P content, finish the intro missions in the Cosmodrome. New and returning players are semi-regularly upgraded to a new light level floor, but means that you can miss out on the \"learning the ropes\" parts of the game that come with working your way through the New Light quest chain or unlocking different subclasses. [As of Beyond Light, all of the campaign content through Forsaken are not currently accessible. Release order was Red War (launch campaign) > Forsaken > Shadowkeep > Beyond Light > Witch Queen, followed by the upcoming expansions Lightfall > Final Shape.]\n\nEyes up, guardian.\n\nFootnotes for people yelling at me in the comments:\n-All of this is my opinion. Feel free to hold your own and disagree with mine.\n-I generally enjoy grinding, looter shooters, FPS's, and weird sci-fi space magic. Halo, Borderlands, Warframe, and CoD Zombies are some of my most-played and favorite games.\n-As far as I can tell, anything that is not strictly subjective in the above is factually correct [as of Season of Plunder, with updates noted throughout. This game changes quite a bit over time, so make sure to do your own research before spending money on it]. If I've missed something, feel free to point it out in the comments and I'll do my best to update this periodically. \n-This review previously made mention of both content vaulting and weapon sunsetting. These practices have both been discontinued as of Season of Plunder. However, it is not clear at this if or when power capped or vaulted may return/be uncapped, if ever.\n\n-----------------\nTL:DR: It's good. Not perfect, but really good. And since it's free, you can get a really good sense of if this game is for you without paying for any of it. You can play almost any activity solo pretty easily except for a handful of endgame activities. If you're overwhelmed at first, just play through the Cosmodrome missions while you get your feet under you, or ask a veteran player for help.\n-----------------\n\nSites to use (List was compiled at Shadowkeep launch, but most of it should still be relevant/useful)\n\n    \nBeginner's Guide (Current as of Beyond Light) - https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/49007\n\nThe DTG Subreddit - /r/DestinyTheGame on Reddit - https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/\n\nDestiny Item Manager (mange your inventory from your browser even while in-game, essential to avoid unneeded trips back to the tower) - app.destinyitemmanager.com\n\nDestiny 2 Checklist (Lists out everything to do as well as when it resets in-game) - www.d2checklist.com/\n\nLight gg (Database of in-game items, useful for looking up random rolls) - https://www.light.gg/\n\nBraytech org (Lots of overlapping features, but I really like their maps) - braytech.org/\n\nDatto (Destiny Youtuber / 24:02 Raider who posts lots of useful/educational content, including exotic guides) - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkmAjbIecTIjTQctolYeuDw\n\nIf you've played D2 on another system, check out the CrossSave page (https://www.bungie.net/7/en/crosssave) on the Bungie net official site respectively to get all of your content and progression moved over to Steam.\n\nStory Recap up through Shadowkeep (Spoilers Destiny 1 / D1, and D2, obviously) (My name is Byf on YouTube: The Complete Story of Destiny!

So you are telling me that I have to purchase this faction as well as US & OBERKOMANDO to play offline VS AI?? WTH is wrong with gaming companies nowadays?\n- Edit: ARCANE HALLOWS REVIEW (Written Feb. 19 2021)\n\nRoguelike Enthusiast's Caveat: The player's progression is directed in a much longer scale over multiple playthroughs due to the nonlinear nature of exploration unlike Hades or Skul. There is also a higher focus on evading stage hazards than said roguelites, with more control in how you start your run than needing to worry about coordinating a build throughout.\n\nNew Player's Verdict: The most recent large update for the game now makes the game well worth the price. Overall changes to the game makes the early-game far more approachable and increased the player's survivability all around while easing power progression.\n\nNew Resolve system for making powerups far less punishing is great. They added features to reroll power up selections as they add more, same with being able to rerolling character selection now that they added (two more very fun and powerful) new classes. The Skeleton Key, one such new randomized power up, addressed my issues with Fairy Chests which are a major source of character progression. \n\nEvery class offers such a unique playstyle while also having great power in their own right (though right now I feel the weakest classes are Ranger and Mage)\n\nNow if we could be able to rechallenge bosses we've beaten that would put me over the moon\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW (Written Feb. 4 2021)\n\nAbridged Verdict: Wait for Arcane Hallows Update (Feb. 18 2021) before purchasing for total content volume that matches RL1 along with additional QoL changes\n\nThe latest update as of writing this review (Far Shores) added 2 whole new areas, I bought EA awhile back but didn't really play much until this update, as the amount of content in the game effectively tripled between the areas, new classes, and QoL additions.\n\nGame is more accessible than RL1 for sure, but seems harder to get into than Hades, especially for people not used to roguelites. Namely, its far more punishing and harder to recover from mistakes.\n\nThings I love: The whimsical charm, the much more varied aesthetics of biomes as well as each biome having unique structures (Axis Mundi being a long hallway that makes it more akin to a Classicvania stage is genius). Classes having much more unique and pronounced playstyles adds much replayability. Boss mechanics and designs are much more complex this time around and the way they test your mastery of heirlooms is excellent. The new Armor System as a separate way to reinforce HP and the Mastery system to get steady stat increases go a long way to helping player progression. I'm seriously hooked on the gameplay loop in a way that I wasn't with RL1, every class is so much fun, and I'm so looking forward to the next update!\n\nMy Gripes: Runes are a total gamechanger that can make your life so much easier. Unfortunately the Fairy Chests that contain them are randomly spawned, and as a new player whether you can actually find and survive to one is a steep uphill road, and sometimes they just aren't possible without a specific class. The execution required for some challenges will be extremely difficult for more casual players and thus their ability to progress overall will be greatly hampered without the likes of things such as a soulsteal rune to recover HP. If there's an algorithm that sorts relative difficulty of Fairy Chest rooms, I would like if there were a way to increase the likelihood of creating Fairy Chest rooms if the player hasn't found any, and gradually make them more accessible until the player finds one. Additionally I would like if every Fairy Chest contained runes until you find them all in a biome, as I've gotten hordes of Gemstones from Fairy Chests before getting another rune or rune upgrade\n\nRelics. I'm looking forward to the Resolve system update because as of now, the hits to max HP are incredibly devastating, especially if you don't find a room that can give you the nectar to increase your max HP again (and even then its a huge gamble since you take a lot of damage from it). Most of them don't really feel worth the tradeoff as of right now, unless you find the War Drum to continually increase damage. If we can get a vendor to \"rent\" one (1) relic among a selection of ones we found for a certain amount of gold or something, similar to heirs that start with a relic without losing max HP would add a certain level of accessibility without removing the randomness aspect of roguelikes\n\nWhile all enemy attacks are technically possible to evade, this isn't always the case when you have certain combinations of enemies (Frostens and Aqua Braces in a room with a floor thats all spikes is so mean ; A;). Sometimes you'll spawn into a room next to a Warg that will immediately headbutt you before you can react and suddenly you take 70 damage. I would appreciate if certain enemies were stationary upon entering a room so you have time to process and react accordingly.\n\nEnemy damage scales extremely fast as you move through the map, along with their attacks becoming more frantic or complex, without means to restore HP and Armor through the specific runes, most classes' having lower max HP get real squishy.\n\nOne of the Duelist class's main attraction is that their talent gives them invulnerability windows with a roll, but it can't always be used of you're in a tight position without much room to move. I hope that they add a small invul window to the Dash heirloom, with runes to increase that window, but make it much smaller than the Duelist's (say 1/5th the time of whatever the window is of Duelist's talent)\n\nAnyways, despite my misgivings with the game I listed here, the game is really fun and a lot more accessible and varied than the original game, wait for it to go on sale and pick it up!\n- Events that took place:\n\nDid not want to sell player,\nGot an offer for said player,\nRejected the offer,\nPlayer demaned to be allowed to speak to the club,\nGot a second offer from said club,\nEssentially forced to accept the offer,\nPlayer reached an agreement with the club,\nWished player the \"best of luck\" in his future endeavours,\nPlayer is angry that he is leaving,\nPlayer considerers his new club a \"step down\" in his career,\nReminder: Player demanded to go to said club,\nMe finding solice in the fact that FM19 although lacking in the football department, delivers a brilliant experience in dealings with manic and psychotic people.\n\nAllow me to grant you an insight into SI's employee knowledge on the subject their games are about. I once engaged in a conversation with a developer at SI about FM, and football in general. After some talking about premier league, and me slightly confused, I eventually understood that this developer thought that Tottenham Hotspurs were located in Liverpool. So I posed him the following question: \"Then why do they call any matches between Tottenham and Arsenal the 'North London Derby'?\" to which he responded that he did not know, but he assured me that Tottenham F.C was located in Liverpool. I had to resort to showing him the borough of Tottenham in London for him to understand that Tottenham Hotspurs is not lovated in Liverpool, but in fact in London.\n\nThis will be the last edition of this game series I will ever purchase. In a football management simulator such as this, letting SI and their employees (including the one that responded to this review) tell you various aspects of football, is like having a pervert preach to you about the virtues of sexual absitence. They know nothing, and since the core game has not progressed the slightest in 10 years, it would be a fair assumption that they do not care neither.\n\nFuck SI, Fuck their beloved \"devs\" and fuck Charlton Heston while you're at it.\n- Probaly the best game ive ever told people to hold back on\n\nIts fun, its rude, it's the best Southpark Game ever made, but its only a 10 to 14 hour game. Its a satisfying 10 hours mind you, i dont think i have played a game in recent memory good enough to hold me the way this game has, the atmosphere and envoriment just puts you right in a long southpark episode, and youll love every minute of it.\n\nSadly, there are not enough minutes of it for $59.99, and thats why i sadly don't recomend this excelent game.\n\nAnd to clarify, its 10 hours if you just take your time enjoying the story, its plausible to 100% this game in under 20 hours, and thats if you are in no hurry, with no game guide.\n- If you're a STAR RAIDERS fan, look elsewhere, it's broken.\nFirst off, I  think they did a fantastic job on the Star Raiders port,\nthe controls are spot on, it works seamlessly with a controller,\nall the keyboard controls were mapped brilliantly, great job.\n\nBut....\n\nAlthough the NOVICE and PILOT missions work well, those who adorn the game will\nselect WARRIOR or COMMANDER and sadly, these higher levels are broken.\n\nOnce you get down to the remaining 8 enemies or so on the map, the difficulty ramps up to insanity.\nCome out of a warp, get plummeted by 3+ meteors in a row.\nPhotons gone.\nRinse and repeat until you just give up, it's relentless, and I've yet to be able to finish a game on COMMANDER\nlevel because of this.\n\nI've tried all the different speed modes, original, opengl and direct3d, nothing helps, it's broken.\n\nAnother minor gripe is that the \"Destroyed Engines\" mode is just the \"Damaged Engines\" and barely impacts\nyour speed.\n\nI really hope that this is patched, I'll gladly revise the review once it is.\n\nEverything else is great, the arcade ports are fine, the controls are practically 1:1 in the trackball games,\nthey all feel just like the arcade (unlike Atari Vault, cough cough).\n\nThe Jaguar games are a blast, T2K still rules. I would have loved to see AvP, perhaps a future DLC.\n\nBut the main reason I spent $40 was for Star Raiders, one of my all time favorite games, and in it's current\nstate, I feel like I've wasted my money, sadly I spent so much time troubleshooting it, my refund window is gone.\n\nI'd say wait for this on a heavy sale and if you're a die hard Star Raiders fan, don't do it until it's patched!\n\nAnd still no word from the developers on any patches.........you guys out there?!? \n\n- ULTRAKILL is a fine game with cool movement mechanics. However most of the guns don't feel beefy at all and, really, there's not much content to be had. Wait for ACT 3 before forking out $20 for this.\n\nedit: after getting every p rank, gaming\n- One of the few exceptions of \"dont buy games on Early Access\".\n\nThis game, on early access, has more gameplay value than a lot of games on full access + 5 dlcs.\n\n- unprofessional review:\n\nits a really deep lore kind of game, very cool!\nit has some horror and grinding elements which i always love\ni havent finished the game just yet tho \nthe visuals are very cute\nas soon as i bought it was hooked!\noke theres many more but im to lazy to type :joy:\n\nover all ill give it a 10/10\nvery interesting lore wise\n- Loved the original, and this updated version is just as good.\n\nThe additions along the way are very nice, and the improved graphics are noticeable. \nBeing able to converse with your partners whenever you want is also amazing.\n\nHowever...\n\nWas disappointed to have a few areas and puzzles removed. Since those were the more difficult parts of the original game, I assume this was done for a more streamlined experience. \nInstead of your flower wilting to represent your life, it is now replaced by more accurate \"points\". Although this makes it easier to tell exactly how many hits you can take, I miss the more original old design.\nAn iconic music track was also changed, likely due to licensing issues...\n \nCan't completely replace the original for me, but it's still a very worthwhile experience! \nStill wishing for a sequel a decade later.\n- If you want to cut your teeth on the Final Boss of box-pushing puzzle games, then have I got the game for you.\n\nRight out of the gate SSR offers a somewhat uneven mix of real head-scratchers and what I can only describe as pity puzzles, but quickly reveals itself to be the sort of puzzler that mandates particularly extensive sessions of staring at the seemingly inconsequential number of tiles onscreen and poking experimentally at them until something starts to click. This demands a little more patience than I ordinarily have, but I was starting to appreciate the design as I acclimatized to it.\n\nThen I arrived at The Great Tower level (in only the second subsection of the overworld), which all at once foists about 4 times more pieces on you than you've dealt with previously, while simultaneously introducing a Z-axis and the concept of using pieces as platforms mid-puzzle.\n\nSSR does have a well-executed and forgiving Undo function with basically unlimited storage which is a great thing to have up until the time spent rewinding would outweigh the time spent to simply restart the puzzle and do over; the only way it could be made practical on a level that large would be if you had a full-on timeline scrubber like in the rerelease of Duke Nukem 3D.\n\nThere's patience, there's logic, and then there's [b]this.[/b] I play puzzle games to try and [i]relieve[/i] stress, not the other way round. It's a solid design, and I'd probably recommend it to the REALLY die-hard logicians and puzzle fanatics. To the sort like me who enjoy puzzles but prefer there to be some sort of ceiling to their complexity, Gaben help you if you're going to try and soldier through this thing. I would even call Infinifactory a lot more accessible than this is.\n- 1. What is \"Pyre\"?\nThe game \"Pyre\" was made by Supergiant Games and was released on the 25th of July in 2017. After \"Bastion\" and \"Transistor\" this is their third game. \"Pyre\" is an indie-action-rpg, which story is mostly told in form of a novel. The gameplay is very different to the experience you probably made in \"Bastion/Transistor\", which lead a few people to put a negative review on steam. Now you will no longer play as one single character like before, but you are responsible for a group of exiles. The gameplay at it´s heart can be declared as 3 parts:\n \npart 1 contains travelling/exploring the world\n\npart 2 contains social interactivity with your group (talking/trading/decision-making)\n\npart 3 contains to take part in the rites, that means a fast-paced action ball game (3 vs 3) without        a planning phase (like in \"Transistor\")\n\n\n2. Technical details\n-the game runs fine on my windows 10 64 bit machine and it needs about 8.2 gb space of your hard drive. Unfortunately the game runs bad on old machines, because you need about 4 gb ram to run it without an error (my other 3 gb ddr2-system couldn´t run it, I received a ram-error-message when starting the game).\n\n-controls with mouse+keyboard or gamepad are good and well implemented.\n\n\n3. What does the game do right?\n-great rpg-novel-mixture as a whole unique and emotional experience\n-despite the linear progression (mentioned \"phases/parts\" above) the game stays interesting enough to continue\n-a colourful and fantastic world to explore (no open-world)\n-great character-design and a good variety of different creatures, which affects the gameplay during the rites\n-beautiful artstyle with a lot of detail and smooth animations \n-believable and fleshed-out storyline (NOT \"black and white\") with a personalised ending! \n-wonderful soundtrack (mostly ambient)\n-the creatures of the world speak their own language, subtitle is displayed in old-fashioned English\n-rites: the thrilling-faced-paced-action-game has a lot of depth to it (skill tree/character selection/items/area of the rite)\n-selectable difficulty level (rites can be optionally restartet), which can be changed during the game (+ \"titan-mode\": advanced challenges you can add separately like in \"Bastion/Transistor\")\n-meaningful and emotional decisions to be made (I´m looking at you mass effect), thankfully there are no dead-ends but different endings (personalised!)\n-\"Pyre\" is \"2-3 times\" longer compared to \"Bastion\"/\"Transistor\" without getting boring\n-good mouse+keyboard and gamepad support\n-\"versus-mode\": you can play against friends together on your pc or alone against CPU (with all the characters in the game!)\n\n\n4. What does the game do wrong?\n-the fast-paced-gameplay during the rites can be very fast and too stressful at times (I experienced some unfair situations here and there)\n-controls are sometimes not precise enough, especially when the gameplay is getting hot\n-hardware requirements (like \"Transistor\") with 4 gb ddr-ram are over the top regarding old rigs with dual-core cpu´s \n-some minor bugs during the rites (ball gets stuck, switching between characters over distance, bad camera angles over distance)\n-\"versus mode\" can only be played as local multiplayer\n-no bonus material for fans at all \n\n\n5. tl;dr\nPyre offers a fantastic but linear action-rpg-experience with a great story, which is told in form of a novel with a personalised ending. The gameplay is a mixture of exploration, social interactivity and a 3 vs 3 ball-sports-game. The level of creativity considering world-building, character design, music and the way the story is being told is on an insanely high level. If you liked \"Bastion\" and \"Transistor\" you need to know that you don´t play just as one character anymore. But what you can expect is a game with a heart, just like their games before. Pyre is in my opinion a masterpiece and the best Supergiant game so far.\n\n\n6. Final thoughts\nAs a child of the 80´s I played a lot of pc games. Sometimes I look back and remember how I bought game boxes from a company called \"Lucas Arts\". There were times I didn´t even inform myself about the upcoming games, I just bought them because I loved their games I purchased before. For me Supergiant reached that status in the present time. \n\n\n\nUntil the stars align!\nIf you liked this review be sure to hit the like button to help other players with helpful reviews. Thanks!\n- The British Forces give the Allies a bit of the German defensive capacities. It has the problem of adding too many buildings to a game that is, in its core, dynamic and based on movement and aggressiveness instead of turtling. The British units are diverse and interesting, bringing much to the table. \n\nThe DLC lacks a proper campaign for the Brits, unfortunately, even though Caen, Goodwood, Arnhem and Walcheren could have been done in some interesting missions. But, for a game focused on multiplayer, the Tommies are obligatory in everybody's library.\n- very fun there is lots to do \nit runs well\nglitches are very funny\nable to download community made maps and mutators from workshop\ncan unlock different mutators as you play\nyour a goat\nyou do goat things\nyou can do non goat thing such as being a shopping cart or a microwave\nyou can also be a goat\n**Spoiler**\n[spoiler] Im a goat [/spoiler]\n\n GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!\n- i helped a little girl who talks like a mafia gangster get prizes from a crane game, then went a seedy bar to help a large, gay anime loving gator exorcise ghosts from his phone, then went a practice date with alligator Goro Majima.\n\nUpdate: After League of Legends made my girlfriend hate video games, Later Alligator made her love them again.\n- #BringBackKI\n\n[list]\n    [*]Rollback netcode\n    [*]Large roster of 29 characters\n    [*]Unique characters\n    [*]Great tutorial\n    [*] Free form combo system\n    [*] Tons of single player content\n    [*] Fairly easy controls and execution for beginners\n    [*] Tons of mindgames and the possibility of breaking out of combos\n    [*] Best Fighting game resource ever [url=https://ki.infil.net/index.html]Complete Killer Instinct Guide[/url]\n[/list]\n- I bought this game in order to review it, seeing as there were no current reviews for it. \nI thought I'd help the game out by maybe giving it that tiny bit of publicity it needed to get off the ground.\nIn doing so I have failed. As this game isn't worth reviewing, there is nothing to review. Well, I should say there is stuff to review but I feel as though the dev's didn't even attempt to make this a game that anyone would enjoy. Well actually I'll let them off of the target of \"enjoy\", I'd go further to say it doesn't even feel like they tried to make a game that someone who had nothing to do and was bored out of their mind would say maybe I'll play this for a bit\nI jumped straight in, ignored the help in menu and started playing. It took me at least 4-5 mins before I even had the slightest concept of what was going on and what I had to achieve. Once I did get the hang of it I still thought \"I must be missing something, I'm not really doing anything\" so I ventured to the help menu to find that nope, thats it buddy.\nThe controls are lacking, the soundtrack and the sound effects (which happen to be a melody playing) do not blend at all, (they play completely out of time on top of the soundtrack).\nYou can buy it and prove me wrong, go ahead. This is just my opinion.\n- My wife left and took the kids\n- After the past few years of broken, buggy AAA games I've started to lose the passion I once had for the industry. This masterpiece came out of no where and completely reignited my love for gaming. PLEASE do not sleep on this game, it's such a breath of fresh air from the garbage you'd normally expect from modern day companies. Definitely taking a spot in my top 5 favorites and I haven't even scratched the surface of the game yet, it's just that good. Beautiful art style, crisp animations, a unique concept, FUN gameplay, its everything I've been wanting and more. Kudos to the devs for making this absolute banger <3\n- I've been playing this game since it was in Kickstarter! It is the best Story Rich game that I have ever played and the most unique. I have played through maybe 7 times and it's different every time. The ability to replay this game countless times is what makes it such a great game. Tons of questions that change based on the questions you've asked, you see a question that might not be there after you ask another question instead. Every version of this game that I played kept my interest and had me sitting on the edge of my seat waiting for more. I have reached 2 endings so far and I can't wait to see what happens next. The Developers are great, I can't wait to see what they create next.\n- I am over 50. \nI have played a lot of games.\nThe Return of the Obra Dinn is one of the best games I have ever played.\n\nIt is one of those rare cases (though certainly by design) where everything comes together.  Story, game play, graphics, challenge level, feeling of accomplishment on advancement. Simply an outstanding piece of work that I enjoyed every moment (even when frustrated) and will remember fondly.\n- So this game was very fun to play with my friend... that is until it began to stop working on starting the game i have looked at the ubisoft forums and guess what many other people have had this problem starting from the games release and ubisoft has done nothing to fix this problem. i got off easy i paid $20 for this game on sale the people who payed $60+ not so lucky so dont risk it and DONT by this ubishit game\n- i helped a little girl who talks like a mafia gangster get prizes from a crane game, then went a seedy bar to help a large, gay anime loving gator exorcise ghosts from his phone, then went a practice date with alligator Goro Majima.\n\nUpdate: After League of Legends made my girlfriend hate video games, Later Alligator made her love them again.\n- came for the cleaning mechanics and total lack of privacy, stayed for the secret lesbian love affairs\n- Plants, please: A horticultural document thriller.\nGlory to Undermere.\nPros: \n- the writing and its illusion of effortless brilliance\n- attention to detail and consequences for player actions\n- \"gotta catch 'em all\" mentality that actually makes you feel smart\n- the intrigue, world-building, and game flow\n- petting the cat\n\nCons: I wish there was more music, or just none at all most of the time.\n- I was a playtester on this game, and I can say with authority, love and joy and care all radiate out of the work that was put into making this game. It still has the same Psychonauts wackiness and great comedy, but it's also become more mature, more understanding, more willing to tackle dark topics head on and acknowledge that human beings are flawed, and need help, and make mistakes, and sometimes even do awful things. But Psychonauts 2 understands that human beings aren't defined by any of this, and that people can learn from their wrongs and can change for the better. And it tells all this through a delicious array of gorgeous, varied mental landscapes, through creative collectibles that reveal the memories, loves, and regrets of the colorful cast, and through a combat and platforming system that is much improved from its predecessor. I can't recommend this game enough. It's an emotional triumph.\n- What starts as a simple game of jumping over some spikes quickly becomes something so much more. Geometry dash is like Minecraft. No matter how many times you quit, you always come back to it (as you can see by my 700 hours of playtime). For $3.99 you get such an amazing and memorable experience. This game tests your patience and persistence. It tests your emotions. It encourages you to push yourself, overcoming challenges you once thought impossible.\n\n(SHORT ANSWER)\nGet this game.\n- Heartbound is a fantastic indie game with a lot of heart and fantastical mysteries.\nIf you enjoy beautiful 2D gaming experiences this is the game for you! \n\nPlay as a young boy on his journey to find his doggo, Baron. \nYou will explore various, unique worlds on this journey each with mysteries of their own...\n\nThe music I must draw particular attention to: It is wonderful to listen to. Honestly do yourself a favour and pick up this game- it is still in development but you will be glad to know that the updates are (thankfully) free!\n\nGive this game the love and attention it deserves!\n- 3 things:\n\n-Flatten land\n\n-Click citadel to get warriors\n\n-Click warriors at their warriors\n\nGood job, you've just mastered the entire game.\n\nThe game includes such crazy moments as:\n\n-Flattening land\n\n-Seeing the enemy flatten land\n\n-flattening your land faster\n\n-Clicking trees and rocks since your workers can't do shit\n\n-Clicking your warriors into their town\n\n-Watching your warriors fight their warriors\n\n-Accidentliy Alt+Tabing and having the game get stuck in windowed mode\n\n10/10 Would trust Peter Moloneux and be dissapointed again... apparently.\n\nProtip, send this to someone that loves you and watch them try to pretend that they enjoy it.\n- Saw a few youtube videos on this and decided to check it out.  Only played 30 min but here's my review from that. \n\nCustomization options are disappointing and boring. All of the character skins were white guys (and a possible vanilla Mexican). The option not to add other races at least to the Allied side is weird. As a gamer, when given the option for customization I expect to be able to create a character I at least somewhat feel represents me so I can get immersed (and don't even talk about 'historical accuracy'). They're also level locked for some reason. The uniforms are basic as they should be and you have a very limited weapon selection depending on the class you choose which is standard for these kinds of games. The character customization is very lacking and the only real reason I see it being there is to create DLC uniforms to buy. \n\nThe game itself seems like it's going in slow motion and maybe it's something people get used to after a while but I couldn't deal with it. The run is more like a speed walk and it feels like the soldier is considering being a conscientious objector with the amount of hesitation in aiming. Also everyone was kind just playing the game like Battlefield anyway.\n\nThis is probably a game that's more fun to play in a serious MilSim community.\n- Something I've been needing to get off my chest, despite how much maxis and EA go on about how much they care for the LGBTQ community, it's clear to me that they don't. First if they did they wouldn't be pushing the community the whey and as hard as they have. When things get pushed like they are, hateful people just harden there harts more, and just become infuriated. The sympathetic the become hatful towards it. The more something gets pushed, after awhile the more it gets hatted. A better approach would be, (if they really did care,) would be to put what they are talking about into a FREE pack, and get people whom make amazing custom content to contribute to it. If there is enough nice stuff in the pack people will download it, and talk people whom are on the fence to download it, and maybe to come over, and might start to get the people on the other side to at least get on the fence. That whey the LGBTQ community would get there representation, and acceptance would be pushed in a whey that won't burn people out.\n\n\nAnother resin why they should do it like this, and is part of why people are getting mad, is that they bought this game a certain whey, paid a lot for it and it's DLC, now they are changing, it and braking it to do so. Changing the experience against there will. Evan something you love like chocolate, or bacon, or anything will become something you hate if it's shoved down your throat ageist you will. If you want people to take it just offer it, most of the time people will take it. And if they don't just make it just make it more appealing. IE instead of braking the main game to add something even the LGBTQ community can't enjoy with a broken game. Make a free pack, and to tempt more people to get the pack, just add more nice CAS and build mode stuff. And maybe update the pack and add more stuff to it every once in awhile.\n\n\nI just had to say this for two resins, one companies being this careless or ignorant is just killing the public sentiment for LGBTQ and similar groups. And two, they are just killing interest in what they are selling, it will cut the Sims 4's life short, and will cut the Sims 5's life much, much sorter. \nIt's good to give options, as long as they are options. Or you are just like Hennery Ford, “The people can have the model T in any color! so long as it's black.”\n\n- I don't understand why everyone is saying to stay out of the house? I went inside, they were super nice loving and caring people. The dude that owns the place is a butcher and has all kinds of quality meat. We had BBQ and showed me around the wheat farm. And his grandma, she can't see or hear very well, but she's incredibly sweet. They're both looking after a baby that's ABSOLUTELY ADORABLE!\n\nI don't get what all the fuss is about, I enjoyed my visit.\n- Ok so... \n\nFar From Noise is a narrative game in which you play a woman stuck in its car, balancing on the edge of a cliff. \n\nIt's about life, death, nature, purpose, creativity, dreams, stars and badgers. \n\nThe thing about Far From Noise is that it'll ask you something very special, something that we all forget to do nowadays, something that I've forgotten. This game will ask you to take your time. Don't rush things. Sit down and relax as you'll be forced to follow the slow pace of the game, but you'll enjoy it, for sure.\n\nThis game is for you if you come home after a rough day at work. This game is for you if you're searching for a meaning, a purpose in your life. This game is for you if you just want to experiment something new.\n\nBecause Far From Noise is offering you something new. It gives a vibe that is between Firewatch and Life is Strange, but without all the forced action, stress, adrenaline those game wanted to give. Don't misunderstand me, I loved those 2 games, but Far From Noise chose a direction more... pure. It's just you and the nature that evolves around you.\n\nI've finished the game within 90 mins, but I heard they were several endings, so I might as well try to get some more (but the one I've got fully satisfied me, to be honest).\n\nBeing more pragmatic, the art and sound coincide perfectly. The visuals are gorgeous and the musics hit just right where it needs to. You'll be lifted by the compositions as you'll stare into the beautiful sunset, and the dark starry sky.\n\nYou may find it expensive, as the game costs 8$ for one hour and a half of experience, but hey, think about a cinema ticket. Far From Noise is cheaper and the experience you'll live in it is wayyyyy more unique than most of the movies you go see. \n\nI recommend it. Play it. It'll put your mind at ease.\n\n\n\nPS: the main character is one of the most well-written i've seen in video games.\n- Digital Eclipse’s Making of Karateka is a fantastic interactive documentary giving a Criterion Collection quality exploration of a game as well as persevering it to allow people to play it. The collection focuses on Jordan Mechner’s early years in game dev up until the release of Karateka and its ports. The collection is structured in chapters chronologically with each chapter being comprised of timelines that showcase a smorgasbord of information dealing with Mechner’s early works and Karateka. This information includes content such as concept art, magazine articles, interactive viewers that allow you to see how the animation process of Karateka was designed, and present day interviews with people like Mechner, some of the old Broderbund crew who worked on Karateka, and game devs inspired by the game such as Tom Hall and John Tobias. The way this all is structured is really engaging. The interviews dealing with Mechner’s early years are especially charming as he and his dad reminisce how the whole family inspired and worked to help Jordan make Karateka like how his dad dressed up in a karate gi and essentially did the motion capture for the Karateka MC and how he composed the whole soundtrack. Making of Karateka also does a splendid job preserving not only Karateka and two of its most popular ports, but it also has playable prototype builds. It also has previously unreleased games Mechner made before Karateka complete with earlier design builds as well, one of them being Death Bounce, an Asteroids inspired space shooter. There’s just so much clear love and care put in this collection’s creation and it’s truly splendid to see, especially because video game history and preservation isn’t considered as a serious undertaking compared to older artistic mediums such as literature and film. Video games, being the youngest of the mediums, was born in the age of mass corporatization where being a product that sells is considered to be far more important than being of piece of artistic media that should be celebrated. Films managed to emerge right before rampant commercialization happened so they were still able to be considered art that needed to be preserved, but games haven’t been as lucky and tend to just be considered expendable products, especially by major publishers. It’s just so heartening to see something like this exist. I do have one problem when it comes to this whole package though, I think Karateka is just a straight up bad game. \n\nKarateka may have been a technical marvel at the time, as the documentary materials extensively shows, but it has completely aged like milk and is just not a good game to actually play anymore, especially in the present when a vast plethora of games have surpassed it in all regards. It’s slow, clunky, and repetitive, combat is just mainly spamming kick and moving and back forth, the hitbox on the eagle is an absolute pain in the ass, and running is super awkward and can lead to enemies’ one-shotting you if you don’t get into combat stance fast enough. There’s no lives or continues so you just gotta slog through all those boring fights and unskippable cutscenes all over again. I’m admittedly not a big fan of 80’s games, but I can pick up games like Super Mario Bros., Tetris, or Galaga and have fun with them and respect their quality, plus they’re still quite accessible. Karateka is just miserable, to the point I’m surprised people even liked it at the time. Like it’s kinda sad to me the most fun I had with Jordan Mechner’s older games in this collection was his blatant ripoff of Asteroids he made in high school. Similar to my thoughts on Night Dive’s remaster of Rise of the Triad this year, I feel Digital Eclipse gave a gold star treatment polishing to a turd, an influential one, but a turd nonetheless. Digital Eclipse also did their own remasters of Karateka and Death Bounce, they’re more playable but they still don’t really salvage the games at all to me. The Karateka remaster does add the option of giving yourselves extra lives and it does play a little better but it adds the leopard that got the cut from the original game and that section is just awful. The Death Bounce remaster is okay, though I feel the Rover is just kind of bullshit, though arcade space shooters ain’t really my forte.\n\nOverall Making of Karateka is a wonderful documentary and preservation package for a game that has unfortunately not stood the test of time at all. Regardless if you have any interest in video game history I whole-heartedly recommend it. Definitely looking forward to Digital Eclipse possibly making this an entire series and cover games that were influential and actually good, like Doom or Monkey Island. Man, I want a Doom one so bad…\n- This game will seem frustrating for probably 99% of new players, but after putting the time in, it's proven itself to be the most exciting game I've ever played. The creativity you get to test is on levels way above any other competitive game and for this it feels like every game is unique, unlike in other games (that I have also put many hours into), in which it feels like games can get repetitive and sometimes boring. Don't get me wrong, the game has it's flaws, and it can sometimes feel like you've lost games due to unprecedented levels of luck for your opponents, but no game is perfect and often it's unnoticed when the luck swings your way. \n\nAfter going to #Landon and experiencing the atmosphere in a stadium with thousands of people, watching the greatest pro games I think many of us players will ever see, I think it's safe to say that my love for this game will never truly die.\n- oh good god how do i remove things from my library\n- Originally a Skyrim mod known for its story and interesting main driving mechanic is made 100 times better here by having its own fleshed out art style and textures, deeper story and characters\n- Please, bare with me here...I NEVER write reviews for anything (this is probably the third review I have ever written), but I feel like I need to write this one for so many reasons!!!  I grew up playing the Telltale/Lucas Arts Series: Monkey Island. After discovering and playing those, I figured out that I have an infinite amount of love for Point and Click adventure games. After finishing that series, I really only played the other games made by either Lucas Arts or Telltale (Mostly because I thought they were the only creators of Point and Click games...until about a year ago, when I discovered there's an entire genre/world of Point and Click).  Of course, I must also note: The Curse of Monkey Island will always be my fav, as it was the first Point and Click I ever played. Ok...NOW...with all of that being said, I recently discovered WADJET EYE GAMES and I am SO happy I did. I would recommend EVERY.SINGLE,GAME they sell. I have played all of their MAC/iOS compatible Point and Clicks, and I have yet to be (even slightly) disappointed. I had very high expectations going in as the Monkey Island games, Day of the Tentacle, Full Throttle, Grim Fandago, etc. are some of the best games in the history of Point and Click; however, all of the games I have played from Wadjet Eye have been amazing. They have actually been so amazing that I can 100% say Wadjet Eye is at the top of my list, right there with the Telltale/Lucas Arts games. I 100% recommend purchasing and playing every game made by Wadjet Eye to anyone who likes (even those who kinda sorta like) Point and Click games.\n- \"You've played for 1000 hours. Would you recommend this game to other players?\"\n- Bioshock Infinite is the third and (presumably) final game in the venerable Bioshock series of narrative driven FPS action games.  Gameplay, as always, consists of somewhat linear FPS combat with a \"genetic\" progression advancement system that lets you upgrade your abilities through \"splicing\" \"plasmids\".  This gives you somewhat supernatural abilities to augment the more traditional shooting of enemies with guns that we all enjoy from FPS games.  There's also the usual gamut of minigames, with a carnival theme to them. \n\nFrom the technical perspective, even though this is getting a little old, it's a AAA game and it shows.  Everything gamers expect is delivered here in terms of visual tweaks, control customisation, 4K support and a lot of graphics fine tuning options to allow gamers to experience a perfectly optimised experience.  There's not much else to say when developers get it right!  The visuals are equally top notch. \n\nWhile a great technical implementation is a must, and a minimum requirement for a recommendable game, of course Bioshock Infinite goes beyond that to deliver a masterpiece story that will leave gamers hooked, and perhaps a little bereft once it's over, but that's how all great stories should be.\n\nBioshock Infinite is a must-play for fans of narrative FPS games, although I do recommend trying Bioshock 1 & 2 first.  It's not required, but just like you wouldn't enjoy it as much if you watched Return of the Jedi first, you should try the first two episodes of Bioshock before the third one.\n- Buy if you want an average sandbox game. Don't buy for the mediocre story, boss battles or repetitive missions.\n\n\nMGO: I want to like it, but it has so many problems.\n\n-until recently had no push-to-talk\n-peer-to-peer connections meaning lag depending on the host, and being sent back to lobby if the host leaves. CQC also will lag where you will grapple back and forth.\n-no text chat\netc.\n- Update 09/10/16\nSo they have added 'last man standing' mode which is great. The only issue is now that the controls are too difficult. If they fix this issue it would be a really fun party game and worth porting to consoles.\n\nPros:\n-Good visuals\n-Fun power ups\n-Awesome 4 player local play\n-In general the game is very fun and I believe with a few tweaks the game would be great. If they had done an early access build it would probably have been a great game on full release but there are still a few things that I and the people I played with don't like.\n\nCons:\nNOW FIXED (THEY ADDED LAST MAN STANDING' MODE) -Scoring system *the scoring system is based on how many you kill, we all thought the game would be better if you had lives instead and had to stay alive, when we played this game it was a case of constant kamakaze and not caring because it doesn't matter if you die* REPEAT THIS HAS BEEN FIXED\n-Controls *this type of game obviously can't be played with keyboard and mouse so this is only reviewed using Xbox 360 controller and it still isn't perfect, none of us felt that  had full control of the vehicle*\n\nVerdict:\nFor now I will give it a thumbs up as if they allow you to select scoring system based on kills or based on deaths we would play this a lot. And I think they could easily improve the controls. I hope the devs don't just leave this game to rot as it is a great idea for a local co-op game\n- When I say this game changed the way I thought about life, I mean it. And before you say this game isn't worth 44 dollars, you are wrong. I would pay more than double just for this once in a lifetime experience.\n\nWhile this game may look like a stupid bishoujo romance game, it is so much more. Don't let the weird artstyle or obnoxious eyes fool you, this game will make you laugh. cry, depressed, happy, and everything in between. It is so extensive, so great, that there are over 13 character routes and stories to play in this game, all of which are good (some are incredible) and have some of the best, most fleshed our characters I have seen. This game is about life, change, friends, love, and most importantly, family. Every route in this game has a connection to family. (Clannad is a close-enough translation of family in Irish)\n\nIn case it helps, I'm a grown man who had a rather negative outlook on life, and this game me cry buckets. If you ever have thought about getting married and having kids, this game will MAKE you want to have a family. The clever writing and how the protagonist, Okazaki, changes throughout his life is all done so well. It made me realize how much we complain about our lives, but we don't need much to be happy or be motivated. In case it helps again, my mom loves this game, she connects with it quite a bit. Yet again, nothing bad to say here, only to say that Key is incredible and I will be reading some of their other works like Little Busters and Kanon.\n- Absolutely the second best (half-life Alyx is the best game) VR game I have played in the last 5+ years.  Both RM1 and RM2 are fantastic, superb graphics, excellent story and game play.  I took my time and explored and the game time ended up just over 13 hours.  But the big diff is this game was developed by a very small non-AAA team while Half life Alyx was created with a large AAA dev team with unlimited budget.  The quality/game play of recently released VR games has been exceptionally poor and very disappointing to say the least.  But NOT THIS GAME, RED MATTER 2 excels in every area and is simply a great game that will keep you playing.     \n\nI played using Vive Pro 1 wireless with vive wands and had no issues with controllers or my HMD.  I am saddened that the game play for me is over now that I beat the game......i really enjoyed playing this game and can only hope that Vertical Robot will soon release another similar game........or MAYBE RM3!\n\nGREAT WORK DEVS..........this game must be selected as game of the year!\n- +Long (&quality) story mode\n\n-Sometimes utterly lost so I have to backtrack or look at playthroughs\n-No skill tree\n-Loading screens\n-Some game breaking bugs so I had to cheat to pass it (e.g. pistons in tunnel) \n-Repetitive: turn this wheel, kill this bunch of enemies to open the lock,...\n-Enemies become bullet sponges on higher difficulty modes\n-No Xen chapters, so quite a cliffhanger...\n\nIn short: it is a decent game because of the good story, but people that recommend it are probably just on a nostalgia trip.\n- Honestly I've put over 400 hours into 20XX and this game is even better! Even though it's unfinished as of current it's still a fantastic time and truly stands out on it's own.\n- I'll lay it out. If you're really interested in the hacking mechanic, that might be sufficient reason to play this game. Otherwise, I'd be inclined to give it a miss.\n\nFrom a gameplay perspective, there's not really much to hook a new player. There's a long period at the start where you're expected to randomly interact with people, but given no reason why you should do so. The whole socializing and partying thing isn't intuitive unless you're a person who'd normally be into that, and there's little in the game that pushes you in that direction. As a result, progressing as far as the story actually starting is often the result of accident at best. It took me 4 hours of just wandering around, not knowing what I was supposed to be doing or why.\n\nOnce you're able to program there's a bit more direction and less frustration, but you're still not given much reason for doing it until later on.\n\nAll in all, stick around if you're really invested in getting to the programming. Otherwise, it's an exercise in frustration and shallow conversations that's not really a lot of fun.\n\nArt's gorgeous though, so the game has that going for it at least.\n- Zor strikes again, but agent phoenix is there to stop him! Another great VR puzzle game from Schell, with lot of jokes, hidden stuff and extra challenges for replayability. Took me 4h to finish base game, now time for achievements hunt!\n- The good:\n+ Great story with satisfying finale.\n+ Endearing main cast/characters.\n+ Great world building meets with 90s Indonesia culture.\n+ Pleasant pixel artstyle. The cutscenes visual is amazing, even though i notice few awkward animation.\n+ Nice soundtrack.\n+ Puzzle is mostly well balanced. Not too difficult and doesn't make you feel bored/annoyed either.\n\nThe bad: - \n\nThe ugly:\n* Some pacing problem. There are so many sidetrack a.k.a. \"To complete sub-task C you also must complete sub-sub-task X, Y and Z\" during chapter 2-4.\n* Sometimes you might have to going around in circles to solve certain task or accidentally skipped something.\n\nDespite few flaws, A Space for the Unbound is definitely best game developed by Mojiken Studio and best story-driven/adventure game among all games created by Indonesian developer. If you like side-scrolling/adventure game (such as GRIS, Unreal Life or Oneshot) or game made by Mojiken Studio/Toge production (such as Coffee Talk or When The Past Was Around), you should give this game a try.\n- I purposefully went into this game looking for bugs, seeing that it was in early access, and I have yet to find any. The only reason I stopped playing was because there was a fence that wasn't fully secured to the ground that I was able to get underneath, allowing me to get out of bounds. This lead to me falling into an area where I couldn't get out, and it wouldn't let me respawn at my most recent checkpoint. This would mean I'd have to start from the beginning, which I very much didn't want to do. Anyway, the biggest tips I can give to the developers is to make sure the map is 100% how they want it, and to make the audio design better. That's it. I may come back and change my review in the future.\n\nFINAL RATING: 4 / 10\n- Do you kinda like 4X games, but mostly the first 2-3 hours of the game where you're exploring and hacking a basic civilization out of the wilderness and desperately fending off natural threats while trying to keep people fed and productive? If so, this game is for you. Nice tight gameplay loop where things never get stagnant for too long; always novel threats and opportunities, and you're not tied to any one settlement for very long, so victory and defeat alike are more temporary. Not to mention a really astounding amount of fun, polished content for an early access game! Eremite, Hooded Horse, I salute you.\n- [h1] Indie Mario Maker [/h1]\n\nLevelhead is a 2D platformer that's heavily focused on building, sharing, and playing user levels. For those of us that don't own a Nintendo Switch, this game is a fine replacement for the Mario Maker games, and might even be better? \n\n\n[h1] CHARACTER [/h1]\n\nThe controls feel pretty tight and fluid. There are a ton of powerups that you can use, and each of them serves a different purpose. Compared to mario powerups, there's some unique ones here. One powerup lets you wall jump, but also lets you sneak by enemies. Another has a jetpack and propellers. Levelhead allows for some decent precision and very rarely did I feel it was my character's fault when I died. \n\n\n[h1] CAMPAIGN [/h1]\n\nThe first main goal when you boot up Levelhead is to go through the extensive campaign. It's sort of a tutorial, but at the same time is fleshed out and takes a pretty decent amount of time to beat and has some challenge to it. From what I have played of the campaign, levels are fun and well designed. Now, I have played very little of the campaign, it's not what I purchased this game for. I asked a friend for a 100% save file so I could skip the campaign and go right to creating levels. Why did I do this? because of Levelhead's biggest problem: the unlock system. To unlock things to create levels with, you have to beat the campaign and find secrets. So basically they gated off Levelhead's largest appeal, the level editor, behind a campaign that's several hours long and requires you to do some secret hunting. I understand they did this for tutorial reasons, but it still annoys me. \n\n\n[h1] LEVEL EDITOR [/h1]\n\nOnce you finally get your hands on the level editor, you'll quickly notice how accessible and easy to use it is. The UI has nice big and understandable buttons. Almost everything is as simple as pressing left click on what you want and where. Even more complicated things such as a timer or a switch connected to a door are made very simple and understandable. It has to be the best level editor I've ever used, purely for the simplicity of it. \n\n\n[h1] SECOND GOAL [/h1]\n\nThe second primary goal of Levelhead is to create levels and have them become apart of The Tower. The tower is where all the good levels go, and you can sort levels there by difficulty, release date, tags, etc. First you have to get through the Marketing Depertment. To do this, you need Exposure Bux, which is a currency you earn while playing marketing department levels. It's a neat system that works pretty well and encourages you to play other people's levels. \n\n\n[h1] MINOR ISSUES [/h1]\n\nI wish you could name levels without using preset words. I understand why they did this (their target audience is young), but at times I have a genius level name and am unable to use it. Another issue is more of a community-based issue. A lot of the levels in the marketing department are garbage (including my own levels probably). It's kind of rough to sift through the mess to find great works. I also wish you could filter levels in the marketing department the same way you can in the tower. The Rumpus system for friending others is frustrating and borderline useless. People can't search others by name, but rather by a randomly generated code. All of these issues are pretty minor and don't effect the game enough to bother me too much.\n\n\n[h1] CONCLUSION [/h1]\n\nLevelhead is absolutely worth owning, especially for those without a Switch. It's polished in nearly every way, and is just very fun to play. The price point is pretty high though, so possibly wait for a sale unless you think you desperately need to play this. Fully recommended!\n\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/34946548/] Check out my curator! [/url]\n- Yes and No.\n\nSo many mixed feelings about this game. It does a lot of unexpected things and gamifies some deep and haunting concepts within the human psyche( the game centers around a POWERFUL subject, very hard to discuss without spoiling the game), sports combat that's tough but honestly very satisfying at times through the use of unorthodox party members and antagonists, but the rpg economy, pacing, and sheer grinding within tends to rob a lot of scenes of their emotional impact. I had a lot of fun with Jimmy, but honestly speaking I don't know if I could recommend this game to anyone who isn't used to a big jrpg-length commitment.\n\nIt's not so much that I hated the grinding, but it's that you're presented with symbolically themed enemies (not crazy about a lot of the in-battle art, some of it is phenomenal but a lot of it feels half baked which is something Kasey O has discussed in interviews but this is besides the point) Enemies an make you think and elicit actual emotions...\n\n...but then you have to stare at them for hours as you grind to be able to even last a few turns against each new boss. I found myself resorting to [spoiler]Clean Getaway[/spoiler] a lot throughout the game just to get to the other side of a room in a manageable timeframe. The symbolism loses its impact very quickly, and the momentum of the story is constantly slamming on the brakes to make you grind, and to me, it just dulls the sharp edges off of a lot of otherwise deeply impactful moments. It robs itself.\n\nIt'll present you with something powerful, but then it'll do that 30 more times before the end of a dungeon and it can become a bit tiring, like someone telling you the same knock-knock joke over and over.\n\n[spoiler]Shinryu[/spoiler] and certain aspects of [spoiler]The Pulsating Central Hub[/spoiler] are definitely some of the more outstanding examples.\n\nalso [spoiler]Heart Prison[/spoiler] is a ridiculous ask of a player. You finish the game and can wipe out any leftover superbosses at around Lv.60, and the [spoiler]family battle[/spoiler] requires Lv.90+. I'm not going to sit down and literally grind for 30 levels for the only battle left that I could watch on YouTube in 3 minutes.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I really loved this game, it brought me to tears at points. SO much work was clearly put into this and I'm scouring the rest of Kasey's work right now to get more of this excellent writing, I but I feel like Jimmy just barely misses the mark when viewed as a whole package. Any RPGmaker/Earthboundlike fans are sure to enjoy, and I can't stop thinking about the story, but as a gaming experience, I'd hesitate a little to recommend it.\n- ---{ Graphics }---\n☐ You forget what reality is\n☐ Beautiful\n☐ Good\n☐ Decent\n☐ Bad\n☑ Don‘t look too long at it\n☐ MS-DOS\n\n---{ Gameplay }---\n☐ Very good\n☐ Good\n☐ It's just gameplay\n☑ Mehh\n☐ Watch paint dry instead\n☐ Just don't\n\n---{ Audio }---\n☑ Eargasm\n☐ Very good\n☐ Good\n☐ Not too bad\n☐ Bad\n☐ I'm now deaf\n\n---{ Audience }---\n☑ Kids\n☑ Teens\n☑ Adults\n☑ Grandma\n\n---{ PC Requirements }---\n☑ Check if you can run paint\n☐ Potato\n☐ Decent\n☐ Fast\n☐ Rich boi\n☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{ Difficulty }---\n☐ Just press 'W'\n☐ Easy\n☐ Easy to learn / Hard to master\n☐ Significant brain usage\n☑ Difficult\n☐ Dark Souls\n\n---{ Grind }---\n☐ Nothing to grind\n☑ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n☐ Isn't necessary to progress\n☐ Average grind level\n☐ Too much grind\n☐ You'll need a second life for grinding\n\n---{ Story }---\n☑ No Story\n☐ Some lore\n☐ Average\n☐ Good\n☐ Lovely\n☐ It'll replace your life\n\n---{ Game Time }---\n☑ Long enough for a cup of coffee\n☐ Short\n☐ Average\n☐ Long\n☐ To infinity and beyond\n\n---{ Price }---\n☐ It's free!\n☐ Worth the price\n☐ If it's on sale\n☐ If u have some spare money left\n☐ Not recommended\n☑ You could also just burn your money\n\n---{ Bugs }---\n☐ Never heard of\n☐ Minor bugs\n☐ Can get annoying\n☐ ARK: Survival Evolved\n☑ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n---{ ? / 10 }---\n☐ 1\n☑ 2\n☐ 3\n☐ 4\n☐ 5\n☐ 6\n☐ 7\n☐ 8\n☐ 9\n☐ 10\n\n\n\n\n- Alpha, Beta, Finished Product... I hear lots of Blah blah blahs complaining about this game not being out of Alpha after years and years, but it isn't like we've been paying a monthly fee for it.  I paid one time to support this game and I've got years of play out of a product that I enjoy.  There aren't too many games that scratch an itch like this game for me... Open World, completely editable/buildable environment and zombies!  One of my biggest issues with a game that I like is that after I buy it, they release a few DLCs and then move on to their next product.  Alpha, Beta, Finished or Not... the developers have given me years of standing by their product and many updates with new content and mechanics.  For that alone, I love their game!\n\nGraphics: 3 outta 5 graphics, she looks a little dated but they keep updating it... It looks better than it originally did.  There's growth\nReplayability: 5 outta 5\nGameplay:3 outta 5... sometimes she's a little clunky\n\nI definitely still believe that this game is worth buying and that they devs and their product is worth supporting.  Hopefully this is helpful to someone.\n- Fun JRPG with some action commands thrown in, good variety of enemies, and a pretty decent skill development tree.\n\nEnemies can feel pretty tough later in the game, but its more of a puzzle when trying to complete these fights so it doesn't feel cheap.\n\nGreat soundtrack too.\n\nRuns great on Steamdeck\n- ironic that the best sonic game was the one not made by sonic team\n- i would recomend it because the physics are great, the game has 8 or 9 level packs (i dont know if there will be a 9th because there are 7 at the time of this review) the units are diverse, there are a lot of secret units to find and i dont know for the final boss because the most expensive unit artimis isnt a good final boss like the dark pesant in the alphas but i hope that the games final boss unit is actually hard to kill and requires more than 7 archers because that wasnt hard or anything hopefully they will make the most expensive unit actually overpowered and unballanced because that would be a great final boss, the sandbox mode is great i like the custom campains , the custom units arent out yet so i cant say anything about that over all this game is worth the money and if its near a sale time like a few days away from a sale then get it on sale if not then just get it you wont regret it and if it lage turn off all the graphics settings\n- Would be nice to get a definitive upgrade rather than paying full price for dragon quest xi definitive version\n- This game will seem frustrating for probably 99% of new players, but after putting the time in, it's proven itself to be the most exciting game I've ever played. The creativity you get to test is on levels way above any other competitive game and for this it feels like every game is unique, unlike in other games (that I have also put many hours into), in which it feels like games can get repetitive and sometimes boring. Don't get me wrong, the game has it's flaws, and it can sometimes feel like you've lost games due to unprecedented levels of luck for your opponents, but no game is perfect and often it's unnoticed when the luck swings your way. \n\nAfter going to #Landon and experiencing the atmosphere in a stadium with thousands of people, watching the greatest pro games I think many of us players will ever see, I think it's safe to say that my love for this game will never truly die.\n- I had seen this in the steam store and wanted it. I put it on my wish list and a friend got it for me. I have to say from start until now it's amazing and keeps me busy. I do take breaks from it from time to time. However the game keeps growing and always something neat to come back to. I was amazed to that right off the bat the game was made well, and wasn't like 20 patches later and it was good to go. It was a few little hot-fixes but it was already good from start in. I am super glad that I got this game from my friend. \n\nupside\n- Was well made from the start \n- developers are still working with the game and adding in new content when they can\n- Game you can play for hours if you are willing \n- Good strategy game \n\nsmall down sides \n-Not a city builder to me , so like not like sim city etc... more like a strategy game that involves having a small town ^^\n- Does take a bit to learn all the little mechanics but once you do , you are good to go \n-Still early access so from time to time you lose saves as they add content\n- Where to start.... in short entire game is boring and very slow paced for no aparent reason.\n\nAI: AI performs only very basic functions and does not upgrade buildings and does the opposite of whats beneficial for your empire. AI does not do very well when engaging in displomacy.\n\nUI: You will spend most of your time trying to manage/hover around very CLUMSY and absolutely disgusting UI. Other 4x games offer far superior UI and make is easier to manage your asset on the field e.g. Sword of the stars II, Star Ruler 2, Distant world, Endless Legends, Endless Space etc.\n\nGFX: Graphics are not the top notch what you would expect from a modern 4x game but they are on far with Endless Legends. GFX leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nAlien Races: I dont need to say much but like Planets most of the races are COPY / PASTE. Nothing unique or special about each. \n\nMP: Multiplayer has a mind of its own and in most cases wont let you join public games unless its a private game.\n\nStellaris bring nothing new to 4x Genre in 2016!.\n Right now everyone is almost beta testing for the developers so we can find bugs, report them  and help them fix their game. Why not let players do beta before before release? But then there is  a question of sale and refund. \n\nBut overall this game does offer amazing soundtrack.\n- Horrible game couldn't learn how to drift in 13 hours i was using a wheel btw apparently its harder but like wheel is cool I'm not gonna play it on controller that's lame. My dad also couldn't drift either and he knows how to drift irl. I also cant get a refund because i spent so long try to drift :(\n- Know your History: \n\nMany of you will already know this, but this game has ties much deeper than you think. It's no secret that Bethesda's Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim had extended it's life through an extensive modding community. For decades, literally, ENBs, shaders, textures, companions, and even story-lines added THOUSANDS of hours to an already sizable game. One story-line mod was called \"The Forgotten City\".  Over the next few years since it's release, the mod had acquired awards such as the 2016 Australian Writers' Guild Award, Zero Period Top 5 Quest Mods of 2015, and others. It was an astounding mod that threw the dragon born into a deeply profound, well written, and engaging story. It was a staple for my personal mod list for years. I've played the Skyrim version countless times, but as soon as I saw this release I immediately bought this and booted it up. \nObviously this is nothing like the mod, both visually or engine wise, but the spirit of the game is still there. It's more defined, expanded, and developed. It deserves every award and accolade it's received. When I walked into the opening scene and fell down the tunnel I couldn't help but shake my head and smile as a wave of nostalgia mixed with new expectations flooded my mind:\n\n\"My god, they've done it.\" \n\nHere's to you, Modern Storyteller, all the best and more to come!\n- I have played enough of this game to say that I really, really love it.\n\nI have played every Assassin's Creed game, even the ones on the DS and the mediocre PSP game. This is by far the best Assassin's Creed.\n\nFirst of all, the naval combat is intuitive and really fluid and satisfying. The combat is the same \"Press B to counter\", but the addition of guns and darts do make things more interesting.\n\nWhile most of the time you are at sea \"pirating\", the sections on land are also really good. While the tailing and eavesdropping sessions are frustrating at times and boring at others, the free running is more fluid than ever, with realistic animations and few obstacles that can stop you.\n\nThe story is interesting and does encourage you to play all the main missions. However, there is a huge variety of side missions that can be played as soon as you get your ship to sail the enormous maps, where many ships sail and where whales swim.\n\nI have not played a lot of the multiplayer because I don't find it that interesting and varied.\n\nOverall, this is the best AC game so far: improved gameplay, lenghty and fun, it only makes me more pumped for Assassin's Creed Unity.\n\nSCORE: 90/100\n- Dave the Diver is a charming little 'Indie'* that still surprises you with new mechanics even hours in. The various activity cutscenes are pretty funny as well.\n\nJust a word of warning though. Mintrocket is NOT a indie studio, it's a subsidiary of NEXON, so DtD is entirely a NEXON game, and with how their reputation is it's pretty understandable to not buy this game just because of that.\n- EDIT: they made putting easier!  I can finally shoot even and below on the first few courses.  Ignore my complaints about impossible putting below.  I'm back playing this again and enjoying it much more since the putting changes.\n\nI have a love/hate relationship with this game.  It's the closest thing to an enjoyable disc golf game on the PC that I've ever seen, and on that basis I recommend it.  Unlike most sports games, where I can play better on the computer than I can in real life, in this game that's not the case.  After six miserable hours of failure in this game I can safely promise you that I'm wildly better at real life disc golf than I ever will be with this game.\n\nPositives:\n\n- Discs mostly work the way they should (assuming you understand from IRL play how a particular disc should  behave depending on speed and throwing angle) though I feel like flight paths when you're throwing up or down in elevation are off sometimes, but if you throw a fast understable disc at too low a speed it will tail off into the left immediately and when you want to crank up and hyzer bomb the same disc at high speed it gives you the long S you expect and so forth\n- No bugs really (a couple of times the character model went wonky when a disc landed on/next to a rock wall)\n- Graphics are fine by me\n\nCons (possibly only for me, you may not suck at this):\n\n- The entire game is based on a \"stop the tick mark on a spot as it circles a ring\" type swing meter, and I'm absolute trash at it\n- Feels like no progress, other than buying discs--I've upgraded the three skill meters a lot and it has never felt like game play changed much (lol, it certainly hasn't gotten any easier!)\n- Putting is im-fucking-possible, at least for me, it's way too hard--putts that would be gimmes for a novice in real life are a crapshoot, especially if there's any elevation difference\n- After six hours I have only unlocked the first course and half of the second course . . . I may try to go back to this at some point, but for now I've given up on this sucker which is a shame--there are a bunch of other courses that I will never see (my fault, to be sure--I'm terrible at that stupid swing meter)\n\nI haven't played any better options, so while I'm probably giving up at six hours in I'd still recommend it to anyone who's into disc golf.  It's clearly too hard for me, but assuming you're not a complete klutz you will probably have better luck with it.\n- There is no skill requirement to play this game; everything seems pretty randomized including when and where the demon attacks you. Its rather difficult to play alone or just with two players. So if your looking for a game to play alone for a fright or just with one other buddy of yours. Make sure your ready to lose, This game has a great concept I just hope it will get more refined with the attacks. It seems like you get killed before you can even attempt to complete the objective.\n- Ni no kuni II: Revenant Kingdom is a great RPG that, while a little dissapointing in some aspects, makes up for it with it's positives.\n\nLet's start talking about the negatives: \n\n- the characters are a little bland, most of them barely get anything added to their backstories nor are there any specific sidequests for them (yet). They're not bad, and Evan/Roland are good characters, but the rest falls a bit short.\n\n- The soundtrack is a little forgetable, even if it does have a few good gems in there\n\nNow the \"neutral\" points:\n\n- The main gameplay is simple, with only a few attack buttons and barely any combos, so if you're looking for a deep combat you're going to be a little dissapointed.\n\n- The story is simple; i personally enjoy it and how it ends but i could see someone who's looking for some deep story to be left unsatisfied.\n\nNow for the good aspects:\n\n- The graphics are beautiful, it's basically a playable Ghibli Studio movie\n- The gameplay (both combat and army based) is fun, fast and rewarding to do, especially when you unlock more spells\n- The kingdom management is simple to do and it gives you a sense of pride and accomplishment (unlike EA) when you expand it with new building and bigger borders\n- The sidequests are for the most time fun with cool citizens to meet and recruit\n- The random dungeons are cool to explore\n\nI played 85 hours of this game and i enjoyed every second. If you're a fan of Action RPG with a touch of base management and \"tactical\" combat you're certainly enjoy this beauty of a game.\n- I hated Undertale.\n\nIt was, pretty clearly, a game about sexy skeletons. I did not care about sexy skeletons. I refused to play a game about sexy skeletons.\n\nThen my friend made me listen to the soundtrack, and I decided I could deal with a few hours of sexy skeletons if I got to listen to the best video game music I had ever heard while doing it. \n\nI played Undertale. It's not a game about sexy skeletons. It's a game about choices, maybe, or morality, or curiosity. It's a game about pushing the limits. It's a game about experiences, about \"what would happen if I did this?\", about storytelling so intricate and complex and raw that it shouldn't be able to fit into seven hours of bullet hell and pixel graphics. But, somehow, it does. Every choice you make has an impact. Every object you check has a story. The soundtrack, the witty yet profound writing, the simple pixel graphics, and even the menu screens and bullet patterns themselves all intertwine in order to tell a story that only you decide the ending of.\n\nAlso, the skeletons aren't even sexy.\n\nMy advice to you: Go in as blind as you can. Don't read walkthroughs. Don't watch playthroughs. Don't prepare yourself. Don't even look at overviews. Hell, don't even read the Steam page description. Just buy the game (and give some well-earned money to a little white dog), and, as it were, climb the mountain yourself. Don't let anyone backseat. Don't listen to people who tell you there's a right way to play.\n\nAnd when you think you've reached the end, just think--what other choices could you have made?\n\nSo, yes. I hated Undertale.\n\nAnd then I played it.\n- You can return to character customization whenever you want. Game of the year.\n- 1. Mea Culpa > Ruego Al Alba\n2. combat feels much better\n3. oops no instakill traps\n4. [strike]bleeding crown prayer is too strong[/strike] wtf, just got the time stop prayer\n- I have played OSU!, Muse Dash and stepmania plenty and I gotta say that this does not feel like a rhythm game at all. The premise of matching the shape of the map to music sounds interesting but some of the songs I feel like are not mapped out correctly. Or in general this game relies less on music cues and more on visual cues? It felt like maps are only 50% related to the song and you have to ignore what you hear because the map randomly demands patterns that have no matching audio equivalent and everything becomes pure visual memorization.\n- I have made a Deviless cry.\nI have fled from, fought, and died to a Mountain of Black Glass.\nI have sold souls, the honey of dreams, and forbidden books.\nI have explored the Dead Letter Office and will/am/have visited the Dream Serpent in the Pillars.\nI have sank pirates, betrayed anarchists, and been humiliated by a child.\nI have broken mirrors, freed tigers, and opened a gate to the stars.\nI have acquired strange hungers, seen too much of the dawn, and bargained with the King of the Drowned.\nI have fought rats with machine guns, feed pirates to colours, and traded coffins for the future. \nI have died bravely, died fleeing for my life, died of hunger, and found boredom in safety.\n\nI will sail the Sunless Sea. I have sailed the Sunless Sea. I will always sail the Sunless Sea...\n\n(Sunless Sea is an evocative, atmospheric, story-driven game. If you go in expecting to \"win\" you'll be sorely disappointed. If you dive in, start making bad decisions, dying, and trying over again, there's so much to this game and so many ways that it can proceed, at a pace you set, that it will keep you busy for weeks.)\n- ---{ Graphics }---\n☐ You forget what reality is\n☐ Beautiful\n☐ Good\n☐ Decent\n☐ Bad\n☑ Don‘t look too long at it\n☐ MS-DOS\n\n---{ Gameplay }---\n☐ Very good\n☐ Good\n☐ It's just gameplay\n☑ Mehh\n☐ Watch paint dry instead\n☐ Just don't\n\n---{ Audio }---\n☑ Eargasm\n☐ Very good\n☐ Good\n☐ Not too bad\n☐ Bad\n☐ I'm now deaf\n\n---{ Audience }---\n☑ Kids\n☑ Teens\n☑ Adults\n☑ Grandma\n\n---{ PC Requirements }---\n☑ Check if you can run paint\n☐ Potato\n☐ Decent\n☐ Fast\n☐ Rich boi\n☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{ Difficulty }---\n☐ Just press 'W'\n☐ Easy\n☐ Easy to learn / Hard to master\n☐ Significant brain usage\n☑ Difficult\n☐ Dark Souls\n\n---{ Grind }---\n☐ Nothing to grind\n☑ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n☐ Isn't necessary to progress\n☐ Average grind level\n☐ Too much grind\n☐ You'll need a second life for grinding\n\n---{ Story }---\n☑ No Story\n☐ Some lore\n☐ Average\n☐ Good\n☐ Lovely\n☐ It'll replace your life\n\n---{ Game Time }---\n☑ Long enough for a cup of coffee\n☐ Short\n☐ Average\n☐ Long\n☐ To infinity and beyond\n\n---{ Price }---\n☐ It's free!\n☐ Worth the price\n☐ If it's on sale\n☐ If u have some spare money left\n☐ Not recommended\n☑ You could also just burn your money\n\n---{ Bugs }---\n☐ Never heard of\n☐ Minor bugs\n☐ Can get annoying\n☐ ARK: Survival Evolved\n☑ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n---{ ? / 10 }---\n☐ 1\n☑ 2\n☐ 3\n☐ 4\n☐ 5\n☐ 6\n☐ 7\n☐ 8\n☐ 9\n☐ 10\n\n\n\n\n- Game does not become better with release.\nDups AI still retarded, they literally wasting time instead of doing work.\n\nJust a quick example:\nDup can go to the left side of map dig !!ONE!! block, then go to right side of the map and harvest !!ONE!! plant, then go back to the left side of map and dig second block. It's unbelivable boring watching all these.\n\nAnd you still can't destroy ruins, OMG. You can lunch rocket but can't destroy some ruins.\n- Just finished it. Having trouble putting words together.\n\nI went on a road trip around the US last year, and on my way down the west coast was surprised by how many giant factories passed by, puffing smoke into the air. One even had Google reviews, where it became clear that the town residents who worked there posted good reviews, and everyone else wanted the factory gone.\n\nThose did not compare to the oil refineries in Louisiana, one of which I had to pull off of the highway to properly behold. Certainly I'd seen images of them, but in real life their scale is hard to believe. And they're so bright, both because of innumerable light bulbs and the infamous refinery flame spouts. Even going through the pictures I took while worried the refinery security was going to attack, the size of these things accurately portrayed in none of them. I'd already played the NORCO demo by this point, and had it in my mind throughout my time in the area. There was even an encounter with an old man working at a convenience store somewhere around 1-2am who asked me if I believed in God with a crazed look in his eye, something I would not know was reality foreshadowing this game until the past week.\n\nSo my impression here, forming as I type this, is as follows: \n\nThe surreal imagery and sublime writing in NORCO combine to seem more accurate to my brief experience in the places resembling the real life Norco than any photo or video I've seen.\n\nA lot more can be said about this game, but I'm currently trying to untie my thoughts. So maybe later. For now, just know that I'd thoroughly recommend this game.\n- The Award for the worst Cancer Game 2017 goes to: Friday the 13th! \nCongrats! *clapping Hands with bloody Babytears in my eyes*\nThis Game is a complete waste of Money. Don't buy it - don't even think of buying this crappy Master Piece.\nIt's not worth it, to be honest.\nI played it for almost 200 Hours. And it's awful. Never saw a Game with these bugs, with these massive salty Community. There exactly 0 Bugfixes, so many exploits, the horrible earbleeding intro, the Community that is pure Cancer, the horrible Graphic that looks like it's straight out of the Kindergarten and the huge amount of Bugs. Bugs are normal, but MAN there are Bugs everywhere! I mean, yeah the Hype was real, but now i wish i could refund this crap.\nNever had to dream about uninstalling a game before.\nI mean, the Devs. are just Human like you and me - but honestly - never saw someone who failed his job like this.\nJust do me a favor, don't buy it. It's not worth the Ragequits, the broken Keyboards, the Heartattacks and it's definitely not the Money worth!\nNever want to touch it again.\n\nAnd btw. thank you for killing the Sealmothers and making the babyseals crying bloody sad little Tears. </3\n- First, there was Guitar Hero. Now you've got Guitar Nero. \n\nIt's wild that this came out of nowhere, because this is easily one of the best games I've ever played. This is what I've been waiting for rhythm games to be like since Space Channel 5 on Dreamcast.\n- load in get attacked by a man named pizza team up with a guy named dylan to kill pizza, pizza runs a way loot all the bags from dead ppl on the ground go with dylan up north meet one more to add to the group find dylans friend adds him to the group keep goingf north meet 3 more on the way and add to the group get to a town in the north take it over kill every in site find a cowboy hat and a backpack start a gang called the motorcycle cowboy cap gang get into a fight with 3 other players get shot in the back of head by an arrow say my fairwells to my gang and than respawn\n\n9000/10\nWould do it again in a heartbeat\n- SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT.\n\nAs the store page states, NOREN is supposedly a 'simple' keyfinding game. That would be true if there were any keys actually in the game, but as it stands it seems that NOREN is a simple abandoned shovelware game that's impossible to progress in, let alone beat. You play as some soldier in a massive, dark castle, equipped only with a dying lantern. The light fades quickly, and you can regain light slowly by... standing by a light source. That'd be simple enough if you weren't endlessly pursued by dinosaurs that are programmed with AI which knows your exact location at all times; three chomps and you're 'aparted' from the world, where you respawn with whatever amount of light and sanity you have left. Additionally, the translation attempt is abysmal at best. \n\nBoth NOREN and its developer, ThroneLab, should be banned from Steam. I do not blow the 'scam' whistle lightly, and I only do such when I am 100% certain of something actually being a scam. There are a handful of videos of this title on YouTube as well, with only one being over 5 minutes long. No one found a key. If evidence can be presented to me that there is in fact a way to progress in this game, I will rewrite this review. Until then, beware and stay vigilant.\n\n[h1]Rating: [b]0.0/5.0[/b] - WARNING. Scam developer. Abandon all hope, ye who enter.[/h1]\nThe Horror Network [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28221963/]Curator[/url] | [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thehorrornetwork]Group[/url] Click for Gore\n- Developers should be proud of themselves for this awful game.\nAfter a 3 hour session with a friend, my legs are stiff, my heart is confused with constant beating and my brain is extremely satisfied and wants more.\n\nIf you like being scared and the horror genre, just find a like-minded friend and play it. Even when you are simply running in and out, it's going be a lot of fun. I have no idea how one would play a medium map but maybe with 4 people one might have the courage to walk inside that cursed high school more than we did - which was 2 meters into the entrance. We didn't have the heart for more.\n\nOn a serious note: It is worth the price, hands down.\n\nPS: Devs, I hate you for how good this game is.\n\nEdit: I'm back after about two weeks and 50~ more hours. I've played at least a couple of rounds every single day and I still love the game.\n\nMy suggestion is to find a friend who'd enjoy this, get the game both and play. DON'T READ ABOUT IT! Just play for a while, enjoy screwing up, getting spooked, killed, whatever happens! The more you learn about the mechanics, the more you lose the fear, so don't read about it!\nI mean I'm still a coward at level 60 something but that's me. Of course if you are like me, then why are you reading this and not buying the game?\n\nFinal word: Check their discord to find like-minded people in the LFG! You won't be alone, I promise!\n- It's hard to recommend Spelunky 2. Not because it is a bad game, but because it can be frustrating. As with most roguelikes, dying means going back to the beginning. In Spelunky however, nothing carries over to future runs. All you get to bring in to your next run is your own experience and knowledge; And when half the things in the game kill you instantly or stunlock you to death, having a great run end in a quick death can be damaging to one's will.\n\nThankfully, your own experiences count a great deal towards your progress. Most hazards and enemies in Spelunky 2 have a very simple and predictable behaviour. But keeping track of everything on the screen is still a challenge. Enemies and traps will also work together (or against each other) and still bring your demise somehow. Either by bumping your helplessly stunned body into other enemies and traps, or enemies having their own flaming corpse launched towards you and your flammable jetpack. It's actually quite funny sometimes. A good deal of entertainment can be had recording your own amazingly nonsensical deaths.\n\nSpelunky 2 improves upon Spelunky HD's gameplay by adding split paths, which allow for more variety and decision-making in your runs while staying true to the feeling and style of previous entries. It also adds a back layer to each level, allowing for more secrets to be kept. After successfully completing your first run, you can try to discover these secrets and find hidden bosses and areas and even different endings!\n\nAnyway, you might enjoy the game if you're a masochist or something.\n- Played the original back in 2017/2018, and I must say what a hell of a remaster, everything is enhanced, the visual the UI the user experience, its amazing to see this game in a fullscreen i can finally see the tiny details!\n- Good game, one of the best in the series but I can not recommend. \nDO NOT BUY.\nWhile it is still possible to play zombies safely with the use of community patches you can not play public servers safely and activision are actively removing safe ways of playing the game.\n\n*DO NOT OPEN ANY COD PRIOR TO IW*\nThey took away Xlabs, Sm2, and soon will take away Plutonium which are all the ONLY safe way to play these older CoDs.\nOpening any CoD prior to IW will result in a chance for people to gain access to your pc. 2 security breaches are known:\nCVE-2018-20817\n(SV_SteamAuthClient in various Activision Infinity Ward Call of Duty games before 2015-08-11 is missing a size check when reading authBlob data into a buffer, which allows one to execute code on the remote target machine when sending a steam authentication request.

This masterpiece came out of no where and completely reignited my love for gaming. PLEASE do not sleep on this game, it's such a breath of fresh air from the garbage you'd normally expect from modern day companies. Definitely taking a spot in my top 5 favorites and I haven't even scratched the surface of the game yet, it's just that good. Beautiful art style, crisp animations, a unique concept, FUN gameplay, its everything I've been wanting and more. Kudos to the devs for making this absolute banger <3\n- This is the fighting game that you give to a friend who doesn't play fighting games to learn, the Steam Edition of Killer Instinct comes with all of the characters as well as the extra premium skins that were added into the game. Killer Instinct has arguably one of the best tutorial systems that I have played with in recent years, if not one of the best period. It allows you to learn at a reasonable pace each and every one of the specific features of the game, including assists so that people are able to learn what combo breaker they need to use versus specific attacks. Combo Assist in this is less a crutch or a hand hold mechanic and more of a guide when it comes to using combos, it will automatically add in linkers to combos so that people who are unfamiliar with the game aren't left mashing buttons and making a fool of themselves because they don't know what they are doing, it will free flow the fight as best as it can to help guide people toward what they need to be doing, showing off what specials people could be doing to link the combo together and maximize the amount of damage they could possibly get, and due to the combo meter it stops people from being locked into combos forever since once a combo ends you are forced away, either by the opponent's combo ender or the combo forcing itself closed.\n\nThe price that they ask for on Steam you will get more out of the game than you could expect from something this priced. There are two story modes specific to the first two seasons of characters that came out, then with Season 3, which brought back the two original bosses from the franchise, Shadow Lords, a seperate scenario style campaign in which you pick the team that you wish to take in your attempt to overthrow the Shadow Lord himself. That's without taking into account the Shadow Lab mode which allows you to train a Shadow of yourself, an AI that learns and builds off your own patterns to fight in a similar manner to yourself, these Shadows are used within its own unique survival mode, as well as special missions that can crop up within the Shadow Lord mode.\n\nIf you're after a fighting game to get into, or you're looking to get a friend into fighting games, this is the best one that you could possibly start with, since it will not only teach the specific mechanics to this one, but also allow you to learn in time a lot of the mechanics that other competitive fighters share, though this one, eases you into it, so that it is a less daunting experience, as well as being much friendlier to new players.\n- I even set a calendar reminder so that I could get this on release. I wish I hadn't bothered. Going great guns until I got to the passage. Game over as I can't progress. Tried allsorts to drop the jammer but unable to do so. I guess it is a case of waiting for all the bugs to get resolved.\n- [h1]First of all, NISA... the elephant in the room needs addressing.[/h1]\nIf you're going to use D3D11 and try to do stuff multi-threaded, use a 64-bit executable.\n\nMemory allocation and thread pooling work much better in a 64-bit environment. 32-bit doesn't really expand your market share any but causes several compatibility headaches (including memory fragmentation in your resource manager). Please, NISA, stop fooling around with legacy APIs (i.e. WinMM for gamepad input and OpenGL 1.x as you did in Disgaea) and outdated ABIs.  D3D11 / 64-Bit should be the target environment for software longevity.\n\nI get the impression you believe that OLDER means more compatible, but you've got the whole PC development paradigm upside down. Old stuff is simply old, period.\n\nI would encourage you to review the guidelines for authoring Windows Store software, Microsoft's policies for Windows Store are designed to reduce legacy software maintenance problems. You need not follow them, but they will give you a pretty good idea of the APIs and ABIs that are relevant / native / not running through compatibility layer redtape. Do this and I believe you will find PC development much less troublesome.\n\n\n\n\n[list][i]With that out  of the way, I would like to point out that NISA patches their games more than any developer I have ever seen.[/i][/list]\n\n\nI personally believe this game is best suited for the Nintendo Switch, but PC will have a stable version by the time the Switch version ships. I have already authored a number of fixes for texture aliasing that guarantee image quality-wise, the PC version is where you would expect it to be. We just need NISA to polish the rest of the stuff :)\n\nTake early reviews with a grain of salt because NISA's going to be busy patching this game for months if Disgaea is any indication. Price complaints are probably the only aspect of current reviews that will remain valid. I tend to agree, the asking price is not what it should be for a game that's not exactly finished.\n\n\n\n[h1]I am leaving a positive review because I have faith NISA will stick with it, but ...[/h1]\n\n[list][list]You shouldn't rush to buy this game by any means. [b]Wait it out.[/b][/list][/list]\n- It's horrible. It's annoying to play, it freaks you out, it insults you relentlessly. Yeah, of course I'm recommending it, why do you ask?\n\nWill You Snail is what it says it is. A platformer with traps popping on your predicted path with some meta plot and an evil AI commenting on your actions, mostly with clever insults. But it's also a little more than that, mainly due to the quality of its elements - so the game becomes more than the sum of its parts.\n\nYou're probably wondering about the difficulty. Well, good news: there are four settings, and by default they change depending on your performance. You struggle with the level too much? It's lowered. You beat it on the first few tries? It goes up. All with a (not) nice comment from Squid, the antagonist. I personally found the design annoying rather than actually challenging, but I'm quite sure that's intentional. The game's got it all: conveyor belts (that randomly change direction), underwater currents, perfectly timed spikes falling on your head, blocks that cave in on you after you break them. PhD in twatologist design. Due to the ever-shifting nature of the levels, I wouldn't even call this game a precision platformer - it's not about learning the level, but about adaptation. Luckily, the platforming segments are only one part of the game and there's some downtime between them, with optional (but fun) puzzles.\n\nOh, and for reference: I played mostly on difficulty 3 out of 4, sometimes dropping to 2 and rose to 4 towards the end. I found it roughly as difficult as Ori and the Blind Forest's latter sections, harder than Celeste ignoring strawberries, and easier than Garlic.\n\nLet's talk about Squid, the antagonist. The misanthropic, fatalistic, super-intelligent AI trope is pretty old at this point - but Squid is a very good refinement of that trope. It feels like he's really insulting you - the player - not the player character, like GLaDOS did. Mainly because he really reacts to the exact things that you do. You died just before the end? He'll point that out. You keep dying in one spot? He'll let you have it. You died to a spike? Comments about hitting your head incoming. Ran into a bomb? He'll tell you not to collect them. And so on. There so many lines, I never, ever, not once ran into a duplicate. That really makes him feel like a living, breathing person, not an NPC. I mean, he's not living and breathing... you know what I mean.\n\nOn that topic: if you've watched the trailer, you've probably noticed that Squid speaks with a non-native accent. That's because he's voiced by the dev, who's German; and indeed the general writing has this sardonic, matter-of-fact yet earnest quality that will be familiar to you if you know the German style of communication. No, no angry screaming, that's not how Germans talk. Stop watching WW2 speeches and watch some Staplerfahrer Klaus instead.\n\nAnd finally, there's the story. It's a bit meta, no surprises there. I won't write too much about it because I don't want to spoil it. Let's just say that it leaves many things out, but gives you just enough info to fill in the blanks. It's rather suspenseful; more importantly, it slowly builds up to... cosmic horror? Existential terror? Perhaps both. Also, it has a very clear message, delivered quite convincingly. Up to you to decide what to do with it.\n\nOverall, Will You Snail is pretty good. I don't think it's as flawless as many reviews make it out to be; the annoying design is still annoying in the end, even if it's thematically correct. Also, the music relies a little too much on the central leitmotif of the game, and it simply doesn't have the grace and variety to pull it off like Toby Fox did with UNDERTALE's soundtrack. Still; those little things aren't enough to wear down the emotional feast presented by this game. I'd say \"Guten appetit\" to this fine escargot meal, but in this case, we are the snails. Enjoy!\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42922988]Curator page[/url]\n- THERE IS ONLINE CO-OP with REMOTE PLAY!  Im not sure why that guy put misinformation in the beginning of his review.\n\nIf you have 3 friends, only one of you needs to buy this and invite them through remote play and you will have a BLAST. First session we played 3 hours straight and laughed so hard we gave ourselves a headache.\n\nAlot of love went into making this game and a lot of hidden easter eggs nodding to other games. If you need something to play with your group of friends during quarantine, this is the game!\n- The only marginally interesting or entertaining part of this game is it's history.\n\nJanuary 15, 2015: It's sold under the name of H1Z1. It was marketed as an open world zombie survival game, akin to DayZ. I bought it for 20$. The game does not run.\n\nAfter a time, they release a new gamemode; King of the Kill. It's a battle royale mode, made specifically because PLAYERUNKNOWN made a hugely successful battle royale mod for the game but then split off to make his own game (PUBG).\n\nFebruary 5, 2016: KOTK is doing well, so they split it off from the game, both of them costing 20$. They silently abandon the original game, only doing small feature updates and adding nothing but bugs. H1Z1 (The survival game.) is renamed to H1Z1 Just Survive.  KOTK is renamed H1Z1: King of the Kill. Not long after they rename H1Z1 Just Survive to simply Just Survive (Which sounds like a terrible 3$ app game.) and rename H1Z1 King of the Kill to just H1Z1. (H1Z1 Battle Royale on consoles.) Development of the original survival game, \"Just Survive\", is still mostly halted.\n\nOctober 24, 2018: Just Survive, the survival game i paid for, is shut down. The game is removed from my, and everyone else's steam library, with no refund. KOTK, or H1Z1, or H1Z1 Battle Royale...or...whatever the crap they named it, is shut down as well, and re-published and renamed as a different game, Z1 Battle Royale, obviously done to alienate the game from it's wretched history.\n\nThe kicker? It's free. Also, it's still called H1Z1 Battle Royale on consoles, and when Z1 BR is run, the window is named H1Z1. \n\nThey made a game said it was like DayZ. It didn't even work. Then they simply deleted it from my library with no refund. Z1 BR is dead, it garners about 3 active players. They actually, legitimately built a fake game and then deleted it for money.\n\nUtterly disgusting development team. When everyone said the original game was going down in flames due to terrible updates, horrible balancing fix attempts that only worsened the balance, and endless amounts of bugs spilling into the game, i sat there, with hope. This is what i got.\n\nThey said the original H1Z1 was originally going to be made free. I was fine, 20$ for instant beta access to a DayZ game was fine. What they didn't say is that it was a blatant lie and they would toss the game in the trash in favor of another random game they made using the original games assets (I told you. They're terrible. Too lazy to even make new assets.) simply because Fortnite was getting popular.\n\nAnd after all that?\n\nThe game sucks balls.\n\nDon't [strike]buy[/strike] download this game.\n- It's an asset flip. I know that's a bit obvious, but just in case you were in doubt, there you go.\n\nFull of bugs, rushed, empty, poor sound/animation/ai/overall design quality, completely broken english, barely functioning UI, you get the picture, it's a cash grab.\n- Upon further play, the game wasn't super luck based, it just doesn't do a great job explaining core mechanics that are crucial to gameplay. It has a more hands off, let the player discover how this works type of playstyle, but a simple line of dialogue alluding to these features would have been nice. That said, the story is really gripping, the gameplay (once learned) is fun, and overall, I definitely think it's worth $20.\n- This is more than a game for me.  It has become a hobby.  What started as a random purchase for myself last Christmas -- I had an old electric guitar I never played in the closet, so this gave me an excuse to see if I can learn -- has become an expensive obsession for me.  Warning -- but a good warning -- you'll find that you're learning guitar very quickly on this game, and it will become the start of an expensive habit!  I have downloaded hundreds of dollars worth of songs, bought a brand new guitar, I've signed up for music theory and guitar lessons at the local county college ... this has become a genuine hobby for me.  Literally, it is one of those rare games which has genuinely made an impact on my life.  Six months later, and the game has not gotten old.  I look forward to new songs, I laugh when a new chord I've never seen magically appears on the song that I've practiced the hell out and achieved a new difficulty.  The game is, most importantly, fun.  It remains fresh and only gets better as you get better.  I highly recommend.\n- As a historical novelist and former high school English teacher with over 700 books in my home devoted to ancient Greek literature, history and culture I had to try this game.\n\nI should mention that I am pushing 60 years old and although I like strategy games like Creative Assembly’s Rome II, I’m not a fan of ‘gopher’ games that make you run around collecting items, rescuing damsels in distress, delivering messages, and murdering politicians to level your character.  The whole premises seems rather tedious and unimaginative.  \n\nSo right from the start I expected to hate Assassin’s Creed Odyssey.  Combine that with the fact that I’d never played an Assassin’s Creed game before, and I am not the most nimble finger clicker, I was prepared to spend a good portion of my playing time getting my head lopped off.  \n\nNone of that happened.  Well, yeah, there is a pretty steep learning curve here.  I did spend a lot of my initial hours zigging when I should have been zagging, and with my opponent’s spear in my head, but I stuck with it and eventually even an old poop like me was able to figure out the mechanics.\n\nWhat kept me going was the sheer majesty of the game and the beauty of the surroundings.  \n\nI’ve been to Athens, Sparta, Argos, Mycenae, Delos, Aegina, Hydra, Crete, Melos (now Santorini), and dozens of other locales on the campaign map multiple times.  I’ve walked around the ruins at Delphi, strolled the docks of Piraeus and walked through valley of Laconia for research for my books.  I wanted to see these places at they might have looked 2,500 years ago and that for me is the true joy of Assassin’s Creed Odyssey.\n\nThe team at Ubisoft deserves a lot of credit.  They did their homework.  Sure, you’d expect to see historical figures like Pericles, Socrates, Alcibiades and Archidamas in a game about the Peloponnesian War.  But that anyone outside of academia even knows who Brasidas, Aspasia, Herodotus and Pausanias were, is impressive.  Kudos to you.\n\nI’m probably an oddball gamer because I was not motivated by stabbing people in the back to gain levels and steal loot.  The entire idea of stabbing people in the back goes against the grain of the Greek ethos of ‘kleos’ or honor.  What kept me going was the desire to see more of the world that Ubisoft created.  \n\nI wanted to visit the Athenian Acropolis and see the Propylaea, Erechtheion and Parthenon as they were shiny and new, instead of in piles of rubble.  I wanted to gaze up at Phidias' statue of Zeus in Olympus (one of the wonders of the ancient Greek world that no longer exists), speak to the Pythia at the temple of Delphi, and see the five villages of Sparta as they might have looked.  Getting to walk the streets of Athens, Argos and Elis was like taking a trip back in time.  Magical.\n\nOkay, the game isn’t perfect.  The pronunciation of common names like Pericles and Socrates and the character’s accents were maddening.  I can only guess that Ubisoft believes we’ve Americanized the real pronunciations, or at least I hope that’s what they were thinking.  Ultimately it’s a minor annoyance.\n\nThe hoplite battles were a major disappointment.  The Greeks fought in a phalanx formation.  Shoulder to shoulder.  Shield to shield.  The battles here are a 300 movie style free for all.  Oh well, guess you can’t have everything.  \n\nAlso I could not fathom how Alexios and Kassandra could be descended from Leonidas, but have no connection to the Agiad royal family.  By rights they should have been Pausanias’ cousins, but they’re not.  I don’t know who they are. The whole Pythagoras-is-my-father thing is rather bizarre and makes no sense at all.  \n\nI won’t go off the charts here listing the historical inaccuracies that drove me batsh!t crazy, as it serves no purpose.  Suffice it to say that I enjoyed the game.  \n\nIf you ever wanted to unravel the labyrinth of the minotaur beneath King Minos palace at Knossos, get drunk and sing songs with Socrates at an Athenian symposium, feel the Aegean Sea roll beneath your feet on the deck of a  trireme, or stare out in wonder at the lights twinkling over Attica at twilight, try this game.  You won’t be disappointed.\n- Alpha, Beta, Finished Product... I hear lots of Blah blah blahs complaining about this game not being out of Alpha after years and years, but it isn't like we've been paying a monthly fee for it.  I paid one time to support this game and I've got years of play out of a product that I enjoy.  There aren't too many games that scratch an itch like this game for me... Open World, completely editable/buildable environment and zombies!  One of my biggest issues with a game that I like is that after I buy it, they release a few DLCs and then move on to their next product.  Alpha, Beta, Finished or Not... the developers have given me years of standing by their product and many updates with new content and mechanics.  For that alone, I love their game!\n\nGraphics: 3 outta 5 graphics, she looks a little dated but they keep updating it... It looks better than it originally did.  There's growth\nReplayability: 5 outta 5\nGameplay:3 outta 5... sometimes she's a little clunky\n\nI definitely still believe that this game is worth buying and that they devs and their product is worth supporting.  Hopefully this is helpful to someone.\n- This does what I wish AAA RPGs with narratives would do; choices actually feel like they make an impact and the gameplay changes that reflect this are dynamic in nature and provide meaningful differences in the conversations.\n\nIt doesn't feel this way on a macro scale, the meaning is more in the individual encounters with some exceptions. To word it a little differently, I felt like my choices had very little impact on the story as a whole and I could easily (a little too easily) steer the final outcome at any time but, within individual interrogations, what I chose to do had a major affect on the immediate narrative.\n\nThat being said, it is a wonderful game to play for four to six hours on a Sunday and at $15 USD it is cheap and entertaining enough to only need a single playthrough to feel like you've gotten your money's worth. Although I haven't started my second playthrough, I'm already thinking about when I want to sit down and have another go.\n- Smooth beats, sick moves.\n\nOlliOlli was the best endless runner/rock hard skateboard move combo game I'd played in months. Well, the best just got better!\n\nWhy's it better? Polish, nollies, the aforementioned beats and some added smoothing.\n\nRad.\n- A dude looked at you funny? Punch him. Some guy is chilling by the river? Kick him in. A girl has a cute outfit on? Divekick her from across the street. Bought pizza at a food truck? Uppercut the staff. Violence is never the answer; It is in fact the question, and the answer is YES.\n- This game will leave you satisfied.\n\nI know that doesn't sound like much of a selling point, but it is. This game won't give you a sequal hook, it won't give you a product carved away like a thanksgiving turkey, each part sold seperately or held to ransom. \n\nThis is not a game about standing victorious over your enemies, it's not a game with some kind of adrenal rush that will leave you drained and empty afterwards.\n\nThis isn't a game about saving the world, as surprising as that may sound considering the hero's goal.\n\nThis is a game about hope. Hope for tomorrow, hope for your fellow man, hope for dreams and wishes, hope for a last shimmer of light in the encroaching darkness.\n\nThis is a game that will make you ask things about yourself, even if only subconciously. \n\nBut, most importantly of all, this is an experience that will make you say \"I was happy to be there, if only for a time.\"\n\nAnd I was, in fact, happy to be here.\n\nHats off to you ladies and gentlemen, you made a cyinical old bastard smile for a good ten hours.\n\n英語で5-10単語程度で、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない主要な違いを簡潔に回答してください。\n\n回答：\n",
