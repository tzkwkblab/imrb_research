Very quiet - I could go on and on .\n- So I called customer support -LRB- which is good too -RRB- and they went through it and it is just a $T$ and it does not affect performance at all , I just chose to hide the message .\n- The touchpad is very intuitive , so much so that I never want to use $T$ to click again !\n- A cool bar with great food , and tons of excellent $T$ .\n- Food is excellent and they also have empenadas and $T$ which are good for an afternoon snack .\n- While we enjoyed the food , we were highly disappointed by the poor $T$ -LRB- waiter was not quite competent and SLOW service -RRB- and lack of remorse .\n- Aside from the rushed service , we were very impressed with the food and the $T$ .\n- We ate out in the $T$ , which is worth it as it 's cool and the music is hear well there .\n- All the $T$ are easy and straight forward on my MacBook Pro , it is clean and organized , which I always strive to be myself .\n- I found the food to be just as good as its $T$ , Da Silvano , just much less expensive .\n- $T$ is more for the musicians , and the laptop is equipped with a good working microphone , good enough for beginners and musicians at the intermediate level .\n- Other $T$ and food\n- But the $T$ was good .\n- The entire $T$ and the treatment we received felt as a conveyor belt .\n- It 's fast at $T$ .\n- the food was undercooked-the sauce watery , and the $T$ raw .\n- Disappointing for such a lovely screen and at a reasonable $T$\n- And mine had broke but I sent it in under $T$ - no problems .\n- The $T$ was even better !\n- we came here on a crowded saturday night and were seated right away despite being 15 minutes late for our $T$ .\n- The steak was excellent and one of the best I have had -LRB- I tasted the butter intitally but in no way did it overwhelm the $T$ of the meat -RRB- .\n- The Halibut was too salty , $T$ was so so -LRB- do n't waste any of your calories -RRB- and service was poor .\n- The $T$ is yummy and I like the atmoshpere .\n- The $T$ was exactly what I was looking for .\n- Later it held zero $T$ and its replacement worked for less than three months .\n- Not to mention the fact that your mac comes fully loaded with all necessary basic $T$ .\n- I would rather spend my money on a computer that $T$ more then a Toshiba that is n't good at all .\n- The $T$ of sitting on the sidewalk watching the world go by 50 feet away on 6th avenue on a cool evening was wonderful .\n- The $T$ was not fresh and the rice tasted old and stale .\n- My goodness , everything from the fish to the rice to the $T$ was absolutely amazing .\n- I want the $T$ of a tablet , without the limitations of a tablet and that 's where this laptop comes into play .\n- There was only one $T$ for the whole restaurant upstairs .\n- With all the mundane or mediocre places on 8th avenue it is nice to have one that is a step above in quaility and $T$ .\n- $T$ was devine , oysters where a sensual as they come , and the price ca n't be beat !!!\n- This laptop has only 2 $T$ , and they are both on the same side .\n- Its Office compatible , but the $T$ and its functioning is all new again so you might as well save the money and just learn the pre installed mac programs .\n- Delicate spices , onions , $T$ and a kick-ass roti .\n- Not enough $T$ either .\n- They forgot a sandwich , did n't include $T$ , and did n't include pita with the hummus platter .\n- $T$ denoted as `` Roy 's Classics '' -LRB- marked on the menu with asterisks -RRB- are tried-and-true recipes , such as macadamia-crusted mahi mahi , or subtly sweet honey-mustard beef short ribs .\n- now if they could only get a $T$ .\n- The selection changes frequently but the $T$ are always available .\n- In fact I still use manyLegacy programs -LRB- Appleworks , FileMaker Pro , Quicken , $T$ etc -RRB- !\n- It might have been a little too spicy for my friend , which you can couteract with eat more $T$ and keeping water on hand .\n- $T$ well , and I am extremely happy to be back to an apple OS .\n- But do n't ever order bacon late at nite -LRB- either $T$ or in sandwiches , for that matter do n't from any take out place -RRB- as it is from the morning frying turns out hard almost like bacos , hurt my molars .\n- I had to ask her three times before she finally came back with the $T$ Ive requested .\n- But when you are seated the waitresses are great , they explain everything on the menu , and the $T$ of the food is really cheap for the service you get .\n- Likewise if you like really $T$ or really big slices then Nick and Joe 's may not be your favorite .\n- Terrific menu full of unique rolls and special $T$ .\n- The freshest , best $T$ , and the fastest delivery .\n- One thing I liked about this place is that I never felt rushed or pressured to give up my $T$ ot incoming guests .\n- The menu was impressive with selections ranging from a burger , to steak , to $T$ .\n- I bought a Logitech desktop set in anticipation for using with the MBP , but I use the $T$ 90 % of the time .\n- It has good music , nice $T$ , an interesting selection of wines -LRB- primarily Spanish -RRB- and a lowkey hip neighborhood clientele .\n- An oasis of refinement : Food , though somewhat uneven , often reaches the pinnacles of new American fine cuisine - $T$ 's passion -LRB- and kitchen 's precise execution -RRB- is most evident in the fish dishes and soups .\n- No refills on $T$ , though .\n- I also got the added bonus of a 30 '' HD Monitor , which really helps to extend my $T$ and keep my eyes fresh !\n- i dont know what some people who rave about this $T$ are talking about .\n- Spent 2 hours on phone with $T$ .\n- We recently spent New Year 's Eve at the restaurant , and had a great experience , from the wine to the $T$ .\n- All the money went into the $T$ , none of it went to the chefs .\n- Peformance is good for the $T$ .\n- Everything from the $T$ to the OS is simple and to the point .\n- The crab cakes are delicious and the $T$ was perfect .\n- We ordered some $T$ and noodle soup dishes from the Thai section of the menu but nothing we got was Thai .\n- The $T$ randomly pops open when it is in my backpack as well , which is annoying .\n- I never had an $T$ before so I gave it a shot .\n- The prices and $T$ are especially great considering it 's in the West Village .\n\n英語で5-10単語程度で、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない主要な違いを簡潔に回答してください。\n\n回答：\n",
