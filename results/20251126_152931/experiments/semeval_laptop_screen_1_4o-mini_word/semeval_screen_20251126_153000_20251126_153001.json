at least 5 pieces of fish and a basketful of fries -RRB- .\n- The difference in the $T$ from a PC 's keyboard took a bit of tim to get used to , but overall it 's worth it !\n- I had their eggs benedict for $T$ , which were the worst in my entire life , I tried removing the hollondaise sauce completely that was how failed it was .\n- Overall , this laptop is definitely a keeper with its simple yet stylish $T$ and its array of fantastic colors to choose from .\n- You can eat gourmet food at a fast food $T$ .\n- Ease of $T$ is just one of the benefits I love about my Mac .\n- Love the $T$ of the Mac software and operating system .\n- When he 's not making authentic Neapolitan pizza in the open brick oven or lightly frying $T$ , he 's visiting the regulars -LRB- a growing legion -RRB- and checking on newcomers .\n- This is a nicely sized laptop with lots of processing power and long $T$ .\n- The design is awesome , $T$ is unprecedented .\n- When going out for a nice dinner , I like a nice ambiance as well as very good $T$ .\n- The start menu is not the easiest thing to $T$ due to the stacking .\n- Awesome $T$ !\n- Overall : Poor , $T$ : Average , Performance : Poor , Battery Life : Excellent , Price-Value : Poor\n- I have $T$ , so I am unable to install and uninstall some programs .\n- Great $T$ and the prices are very reasonable .\n- Not as fast as I would have expect for an $T$ .\n- All the money went into the interior decoration , none of it went to the $T$ .\n- It 's not a wear-and-tear issue , not due to user carelessness and most importantly , they CA N'T guarantee the problem will be solved if it is sent for $T$ and I have to accept the outcome .\n- I love the dock where I can simply drop a file ontop of a particular $T$ , and the program will simply open that file .\n- However , it did not have any scratches , ZERO battery cycle count -LRB- pretty surprised -RRB- , and all the $T$ seemed to be working perfectly .\n- Casablanca servces delicious falafel , $T$ , humus and other Mediterranean delights , which are all very inexpensive .\n- $T$ was awful - mostly because staff were overwhelmed on a Saturday night .\n- Get the $T$ and a nosh -LRB- pastrami sandwich -RRB- for $ 8 and you 're golden .\n- Service was also horrible and the $T$ is not that great .\n- I especially like the keyboard which has chiclet type $T$ .\n- They bring a sauce cart up to your table and offer you up to 7 or 8 $T$ for your steak -LRB- I tried them ALL -RRB- .\n- The $T$ is very good too but for the most part , it 's just regular food , nothing special .\n- The $T$ is secured to motherboard so when this happens you ca n't see the plug at all , it 's just gone .\n- Adjust the $T$ since it 's not that responsive to begin with .\n- A few tips : skip the $T$ , roast pork buns and egg custards .\n- The screen is nice and the images comes very clear , the $T$ and the fit just feels right .\n- Other installed features , such as certain $T$ , are also most attractive .\n- -4 RAM slots , 2 HDD Bays * , 16GB RAM support -
