If you're looking for activities, give these boys a look: \n- I don’t think anyone would be offended by calling a group guys. But idk\n- I'm replying just bask in the glow with someone else! Yay!!\n- Agree but 2015/2016 KAT != 2018 KAT\n- I don't think this happened at all tbh\n- Lol it's a public sidewalk, I wouldn't call it their set \n- I recommend here a kind of jazz bar that enjoy a meal and drink. Famous place in seoul\n- CIA?... Yes, this one right here.\n- I joined a club and that's how I made friends. Try joining a club.\n- That would be fantastic!!\n- I honestly couldn’t care less about your opinion at this point\n- I think it was just a poorly worded title, what it meant to me was that there was a reason other than teaching kids to count. \n- Agreed. But considering their poor cars were carrying 1200+ lbs of weight, that might slow things down lol\n- My point was that there is no good vote here. This is legislative battle over wall funding and any given vote makes sense only in that context.\n- Damn. Alright.\n- Good [NAME] ^(that's perfect)\n- I am sure epic is going to go the disney way and not have any \"controversal\" stuff on their platform.\n- For the record I don’t necessarily want him either. I just think he’s a compelling person.\n- I don’t go out that way much but even [NAME] is killer if it’s slippy out.\n- Wow, this is bizarre. Well, I agree too. A wealth tax is exactly what we need.\n- Takes a lot of courage to admit they are autistic online. Nice to see you worked up the courage buddy!\n- Yeah that's not almost a semi auto. And the slam fire is vastly over rated.\n- By taking it as a nonserious game you don't need in order to enjoy and have fun with it.\n- That is profoundly messed up.\n- Well then why are some people allowed to talk about strip clubs here and others are not?\n- I agree it's nonsense. Race, as a biological entity, doesn't exist. \n- almost [NAME] can do it !!\n- >Also, you realize that both parties largely dabble in identity politics. Oh absolutely! It's a major reason I hate [NAME]. \n- Lol no.\n- My biggest problem with Yuri on Ice is that it didn't have enough episodes to show the payoff of their relationship in my opinion.\n- They literally don’t have enough time on the planet to regret their actions.\n- Nope. I don't think so either. Same thing I noticed with a couple of accounts that posted here at ESS recently.\n- yes, also most donut shops like those are cambodian just fyi.\n- The most important part of a sacrifice is the innocence of the victim. (Even we [NAME] belive that). The unborn are the most innocent.\n- What game do you think that is ? Because that'd be Tetris or Minecraft my dude, not your teenage greasy neckbeard crap. Sorry.\n- At least you can skip it\n- You’re being downvoted for making a moronic comment - not for your “heroic” efforts here fedora...\n- Agreed. Very relevant suggestion!\n- Yeah ik that should be unacceptable too lmao\n- Mr [NAME] is operater as fuck\n- That kinda true honestly lol. Just has more potential\n- Doesn't matter if we stop, everyone else will do it. You're telling a whole world looks don't matter, yah good luck.\n- No there is, because as soon as it’s a human it is entitled certain unalienable rights. \n- I don't bother diagnosing it in people with BPD. The handful of genuine DIDs that I was referring to were people who didn't have BPD.\n- No, but she's lived in Chicago longer than I. \n- You are definently not in the wrong because you didnt actually him. Also does your brother get any special privledges that you dont?\n- I never said they didn't test it lol, I said they haven't tested it on PTR, which they haven't.\n- Deservedly so too. Tbh I think you must be the favourites.\n- Not practicing with the team, seems like a bad sign for playing today. \n- I don't have a problem with this if their hands are clean.\n- Never argue with religious people. You can't win. They think [NAME] is real after all.\n- Most underrated subreddit.\n- Damn I got a notif from a (very cute) friend saying \"no u\" on Discord right before I saw this\n- Vasectomies are fairly common. Especially in older men.\n- I have this problem but without caffeine\n- Nah man I prefer endless cause of the part where he goes WOMWOMWOMWOMWOMWOM WOOOOOO REEEEEEEEE like that's lyrical genius right there\n- Nice, I like it. A truly unusual pairing. \n- \"Electricity scam\"? ...and I'm pretty sure [NAME] is not an idiot.\n- \"Feed the wars and fuck the poors\" is pretty much their policy.\n- We can't let the 8 year olds who are playing an M rated game see all of this bad language!!\n- Didn't you know, it's all about winning, nothing else matters\n- A world where I despise a good number of republicans AND democrats.\n- This face will not age well.\n- \"You're right. Things are boring. You should find someone who isn't boring. I will too.\"\n- Having read the entire article, and some of the other FAQ, the only thing this is telling is that [NAME] read the same book very differently.\n- This seems like a colossally unimportant thing to sign a petition over.\n- As a household we deal with it by respecting each other's choices and opinions.\n- I couldn't agree more.\n- They don’t. Conservatives want to characterize any scoopy news organization as unreliable because they can’t get ahead of them easily.\n- No I don’t, why can’t you bring your hand to do it?\n- You're right, thank you.\n- “Not a word you need to learn, honey” Cringiest part of the whole episode.\n- It's not hypocritical to find annoying behaviour annoying. The two situations aren't mutually exclusive.\n- Adding a few projectile characters only made the game better, not worse. Bars can go though.\n- Yes! These people are allowed to vote and drive and do other things that affect our lives!\n- No, just a bastard pastry\n- No, you're thinking of basilisk. A basterisk is a person born outside of wedlock.\n- Like [NAME] [NAME] yes but [NAME] [NAME] is super nasty. Whoever wrote the dialogue for classified needs to be fired cause it’s makes me wince\n- Turgeon offense at it's finest. The ball never gets past the three point line and [NAME] just hits a three in someone's face.\n- This is not looking good for China's typical method of say whatever the other side wants to hear then do nothing.\n- I mean my statement applied to more than just weed but sure...\n- I think that's more a matter of character's personalities, I think, more than development. But for the rest, I agree. \n- > no one wants to smell like a goat. HA! That's amazing. I love it.\n- He's done nothing to earn trust either. He got ran out of Miami\n- The level of envyness far too much\n- Great for him professionally, but the employees he takes the credit from? Not so much.\n- Honestly, if you did not, then you were watching the video incorrectly.\n- [NAME] bad, [NAME] good, updoots to the left.\n- I bet there's something delicious in there that hornets do make\n- Those words you used. I don't want to believe that exists.\n- Look we are starving but we still have some honor. We don't need any help from your people. Especially not 50 cents a day\n- Yeah I don't think so lol\n- That's because there are a lot of other attrocities that have happened since then. [NAME] aren't the only ones facing discrimination.\n- Refusing to pay someone for work that they've done is theft. You can try to justify it any way you want but that's what it is.\n- >Federal minimum wage should be closer to $5 That's a horrifying thought.\n- Interesting take there\n- Me too.. which left me conflicted about how to feel.\n- I'd give them a first, but they have to retain salary. You know they'll just destroy that first round pick too.\n- thats messed up...thats why i dont like reddit as much\n- Join Wattpad! There are many great books and it's free :) If you want \"real\" books, [NAME] is definitely worth reading. \n\n【グループB】\n- Very possible but there's absolutely zero indication were working on a deal to trade [NAME] currently. We're not just going to trade him away for peanuts.\n- I know you're trying to play devil's advocate but [NAME] doesn't hit close to as well as [NAME]\n- I think sweaty is hilarious in the context of r/forwardsfromgrandma which is where I see it 90% of the time\n- I love this pic... believe me I am up for some reason my hands on you.\n- I think its justified because that dude freaks me out. The less money the better.\n- They want to make gun ownership so expensive and onerous that people won't even bother.\n- That's a good step that can't be attributed to him because he didn't do a damn thing about it.\n- Ahhh, [NAME]: Hero of Eardrums worldwide!\n- *curb your enthusiasm theme intensifies*\n- You’re truly welcome :)\n- You too thirsty\n- As much as I love the dodgers, I can’t see them in the World Series 3 times in a row... so yeah, backwards.\n- It's awesome.
