is not upgradable to a longer life battery .\n- They gave me a hard time yet again , but their was a malfunction in the $T$ itself , it did n't die .\n- There is a small red circle next to it with a x in the middle , and when I click on it it says : '' Consider replacing your $T$ '' and it does not hold full charge .\n- The $T$ is amazingly long at 7hrs and 5hrs if you use it .\n- Crisp screen , great $T$ , and plenty of storage .\n- lightweight , long $T$ , excellent transition from PC ;\n- I use this for my tutoring business , and since I 'm always bouncing from student to student , it is ideal for portability and $T$ -LRB- yes , it gets the 8 hours as advertised ! -RRB- .\n- The $T$ , before the battery completely died of course , left much to be desired .\n- The only thing is that the $T$ wo n't last more than 1/2 an hour .\n- It is good to know that I can mobilize without having to worry about the $T$ .\n- My laptop now has no $T$ .\n- My only disappointment with the 13 '' model is that they 're the only ones in the MacBook Pro line up without an i5 or i7 processor and dual graphics cards , however the trade-off is that you achieve a longer $T$ -LRB- of about 2 more hours -RRB- .\n- The $T$ gets so HOT it is scary .\n- They went through asking me open up various components , taking $T$ out , hard disk apart , and after 2 hours on phone could not fix it .\n\n【グループB】\n- Somehow the $T$ got messed up after reboot .\n- My wife and I will usually only order one $T$ and one secondi and split them , as they tend to offer large portions .\n- The pesto pizza was excellent , $T$ with a nice amount of spicy Italian cheese that I 'd never heard of before .\n- CONS : $T$ is a bit ridiculous , kinda heavy .\n- I like $T$ , the apparent security , the Mini form

.\n- The sauce on the pizza is sooo good with $T$ and fresh tomatoes and they do n't skimp .\n- With all the mundane or mediocre places on 8th avenue it is nice to have one that is a step above in quaility and $T$ .\n- I also purchased $T$ with the `` no lemon '' clause .\n- The only thing that is n't perfect about this netbook is the $T$ , they are not loud at all but I expected that .\n- Went on a 3 day $T$ binge , with Fish bringing up the closing , and I am so glad this was the place it O trip ended , because it was so great !\n- Had 1 $T$ , 2 entrees and 2 cokes and the bill was ~ $ 55.00 , not including tip .\n- Bottom line : B + for the food , F for the $T$ .\n- I highly recommend visiting this restaurant and having $T$ and drinks !\n- you can actually get 2 $T$ worth if u take it home and add it to some lettuce !\n- It is nearly impossible to get a $T$ , so if you ever have the chance to go here for dinner , DO NOT pass it up .\n- The $T$ and employees are friendly and their pizza is fantastic .\n- The $T$ is a bit quiet if you 're on a plane , this can easily be overcome with a decent pair of head phones .\n- It is super easy to $T$ .\n- While most people say that PCs hold functionality and value and Macs are just pretty to look at , I think there 's something to be said about the $T$ of Macs .\n- Keyboard good sized and wasy to $T$ .\n- It is a REAL $T$ , not the toy I saw in other brands .\n- great $T$ , lt 's of it , more then one person can eat !\n- the food was mediocre to be kind - the $T$ is small and average - the owners are a tag-team of unpleasantries - so rude and snotty i actually let out a hearty guffaw whilst dining .\n- Its a good laptop for its $T$ .\n- I have $T$ , so I am unable to install and uninstall some programs .\n- The computer itself was fast , $T$ smoothly , and had no problems .\n- If you can handle that , it 's a great place for a $T$ , fun with friends or simply a table for 2 .\n- During our meal , the management came over and checked on us and even bought us a $T$ .\n- I am amazed by the poor reviews - I find this place to be standout Italian in an area flooded with Italian - great prices , great atmosphere , good service and a wonderful $T$ .\n- The programs are great , like iphoto -LRB- love the editing capabilities -RRB- , imail -LRB- which can incorporate with the address book on the ipod and ipad -RRB- , $T$ , etc. .\n- As we were sitting eating the subpar $T$ the manager proceeded to berate a couple of his employees for putting out the wrong containers for condiments and explained to them how expensive these containers were .\n- The server was really cool and $T$ us our food and drinks with a smile .\n- I have to say they have one of the fastest $T$ in the city .\n- The best thing I tasted were the $T$ .\n- $T$ came out good also .\n- Well , it happened because of a graceless manager and a rude bartender who had us $T$ 20 minutes for drinks , and then tells us to chill out .\n- Please if your thinking about it go , and stay the $T$ you wo n't be disappointed .\n- Told us to sit anywhere , and when we sat he said the $T$ was reserved .\n- Further , this Mac Mini has a sloppy Bluetooth interface -LRB- courtesy of the $T$ -RRB- and the range is poor .\n- I would not have been so disappointed with the $T$ if the qualities were good enough to make up for it , but they were not !\n- I have never before eaten 40 pieces of relatively good $T$ .\n- There are several programs for school or office use -LRB- Pages , Numbers , Keynote , etc. -RRB- , music -LRB- $T$ -RRB- , photo management -LRB- Photo Booth , iPhoto -RRB- , video-editing or movie-making -LRB- iMovie -RRB- , etc. .\n- Unlike other places in NYC where the sandwiches you want only come as a triple-decker , here you can get what you want in a reasonably-sized portion -LRB- and $T$ -RRB- .\n- I wanted to purchase the $T$ and they refused , because they knew it was trouble .\n- Then after 4 or so months the charger stopped working so I was forced to go out and buy new $T$ just to keep this computer running .\n- Super friendly and knowledgable $T$ , fabulous bistro fare and a wonderful jazz brunch with great live jazz -LRB- the chilaquiles were awesome !\n- Note that they do not serve $T$ , you must bring your own .\n- My friends and I experienced amazing $T$ and a delicious , new summer menu at Artisanal last night .\n- All the money went into the interior decoration , none of it went to the $T$ .\n- I keep my fingers crossed the whole subway ride hoping that there will be a table I can sit at by myself and not have to share with the $T$ people .\n- We also use Paralles so we can run virtual machines of Windows XP Professional , $T$ , Windows Server Enterprise 2003 , and Windows Server 2008 Enterprise .\n- Has all the other features I wanted including a VGA port , HDMI , $T$ and 3 USB ports .\n- Supplied software : The $T$ that comes with this machine is greatly welcomed compared to what Windows comes with .\n- I have had to call with a few questions or issues and they have helped me for free , even without the $T$ .\n- It 's super fast and a great $T$ for the price !\n- It is absolutely horrible to $T$ , despite all its so called advanced features .\n- True quality at a great $T$ !\n- It could be a perfect laptop if it would have faster system memory and its radeon 5850 would have DDR5 instead of $T$ .\n- Their whitefish salad is excellent -- all $T$ with a little mayo .\n- $T$ is excellent quality for a good restaurant price .\n- Wonderful menu , warm inviting $T$ , great service the FOOD keeps me coming back !\n- His wife Tanya , the hostess , completes the comforting $T$ by being delightfully warm and gracious .\n- They bring a sauce cart up to your table and offer you up to 7 or 8 $T$ for your steak -LRB- I tried them ALL -RRB- .\n- I would recommend this laptop to anyone looking to get a new laptop who is willing to spend a little more money to get great $T$ !\n- no complaints with their desktop , and maybe because it just sits on your desktop , and you do n't carry it around , which could jar the hard drive , or the $T$ .\n- Not only are the versions of these $T$ able to be saved , worked on and opened on both a PC and Mac , the versions of these programs on a Mac are graphically and functionally superior .\n- I recommend for $T$ and internet users .\n- Oh , but wait , we were out of $T$ -LRB- which were also delightfully overpriced -RRB- .\n- -LRB- food was delivered by a busboy , not waiter -RRB- We got no $T$ offered for the pasta , our water and wine glasses remained EMPTY our entire meal , when we would have easily spent another $ 20 on wine .\n- We had the $T$ as an appetizer and they were delicious and the sauce was wonderful .\n- The atmosphere is unheralded , the service impecible , and the $T$ magnificant .\n- Great $T$ , and seafood .\n- One of my favorites though was the Angry Lobster , a $T$ that

strong and picks up signals very easily .\n- The $T$ and the managers are really nice and the decor is very comfy and laid-back , all the while being trendy .\n- Innovations are just as assured , from the simple Carinthia cheese ravioli with wild mushrooms to the $T$ , beautifully matched with a bright green spinach-vodka sauce .\n- I am overall very pleased with my toshiba satellite , I like the $T$ , I love the windows 7 home premium .\n- Three courses - choices include excellent $T$ , puff pastry goat cheese and salad with a delicious dressing , and a hanger steak au poivre that is out of this world .\n- Every $T$ and customer who passed by me bumped into my chair .\n- The service was impeccable and unobtrusive -- the $T$ knows what they are there to do -- to know their menu , present your meal , and attend to your needs .\n- I custom ordered the machine from HP and could NOT understand the $T$ due to his accent .\n- The $T$ was just OK , at least for what food was available .\n- It had the full sized $T$ with 2 buttons instead of just one .\n- Great roofdeck , nice group of 30 somethings , but no $T$ , kind of quiet .\n- The only bad part is the size / $T$ .\n- this is the best secret place in midtown ' , I heard that from the bartender , after having brilliant food -LRB- try steak with portobello mushrooms -RRB- and $T$ on the bar last Tuesday .\n- Overall : Poor , Features : Average , Performance : Poor , Battery Life : Excellent , Price - $T$ : Poor\n- I am not sure if I would call the $T$ here Indian as it is a fusion of what seems to be French with an Indian or exotic touch .\n- The food is amazing , rich $T$ and fresh doughy pizza .\n- If you 're craving for Haru 's great $T$ , especially the House Roll , but ca n't stand the wait building outisde , head across the street to their Sake Bar !\n- Delicious food , excellent $T$ , and a pretty atmosphere make this a great choice for dinner and the $ 5.99 lunch buffet makes it an even better choice for lunch !\n- I had to buy a $T$ to go with it , as I am old school and hate the pad , but knew that before I bought it , now it works great , need to get adjusted to the key board , as I am used to a bigger one and pounding .\n- But other than that I am blown away by all the $T$ this laptop offers .\n- They also have a great assortment of wraps if your not in the mood for $T$ .\n- And $T$ works like a charm .\n- Great $T$ , great prices , great service .\n\n英語で5-10単語程度で、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない主要な違いを簡潔に回答してください。\n\n回答：\n",
