      "I purposefully went into this game looking for bugs, seeing that it was in early access, and I have yet to find any. The only reason I stopped playing was because there was a fence that wasn't fully secured to the ground that I was able to get underneath, allowing me to get out of bounds. This lead to me falling into an area where I couldn't get out, and it wouldn't let me respawn at my most recent checkpoint. This would mean I'd have to start from the beginning, which I very much didn't want to do. Anyway, the biggest tips I can give to the developers is to make sure the map is 100% how they want it, and to make the audio design better. That's it. I may come back and change my review in the future.\n\nFINAL RATING: 4 / 10",
      "Fun JRPG with some action commands thrown in, good variety of enemies, and a pretty decent skill development tree.\n\nEnemies can feel pretty tough later in the game, but its more of a puzzle when trying to complete these fights so it doesn't feel cheap.\n\nGreat soundtrack too.\n\nRuns great on Steamdeck",
      "Guys literally only want one thing and it's this.\n\npure JRPG nostalgia",
      "You finally don't need a guide on how to purchase the game.\n\n- 21 different story missions that each take approximately 20 to 50 minutes to complete.\n- DLC sidestory contracts - different targets but same maps.\n- Escalation contracts on those same maps; think of this as a puzzle mode.\n- The new roguelike Freelancer mode that gives randomly generated targets in a randomly generated campaign.\n\nThis game now has such a vast wealth of content that it would take you months to complete it all. I genuinely recommend it.",
      "You, yes you, the person that is reading the reviews.\nI envy you because i can't play this game again for the first time.\n\nScroll back up, buy the game, get a drink and take a seat.\n\nEnjoy you waifus, music, sex stories, and reflection on your own life at 2am moments.\nDon't mind the alpacas.\n",
      "I didn't like the FPS section; was honestly pretty repetitive and gratuitously violent. Also the 8 hour sex scene was a bit out of nowhere, but after like hour 3 you understand why they devote so much time to it. Overall game was ok I guess",

      "This game is basically awesome, under 3 conditions:\n\n1- You get rid of all on-screen icons (i.e. incoming attacks, ennemy spotting)\n2- Do not care about secondary missions only here to further lenghten the game's lifespan\n3- Play the game as you would if  YOU were in charge\n\nBasically, nevermind the Ubisoft micro transactions' system and other abhorrent company induced  greed-leaned system to get stuff faster and more easily by robbing you out of your hard-earned cash...you can finish the game without spending a single dime in the store, it's all pay to win...\nThe open-world aspect is very satisfying and rewarding, in terms of progression, don't fall for the micro transaction system\nCombat is easy even in the highest difficulty setting, but makes you think you are badass when you slash through waves of ennemies, whose AI is rather basic, with your arsenal of rockets, LMGs and explosives but it is satisfying as fuck!\n\nImagine strapping C4 to your plane, jump out of it, have it crashing down an ennemy outpost meanwhile you are parachuting down and throwing hand grenades their way, land on a roof and eliminate the remaining ennemies with fire ammo shotgun and a motherfucking M60 with armor-piercing bullets while throwing dynamites and there you have it...FarCry5 in a nutshell\n\nOh and don't forget about the flame-thrower lol, who doesn't love a flame-thrower scorching ennemies to their own demise eh?\n\nFarCry5 got it all, extreme freedom of how you wanna handle a situation (stealthily or all guns blazing) while being challenging enough in the highest difficulty setting!\nP.S. don't forget to turn off all the on-screen icons, really ruins it for hardcore FPS fans by making it extremely easy, please hear me out, you don't need these!",
      "This game has (while this review is being written) 10076 reviews. 221 of these reviews are negative. I think this ratio of reviews is deserved and here's why:\n\n- It's a fun story, but not something outstandingly new or anything\n- No one ever can deny that it has an amazing soundtrack\n- The combat is a bit bland, but this is compensated by the fact that the game is pretty short\n- It's a short game, but definitely worth it\n\nOverall: it's just a fun short game to play on a day off. Also, I can't get this soundtrack out of my head! PLEASE SEND HELP!",
      "I find it hard to describe everything I read, I’m not even the person who usually reviews games in a serious way because of my difficulty in expressing my emotion, however, I felt the need to externalize what I felt in a simple and fast way. \n\nWhat I read is not a game neither a visual novel, it's a story of a life... Everything that’s happened in this story has stolen my heart, there have been so many beautiful moments that will be impossible to forget... \nI found myself crying over tragedies that weren’t mine.\n\nThanks NOVECT for this masterpiece full of love.",
      "This game is like cocaine. \nI always tell myself just one more, then im done. I'll do homework. I'll sleep. I'll eat something. \nBut you know what? That last death was cheap, I'll do one more to make up for it. I just need 1000 gold for that upgrade, I'll just do one more to get it. Always just one more. \n\nThings I like:\n\n+Strong RPG Progression - Gold from your run can be spent on stats, equipment, abilities, etc. making multiple runs and longer runs more rewarding.\n\n+The game is witty and has flavor. -- there are various conditions your new characters can have such as being blind, gay or having a fear of chickens, amongst many, many others. Dying is in this sense, pretty fun. The writing has a lot of charm!\n\n+The controls are very tight -- this game has good controls. It's easy to do what you want, which is good because it's very tough and you will die a lot.\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n- The bosses in new game plus don't get harder -- As you progress into new game + or ++ or +++ and beyond, the bosses don't scale well, despite the general enemies leveling up to basically become bosses themselves. Not a huge deal, but it's the only negative I have.\n\nThen at some point you realize you've beaten the game, Thankfully there is a new game plus.\nMaybe just one more playthrough...",

I was tempted to play, and will do so for a few hours in future, may be a demon has possessed me...or may be I just don't waste my money that I have spent on it. But really, you should not encourage these games. Who have not bought this game, plz don't buy.",
      "The good news: you came out of cryogenic suspension in good health.\n\nThe bad news: you're critically low on supplies.\n\nThe good news: there are plenty of other vessels within range.\n\nThe bad news: they're all derelict.\n\nThe good news: you have a fleet of salvage drones you can send into the derelicts to gather supplies.\n\nThe bad news: your drones aren't the only things moving around those derelicts. And the other moving things are hostile. And the half-broken infrastructure on those derelicts is prone to fail explosively. And parts of your drones and your ship break too. And your only interaction with the outside world is with the drones. And your only interaction with the drones is through a clunky command-line interface. And you may be the last human alive anywhere. And if your drones die, you're next.\n\nSo on the balance, it's mostly bad news.",
      "I've played a fair amount of games during my time using Steam.\n\nI've never felt as emotionally moved by one as I have with OneShot.\n\nI don't know if anyone reading this has played Transistor, but if you are familiar with and enjoyed that game, continue reading for a little context. (I'm going to put it in spoilers because it contains an integral part of how the game functions, which is likely better for you to experience on your own, rather than learn about it from a third party. Be warned!)\n[spoiler]\nTransistor and OneShot are very different games, but both of them share a similarity in that they have been the most emotionally moving games I've played in my entire life. They both have a huge emphasis on characters, both the one you play as and the ones you interact with or are around you. They also both have brilliantly-developed environments, The combination of these two things is one of the major factors in why I've gotten so immersed in them previously.\n\nHowever, OneShot affected me notably more strongly and for much longer than Transistor, and that is for a very discernable reason. In Transistor, you experience the stories of the characters. When it all ends, you're still a third party, experiencing things through the \"eyes\" of the protagonist.\n\nOneShot, on the other hand, features *you* as basically an integral part of the story. Because of this slight difference (which may seem negligible or gimmicky at first), OneShot basically destroyed me emotionally by the end - not necessarily because of how it ended, but that it ended at all. It wasn't just story of some other charismatic protagonists that came to a close.\n\nIt was mine, and with it, my connection to everything that happened in the game.\n\nIt's really hard to put into words... but I really wanted to put this somewhere, in hopes that someone understands and agrees. :D\n[/spoiler]\n\nAnyways, random game comparison tangent over. It's a phenomenal game - easily one of tmy favorite games of all time, my only complaint being that it ended. Extremely solid 10/10.\n\nIf you enjoy story-driven adventures like Transistor, Undertale, Night in the Woods, etc., this is basically a must-buy.\n",
      "I am generally not a big fan of card games, because luck is most often the deciding factor in them, and so it is also here. But there are many solid mechanics that lessen the randomness and make it enjoyable. You can plan builds and be tactical with your card purchases, so you get a strong deck that can beat the boss. \n\nOf course it is also a rougelike, you will die. But that's part of it, you can have a strategy and get better with every run. It is also addicting in a good way. There are no in game purchases, or other such garbage that is common in so many other card games.\n\nThis is one of the best games that went through Early Access, and the developers made good updates, introducing two new characters with new cards and gameplay mechanics and also further balancing the game. They are currently working on a fourth character. They also interact really well with the players, featuring artwork and being active in the discussions.\n\nThere is much to love with this game, I saw myself coming back time and time again. \nI recommend it for everyone =)",
      "Don't go in expecting a Soulsborne game. \nYou don't get to customize your character.\nYou don't get to just use any weapon.\n\nThat doesn't mean it is bad. In fact, I think it's a brilliant move. FromSoft has set a narrative with this that makes for a -real- story to be told with the player, rather than AT the player like in other FromSoft titles.\n\nIf you are worried about Activision's name being on the label? Don't be. There are no microtransactions. There is no hurdles to make you pay more. You get the game, you own everything currently available for it.\nAll Activision was in charge of was creating the tutorials, and doing some QA testing.\n\nOptimization is great, as well.\n\nYou owe it to yourself to buy this game and support Fromsoft. Show Activision that singleplayer only games are alive and well. This is a gem.",
      "***NEWBIES*** At least 50%, if not more, of this game is map knowledge. So don't beat yourself up if you're  super lost and everyone is yelling at you over game chat. Just mute the salty people and report them if they TK. Trust me there are a lot of people in the game that will back you up and want to help, so don't let one bad experience make you quit the game for good.\n\nThere are a LOT of maps to learn and a lot of small details in every one. It's going to take the average person until your siege level is at LEAST 50 before you really start recognizing map layouts and details on all maps - including room orientation, call outs, soft wall, hard wall, what should be reinforced in each site, common paths of travel, etc..  And then probably until 75 until you're actually comfortable with most maps and operators. I'll give 15% to your own gun skills, 20% to team work and communication (call outs call outs call outs, people. Don't be that guy that just looks at memes after dying. Unless it's casual.), and 15% to your knowledge of the operators and ability to utilize their gadgets. \n\nMore tips:\n-There are a lot of Diamond/Plat smurfs in newcomer that like to make new accounts and s*** on actual new players because it makes them feel good for some reason, so you're better off playing quick match. \n-To learn maps faster, make your own custom games and run around in them. \n-When you die, make sure you watch the replay so you know what cheeky angle the enemy was holding and then don't do what you did next time, or use it to your advantage when you switch sides. \n-If you're not on cams, watch teammates. Look at the places they check as they sweep rooms. Watch the paths they take. Look at how they engage in gun fights and how they rotate around the map. \n-Spend the extra few dollars to buy a version with some operators - it'll make game play more fun for you and you'll have an easier time finding operators that work best with your play style. \n-Squad up with friends - being able to communicate and laugh in a discord can really improve the game experience, even if it's just one other person.\n-Best way to really understand an operator is to play them, so take advantage when there are siege events that allow you to play whoever you want. Use this information to purchase your next operator with the game currency. \n\n",

      "DON'T BUY THIS GAME!\nThis is one of the best games I've ever played. It is quite possibly the best and most detailed Choose-Your-Own-Adventure novel ever written and if you buy it now the creators will receive *NO COMPENSATION* for their work. I am thankful i bought it when I did, while they were still involved, but due to contracting and political differences (ironically fitting for the content of the game) the 2 or 3 writers who pioneered this project were cut out and can't receive royalties anymore.\nThis is a game about the inherent flaws in dogmatic political ideologies, all ideologies including centrism and being a moderate, and it was essentially stolen by capitalists.\nI love this game with all my heart. It is a beautiful story about loss, depression, and finding meaning in a chaotic and absurd reality. Anything more is kinda spoilery so I'm gonna stop myself there. It is all narrated so you dont have to read the enormous amount of text on your own and it is HILARIOUS. Depressing at times but always that spark of humor lingers.\nDON'T BUY THIS GAME. And *DEFINITELY* don't *PIRATE THIS GAME*. Even though it is totally in line with the messaging of the game, would be a HUGE middle finger to the corporation that cut the writers out of their own creation, and is super easy to do with like an an hour of searching Reddit or something, *YOU SHOULD* not *PIRATE THIS OUTSTANDING GAME*. Thank you for reading this, I hope you do the right thing, and you should totally hit on that girl at the beginning she is super into you and there will be no repercussions. Peace.",

      "Since no one with a positive review is willing to explain why, I guess I will.\n\n          Right off the bat, visually, this game is jaw-droppingly phenomenal. The lighting, presentation, and atmosphere has been brilliantly re-captured to ensure older fans from the first game feel like they are returning to somewhere that feels oddly familiar, yet holds many new and unique encounters we have yet to discover. The colors, especially the greens, pop in just the right way to further emphasize the seemingly calm and collected forest during the day that can quickly change into a dark and unsettling nightmare by night.\n\n\tEndnight has again hit the nail on the head with the combat. Considering the old system of charging up momentum to land attacks worked exceptionally well, it's understandable they did not try and reinvent the wheel. Combat has been expanded and smoothed out just enough to keep it feeling fun, fresh and different. Landing hits is just as satisfying as it was in the old game, and mastering these techniques is especially entertaining with both new enemies and their original, upgraded counterparts. \n\n\tAs far as interaction mechanics, the inventory system has been cleverly improved, and Kelvin is a genuinely cool addition to the game. For other friendless losers such as myself, having Kelvin around is good company. Interacting with him is intuitive and straightforward, and losing track of him isn't a problem with the GPS you get right off the bat. Starting off with some way to orient yourself in a map that's five times bigger than the first game is also a welcome change. The \"quick inventory\" while you're on the move is a welcome upgrade as well. The crafting menu has also been improved, separating custom buildings from presets, which makes it easier to keep track of what you can make using custom buildings. Unfortunately, the garbage control scheme returns so for the first five minutes into my new save I was making the game playable instead of... playing the game.\n\n\tBut holy smokes the building is 1000% better than the first game. You still have your already mentioned presets for use in a pinch, and you have the massively improved custom building. Instead of laying out where you want everything to go all at once, you get to pick and choose as you create your desired structure, which makes it way easier to manage your resources while making it, and also allows you to make changes as you see fit. This is a huge step up from the previous game, and it's great.\n\n\tI see some complaints with the performance but I personally had no issues. With the medium preset my game ran at a rock solid 75-80 fps, which is perfectly fine for a game like this. Survival games don't need absurdly high frame-rates; what's more important is certainly the frame times and consistency. And my game would rarely drop frames, it again stayed at 76-77 fps with little deviation.\n\n\tI think that's really this game in a nutshell. The first game, but with pretty much every mechanic getting upgraded and reworked in a positive way (for the most part). There's some reused sound FX throughout the game which I thought was a little disappointing, but there have to be some expectations with a team of just 30 people. People get wrapped up in the fact that visually it competes with triple-A games, but those same people forget a tiny team of 30 put this together, and they are only asking for 30 bucks, which is a steal for a game with this much visual fidelity and replayability. Not to mention the oncoming free updates that will only add more content. It's certainly okay to be critical of a product and point out its flaws, but with expectations in check, this comes out as a pretty solid game.",
      "It was a nice little trip, about 8 hours of gameplay (A bit more if you feel like grinding)\nStory went along nicely from start to end, in no place felt rushed.All sidequest can be done as you progress on the story.\nCombat is nice, and gotta apply every mechanic you had learnt about to fight the final boss.\nThe music, both in fights and background is really nice, has some nice Cyber-future feel\nRecommended? Yes. \nRating 9/10. Hoping for DLC or sequel soon enough",
      "Sticking with the usual air of cool and weird and the usual musical flair, the latest Cosmo D entry changes up the FPS gameplay for a dice rolling RPG with quirky characters and little surprises to be found (and making pizza, of course).

      "This game was a real treat. I played the 1st Valfaris and became an instant fan. I love that this is direction went by the developers, I feel it was a really good evolution of the series and mixing it up with a shoot em up gives it that extra punch/kick/slash. The graphics, characters and bosses are just so awesome and you can feel the grittiness of the mechs. Aside from the awesome game play, the environments and atmosphere has really leveled up.

      "TL;DR - 80-90s retro fun. Will prove you wrong if you think FMV games couldn't ever be good. Check out 5 seconds of playthrough if unsure.\nNOTE: Story isn't written in this review as game is reliant on mysterious plot. \n\n　　　For those unfamiliar, FMV stands for full motion video where you are playing a game that is based primarily/largely on the usage of pre-recorded video clips. Though it is no longer a frequented genre in video gaming, during the 90s, FMV games on CDs would often lead me into the darkened halls of many a thrilling Sherlockian mystery adventure. Unfortunately the majority of FMV games were downright awful. Pre-recorded videos with a small quantity of scenes by actual actors caused the a gaming experience to feel boxed in. Astoundingly, Her Story does the exact opposite while still being as classically FMV as FMV games go. It displays FMV like a shield of pride with the added old school touches being tasteful to a tee. As the game is \"turned on\", the screen whirring into action like any early 90s PC would, making the familiar creaking and croaking, players are introduced to their in-game desktop. The thick 90s computer monitor flares a little and in its reflection can be seen the old tube shaped fluorescent lamps that were common fixtures in most public buildings back then, flickering and popping from time to time. It is like playing a game in the past without the annoying performance issues. [spoiler]The glare on screen where you can see a better reflection towards the end made me jump a little here and there. It is fabulous as a \"moodsetter\" like many of the other suppositious yet important details that worked towards the game's impressive little plot.[/spoiler] In addition to the other details, the background music between searches where players are looking at the desktop felt like a good touch and appropriate in terms of guiding players (reacts to clips/progress etc). There is such an abundance of both subsidiary and essential detail in this game that I'd be happy with the mere nostalgia prompting ambiance. It is an added bonus, which isn't too recurrent in indie games these days where there is a deficiency in either style or story, that makes Her Story such a good FMV. It differs because players can feel as if they are in control as every person works towards the ending down a differing path depending on how they decide to investigate which is conducted solely by which searches are brought up how and when. The secret to any game that lacks the variety and freedom of choice by \"genre default\", is to give the player as much control as possible within the walls of that rigid reality. Within the uncomplicated, search - watch - find clues - check Db repertoire, players are given room to stretch and investigate on their own. The mastery is in the details so it is crucial to pay attention. Everything is told methodically and the acting that seems off in places makes much more sense once you piece the evidence and videos together. You are the \"detective\".\n\n　　　This superlative story told through proficient acting by the talented Viva Seifert (also musician/former British gymnast) weaves a surprisingly thick plot into a very lugubrious tale and the eerie horrors of the truth become more evident the more you unveil. The \"wifey killed him\" synopsis we are inclined to linger on in theory is not as discernible in-game as you'd imagine and it'll keep you guessing and alarm you at several progression points. It'll make your thoughts run wild but mostly you'll be wrong with those assumptions until you get the whole picture, as in as close to 100% off the clips as you can. The short clips have a role in that you're piecing together a very large puzzle. The splintered pieces of a total 7 interviews leaving you with 271 videos spanning between mere seconds to a couple of minutes will feel jumbled up so receiving the story in abstruse titbits as such makes you feel like your own little Jessica Fletcher and adds to the anticipation of piecing everything together. If possible I imagine it would be a fun \"couch co-op\" game for an afternoon in with a friend/SO taking notes and guessing the story together (plot contains mature content). \n\n[i]Other interesting things[/i]:\n- Doesn't stop running while you do other things so you can open up your notepad and type there if you'd rather that over pen and paper\n- Search history is helpful. Anti-Glare Filter is a nice touch. Yellow subtitles are very British. \n- The odd title is actually fittingly chosen\n- Database Checker on your desktop screen will display the overall progress you make, creating a timeline for your discoveries so investigation will be smoother\n- Each keyword brings up 5 clips at most (excluding default keyword*). Keep a list of words that stick out in clips and if you get too stuck, use default keyword to bring up whole Db\n\n*[i]Default keyword:[/i] [spoiler]BLANK[/spoiler] Using the default is not optimal. Uncovering new snippets in turn revealing new clues/plots urging you to solve the case yourself is most of the fun.\n\n[b]TIP[/b]: All clips found will have the default keyword in its details. I assigned a number for every new top she wore. Examples: [spoiler]BLANK5, BLANK1 etc..[/spoiler]. An easier method is just deleting the whole keyword for each clip watched, never to return. ;)\n\n　　　Though the sweet yet unnerving finale didn't feel as inspired, the wrap up was still nicely done. People who are new to FMV games may find it harder to get into, but it has a good depth of story to tell for the short game (3-4 hrs) that it is and I recommend it to people who enjoy a good tale. Chances are it's either going to feel like something new and interesting or old school and nostalgic. \n\n[i]Bought game on dev's site: $4.99 (Steam key + DRM free version).[/i]",
      "What a refreshing experience, returning to Ishimura yet again, but with a nice new coat of paint!\nAfter so many years, we finally got a \"new\" Dead Space game, and surprisingly, they actually delivered! \n\nThere are some differences in story and other details, but honestly I think it was all tastefully done.\nThe gameplay borrows from the games after Dead Space 1, like being able to TK enemies with spikes and their claws properly, along with stomping for loot!\n\nThere are also some new differences, like new side missions for extra story, and being able to return and explore areas you have previously been to, which I think was a wonderful addition.\n\nThere were a few small issues occasionally, I imagine with time these may be touched upon, but mainly it was fps hitching when loading new areas sometimes, and very rare crashes (I crashed twice through the entire playthrough)\n\nOtherwise I kept a stable fps for most of the game on Ultra settings, and didn't really experience any other issues (RTX 2080)\n\nIt really was just overall a great singleplayer experience for one of my favorite franchises, and I hope this will do well enough, so we can see more Dead Space in the near future from now on! \n\nGreat game, beautiful visuals, and wonderful experience, for any Dead Space fan. \n\n(Also small side note, you receive the original Dead Space (2008) suit upon visiting your stores inventory, which is a very welcoming surprise!

      "[i]While the artwork and combat remain enjoyable, the story, writing, and pacing were a major letdown.[/i]  \n\n***\nMINOR SPOILERS BELOW.

In Banner Saga 2, Fosolt is unexpectedly rescued by Bolverk. [i]\"I have a message for Alette from the dead varl king,\" [/i]he said. That's pretty intriuging! Maybe there's a mystery, an oracle, an item, or just cool information about the Varl and their strange king? Maybe there'll finally be context about the bridge decision!\n\n[i]No! He has nothing interesting to say or add, and then his storyline just gets dropped and forgotten.[/i]\n\nWell, Bolverk's been possessed by Bellower! Gosh, who knows what Bellower will say? In fact, I can't wait to find out what happens to Bellower's body! \n\nWell, actually, Bolver's [i]not[/i] possessed, not really, certainly not like it was implied last game, and Bellower's body -- [i]a primary focus of the first two games[/i] -- isn't mentioned [i]once[/i]\n\nOr how about how they casually mention that Eyvyn is not only the [i]head[/i] of the Valka order, but also that he's had periodic bursts of hereditary madness all along? That's... odd. And it's not presented as an well-thought out [i]reveal[/i] or anything. It's presented matter-of-factly, like they were trying to ret-con in a less interesting story, or were tone deaf.\n\nYou'll notice that all the characters are underutilized and have unfulfilled storylines/tensions. Hakon has hard choices to make; Canary's a little crazy; Yrsa is mysterious; Gil's in love with Alette, etc. Will these build into choices? Reveals? Dependent endings based on choices? Will there be discussions referencing the past? Reflections on travels? Hints of despair?\n\nNo. In mine, Gil was [i]murdered[/i] and no one even bothered to reference it. Canary's situation never comes to a head. You never have to choose between Varls and Humans. Murdering people doesn't make people threaten to leave. Ubin returns randomly as an uber Varl and he's... learned the horseborne's language? Travelled the southlands? In like, a month? In a way that doesn't advance the plot? It's just... weakly done.\n\n\nThere are [i]so many[/i] examples like this, where the stories don't quite fit correctly, where what you picked up on in the early games about the [i]mysteries[/i] and the [i]world[/i] and what made it a [i]vibrant[/i] place were forgotten about by the writers. [b]The result is that it the game plays out in unsatisfying ways, in tenseless scenarios made vapid by watered-down morality, an inability to leverage the situation in fun ways, and low-quality writing, paucity of choice-making, a lack of exploration, lack of plot twists, simplified overworld mechanics -- all culminating in an almost staggeringly one-dimensional and shallow ending.[/b]\n\nThe Banner Saga series was always an experience that was greater than the sum of its part. An [i]experience[/i]. Of being [i]riveted[/i] to the computer, checking the map, worrying over supplies, guessing at mysteries, having my breath taken away at each hill. Unfortunately, that's not the case in this game. \n\n\nGameplay-wise, it's also a bit of a letdown. Combat is fun-ish, but you can make invincible character combinations and the mechanics don't even try to deal with this. There's an interesting new reinforcement mechanic that's not used heavily, and never pushes you like you think the end of the world would. You never really have to split up your forces. There's no novelty. Like maybe using a hero in a battle makes them fatigued, so you have to switch them up? Maybe you can station them different places, making them unusable for combat? Maybe you need to choose eight for a secret mission caravan? Maybe dream sequences? No, nothing like that. \n\nThe overworld gameplay had some changes that never really felt significant. Moreover, quite a bit felt taken away. You can't rest, do training missions, no longer weigh food vs upgrades. One example of all thise tone deafness was Iver's march through the destroyed world was consistently at \"Great Morale!\"\n\nThere didn't seem to be many flavor choices (\"Do we hang the criminals or let them join us?\"), including much less on social themes (\"Should women fight, if it disturbs the traditionally-minded men?\" \"One clan's rowdy, what do we do?\" \"They threaten to leave if so and so isn't banished\"), and less delayed results and fewer significant decisions, including among the game's built-up tensions among the factions. \n\n\nThere's also some cases of development [i]feeling[/i] cheap. Remember opening Banner Saga 2, and feeling that it was [i]fresh[/i], and [i]upgraded[/i]? There's little to make you feel that way here. The artwork is okay, but the environments feel more generic, with less variety, and the surreal landscapes in the darkness aren't especially interesting to look at for long periods of time. Iver is voiced by Bolverk's voice actor, and they sound exactly the same. The new title system is a fun idea, but is visually integrated into the game's menu system with the finesse of a cheap mod. \n\nThere's a moment in the game where the screen goes black for scrolling text and voiceover narration explaining the upcoming mechanic. Um, a character can't explain that? It was similar how the many two second animations are used, not to supplement the story, but to [i]replace[/i] written portions, making you feel unsure about what's going on. And finally, the game's pretty short, without fun combat challenges or interesting newgame+ challenges. \n\n\nWhat's [i]particularly[/i] frustrating is that the game's release date was moved forward four months. I don't know the story why, but I do know that a few more months of polish and story embellishment might have delivered the beautiful, grippingly interactive story we were hoping for. Because this is a watered down version of the previous two in just about every way.\n\nThis negative review is for whatever processes lead to this mediocre finale.\n\n---\n\n[i]Here's a plot that would have made more sense. Zephyr arrives and speaks to you secretly. There's a god that's still alive! Neat, now we'll finally get more story on that. Yay, fun caravan mode, now we need to take longships somewhere interesting!\n\nBut uh-oh! There's a Sundr villain going there as well, with an army of dredge! But at least now we'll finally get more story about the Sundr! \n\nThe god reveals something interesting, talks about Juno, the sun, gives a means to protect the city and help Iver. But when you return to the city, now the king and rugga and the factions have devolved into fighting based on your choices. How are you going to handle this? Which of many possibilities will ascend to the throne? How will you defend the city? And what mystery lies beneath the mountain of the city...\n\nFor Iver's caravan, there should be pockets of dredge villages kept alive by Spellsingers. Now you need to decide to plunder them or not! More stuff to do! Maybe go to the remains of the Varl capital first? Fight warped Valka? Realize deceptions, machinations, corruption, hear stories? Find new characters, have old ones die?\n\nInstead there... wasn't a plot?[/i]",

That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.\n\nI liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters.

      "Emily is Away Too is the sequel to Emily is Away.\n\nThe first game, which was free to play, was absolutely fantastic, especially because of its finale: [spoiler] no matter what you felt or what you wanted to do, your choices would always bring the same conclusion of you unable to say to Emily that you wanted to be more than friends, and her spending the summer with her boyfriend. [/spoiler]\nBut that was not because of \"lazyness\" by the developer: it was intentional, and in fact, towards the end of the game, [spoiler] even if you try expressing your feelings your character would delete what you wanted to say replacing the messages with generic questions [/spoiler] . In my opinion, the intention was to deliver the message that [spoiler] sometimes in life, especially when dealing with relationships with other people, there is simply nothing you can do except accepting other people's choices and move on [/spoiler] .\nIt was a very powerful ending that left me thinking about it for days after finishing the game, even if it was a short experience.\n\nUnfortunately, while playing this game I did not feel the same, powerful emotions that I did with the first one. This is because the game features several different endings, this time with two girls instead of just Emily, which isn't a bad thing per se, but it contrasts with the power of the message of the first one. Moreover, here [spoiler] you can actually achieve not one, but several \"good\" endings [/spoiler] .\n\nI liked the integration with your desktop and browser, plus the many different references to artists, TV shows and movies from 10 years ago.\nThere are still some \"twists\" present here, and if you make certain choices you will encounter situations similar to what you do in the first game, but as I said, I feel that they are not as effective as the original game.\n\nThat does not mean this is a bad game by any means: I would still recommend it, especially for its low price, but make sure to download and play the previous one first. It's free, too!\n\nRating: 7.0/10",
      "If you somehow don't know what this is: It's a meta-narrative focused walking sim with a funny narrator. Only you know if that kind of thing sounds like a good time to you.\n\nSubtract about 26 hours from my playtime because I'm a lunatic who left the game running for a whole day to get a silly achievement.\n\nI loved the HD remix (never played the og mod), and I really liked this one too, but I will say that a lot of the commentary the original offered doesn't hit as hard or hold up as well almost a decade later, just because the narrative structure and how narrative is tied to gameplay of many story-driven games has changed in that time (because of course it has), as well as the mindset of a lot of players being different. So I think that it's worth keeping in mind the cultural moment the original was made during... if you're the thinky type who likes to overthink things. You massive nerd.\n\nStill, it felt nice to jump back in and spend a little more time with the narrator, and there were some legitimately striking moments in the new content that I found to be quite powerful and engaging. Overall, though, having played the original, getting all the new stuff (and revisiting the old) felt a lot more like checking off a to-do list than active exploration teasing at the boundaries of the game and it's layout than the first one.",

      "Playing this game for the first time six years after its initial release proved to be a delight in disguise. With all the memes and jokes established, I was finally able to understand what the fuss was all about back in 2011. Despite not having the best gameplay, story or graphics out there, something about this title just made me want to finish every quest I deemed worth completing. \n\n9/10 - mods recommended",
      "This is mostly a worse version of the much better \"Slay the Spire\". Slightly different gameplay (Inscryption has a 'field' and some very limited mechanics from Gwent-like games), but both are deck builders with card alteration and deck probability as a core mechanic. Really expected better from the reviews and a demo that promised more gameplay aspects than seem forthcoming. Not an awful game, and has potential, but it feels like they took a basic card game and never bothered to balance it or build better guidelines for the randomized encounters. \n\nPros\n-Atmosphere is decent\n-Gameplay core is fine and could have promise but is highly random. \n-The 'scale' system works well in concept - winner must be X damage points above the opponent, not a set amount of life. X is too small.\n\nCons\n-'Roguelike' aspects are minimal so far. Even as I get more familiar with gameplay my runs are as likely to end on the first or second map. Grinding the same level doesn't get you anywhere in terms of improvements, since the end game 'summary' is determined by random cards you obtained during your run... which can be very poor. Even then, these seldom show up on future runs in my experience.\n-Few ways to guarantee what cards/powerups you get if you want to focus on any specific type of build. Additionally certain paths are OP, while others are next to worthless. With STS there are far more viable builds, and while some are better than others, most times you could construct one to get you far.\n-Powerups sometimes do nothing (e.g., Instant kill on a card with zero attack is... worthless, but if you add 1 attack it suddenly works), and sometimes create amazing combos.\n-Highly variable battles, often hinging on 1 turn or card draw. Get your top card first? Battle is won. Keep drawing the wrong 'fuel' (card summoning) source? You've lost. Sometimes you'll get 1-2 cards that are a permanent squirrel card, other times you'll need to spend a 1-2 draw actions to even summon a card.\n-Overall atmosphere is interesting, but highly limited and very repetitive. Narrative only changes when you advance and isn't skipable so spending 1 minute each death doing the same death sequence 5 times in a row ruins it. \n-You can't just quit a run. Also the stupid UI that has you click + drag to use the menu system. \n-The room, which functions as your 'rogue-like' element is limited, and once explored is dull. Late 90's graphics, low light. Puzzles are mostly bound by gameplay and even completing a puzzle and adding a card to the pool of possible draws isn't that useful. \n\nThe game needs more features to allow for 'controlled randomness' (e.g., lock certain starting cards for each run, set a preferred powerups/creature type, start encounters with +1-2 cards in hand, expand # of result possibilities, better 'rarity' parity), better permanent powerups (expand past # of \"helper items\" that can be held), scale needs to be larger (once you get the right set-up the game is over the next turn, conversely some scenarios the computer can 'rush' you and a match is over by turn 3-4). Possibly expand # of slots for cards and allow player to have 2 rows, like AI does - would also allow certain powers to be more interesting.",

      "it's a shame but i honestly cannot recommend this game if you are a disabled person, i wasn't that far into the game when my character started panicking apon seeing a disabled person [person with leg braces] and then gets a \"no good answer\" bit of dialog and all the options are saying something wrong or saying nothing, trying to go with the least bad option aside from saying nothing since i know as a disabled person myself [i'm a wheelchair user] it can be pretty upsetting getting people just randomly stare at me and at least when they say something slightly wrong they are engaging with me as a person, my character then proceeds to talk abt what an \"inspiration\" it is 2 c a disabled person living their life,,, not exaggerating when i say i let my head hit the desk, closed the game and uninstalled, i understand that this is probably put in the game to be a teachable moment for the able bodied audience but ironically in trying to educate about us disabled people they then made the assumption that no disabled people would be playing their game as there is no option to make your character disabled or even to make them remotely aware of disability and ended up just making the experience awful for the disabled gamers they seem to be trying to help",
      "100%'ed the LUCT version of the game and I'm slowly working my way through this version now.\n\nOver all the game itself is solid. If you're reading this, its a brilliant tactics game that helped define the genre. However most of the changes they made in reborn, while innovative, ultimately feel constraining. \n\nFor example, they've limited spell slots to 4, so you can only ever take 4 different spells. One or two of which (missile + indirect) are taken by a damage spell of your choice, leaving you with even less spell customization than you'd think. And its unfortunately the same situation with skills, as one will always be taken up by your weapon skill. \n\nThe cards that drop in battle, while an interesting system on paper, just end up cluttering the field most of the time, often with auto-skill activation up, which most of your units won't even really want compared to the other options. \n\nRandom battles were also removed, limiting chances to recruit to a few key dungeons as well as removing some of the more amusing battle locations from the game. \n\nI've also seen some people complain about the level cap, but in my current play-though of the game, it isn't too much of a concern for me, but it may be for others. \n\nOver all, it just feels like they've taken a step back from what Tactics ogre: Let us cling together, gave us. Yes there's bloat in that version, but it also gave us a feeling of freedom when we were putting our teams together that this version lacks. I am grateful that we saw a remake of this game within my lifetime, but I wish they had improved on Luct, rather than take steps back from it. \n\nIf they ever increase the amount of spells and/or skills you can take, to like 6-8, then I'd probably switch my review to a yes. But until then, with a heavy heart I have to say that this version just isn't as good as Luct so far.",

I love the story line and everything eles they did with the game, BUT the MAIN problem i have with this is that even with my game pad I had to install another app so that I can use the dame pad. The game couldn't completly figure out my game pad buttons on it's own and I had to re-set every button and it's a pain in the a$$. There's a MAJOR learning curve if you think you can use the keyboard, plus I highly doubt you can hit every single button at the exact time you need to press it. If your getting this in a console then thats awesome. But I don't recommend getting this from steam and playing in your Pc. If only they had figure out the controls then I would have given 10/10. So sad.",
      "There is no skill requirement to play this game; everything seems pretty randomized including when and where the demon attacks you. Its rather difficult to play alone or just with two players.

      "In 2013, after 10 years of waiting, the Sim City community of modders, fans, and aficionados rushed out to purchase the fifth installment of Sim City. Ten years is a long time to wait for a game, but people had a lot of faith in Maxis when they announced the title. Long story short, it was a massive dissapointment. Maxis and EA crippled Sim City 5 with DRM, Always On APM, tiny maps, forced origin installation, lacking mod support, no steam support, and a forced multiplayer aspect.  I decided to not purchase the title, so it may have been a decent game, but 2 years later a team of 12 people created a game that does everything maxis insisted was utterly and totaly impossible.  \n\nEverything the mod community did that kept Sim City 4 on the shelves in Wallmarts across America for an entire decade was ignored. Maxis (and to a lesser extent EA) ignored the fans, and gave the people who had kept them in business for twenty years a crippled subpar game.  And for that Maxis is now out of business. They will never make another game, and it is no one's fault but theirs.\n\nNow pretend none of that happened. It's 2013 again, and here it is people: Sim City 5. \n\nThe game balance is a bit on the easy side for veterans of the genre, but the potential map size is ENOURMOUS and customizing your city could fill up years of gameplay time.  The game runs so smoothly with so much going on, it really shows how lazy Maxis was with their approach.  The glass in buildings reflects the sun and the buildings near it, there are dynamic shadows, zoning is back, and it is not 'dumbed down'.  A single tile in this game is twice the size of the alloted map in Sim City, and you can purchase dozens of additional tiles to expand.  The map editor is awesome, the community is thriving, there are mods to do anything you want, and this is the city building game we've all been waiting for.  I can not possibly reccomend this more.",
      "An okay game that wastes your time.\n\n\nI played on the hardest difficulty. For me there was a pretty big difficulty spike somewhere in chapter 6 or 7. Apparently I had been skipping on the battles earlier on and was a bit too low level. No problem, I had just unlocked skill trees for the characters, so some XP spending made things manageable. I had to try the map a few times, but once I downed a few mobs and gained some levels, all was going well. The objective was to kill all the enemies by certain time, and that's what I aimed to do. Except, once I'd killed all the enemies, the objective changed and I would've needed to trudge to the other side of the map and kill the boss as well. Yeah, fuck that.\n\n\nThe combat works round-by-round in speed order. If your characters go faster than the enemies, you can simply spam AoE attacks and kill droves of them before they go. If enemies are faster, you're kind of screwed because they hit hard, you're on the defensive, have to spend turns healing and cannot attack that much. And levels seem to make a huge difference here. Combat seems sort of poorly balanced in this respect; maps are hard at the beginning, but by the end just a joke because you gained a few points of speed and are now overall faster and can spam AoE attack and kill enemies in droves.\n\nThe user interface and usability is pretty archaic. For example, to get out of a menu you have to explicitly click on the button that says \"back\" instead of just clicking a right mouse button or Esc or whatever.\n\nThe writing was quite funny at times. It also seemed of a mixed quality. A lot of times it seemed clearly aimed at 13-year olds.  (Especially cringey are the first pair of \"combat helpers\" you get.) I also did play the game for a lot longer at once than I usually do. I think there's some kind of magical simplicity about it, and it's fun to play.\n\nIt's just, in general, the one thing I dislike the most is doing again the exact same thing that I just did. That's the developers' way of saying \"fuck you\" to me, and so I don't want to play this game anymore. If you don't mind that, and the game looks like something you'd like, then I don't doubt you'll like it. Don't get it for 20 moneys though. 15, perhaps... 10 yeah, sure. Because reading the reviews, the one thing many agree on is the later you get the more garbage the combat gets. So, in essence, you only have the visual novel aspect. And if you're not 13 anymore, I don't know. Play something else perhaps.",
      "This is a game that I have been looking forward to for at least 2 and a half years. I have wanted to have a game on the PC that had the elements of harvest moon (for the little bit I played of it), Animal crossing (<3) and Rune factory. I was super excited when I was approached by Leth (publishing manager at Chucklefish) at the beginning of December to help him and ConcernedApe (developer of the game) with bug testing and QA. 400+ hours later (off steam and on steam), I still love the game. \n\n[b]Farming.[/b] The farming is fantastic. It is to me one of the main elements of the game, and it's just a joy. Being able to design your farm any way you want it... yes please. Planning out what to buy every season, where to plant them, on top of the thrill of when you can harvest and reap on the gold... it's so enjoyable and addictive. \n\n[b]Fishing.[/b] The fishing is outstanding. From playing WoW and Runescape.. or any game with fishing, the fishing in Stardew Valley is so much fun. At first, the fishing is challenging, but as you progress your skill, you become a pro in no time.\n\n[b]Mining and combat.[/b] Mining and combat is incredible. Going deeper into the mines can be tough, but if you're prepared with your food and weapon in hand, you can fend off the creatures and get your sweet ore/minerals/gems that you want to bring back to your house and possibly hoard. (Hi, I'm Bexy, and i'm a hoarder.) \n\n[b]Social.[/b] Social interactions are great. Being able to become friends with the people in the town,  and eventually being able to get into relationships with people and having a family with them.. what's not to like about that? And what's great is that it gives great replayability because you can have different saves with different spouses! The backstory for each of the characters too is so in depth and well thought out, you will be silly if you don't shed a tear maybe once or twice. \n\n[b]Main story.[/b] The actual main story is well rewarding, and once you \"complete\" it, you can still continue on your adventures and farming life with no problems, hell you might even discover new things afterwards, I sure as hell did! \n\nYes, I was a tester for the game. Yes, I have played for ridiculous amounts of hours. It may feel like i'm being a bit overzealous with this. However you have to remember, I was a tester. I tested the crap out of every aspect with this game, even though there were massive game breaking bugs, errors, glitches, crashes. I still love this game. I reported many a bug, and ConcernedApe was quick to fix them. \n\nAnd that's the thing, not only is the game amazing, the developer is too. ConcernedApe works around the clock to make sure that bugs are fixed in quick time in order for us to have an amazing experience with this game. And that's true. The experience that you have with this game IS amazing. \n\nMinutes playing turn into hours. Hours turn into \"oh no it's time to sleep\".\nYou will forget about time. You will forget about sleep. You will forget that dinner was about 5 hours ago but you couldn't' remember because you were too busy trying to fight off 12 bats that were clobbering you inside the mines while trying to gather that 1 diamond waaaaay in the back. \n\nSo yes, I without a shadow of a doubt 150% recommend this game to anyone that wants to \"escape\" for days on end with what I am classifying as my #1 Game of 2016.",
      "Loved the original, and this updated version is just as good.\n\nThe additions along the way are very nice, and the improved graphics are noticeable. \nBeing able to converse with your partners whenever you want is also amazing.\n\nHowever...\n\nWas disappointed to have a few areas and puzzles removed. Since those were the more difficult parts of the original game, I assume this was done for a more streamlined experience. \nInstead of your flower wilting to represent your life, it is now replaced by more accurate \"points\". Although this makes it easier to tell exactly how many hits you can take, I miss the more original old design.\nAn iconic music track was also changed, likely due to licensing issues...\n \nCan't completely replace the original for me, but it's still a very worthwhile experience! \nStill wishing for a sequel a decade later.",
      "I only just found out about this game when it released. Saw a few videos and had to get it.\n\nI'm a musician, and instructor. Have been playin music for most my life and this game kicked my butt. \n\nThere's parts of each level that groove and feel \"right\" while a lot of the rest of the level doesn't seem to fit with the tempo/time signature, (each level number represents it's time signature). It frustrated me a LOT. I felt like the devs put in those groove sections to make it seem like a rhythm game but most the filler was just an out of time mess.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nThe more you learn about the mechanics, which are actually fairly complex for one button and stick, the more you'll apreciate how finely tuned this game is. So, a lot of the patterns don't exactly groove like typical rhythm games, but once you start feeling how all the more advanced scoring mechanics work together, you'll start feeling the music in really interesting ways.  It's hard to explain, haha.\n\nYes.... your thumbs will get sore playing this, like... seriously. But man.... when you nail sections and feel how it all fits together there's no comparison to how awesome it makes you feel.  \n\nThere's PLENTY of replay that can be had in this, plus the music will stick with you and make you want to play more just to hear it again.\n\nIt's worth the price.",
      "I have not play for long, but know well enough this game deserves a mention. A side on, survival-ish game set in a war. Now, While I admire this game, it does have a few issues I personally find abnoxious.\nI'll start with those, and then will share what I like about it.\n\n-Characters you play seem to have never stolen anything at all from anyone, ever during the war. This is reflected in how unhappy and whiney they become caring more about the people they have taken from than their own wellbeing.\n\n-Characters you play are too softhearted. Just use the example with the point above. \n\n-Characters are expert carfters for being just average people. How many average people know how to pick locks, make servicable firearms and make alcoholic beverages? Well these three certain are capable of all three and more. For that matter, they all can do everything, but have one special skill they are the better at than the rest.\n\n-You get to only visit one building per night. This is bad since if you chose a building with other survivors in it, you will either need to steal from them to get supplies and be faced with a lot of unhappy complaining, or return home with nothing.\n\n-Visting other survivors, you cannot negotiate with them let alone talk to them. What you can do is beat them to death (or kill them with whatever weapon you happen to have on you at the time). I don't see how this was a good design choice at all when the characters you play are not personally that sort of people. Attacking other survivors is certain to cause problems with your characters.\n\n-You can not relocate from your starting place. What you start with is your base of operations.\n\n-Raids happen frequently to you only. You will never kill raiders, only chase them off and this happens behind the scenes, out of your control, while your character is out scavanging.\n\n-You can not sleep in shifts. If a person sleeps, they sleep the whole night.\n\n-Rediculous resource requirements. Some things require far too much, while others require far too little. \n\n-There is little to none interaction between your characters. No idle chatter between them. \n\n\nNow for the good points.\n-You play 3 characters to begin with, each having one specialty. They somewhat have different personalities.\n\n-The art style appeals to me.\n\n-Characters are well animated. Different staes of tiredness, different things they do when unhappy or when they have nothing else to do.\n\n-The overall idea, even though it isn't implemented well enough.\n\n-Building your shelter from ground up.\n\n-Forgaing and stealth play.\n\n\nSo while i find some issues with this game's design, if you ignore the lack of realism and consider this to be just a game with a very narrow play style, it is quite fine. It has a certain atmosphere you generally don't find elsewhere. I still recommend to give it a try.",
      "Dandara is inspired by a legendary warrior who fought slavery in Brazil in the 17th Century. The similarities, however, seems to stop at the name and the fact that she is a black woman fighting a vague concept referred in the game as \"opression\". \nThe game mechanics are very unusual as you can`t really move back and forth and the art style is often charming, although sometimes it gets really generic with some enemies  inspired by Egyptian culture (I thought it was supposed to be about Brazil). The difficulty escalates quite suddenly at certain points in the game, and the fact that you have to be standing still at all times to attack your enemies is pretty frustrating. After you get used to the movement in the game, it is quite fun to jump around without the frustration of having to walk slowly through a huge map as you do in some games of the genre, especially before getting upgrades that allow you to teleport or move faster.\n The story and dialogues could also have been polished a little more. Everything is very vague making it feel a little bit like a waste of an interesting idea. Dandara is a little rough around the edges, but  pretty unique for a metroidvania style game. Worth checking out.",
      "If you like management type games and RPGs, this is the perfect mix. It's just enough management to allow you to thrive with mostly strategy without feeling bogged down, and just enough RPG elements to get you invested in not just your squad, but each individual character in it. \n\nHere's a tale from my experience with the game;\n\nThis is the kind of game to change your entire perspective on life itself. Failure is not the end, nor the beginning, but a constant in this world that you can either let destroy you or make you stronger. Allow me to tell you a story. The story of New Battlehill. \nNear the Shek city of Squin, not far east, was a small town. It went through many names. The first that stuck was Firstyeet, totally not a placeholder. It wasn't an notable settlement, merely consisting of a shack, an iron processor, and some walls to mildly inconvenience the roving gangs of Dust Bandits that liked to bully the residents. After being evicted from their own city once again, the residents, Denver, Soto, Ruka, and Meow, vowed to take back their home. After training and buying the best weapons and armor they could, they made their way back to Firstyeet. To their surprise, however, they would not have to fight. One of the bandits had picked a fight with a herd of goats. The bandits' defense failed against the caprine assault. From this, the town would get its second name - Densorumego. Den for Denver. So for Soto. Ru for Ruka. Me for Meow. And Go for the true heroes, the goats.\nPeace would not last long but soon the residents of Densorumego would become strengthened by their constant fighting. On the elevated, somewhat round land on which Densorumego sat, there were many large fights involving a lot of people. If only there was some sort of name to reflect this... \nAnd from that, the town was renamed for the last time, to Battlehill.\nThings were looking up. The town built its first farms and expanded to be almost four times its original size. But this peace would not last. Battlehill's new ambitions of self sufficiency would attract the attention of a new foe - The Shek Kingdom.\nThe Shek claimed ownership of the land Battlehill was on, and as such, demanded all food grown there be given to them. Confident from their many victories against the Dust Bandits, the Battlehillites refused the Shek demands. Their risk was calculated... but man were they bad at math.\nAll but one were nearly killed in the ensuing battle, and the one person that wasn't knocked into a coma was stuck on the wall because part of the wall was destroyed and he could no longer reach the stairs because of that. The people knew they couldn't fight the Shek, but they would not allow themselves to be subservient either. And so began their malicious compliance. The Shek would get all the food in Battlehill, as it would be none - The Battlehillites were moving.\nI could write entire books about their journey around the west. The Fogmen, the ruins, the Screeching Bandits, there's many a tale. But, eventually, the people would find a new home. In the harsh and Beak Thing infested land of Vain, homeland of the Western Hive, they would found their new home - New Battlehill.\nJump to now, the city is thriving, they have more bread than they know what to do with, they've grown strong from defending their home from the Beak Things, and their population has grown. They are currently planning a reconquest of Battlehill, which was occupied by Dust Bandits shortly after they left.\n\nThere is a part I left out, between Firstyeet and Densorumego - I had repeatedly failed to retake Firstyeet, and I was about to quit the game. I was frustrated that I'd gone and bought the best arms and armor and still failed. And when I tried to set up a training ground on a mountain near Squin, bandits again came and defeated me. I went as far as to try and get a refund, which was denied. That refund being denied was the best thing that could've happened. I decided to give the game another try, and to try accepting my failures and growing from them. And if I hadn't done that, I would never have founded New Battlehill. None of the legend worthy tales my squad has been through would have happened. And I'd never have had the fun of going through all of them.\n\nIn short, get this game. It is just great.",
      "Amazing game that I love to play, but the boyfriend that I was playing it with broke up with me a few days after playing this game. A game that's about fixing your relationship.\n10/10 game.\n0/10 in my heart.\n\nedit: why do people find this funny i wasn't kidding\n\nEdit # 2: It has been 7 months since I had originally played this game. What was originally a game of heartbreak and painful memories, I had managed to find it someone new to play with. While this game had terrible memories, I had decided that a game such as this was undeserving of them, and thus created new memories with another special person in my life.\n\nThe game is remarkable, with good writing, and amazing gameplay, and it is deserving of the buy. Each level is crafted with amazing detail, and all of the mini-games are just as fun as the main game itself. Don't let bad memories keep you down, and instead create happier ones. Live your life, ya'll.",
      "How the hell did I not hear about this until the very end of 2021?\n\nA beautiful blend of all your favourite action-adventures: Your Zeldas, Metroidvanias, Dark Souls, Megamans (more Zero/ZX), Features local/steam play-together co-op. \n\nThe OST also slaps. I don't expect very moody noir piano in my dystopian cybernetic future but here we are.",
      "I normally hate \"retro\" platformers, I never liked Mega Man, only Mega Man X, didn't care much for Shovel Knight but loved Hollow Knight, things like that. The Messenger IS a platformer, even though the second part of the game makes it less linear, and I loved it.\n\nDevs could take a lot of notes here - checkpoints are frequent, boss fights are short and creative and you don't have to go through 2 easy phases to retry a hard 3rd phase, most rooms and even most trick rooms have multiple ways to approach them given your fairly simple moveset. You never have to do anything pixel-perfect to get through but doing things well is massively rewarding. It constantly surprised you with new things but doesn't overstay anything, and completely foreign mechanics introduced are not punishing (Skylands, for example).\n\nA lot of people comment on how great the writing is, and well... it is great. It's sparse but fantastic throughout, with more personality in what amounts to a few pages than most games can give with 10 times as many words (and lore pickups).\n\nFor reference, I completed it with all the challenge collectibles in 14.5 hours, but did not get all achievements nor go through NG+. It is well paced and hard to put down, but easy enough to play in chunks, and I felt like I was learning new tricks up through the end of the game.\n\nDo the thing!",
      "If you're a STAR RAIDERS fan, look elsewhere, it's broken.\nFirst off, I  think they did a fantastic job on the Star Raiders port,\nthe controls are spot on, it works seamlessly with a controller,\nall the keyboard controls were mapped brilliantly, great job.\n\nBut....\n\nAlthough the NOVICE and PILOT missions work well, those who adorn the game will\nselect WARRIOR or COMMANDER and sadly, these higher levels are broken.\n\nOnce you get down to the remaining 8 enemies or so on the map, the difficulty ramps up to insanity.\nCome out of a warp, get plummeted by 3+ meteors in a row.\nPhotons gone.\nRinse and repeat until you just give up, it's relentless, and I've yet to be able to finish a game on COMMANDER\nlevel because of this.\n\nI've tried all the different speed modes, original, opengl and direct3d, nothing helps, it's broken.\n\nAnother minor gripe is that the \"Destroyed Engines\" mode is just the \"Damaged Engines\" and barely impacts\nyour speed.\n\nI really hope that this is patched, I'll gladly revise the review once it is.\n\nEverything else is great, the arcade ports are fine, the controls are practically 1:1 in the trackball games,\nthey all feel just like the arcade (unlike Atari Vault, cough cough).\n\nThe Jaguar games are a blast, T2K still rules. I would have loved to see AvP, perhaps a future DLC.\n\nBut the main reason I spent $40 was for Star Raiders, one of my all time favorite games, and in it's current\nstate, I feel like I've wasted my money, sadly I spent so much time troubleshooting it, my refund window is gone.\n\nI'd say wait for this on a heavy sale and if you're a die hard Star Raiders fan, don't do it until it's patched!\n\nAnd still no word from the developers on any patches.........you guys out there?!? \n",
      "Think you’re good at racing? Well, this game will give you a RKO.\n\nI don’t even know much about rally when I bought the game. I just see cars driving at dirt, weaving steering left and right constantly, and thought it looks cool. \n\nThis game is HARD. The learning curve is really steep. The first time I played, I constantly fly off a cliff and hug into trees. Because i don’t understand what my co driver is reading. He talk so fast that my tiny brain couldn’t process in time, sometimes I’m so confused that I go straight in junction because I can’t remember he said turn left or right. The cars are constantly out of control. \n\nAfter I learned about weight transfers that I’m able to start utilizing oversteer into corners. No more cripple into finish line with two tyres missing, that’s when the fun begins. Dirt Rally 2.0 is different from other racing games. You don’t race against other drivers, instead you race against time. If you turn off the hud, then it’s only you and the road, and TREES :)\n\nThe sound of the gravel hitting under your car. Dirt stained on your car as you progress through out the stage. The pops and bang coming out of exhaust when you shift. These combination feels somehow relaxing and satisfying at the same time.\n\nThe only downside of Dirt Rally 2.0 is that it requires constant internet connection, even when most of its content are single player. I wouldn’t complain if the server is stable. But sadly it isn’t. The server down happen quite frequently. Imagine you feel like you completed a 10 minutes perfect run, no crashes or mistakes. But then the game refuses to connect to the server. So the game won’t record your progress. It’s like a big middle finger to the player. \n\nI could make this review a thumbs down solely for the “always online” requirement, cuz it makes the player experience kinda inconsistent, but the gameplay itself does make up for it though. I mean when it works, it works remarkably well.\n\nApart from always online issue. Dirt Rally 2.0 is fantastic, the handling, physics, graphics etc. everything is on point. If you’re interested, buy the GOTY edition, it easily double the contents of the original game had. Worth every single cents.",
      "Finally, a video game that is everything televangelists in the 90’s said that video games were. Exactly what my Christian mother would love to catch me playing.\n\nIt’s like Animal Crossing and Doom\nEternal had a son… as was foretold when they released on the same day.\n\nThis game really makes you FEEL like you’re sacrificing your friends to an almighty force. Would I really just sacrifice 5 of my friends  again for some loot chests? I’m a gamer, of course I would.\n\nI fell in love with the aesthetic of this game instantly. It was brilliant when the gameplay held up to those expectations.  \n\nI loved it. I loved the art. The humor. The theme. The premise. The combat. The cult management. Sacrifices. Collecting the bones of my enemies. The juice visual effects. Most of all I loved feeding my followers bowls of poop.\n\nThe combat is fun but definitely not the meat of the game. Building your cult and just upgrading stuff is quite satisfying.  There's some goofy stuff to laugh at and it's quick and responsive. There’s something about the music that makes you feel relaxed and in terrible danger all at the same time.\n\nThis is not a game that you're gonna put 50-100 hours in either.  Which to me is a big plus.  Most of the runs don't take you more than 15 minutes.  So it's an easy game to pick up and play for a bit and jump back in later. It's like Vampire Survivors in that regard.\n\nIt's basically Animal Crossing with a roguelite twist. I could say it's almost original how those elements were combined.\nIt's great entertainment, all around. You could even say the game is bound to become a cult classic…\n\n10/10",
      "I couldnt get past the first fight on the inside of the castle because geralt ust sits there and doesnt do anything. Dodging doesnt do anything if i cant kill ther enemy. The combat is atrocious, doesn't let you fight the way you want to (which is utterly asinine and these three things literally made me quit playing the game permanently in 10 minutes time. However since i want to know the story im just going to watch a lets play of this on youtube.",
      "Two words: Modding Heaven. This is probably one of the most modular games I've ever played. \n\nYou wanna play Mount and Blade in a historical time period instead of Calradia? OK, which one? Don't answer, it doesn't matter, there's probably a mod for it. \n\nWanna add in some magic and play in a fantasy universe? There's mods for that. \n\nHow about a game set in the modern day? Or in a sci-fi universe? Or a post-apocalypse wasteland? Or the Wild West? Or maybe something specific like throwing your hat into the Game of Thrones, or defending the World of Men in Lord of the Rings, or taking over the Empire from Star Wars?\n\nPerhaps you'd like to set sail on the seven seas as a pirate in a nautical adventu-! Oh, wait, OK, there aren't any of -those-. \n\n...but there's mods for all of the others, with even more being made every day! \n\n\nI guarantee, if you buy this and are open to modding your game, you will never go another year without playing Warband. Maybe a week, maybe a few months-- but just when you think you're done with it, you'll find another mod based on your favorite movie series popping up to pull you back in. \n\nIt is worth well above whatever you'll pay for it.\n\n",
      "I definitely would not recommend this. The aesthetic of it might appeal to some people, which is what initially drew me in, but the visual awe wears off after seeing the same scene too many times. The game is best played with paper and pencil in hand so that you waste as little time as possible wandering around in a straight line. \n\nThis game survives off of the mysterious nature of its content in the sense that if people knew how small the experience was, they would not buy it. I was thoroughly let down by this game, especially since its promotional material hyped me up for an exploration game with a unique method of interacting with the world. \n\nThe main feature that sets the game apart from other titles, the use of the telephone to access parts of the static world, becomes little more than a password screen used to pick up where you left off or were booted out of your game by a short time limit. After the first two or three times I used the game's core feature, I was tired of it and wished there was a way to play the game that was faster or had more depth.\n\nFor anyone who has played or seen any amount of gameplay from Yume Nikki, you will realise that this game's design begs the audience to compare the two. However, the most useful comparison to draw between the two is by using the game that Madotsuki can play in her room as an example. In Madotsuki's game, \"Nasu,\" is a joyless game about catching fruit. It is repetitive, intentionally annoying, has no bearing on your progression/success, and is meant to urge you toward doing something else. Unfortunately, this is a suitable comparison, as it succeeded in making me feel like Madotsuki in real life and I want to turn off the game and do almost anything else in record time.\n\nI truly wanted to like this game, but I cannot justify spending $5 for this experience when I played better flash games all the way back in middle school for free.",
      "Basic game, extremely well done. Like going home and eating your mom's food after decades on the road.\n\nEditing the review to mention some of the flaws of the game:\n- the level design in general is not that great, with every tiny room requiring some mindlessly easy puzzle to be solved first. Eventually it just feels like a chore.\n- not sure if it's something with my steam deck, but I had to put both the game's and the screen's brightness to the max to be able to see things; before that I was constantly missing objects and having trouble with moving around because some soil path looked like a hole in the ground or something.\n- while the game is 2d, there's a lot of different layers of height and depth that get mixed in together and may be hard to tell apart. You often don't know if some platform can be climbed onto or jumped out of until you try to do it.\n- battle system gets repetitive after a while.\n\nDespite those problems, the game is still great and more than make up for those things in other areas.",
      "Great game... who need 1 or 2 years of development. tl;dr: mid game turn into a micromanagment hell.\n\nThe game is fantastic until a certain point. You start as a mercenary, one party, 50-150 soldiers doing missions, small battles or bigger fights joining armies. Good graphics, brutal engagments with 200-1000 units at the same time if your computer can handle, playing as a soldier is a blast.\n\nThe problems start when you get a few towns and a bigger family, the micromanagement never stops and gets worse overtime. You have to physically move your party to towns to fix their issues. When your lords get captured & escapes, they'll go into a random town until you pick em again, then you'll have to reform the party. Same with caravanes for trading, if they get captured, you'll have to go in his town and recreate the caravan. You have to partially fill towns with soldiers, manually, from your own soldiers. All the little fun things of the beginning soon become a hassle, as you can't delegate. Messengers are not a thing.\n\nYou can't manage a town at a distance, you can't tell a party member to move to a location or guard a territory, they do whatever they want if they're out of your army / party, so you have to do it yourself. Either you're leading your huge army to fight what is basically an enless war mid game, or you take care of your cities while the rest of your faction fight... with various success. Some commanders are pretty good, other will throw waves of recruits at highly trained arbalists in the open backed with cavalry. Protip: don't be a recruit in an imperial army.\n\nYou can't tell a party you created to guard an area or to kill all bandits attacking your villagers, it's up to you, or the IA if it feel like it. Worst, if you let the parties you created roam around (parties = group of 70-200 soldiers under a lord) they can be (temporarily) drafted in other armies of your kingdom... and you'll have to physically move to the army, talk to the leader and pay some reputation to get them back. Of course, large armies are slow. This leads the the next problem, swarms.\n\nMy worst fear is not a massive army, it's an army disbanded in the middle of my territory. The small parties usually start raiding all villages in the vicinity while being too fast to be catched by a big army. Raided villages impact your town / castle loyalty and gold quite heavily. Sure, you could disband your army and hunt them yourself... but that makes you take a step back, and all your parties would reform under another army you can't control. And man, some army commanders are really, really stupid. Verdun style charge in the open against walls of archers, cavalry in a forest vs pikemens, you name it. I can't count the time i had parties wiped in someone else army. But let's say you managed to capture the lords burning your villages.\n\nThe capture system is broken. Captured lords escape A LOT. I had some escape 20 seconds after being captured. They never stay in a jail for more than a few in game days. Once they escape, they magically teleport to their hometown, rebuild a fast 80 mens army in the blink of an eye and go back to raiding villages. AI \"cheat\" with recruits, they will always find soldiers in town, even if they're empty for you. Executions you say?\n\nIf you execute a lord, no matter how much of an A-hole he/she is, the whole faction will hate you. He raided dozens of villages and killed hundreds of peasants? Still not good enough. You just can't kill a lord without suffering heavy consequences down the line, and you'll need those lords to be friendly later. Worth to mention, capturing the leader of a faction won't stop a war.\n\nLast - peace / war is on/off. I had 600 days of continuous war, followed by 600 days of complete peace in the entire map (due to a bug apparently), and i'm now back at 300 days of war. Not a single day of peace, when one war stop another start immediatly. They will just never, ever stop fighting. Can't catch a breath, can't leave the front of your lose towns.\n\nOh and the main quest randomly failed after 875 days or so.\n\nI would still recommand the game, it's really fun for a while but it need a HUGE QoL update.\n",
      "IRL, I really am an unmotivated 20 year old college student, not many friends, living away from my mom.\nThis is a game that kids might not be able to relate as much as peeps my age.. but Im not saying there's an age restriction or something, no. There's a lot of useful lessons anyone can pick up from this.\n\nThe emotional issues it tackles are pretty grounded and somewhat refreshing to see in a game. There's a HUGE mystery element when it comes to the story. (which is sooo damn good mind you). But the conversations you have with the people in this game are just so real and cherishable, you could just wish these in-game days won't stop. \n\nThe small moments you have with family and friends in Night in the Woods are probably one of the most amazing experiences I ever had in a game\n\nPS: After finishing the story, I got all sappy and tear jerky that I went and called my mom to tell her that I love and miss her and stuff.. that's what this game is.\n\nUgh kill me.

      "I'll preface this by admitting that it makes sense for so many of the \"helpful\" reviews to be negative; it's good to warn customers of a game they won't enjoy, and The Witness definitely isn't for everybody.  That said, this is among my favorite games, and I was looking forward to The Witness for a very long time, so the fact that it lived up to my expectations says a lot.\n\n(You may find it helpful to know my preferences, so here are some of my other favorites: Fez, Portal, Infinifactory, LIMBO, The Beginner's Guide, and of course, Braid.)\n\nAs other reviewers have pointed out, The Witness isn't \"fun\"; that's not a criticism, it's just an accurate observation.  The Witness is treading unfamiliar territory, but only for a video game: most other artistic mediums have been used to explore themes other than \"fun,\" and it makes sense that this medium can be used similarly.\n\nInsofar as objective criteria exist for judging the quality of a video game, The Witness meets every standard I can think of: the game runs smoothly, the team have been timely about patching bugs, the visuals (gorgeous and stylized) and audio (understated and lacking music) are expertly executed, and the design of the world and puzzles is meticulous (and ambitious).\n\nThe only objective drawbacks I can think of are:\n\n1) The absence of an FOV slider (important for those who suffer from motion-sickness), which the developers have hinted may be added in a future update. UPDATE: this has been added, along with some other configuration options.\n\n2) Some of the puzzles are impossible to solve if you're deaf or color-blind.\n\nFrom what I can tell, The Witness is about making your own observations and forming your own theories about how the game mechanics work (the title of the game is relevant to its content); it's partly about solving puzzles, but more so it's about figuring out what the puzzles even are and how they work in the first place; given that, it's easy to see why The Witness fails to provide players with a clear goal or feedback: that would undermine the core of the game.  Patient curiosity is the best mindset with which to approach The Witness; it's like a piece of cloth with a loose thread: you pull it, and it keeps unraveling, and unraveling, and unraveling...\n\nThe intrigue of The Witness stems from constant and subtle revelations about how the game functions, which tend to overturn your previous theories and force you to let go of your presumptions, all without ever jumping the shark.\n\nThe Witness is slow to get rolling, patiently waiting while you adjust yourself to the mechanics and freely allowing you hold on to your false sense of comprehension.  You might expect a game like this to be eager to shove its paradigm-shifting revelations in your face, but it generally isn't: The Witness makes no effort to divulge its secrets, and when you peel back another layer, you can take comfort in the fact that it's a real accomplishment on your part.\n\nThe island is dense with puzzles (more so than it appears at first), and each of the nearly 700 puzzles (according to the developers) presents its own unique challenge, and a peek into the mechanics of the game (if you're paying attention).  The puzzles are each short, but satisfying and interconnected, so it's easy to leave the game at any time, and they're grouped into areas, where each area explores a particular game mechanic.\n\nBecause you're free to wander the island, you can walk away from one area if you get stuck and try a different one.  I usually had two or three areas I could choose between at any time.  If you try to play through each area, beginning to end, one at a time, I imagine you'll not enjoy yourself very much.  Once you get stuck on a puzzle, rather than continue banging your head against it, I recommend venturing off to find a different one; returning to a puzzle with a fresh palette and new mechanics under your belt may shake something loose.  The puzzles generally shouldn't require guesswork, and all of them are fair.\n\nThere's no narrative in The Witness.  You'll find recordings scattered around the island, which contain quotes from people throughout history, generally on the topics of awareness, discovery, investigation, and the monotheistic concept of a god.\n\nBeing an atheist, some of these fell flat for me, while others less concerned with theism hit hard, and one even had me teary-eyed.  Each one rang with the sort of sincerity that will either move you, or make you very uncomfortable, depending on how it plays against your own life and beliefs.\n\nIf I'm to be honest, I think The Witness has affected me on a personal level: its themes of exploration and discovery, and its quiet faith in your capacity to unravel its mysteries are comforting.  If you're in the mood for some introspection, you'll probably enjoy it as I have.",

      "I didn't want to review this until I was completely done. I've now 100%'d the game. Quite simply, I think everyone should play this game! It's perfect for puzzle players with easy and difficult puzzles, most of which feel very satisfying to solve, has fantastic commentary about all of the perspectives of today's society (it's not just a one-sided view!) and is a genuinely well-crafted game.\n\nMost facets of the game are positive so I have to point out the negatives in the game.\n1: There is no save/load system, it's all automatic checkpoints and you have to go and back up the files manually if you want to see the results of different choices.\n2: The choices you can make, or miss, have some light dialog consequences but they occur over many hours of time. This is something I don't really expect from a puzzle game that used to always tell you \"you can return to any place you want at any time.\" In this game, you can't. The time of day and weather of locations can irrevocably change, the ending itself has some major changes, yet there's no way to see it all without replaying the game (a tough pill to swallow for a puzzle game) or watching the results on YouTube. I'm kinda against that sort of thing unless your game can be played multiple times and be different each time, which this won't be, because it's the same puzzles each time.\n3: The engine is Unreal 5 and it's very unfortunate. Although the game may have been easier to develop for multiple platforms in a faster time via doing this, but it has proven that Croteam's old Serious Engine was a much better engine. Unreal 5 has horrible eye adaptation, anti-aliasing, lighting, and geometry options that are all proven to be horrible via this game. Don't get me wrong, the game runs and looks fine for the most part, but all of it could look better and run better had it been built on any other engine. Yes, *any* other engine. I'd sooner have played this on the Source engine. Epic's Lumen and Nanite technology is still too unproven, early, and crappy to be the generational leap they claim to be. I hope the developer can better tune this stuff so players can have better framerates, less ghosting, better lighting, and eliminated distant object pop-in.\n4: The game's pace at the start and end are worse than they could be. The beginning spends too long (and a lot of later optional dialog depends on your exploration of this) in an open world without puzzles while the end has a final puzzle that includes a frustratingly tedious walk-about aspect that needed to be shortcutted somehow. Everything in between (including the breaks you get back in the open world bit) is perfectly crafted and paced, though.\n\nThese things said, I still insist that if you enjoy any form of puzzle game, like Antichamber or Portal, you play this game. You will enjoy it!",
      "This is one of the most beautiful games I played since Shadow of the Colossus. And much like SOTC This game is a visual delight not all the visual feel pointless or feel to in your face no all of it is PURE atmosphere and really enhances the experience when exploring the many levels in the game. The game's ability to tell a very deep story visually without any dialog or exposition to undermine the player is absolutely brilliant. the game be very diffult the first time playing but feels rewarding after you level up Ori as you continue to fight bad guys.\n\n My rating is 10/10\n A stunning game with a compelling storyline that worth every penny",
      "I bought this game because it was supposed to be like Harvest Moon. I'm now close to finishing an ingame year.\n\n+ The town and art style is very much like Harvest Moon\n+ There are a lot of interesting characters with lovely art to socialize with\n+ The dog is helpful, barking on spots where you could dig out some items\n+ Some events, scenes and dialogues in this game made me smile to no end. This is a happy game.\n\n- You have a farmland of 40 tiles and farm by seeding tile by tile and watering tile by tile. The watering can is your only tool and upgradable to water 3x3 tiles.\n- Friendship is a grind, as is tradition in the genre. I once gifted a whole harvest to a girl without visable change in the 1 to 10 affection meter. After finishing the friendship grind on 3 villagers, the game seemed to reward me with... some random dialogue lines.\n- You can only bind the shovel and watering can. You cannot bind anything else like the brush or milking device or animal fodder. This makes the daily barn work quite nasty.\n\n\nIf you need a Harvest Moon on PC, this isn't what you want. Games like \"Friends of Mineral Town\" had a significantly larger focus on farming simulation. World's Dawn is a small town simulator with a little gardening on the side.",

      "There is an ethereal beauty to Ori that makes you believe in the power of love. As you play it you know you're experiencing something special that comes around very seldomly and that you should do everything within your power to appreciate it. It feels like a special privilege to play through it. Its a piece of art for the twenty first century. It's a reminder that there still exists impossible beauty in what sometimes feels like a bleak hopeless materialistic world. If you remain steadfast though and look for it, you will find things that will inspire you, things that will give you hope again and things that will remind you of why life is so beautiful and worth fighting for. Don't despair, fight. Fight for Ori and everything she stands for. It's worth it.",

      "Wow! Let me start by saying that for the last year, I worked in what could be called a high tech arcade. We featured a number of VR stations there, and I watched people playing Beast Pets that entire time. I ended up leaving the arcade before being able to try the game (the stations were only on when customers came in, which is when I left for the day), but since I had watched enough people try it, I felt like I had a pretty good grasp of the gameplay -- cute and light. When I saw it hit the Steam store, I was curious to finally play it. I'm more of an FPS/RPG kind of gamer, so I wasn't sure how much I'd be playing it. Well...it's really fun!! There's an immersive aspect to interacting with little AI's in VR that completely changes the experience. For example, while playing Skyrim, you get to have little companions. You interact with them a bit, they follow you around, and that's basically it. But when you're in VR, it actually feels the same as when I'm playing with my puppies. These little guys can fetch, follow a laser, and interact with the environment. There are places for you to explore, and each location offers something unique for the dragons (and you) to play with. And speaking of the environments, they're really pretty! The art style is low-poly, and it works perfectly to create ambiance while allowing you to interact with your new pets. The creators came up with some really clever conventions for interaction that make the experience smooth and hassle-free. This game is great for everyone, and I promise you it's absolutely worth your time.",

      "In all honesty, I became a little bored in the middle of playing it. It wasn't until I was almost through with the story that I realized why it had gotten such high ratings. You have no idea how hard it hit me when I realized why he was at the hospital [him being at the hospital is not a spoiler btw], and how relieved I was when he had at last found peace. It was in that moment that I had no regrets in purchasing it and how it was worth my time. Despite how brief the game was, I'm gonna remember it for a while. \n\n",
      "One of the hardest game I've ever played, also the most fun. Satisfying gameplay + pretty cool visuals and story. The moment the game clicks for you is like crack. Finishing the game gave me a better feeling than that one time I escaped child services by immigrating to Argentina",

      "Before I begin, are you a fan of modern art? If no, I can safely say move on, this isn't the game for you. If yes, then you can appreciate that there is a lot of famous modern art. Some pieces you will find yourself drawn to and feel something about them, and others won't evoke any real response. This is true for most things in life, but we tend to try and find reasons why we feel a certain way about other mediums, while with art we are usually happy enough to admit the various factors like skill, materials used etc. don't really impact our overall opinion of the piece.\n\nKentucky Route Zero is an incredibly well made and obviously incredibly personal game, and the level of effort put into it is astonishing, and I didn't like it. I wish I liked it, it seems so much like something I should like, but I don't. The strangest thing is, I would call this the game's greatest triumph. \"Games as Art\" has been an ongoing debate for years, but artist's always make something for themselves, while most games are made to be enjoyed. The fact that I didn't like this but I can't actually pinpoint the reason is evidence that this might be something more than most other games in this space.\n\nI won't go on too much longer here because while I cannot recommend something I didn't enjoy, I do absolutely think anyone interested in narrative games try the first two acts. I did enjoy the first act and can recommend that with no reservations, but from the second act onwards my interest and patience just declined more and more. I have no problem with wordy games, I've played plenty of visual novels that took 50+ hours to complete, but here I feel more and more of the story was being told with blanks I was supposed to fill in, but I just wasn't engaged enough with the characters and setting to bother with that, so you can easily see how this would become more frustrating over time.\n\nI wouldn't change a thing about this game, to me that would be like asking a painter to add in a few more trees to a finished piece. This game exists as a piece of art. I didn't like it, but you might love it, and you might not be able say why either, and that's a big achievement.",
      "This game's constant revealing of stranger and even stranger esoteric strangeness with every case, the way hitting start you are slammed in the gob by an unexpectedly gnarly tableau, a sinister mise-en-scene with a man burning to death on fire or blasted apart by a canon while wry cultists in various states of masked and undmaskedness make slight comments to say How deserving they were to be killed by us in just that way, oh yes!\n\nAhhhh! That is all about what I love The Case of the Golden Idol for.\n\nIt is 13 deduction puzzles (including the DLC) for you and perhaps a friend on the couch wherein you will become acquainted with a decades long revenge tragedy that tore several families and several kingdoms apart as many people lost there lives in heinous and sometimes magical ways. As you move along the story and investigations grow more complex, which could be a bit fatiguing, especially by the end of the DLC. Though everything here is great, don't mishear me. The art is disgusting. It's visuals and music complete the necessary deranged curious mood to undergird the transmutating tone of a murder-filled horror story into one that equally unnerving as it is subtly hilarious.\n\nThis is a game made by some Latvians from Latvia, and maybe, buster, you should just pay them some money and attention.",

      "Ahh, CrossCode.\nLet's start this review with what this game does right.\n\nPros:\nEverything. There review is complete. But on a serious note I'll elaborate.\n\nThis game starts out very generically. You got an amnesia stricken heroine. You got fairly archetypal characters. The story is the typical trying to figure out your past. But it's not. I lied about all that, that only covers the first 10-15 hours then you see drastic changes in the pace and tone. The story turns out to be well done, not the best, but enjoyable. 8/10 for story and characters.\n\nLet's talk about gameplay. It's perfect, seriously. The pacing of combat is fairly quick. There's a decent variety of enemy types which nearly all of them have some sort of unique trait. Your skill set leaves you with a lot of variety and different tools to take on different situations. I have yet to get bored of it, despite the fact combat isn't inherently profitable for most of the game. Puzzles. You have timing puzzles, logic puzzles, memory puzzles, enemy based puzzles. It's all there. It's all enjoyable. They're quite varied, no two puzzles feel the same. This game has over 200 'maps'. And just about every 'map' has a puzzle or two (optional or not). Ez 10/10.\n\nArt design. I'm a sucker for 16 and 32 bit graphics. The level designer, this guy made the game. He created some beautiful and interconnected maps with nearly everything having purpose. In all honesty, I have never seen design quality this high, it even beats out SquareSoft games (you know before they became that crappy company that is SE). 10/10 again.\n\nCharacter design. It works. Not the best. Not bad. The characters look the way they should. Lukas' nose drives me crazy, it's huge. But Holiday Man is solid. 7/10.\n\nMusic. Some of it's great. Some of it annoyed ME (but I'm picky). They stayed true to what they were trying to make. But it's obvious their composer was no Yasunori Mitsuda. But still, what I enjoyed, I really enjoyed. 8/10.\n\nDid I enjoy it? Every single minute of it. Even when I was confused. \"I WILL figure this puzzle out.\" 35/40, based off my personal taste, but CrossCode is as damn near perfect as you can get.",
      "I really wanted to like it, but i can't, in good faith, recommend A Space for the Unbound to anyone. It's a crying shame, because i deeply respect the intention behind the project. I love the whimsical, yet somewhat grounded premise: anyone who likes Makoto Shinkai movies will feel right at home. The intrigue, even though the plot twists are fairly obvious, still creates an unsettling feeling of uncertainty and dread that clashes (in a good way) with cheerful, bright colors of youth. A Space for the Unbound is mainly a point-and-click quest, but the developers still tried to spice the gameplay up a little with mini-games and little one-off mechanics that successfully break up the monotony.\n\nAnd yet... For every memorable, emotional peak A Space for the Unbound presents an hour of pure, unadulterated filler. Almost every \"puzzle\" is a multi-step fetch quest that requires you to backtrack multiple times with no other reason than to pad the length of the gameplay sections. It also indulges in \"gotcha\" moments, where the game deliberately fools you into the wrong solution, while the right one, of course, requires you to back track somewhere. Yes, the hometown of our main heroes is not that big, but that's hardly an excuse. Even more so in numerous dream sequences, where you are often times forced to go back and forth between someone's mind and reality to collect key items. Spacedives represent a wonderful opportunity to do something different, but A Space for the Unbound rarely delivers on that front.\n\nMost people praise the game for the story, the characters and the fact that it was made in Indonesia -- an under-represented region when it comes to games. But neither of those three have any solid writing to stand on their own. Sure, Atma and Raya can be sweet, but developers never allow their relationship to truly blossom. There's almost no banter, she's not even a constant presence in the story. Raya is important to the world of A Space for the Unbound, but doesn't really feel important to the player. Yes, the game tries really hard to tug at your heartstrings, but more often than not does so in a terribly hamfisted manner. It's supposed to be so profound and melodramatic that, at a certain point, it becomes difficult to take the game seriously.\n\nOh, and speaking of representing the community, A Space for the Unbound doesn't do a good job. The town itself is cute and full of life, there's no argument about that, but all of its inhabintants are either nameless mannequins with a so-so pixel-art, or just item bots. You speak to them once or twice, they give you what you need to advance the plot, and that's it. The fact that the game forces you to run laps around the town on an endless search for items doesn't make it any more charming or cozy. While, on the other hand, the authors only briefly touch on real societal issues, so as not to spoil the whimsy. In short, it's a huge nothingburger of a letdown, despite the fact that the whole setting is clearly supposed to be warm and nostalgic.\n\nYes, you can excuse some of those flaws by the main plot twist, which i will not spoild. But while it does make certain things more clear in hindsight, again, it does not portray the story in a good light. A Space for the Unbound really wants to be a Makoto Shinkai movie by way of Night in the Woods, but falls tragically short wherever you look. However, despite my criticisms, i hope Mojiken will not stop making games. It is very clear that the devs have tremendous passion and some talent on display -- it just needs refinement.",

The premise of matching the shape of the map to music sounds interesting but some of the songs I feel like are not mapped out correctly.

It felt like maps are only 50% related to the song and you have to ignore what you hear because the map randomly demands patterns that have no matching audio equivalent and everything becomes pure visual memorization.",
      "No Man’s Sky is like a guy who owes you $1,000 from 6 years ago coming back with $10,000 to repay you after you thought the money was gone.\n\nI really like this game. I’ve been playing it for years on and off, returning after every major update to see the state of things. No man’s Sky might be a fantastic game now, but you gotta always remember how it all begun. When the game first came out it could best be described to had been as wide as the ocean, but having the depth of a puddle. \n\nThe game has improved so much from when it came out that it is easily one of my favorite space exploration games nowadays.

If you like exploring and just taking your time  doing things, this game is a must, and I highly recommend it. \n\nThe truth is no matter what you think of the game we should all be grateful of what we’ve gotten. If No Man’s Sky was made by EA, all these updates throughout the years would probably have been released as $60 new games each.\n\nI’ll be honest, at this rate and with these devs I have a feeling No Man’s Sky has a better chance of of becoming what Star Citizen strives to be than Star Citizen.\n\nEvery now and then though, whenever I see a game trailer that I really enjoy, I like to remember the state of this game when it first came out and how awful it was.

That'd be simple enough if you weren't endlessly pursued by dinosaurs that are programmed with AI which knows your exact location at all times; three chomps and you're 'aparted' from the world, where you respawn with whatever amount of light and sanity you have left. Additionally, the translation attempt is abysmal at best. \n\nBoth NOREN and its developer, ThroneLab, should be banned from Steam. I do not blow the 'scam' whistle lightly, and I only do such when I am 100% certain of something actually being a scam. There are a handful of videos of this title on YouTube as well, with only one being over 5 minutes long. No one found a key. If evidence can be presented to me that there is in fact a way to progress in this game, I will rewrite this review. Until then, beware and stay vigilant.\n\n[h1]Rating: [b]0.0/5.0[/b] - WARNING.

      "Was a bit turn off when I saw it was a stationary shooter, but the game is so fun I look past that and even began to enjoy the room scaling dodging mechanics (game can make you work up a sweat!).\n\nA must for anyone looking for a more intense arcade shooting experience. I cannot overstate how fun it is to build your weapons in VR, the crafting system works flawlessly and seemely without the need of menus or UIs getting in the way, props for the devs for how well the game integrates with VR controls.\n\nWhat I liked:\n- Varied enemies\n - Great VR controls\n- Gun crafting is addicting and allows for a lot of experimentation\n- Great Bosses\n\nWhat I had trouble with:\n- Makes you wish you could run around the rooms like the original game!\n- The reduced FOV of most VR headsets makes it quite difficult to keep track of enemies that come from multiple directions. Some rooms require so much head movement that I tend to get sick.\n- When a room spawns with multiple shield pylons and a healer bot, it gets extremely frustrating if you have slow moving projectile weapons.\n\nWishes:\n- More gun parts! (Maybe future DLC?)",
      "I was warned a while back not to buy this game because of microtransactions, so I stuck with BTD5 instead. I haven't played much bloons before other than a lot of BTD 3 and 4 back then, but man I was missing out. The microtransactions in this game are nowhere near as bad as people made them out to be. Currently having too much fun with this game.",
      "Wow. Just wow. This is BY FAR the best visual novel i have played. the old school forums and cameras feel very detailed as whenever anything happens in a video chat, no matter how small, the characters react to it. the story was very enthralling and every time i slipped up and made a wrong move, my heart would feel as though it was gonna beat out of my chest. talking to violet felt very real and made the ending that i got so much more satisfying. the only bad things i can even say about this absolute masterpiece is just the fact that most of the really impact full options were locked because \"Emmett isn't cocky enough\" or  \"Emmett isn't compassionate enough\" which felt very vague and confining.\n\noverall the game is absolutely amazing and i wish the devs would come out with a game similar to this because of how good it was.\n9/10",
      "I bought this game because it was supposed to be like Harvest Moon. I'm now close to finishing an ingame year.\n\n+ The town and art style is very much like Harvest Moon\n+ There are a lot of interesting characters with lovely art to socialize with\n+ The dog is helpful, barking on spots where you could dig out some items\n+ Some events, scenes and dialogues in this game made me smile to no end. This is a happy game.\n\n- You have a farmland of 40 tiles and farm by seeding tile by tile and watering tile by tile. The watering can is your only tool and upgradable to water 3x3 tiles.\n- Friendship is a grind, as is tradition in the genre. I once gifted a whole harvest to a girl without visable change in the 1 to 10 affection meter. After finishing the friendship grind on 3 villagers, the game seemed to reward me with... some random dialogue lines.\n- You can only bind the shovel and watering can. You cannot bind anything else like the brush or milking device or animal fodder. This makes the daily barn work quite nasty.\n\n\nIf you need a Harvest Moon on PC, this isn't what you want. Games like \"Friends of Mineral Town\" had a significantly larger focus on farming simulation. World's Dawn is a small town simulator with a little gardening on the side.",
      "As a cybersecurity professional , I would classify this game as malware, or at the least adware.\nWhy? It opens up a number, at least 10 when I checked, of connections to various points on the internet which have no purpose in running the game. They are only there so the vendor can spam you with advertising, track you, or for other unspecified activities. \nAs such, I can NOT recommend this game. \n\nTo verify, I disconnected my computer from the internet. The game ran fine without the advertising and tracking. \nThen I connected back to the internet, and launched the game. The game opened at least 10 connections(!).\nThen, while still connected to the internet, I blocked the game's network-connecting executables in the firewall. In such a case, the game behaves differently, apparently it sees there is an active connection so it runs for a while, then when it cannot make it's for-bad-purposes network connections, it terminates and you can't play. \nThis is bad behavior that I would only expect from spyware and malware. I hope the vendor fixes it so the software runs in the manner they declare - it is supposed to not require network connectivity after the initial run as they describe in the System Requirements. \nSteam should be reigning in this behavior as well.",
      "Melatonin is a simple rhythm game, with a focus on ease of gameplay and calmer sounds.\nIf you're expecting something on the tougher or more upbeat side, this ain't it.  Ironically, I had more fun as I stopped focusing on scoring well, and more fun when I was just feeling the music and half-asleep.  The sounds and songs are quite relaxing lol.\n\nOn the shorter side of games, it still delivers an enjoyable experience in what it offers. The timing is a *little* on the forgiving side, and there are even accessibility options if you need a little more help, such as timing circles, metronome, and a bigger Perfect window.  If you'd rather go for a challenge, a Perfect only option is also available.\n\nControls are quite simple, using [strike]4[/strike] 3 directional keys and an action key (Space by default). In each tutorial, you're told whether you'll need to hit directional keys or the action key, and whether they're held or not, as well as general timing.  For some stages, the instructions don't give you as good an idea as the tutorial itself/timing circles do (Work and Time levels for me).  All good, but in some levels you get tempo changes in the middle of the song that can throw you a bit off, especially if you're just grooving to the audio cues... when you can hear and distinguish them.  Unfortunately, there are a few levels where the audio cues are either far too similar to each other, or happen too quickly to react to.  This can be a bit of a bummer, as I prefer working off audio for rhythm games, as their focus should be lol.  \n\nWhile Melatonin doesn't bring a whole lot to the table, it doesn't need to.  Less is more here, and the art and sound direction definitely hit their target.\nRelax.",
      "I was hoping for a good game but I can't believe the positive reviews. Really annoying on a personal level. If you like your hand held and revel in 3rd person view then enjoy, but I think it's terrible. I was on the mountain jumping across a platform. \"Press ENTER\" to 'grab' it suggests. I press ENTER and what do you know? Nothing happens. Well, you die continually because what it tells you to do (zzzzz) doesn't work. Ah, maybe this is part of the 'difficulty'...hahahaha.\n\nNot a patch on any Far Cry or GTA even though these are full of directions. First Tomb Raider I've bought and definitely the last. What is it with games these days telling you what to do every step of the way: Do this...do that....go here....find item...take item...drop item...fire now.....pull lever...talk....rest....jump.... quit game and uninstall, ya that's the best option. As this game is created for a dumbed-down society or tailored for intellectually challenged meercats, some of us can see where the industry is heading. What happened to thinking for yourself???\n\nI don't need to progess far in this game because the first 10 minutes says enough. Do this, do that, blah blah blah...",
      "Okay this is a weird situation. I personally don't like this game all that much, but I do still recommend it nonetheless. That's because despite me not being personally huge on it, I can't deny that it is a very well-crafted game that definitely will give people the experience they want if this is the type of game they're looking for. I, turns out, am not part of the crowd that is targeted for said experience. I just found the whole trial and error stealth RTS style of this game to just not be my cup of tea, but again I can't deny its very well-crafted. I also think the art style and voice acting and story are all very well done as well. So yeah, if you're fond of games of this type, then go for it. I'm sure you won't be disappointed. I, for one, don't think I'm entirely sold on it though.",
      "I've loved this game, put in WAY more hours making maps and modded content for it than I have playing it which is a terrifying statistic to think about, and have made some of the closest friendships from playing with people in the community- but, I'm just really disheartened. This is gonna be a long post, I've nolifed the shit out of this game for the better part of half a decade so there's a bit.\n\nHaving people come into my streams & DMs to ask me if I'm going to be porting my map and mods over to ARK1.5 with ASA and then to ARK2 before all of this immense drama and fleecing happened, before we knew anything about prices and release dates- it was a firm yes! I'd love to bring my creations over to UE5, porting content over was so easy, even myself and people in the modding community were putting our maps and creations into stock UE5 just to see what the possibilities were and get off on the new physics, lumen and nanite.\n\nNow I really don't want to bring that content over. Not only because of the bad business practice, with many other games who have ported over to UE5 or have done engine upgrades been offered for free- but because I've seen this one too many times with this company and the business is just horrifically mismanaged and it's heartbreaking for some of us, it's heartbreaking for me.\n\nWhen someone in a position of power and authority over an IP and business has stated that ARK1.5 would be free, as a gesture of good faith, you take that as a promise, and we were all stoked about that. That was the right thing to do. ARK is not a small indie, unknown survival game in a (mostly) unfinished state anymore like it was- it is a powerhouse in the industry, top survival game charts across the internet for -years- will have ARK in the top 5- it is not a game that has done poorly for revenue, publicity or players. It is one of the giants. The best IP that Snail/WC have to date and continues to be. There is no reason to renege on a promise that was publicly made. And before some moron says \"JuSt DoNt BuY It ThEn\" it's deeper than that, I would have had, at my hours invested, zero issues purchasing ARK1.5 for like $20-$30 bucks with all DLC's included- but to make an offer, after it was promised as free, then to take it back and serve up an even bigger steaming pile of shit that is more expensive on a plate, and for Wildcard to hand you the spoon and be like yum yum dig in! Is so strange.\n\nHonestly, I'm not surprised. I was a public moderator in the ATLAS discord with Jat and other off branched former/current- Wildcard/Grapeshot employees at the release of that absolute dumpsterfire and was there with the rest trying to put out fires that could be witnessed from fu**g Jupiter- because I had faith and volunteered my time to assist with a company I believed in, created for and wanted to succeed so badly for the community. \n\nDark and Light was next. Another abandoned IP. Then Last Oasis- yep- Abandoned. All of the offbranches of ARK have failed so horribly, and haven't managed to capture that excitement that ARK did for the industry but they will absolutely keep trying to push out what they think consumers will like, all without listening to any feedback- and feedback isn't always good, do not get it twisted some suggestions I've seen truly are horrendous- but there are gems in amongst the boulders and landslides. Having the initiative to sift and find them, and then really look at them seems to be the problem. It concerns me deeply when Wildcard state themselves on their newsletters that ARK2 will be such a different experience from ARK1 that it now makes sense why they tried to package it in a non-refundable-at-time-of-play bundle with ARK1.5.\n\nSpeaking from experience here- the best thing Wildcard/Snail have done for ARK, and I will never discredit them for it, is their Sponsored Mods program and hiring modders from the community for ARK and ATLAS. That alone has kept ARK where it is, as popular as it is, as fresh as it is and as revolutionary as it is. There is never a drought of \"content\" with ARK, as the modding community carries it on their backs each and every day. Official servers have their place, and I disagree with how they're being handled, but have no solution for that as I never was an official player for more than an hour at a time to remind me why I prefer modded servers. This is no discredit to the ARK art department, by the way, having looked through the maps in the Devkit- Aberration is still to this day is a visual and technical marvel, and many other maps made since then.\n\nThere is a massive air of uncertainty for modders with ARK1.5 and 2. Logistically, the average number of mods on big unofficial servers is about 18- if each modder listing them on Overwolf decides to list their single mod for say $3 bucks, something very reasonable- times that by 18 and are players really going to be expected to play on a single server they MIGHT not even like, for $54 bucks? Maybe they discovered that server was good but had no players during their playtime- and then they find one in their region but, oh- there's 5 more mods on this server, there's another $15 to play on this one. Is a $69(nice) investment really worth it? I don't think so. Even at what has been discussed quietly behind closed doors with other modders at a $1 a mod price, so 50c to the modder, 50c to Overwolf/Wildcard- that's still, on average, $18 bucks to play on a server- this price is not including ARK1.5, or the DLCs for it- so what was the discussed \"Content creators/Modders can make a living!\" price...? Because when you take a step back from the buzzwords, there's a colossal black hole of a problem in the logistics.\n\nI digress, without any more information to go on regarding priced mods, we can only speculate. Back to what we know. \n\nSelling all DLCs and base game for ARK 1 that will functionally become a single player story mode and mod carried game without any warnings, notices or heads up to new prospective players is scummy as hell. There will absolutely be more delays before ARK 1.5, which will extend the lifecycle of the current game and DLCs, sure, but it's shady. The idea that ARK1 will become, in a sense, a showcase of my above statement about modders carrying the entire ARK community on their backs, and a solo story is fine- but adjust your listings so that people will know they will never experience ARK1 as \"Wilcard intended\" with the removal of official servers, that they will be playing with archived mods no longer receiving updates as many modders move over to 1.5, that they will have a limited playerbase to play with as most have gone to 1.5, that there is limited updates going to be provided due to 1.5- that there is no more official DLC... due to 1.5.\n\nThis isn't even taking into their account their roadmap of the supposed finished content releases for ARK1.5 and ARK2 finishing up and starting at almost the exact same time. So we will have this problem ALL over again when the release of ARK2 is imminent, after it's delays. Players who bought ARK1.5 and all the DLC's will play on that for a month or two before ARK2 is released, then ARK1 is even more abandoned, and ARK1.5 will dwindle.\n\nI know many people will say- damn, this chick gives way too much of a shit about this game, you right lol. I don't like seeing a community be lied to, deceived, fleeced and taken advantage of. ARK is one of those \"coping\" games. If you spend any time with the community, it's a comfort. People come home from work or school and they will turn their brain off and just play. For hours. Not giving any thoughts to how shit their workday was, how badly they were bullied at school, how much anxiety they have or problems they are facing- ARK lets them turn off and have fun, it's an escape game. There's not many other games out there that keep people playing like ARK does, for so many reasons. But, the community is at the core of it.\n\nI wish Wildcard would pay attention to it.",
      "I waited 12+ years for a proper sequel to A Crack in Time (yes i know the other games came out but tbh they didn't do much for me) for it only to come out for the PS5. Unfortunately, I wasn't getting a new console for just one game. \n\nNow, two years later I'm playing it on the PC.  While surreal, I am super glad they ported this series to a different platform, and the game was totally worth the wait.\n\nThe port by Nixxes ran very nice for me. I had a few hitches in the dimensional portal scenes, and one crash in a total of 12hrs of playtime. I do understand that some people are having issues and that does suck & does not disqualify their experiences, however, It is not even close to how bad TLOU Pt.1's port was.  \n\nIt's another Insomniac banger, and if you've played any of their games you already know whats up. I beat the game in 12 hrs on the 2nd to last difficulty grabbing whatever side content/collectibles I could before the story captivated me. As is tradition, there is a NG+ mode (haven't touched yet) and I look forward to trying it. I'll probably update the review at that point, but the games are always repayable due to their collect-a-thon nature, that and being so damn fun you have a dumb ear-to-ear smile for all of the playtime.  \n \nIf you enjoyed the Ratchet and Clank games in the past, its way more of that + the dimensional gimmick which is really well done and very neat tech wise. I love the new movement features and Rivet is a very good addition to the cast. I hope she stays relevant in the story in the future. Game feels super good to play as well, weapons are great as always. The writing is still funny and enjoyable. It's just a good time, and I highly recommend it, even at full price.\n\nLastly, I would like to direct a message to Sony/PS Studios/Insomniac Games:\nPLEASE PORT THE OTHER AND OLDER R&C GAMES PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE IPELASE PLs I WILL PAY $70",
      "its a very stressful game and rly hard but the fact that u can lose all ur progress because of a mistake is on another level of insane but in the end if u r determined u will finish it and the feeling when u finish it after all the time is very good i never felt this good in my life about finishing a game or a puzzle its a rly good game i recommend",
      "I had to purchase Scarlet Hollow after witnessing the excitement of Episode 4 through my friends. I immediately binged the first three episodes the following day and found myself and in rather different spot compared to their playthrough. The choices you make in SH are actually impactful - which is (unfortunately) quite refreshing for the genre! I've since run through several different routes to explore more of the story (and collect those achievements!). While you have the ability to skip through previously seen text, lines within replayed conversations are shaped by your selected traits, choices, and previously selected dialogue; you won't be skipping that many lines before seeing new content. Similarly, characters may be painted in an entirely different light based on choices you've made. The cast and writing truly nails the small town feel of SH (gossip and all). \n\nMake sure you eat the takeaway container in the fridge. Thank me later.",
      "Blows every single PFS game of the last decade out of the water, even those shitty D**M games that people who never played FPS games before seems to worship in order to look cool. Smooth and fast gameplay with a lot of variety. Great visuals even on medium/high settings.

Writing has always been the worst part of the series, dont be delusional retards.",
      "[b][i]AMID EVIL[/i] is very much [i]Quake[/i] 1 level design in a [i]Hexen[/i]/[i]Heretic[/i] universe.[/b] It's well done. We're a bit spoiled this year with outstanding '90s FPS shooters. Personally, I prefer both [i]Ion Maiden[/i] and [i]DUSK[/i] over this title for the following reasons:\n\n1) I find [i]AMID EVIL[/i] to be a bit generic in terms of theme; the fantasy setting could use a bit more to set it apart.\n\n2) I prefer real or low fantasy weapons/guns over wands and totally high fantasy weapons. Now, don't get it twisted - I appreciate that these high fantasy weapons exist, but yeah, they leave something to be desired. I miss reloading and all of that. \n\n3) The level design in [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is much more 'sprawling' (for lack of a better term) just like the original [i]Quake[/i]. Most levels are indoors in what feels like an underground compound (at the time of writing this review). I personally like the backwoods feel of [i]DUSK[/i], or the dystopian cityscape of [i]Ion Maiden[/i] far more. I want to look up at the sky in most levels.\n\n4) The enemy design is different than the other two games I mention, which is good - but they all mostly have a 'same' kind of feel. The enemies are all super fast, so most of your efforts are focused on running backwards while fending them off. It's fun, but gunplay isn't quite as fun as the other two games for this particular reason.\n\n5) The font and overall menu system definitely feels 'Early Access'. I know the font is being worked on, which is desperately needed. \n\n6) My favorite way to play the game is Endless mode - and I feel like that's a flaw in itself. It's the opposite for me with [i]DUSK[/i]. I want to fall in love with the campaign, but eh, there isn't really any story or anything all that interesting to suck me in. The secrets are super easy to find compared to the other two games, too.\n\n7) No multiplayer. Now, I really don't care about this - but who designs a game in this genre without building this in from the ground up? You know the community is going to whine about this. Questionable design decision to say the least.\n\n[b]Well, it sounds like I just dumped all over the game.[/b] Please don't get me wrong. [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is a welcome addition to the genre. The *great news* is that this is not just some reskin of [i]DUSK[/i] - it certainly is it's own thing. And that's really important. \n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+Fairly polished game for Early Access\n+It's the most modern version of the original [i]Quake[/i] we've seen this year\n+Well optimized\n+Lots of content right now\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-The universe is generic\n-No multiplayer\n-The font is too hard to read\n-Music is nothing to write home about\n-The secrets are easy, and there really aren't all that many of them\n-Weapons could use more 'oomph' to them; also we should be able to use the special ability when we want to as opposed to it autotriggering\n\n[b]I was psyched out of my mind for [i]AMID EVIL[/i] - and while it is certainly good - I think I'll be focused more on [i]DUSK[/i] and [i]Ion Maiden[/i].[/b] Because, let's face it, gaming time is valuable and we can't play everything.",
      "Very addictive and challenging\nAlthough the whole game is happening on the same map, with the same enemy and the same weapons, it has a lot of replayability trying and testing new builds and characters.\nMusic is good.

      "If Disco Elysium is a meditation on lost futures and the value of self destruction, Norco answers with an indictment that we might be inhabiting the end times and should hold on regardless. Every scene and character portrait is a painstaking work of art that works along with the dreamy soundtrack to draw you into the gorgeous, hazy bible belt setting. The point and click gameplay is straightforward (and at times a little overbearing with handholding), with small minigame sections to mix things up somewhat, but rewards interacting with the world and the people in it to uncover another small truth about it. I don't think I've come across anything that quite captures the sense of melancholy and unease that dominates the current moment in the 20s.",
      "Earlier this week I did the impossible - I came out to a family member. One of my two sisters, in specific.\n\nI was nervous but relieved to know she accepted and supported me - and thought, you know, perhaps we should call and talk about some things. We had that call this Wednesday and I expressed a lot of my resentment towards my family - being stuck at home with some of my family, more specifically my [spoiler]mom[/spoiler], has completely wrecked my mental health. I'm still closeted from them and I live with each passing day, worried [spoiler]she'd[/spoiler] reject me - for being non-binary, for dating a trans person, for disappointing [spoiler]her[/spoiler].\n\nMy sister told me that [spoiler] my mom [/spoiler] only hears what [spoiler]she[/spoiler] wants to hear, that [spoiler]she[/spoiler] only thinks about what [spoiler]she[/spoiler] wants to see in [spoiler]her[/spoiler] kids despite often saying otherwise. From her experience, [spoiler]mom[/spoiler] seemed to be a very not open and is often a close-minded individual. \nComing into If Found..., I had only broke down early Thursday morning as my many months of frustrations and anxieties finally given the voice it needed.\n\nIf you've played the game it'd make sense if I told you that Kasio's experience with her parents in If Found... hurt reading for me - it genuinely hurt. Seeing her mom's first letter and annotating it with \"She's trying. But she has all these ideas of how I should be.\" and \"She didn't even consider she might need to apologize too.\" was something I sat at for a long time, probably longer than any other part of her journal that I was erasing through at a normal pace.\n\nMoments like that made me realize that this game is something I never knew I needed - a realization that hey, think about the move out you're doing in a month as rebuilding - as leaving the past behind. That there isn't anything wrong with that, and that you can really be yourself once we're out there, together. That family doesn't have to be bound by blood and it's really about the people who's there for you, even at your absolute worst. That I don't need to seek acceptance through others - but rather be more accepting of myself.\n\n[spoiler]\"I find I care less and less what other people think of me, and more for my own opinion. And these days I'm so much more comfortable in my own skin.\"[/spoiler]\n\nThere's people I can think of who need to read and see this.\n\nIf Found... left me with hope - and it's leaving me with a lot to think about. Thank you so much for this game, DREAMFEEL. I wish I could articulate this game better like other people have - but it's been a lot lately and I need to rest - if you're coming across this review/text you should without a doubt play it, especially if you've felt similarly trapped like both me and Kasio did.\n\nP.S. - If you find the eraser mechanic to be a little strenuous you can increase the size of the eraser in the options!",

The action is character driven, and while the main story is fairly linear, the open world nature of the game allows you to take a break from the main story arc and explorer the hundreds of characters and side missions that can be found all over Pandora. It also has one of the most badass, charasmatic and handsome villians of all time... [/td]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td]Replayability[/td]\n    [td]9[/td]\n    [td]So many reasons to replay this game. Firstly the story can be completed at least 3 times with the same character at increasing difficulty and xp levels (normal, true vault hunter and ultimate vault hunter) with progressively better rewards. There is so much detail in the story and so many optional missions that each play through feels different. Next you have at least 4 (more with DLC) characters each with their own skills, playstyle and story to explore. Finally you have tons of loot in the form of Guns, Shields, Grenades, Relics and Class Mods you can collect for your character. These increase in rarity from white (basic) to orange (legendary) generally the rarer the weapon the more damage it will do and many will have additional unique abilities (red text). [/td]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td]Multiplayer[/td]\n    [td]10[/td]\n    [td]For me, this game remains simply the best cooperative multiplayer experiences you can have. Your character's skills really augment and compliment each other when playing as a team. Enemy and mission difficulty automatically adjusts to the amount of players, requiring real teamwork and synergy to avoid dying at higher levels. The multiplayer allows you to connect (drop in and out midgame) to your steam friends games or to public games, connections for the most part feel quick and responsive even with 4 players and with only a small delay on audio communication. [/td]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td][h1]Overall[/h1][/td]\n    [td]9.5[/td]\n    [td]I can't recommend this game enough, while a minority of missions feel like you are just a glorified delivery boy, most are creative, funny and packed full of classic moments and great characters. So much fun to pick up and play with friends. - I haven't really mentioned the DLC (of which there is a lot) in this review but the main ones (Mr Torgue's, Captain Scarlett and especially Tiny Tina's) are all well worth getting (these are included in the Game of the Year edition), great fun to play and add loads more content to the game. To progress to the highest level in the game (level 72 +overpower levels) you will also need the ultimate vault hunter pack 2 so I would recommend that if you reach the end and still want more.

      "Did you like the first two chapters?\nWell, here we have everything and tons of new and improved things, like the 2nd chapter did with regards to the first one (which was awesome, but quite simple gameplay-wise).\nA classical turn-based strategy game, now more polished than ever with wave-like combats and tons of units to start with, to upgrade and well, we don't even have real classes here - more correctly, each hero is a class on its own and has different abilities and such.\nThe story follows always the same one-way saga and you'll have to make lots of choices determining your fate, your battles and so on; the graphics are the most beautiful I've ever seen here and the soundtrack is quite amazing and atmospheric too.\nYou'll have also many features like arena combat, and a great history re-telling if you don't remember the first two chapters, plus a great tutorial to start with even if you're not new to the series and the genre.\nIt's quite fundamental if you're a little bit interested in this awesome story to play the other chapters - here in fact we'll start with all the old heroes, all the story right back from the caravan that reached Arberrang.\nWe're basically reviewing one of the best strategy tactical turn-based role-playing games of the last 5-10 years and I won't add more than this, it has already thousands of reviews and mine is quite useless I think. \nLots of endings, lots of characters to explore and promote, lots of weapons, accessories, modes.. we have everything. Recommended to anyone (maybe with a little discount).",
      "I've been waiting since the likes of Planescape Torment and Baldurs Gate 2 for a game to match their sheer perfection, many games came quite close, but Divinity Original Sin just manages to hit so many nails on the head its not funny. It looks great and still plays fine on my aging PC, it has a great storyline, it's two protagonists have some great interactions and dialogue. The voice acting is spot on and it has the most sublime OST.\n\nThe combat is turn-based but do not let this put you off, there are so many choices in combat with the interaction of spells with each other and the environment, that the game just begs you to experiment with different tactics.\n\nThis game just oozes pure class, it was a labour of love for Larian and it shows in every tiny detail of the game.\nIf you like RPG games (or even just pure quality games), you need to play this game, it is the benchmark I will use in comparing other games in future.\n\nWell done Larian.",
      "Most of the negative reviews cover my complaints already. So I won't rehash the ones I've already read. \n\nHere's my biggest complaints: \n\n- Jumpscares have never been compelling to me. Doubly so on VR. Are you trying to injure me in my computer room? Stop. \n\n- Guns are fun. Not having ammo for them is not fun. (The game is pretty generous with ammo but it also encourages tediously conservative behavior, if you just unload clips at shit you'll run out pretty fast) \n\n- \"Continuous Turning\" feels so bad. Like, how can I turn my headset and everything looks smooth as butter, but as soon as I use the look stick for turning suddenly it's all choppy and looks wrong? I'm familiar with some of the motion sickness issues people get with turning in VR games, but this isn't that... \n\n\nThough honestly it seems like they just leaned really into the whole horror thing, which is fine, but also just super not my thing. \n\nIf the mechanics and some design choices had been better I might have slogged through it anyway. \n\n\nGame's beautiful, though, so they got that going for them.",
      "This is more than a game for me.  It has become a hobby.  What started as a random purchase for myself last Christmas -- I had an old electric guitar I never played in the closet, so this gave me an excuse to see if I can learn -- has become an expensive obsession for me.  Warning -- but a good warning -- you'll find that you're learning guitar very quickly on this game, and it will become the start of an expensive habit!  I have downloaded hundreds of dollars worth of songs, bought a brand new guitar, I've signed up for music theory and guitar lessons at the local county college ... this has become a genuine hobby for me.  Literally, it is one of those rare games which has genuinely made an impact on my life.  Six months later, and the game has not gotten old.  I look forward to new songs, I laugh when a new chord I've never seen magically appears on the song that I've practiced the hell out and achieved a new difficulty.  The game is, most importantly, fun.  It remains fresh and only gets better as you get better.  I highly recommend.",
      "Minesweeper influenced design feels like a fresh take on the Slay-the-Spire-like genre.  Now that I've won with all six classes, and done some of the unlockable difficulty levels, I feel that I've gotten my money's worth with the game, and I have enjoyed the time I've spent so far, but I don't expect great longevity beyond this point.\n\nI do have some minor gripes:\n\n* The pacing on unlocking new classes feels too slow.  It would be nice if the approach was the fairly standard one of unlocking a new class when you win with the previous one, but here there is a currency which is acquired throughout runs, and I found that I usually had to have two winning runs with the previous class to earn enough currency to unlock a new one.\n* Optimal play with some classes requires memorizing tiles which are revealed, and then on later turns these tiles are hidden.  Taking damage because I misremembered what was hidden behind a tile feels unfun and at-odds with what the game otherwise wants to be.\n* I would prefer if the harder difficulty settings were unlocked from the get-go, rather than grinding through easier difficulty settings to find the challenge.\n\nOtherwise, though, it's a fun game with an adorable art style, and not just a clone of the other Spire-likes around.  Recommended if your expectation is to get ten hours or so of strategic puzzling.",
      "I've been completely in love with this game ever since the Mojam prototype \"Wasteland Kings\" was released. It's an insanely fun, fastpaced \"roguelike-like\" or \"roguelite\" with randomly generated worlds and tons of weapons to find. On top of that, the developers stream the development of the game on tuesdays and thursdays over at Twitch and they release updates to the game every week. To me, this is the best game of its kind and I've put tons of hours into mastering it (and I still die. Often. It's difficult okay?).",
      "Deathloop is definitely not your average video game.\n\nYou'll either love it or hate it.\n\nThe first few hours are the weakest. You, as a new player, don't know what to do, what's important and you never keep what you find. Only after completing several mission objectives you get the ability to collect residuum and actually infuse your found items for later use in later loops or after you die. That's why it's always better to just go straight to the objectives and not explore the map at all, otherwise it's just gonna be a big time waste.\n\nAfter you acquire the ability to make permanent items (character and weapon trinkets) which you'll be able to use in future runs and collect some crucial weapons (like silent gun) and abilities ([in-game slabs] like Shift that allows you to teleport short distances) - then the game fully opens up. \n\nReal fun begins after you learn all maps and shortcuts and how to toy with your enemies (but it takes quite a lot of time to get there).\n\nStealth is very easy, the enemy AI is dumb at best. The more trinkets and slabs you get - the more variety in gameplay opens up. \n\nAction is very smooth, Abilities are strong and versatile, that's where this game shines to be honest. \n\nThere are 4 different areas and all of them change depending of the time of the day (morning, noon, afternoon and evening). Depending of the time of the day - some areas become accessible, some become closed, The enemies and items also change their locations and sometimes you'll be able to encounter bosses (in-game they are called visionaries). They are not hard to kill, but it's quite hard to get to them. That's the fun part of this whole game. The more you replay all areas, the more information you'll acquire about visionaries and their behaviour. It's possible to deal with them all without killing a single other enemy.\n\nBut with all that comes the not so fun part - exploration and doing the same thing over and over and over again. It's gonna be hard at first, every area is very detailed and it's really easy to miss a code written on a desk or a wall, A lot of sniffing around is required for clues and multiple times per map. It definitely makes repetition your new best friend.\n\nThere are a lot of puzzles and challenges. If you are not shooting dumb NPCs - you're definitely trying to crack a solution to a puzzle. Sometimes you'll need to visit several maps on the exact time of day at which events occur and find the exact required item or piece of information in order to solve a puzzle. Yeah. It's a big hassle, but that's how this game is and how it functions. If you like puzzles, you'll enjoy Deathloop. But be prepared to use a guide or two for some of them and a lot of patience.\n\nDuring some objectives it's very easy to make mistakes and fail. Several challenges require you to be pixel perfect in execution. Didn't notice that mine placed on a generator? Too bad, you'll gonna have to restart or try in another loop.\n\nI disliked that once you find a new weapon, you have to take it with you and drop one of your 3 weapons. You will never be able to use the dropped one for the rest of the loop. Considering that you'll always find a new toy to play with - your loadout will always be half-baked. It's actually extremely annoying, the same can be said about your slab abilities too (only after you find them all, then the ability upgrades will go straight into your inventory after finishing a level).\n\nAnd of course, there is Julianna. She is your \"buddy\" the whole game and she talks to you at the start of every level and well... she is always trying to kill you. It's fun when she invades and disrupts your chill Groundhogday experience. You can even let other real players invade you as Julianna. Fun, if you like to fill yourself with some adrenaline. Either you kill her, or she kills you and you'll have to start over the whole loop ^^\n\nFunny, but Colt reminded me of Draymond Green from Golden State Warriors. In some instances he looks exactly like him haha.\n\nThere are some AI bugs and the game starts to stutter the longer you play. Kinda strage, but it was for me. Occasionally framerates can go from smooth to choppy quite fast.\n\nDeathloop is a decent game overall. Idea is good, but works much better in movies, because there you don't have to sit through the same routines every single time and you get to the next big reveal a lot quicker. \n\nI think Julianna was a bit underused. Imagine how awesome this game could be if Deahtloop worked similar to The Lost Vikings where you control 3 characters at the same time. She could have had different abilities, different strengths. A duo trying to break the loop! Pretty cool, eh? Anyway, That's just my 2 cents.",
      "The game is decent but not worth $15 for a slightly better looking version of a 2 hour game that is 9 years old. I can only recommend it if you really like these kind rpg maker horror games, because it's among the best in its field.",

      "[h1]Strategy at its finest[/h1]\n\nInto the Breach is Subset Game’s latest title, following on from their massive hit, FTL. I put off trying Into the Breach for a long while, but I finally got it when it dropped down to $10 on HB a couple of months ago and I’m so glad I did. This game isn’t for everyone, it’s kind of rogue-like mech chess, but if it clicks for you then it’ll be one of the best strategy games you’ll ever play.\n\n[h1]Positives:[/h1]\n[list][*]First up, the game looks fantastic. The pixel art here is great, from the backgrounds to the mechs and even the pilot portraits. The animations here area also really good. There’s nothing too complicated here but it’s all well executed. On the topic of appearances, I also really like the way the maps are laid out, the 8x8 grids on a plain background work really well here and it reminds me of simple boardgames. I think it works well for the game.\n\n[*]As with any good strategy game, it’s easy to pick up, but hard to master. You have a squad of three mechs (there are a few different mech groups to unlock with gold coins (?) and you can also create custom groups from the mechs you’ve unlocked). Each group has a unique element, but they all follow the basic structure of one close-range mech, one long-range mech and one support mech. Each mech has a different ability/weapon and they’re all well varied. The mech teams are really well designed here so that no one mech is super powerful and they all work really well as a unit. \n\n[*]The combat is excellent. It’s really simple but it works so well. You’ll quickly learn the different roles your mechs have and figure out the best strategies to use them. There are two ways to kill most enemies. Getting rid of all of their HP or pushing them into water/lava (with the exception of boss enemies or flying enemies). However, a lot of the time you probably won’t even be trying to kill your enemies in a given turn. You can always see what the enemies will do on their next turn and so you always want to be playing to react to/prevent their next move. Typically, enemies target civilian buildings or buildings related to your objective, so it’s usually better to focus on moving them away from these buildings rather than focusing on killing them. If you’re really smart/lucky you can also push enemies so that they attack each other, as friendly fire is a major part of this game. It’s really satisfying when you line it up right so the enemies are killing each other rather than attacking you or the buildings you defend. You can even block them from spawning by moving something on top of them!\n\n[*]Unlocks in this game are handled better than in FTL in my opinion. There are six actions that you can complete with each mech squad to earn those gold coins I mentioned in order to unlock new mech squads. The first three are the three possible victories: two, three and four island (more on that in a second) and then the other three achievements are unique to each mech squad. They’re centred around the unique aspect of each squad, tasking you to get a bit creative with the way that you’re playing. I know some players didn’t like the way that unlocks worked but I think it’s a really good way to handle it and encourages you to try new strategies. \n\n[*]The game has five islands, with one of those being the final boss fight. Each island is basically a different biome with different enemies and environmental hazards. They aren’t necessarily easier or harder than each other to start with, but the difficulty does increase as you move from island to island. There is some crossover with the enemies you’ll see, but they at the very least have a different appearance and most of them behave differently. There are also enemies unique to each island. \n\n[*]On each island, you’ll need to complete several missions before facing off against the island’s mini-boss. The missions all have different objectives for you to complete, though the win condition is always just to survive all of the turns (typically 5 turns). The different objectives vary but there are usual two, with some easier missions only having one and harder missions having three. Completing these objectives gets you certain rewards. You can either get stars, which are used upon completing an island to purchase new pilots, abilities or weapons. There is grid power which restores or increases the grid power you start with (grid power is lost when buildings are destroyed, losing all grid power results in a loss). Lastly, some of the missions award power cores (usually you only see this as the third reward for a hard mission) which allow you to upgrade your mech’s weapons or abilities (super handy). The mission variety is fairly good.\n\n[*]There are a range of different pilots in the game. You always start with one ‘special’ pilot and two regular pilots but more can be found in cryo-pods or bought at the end-of-island store. All pilots earn xp at the end of missions and when they level up they get some kind of upgrade, like more mech health or an extra movement per turn. The ‘special’ pilots all have some kind of special ability, such as being able to attack twice if you don’t move or the ability for the piloted mech to fly. Some of these require a power core, but they’re definitely worth it.  [/list]\n\n[h1]Negatives: [/h1]\n[list][*]Honestly, I’m clutching at straws here for negatives. One thing I would mention is that I don’t think this game will have as much replay value as FTL does for most people (completionists have an awful lot to do here) which shouldn’t put you off from getting it, but is something to base your expectations on. I also felt like Chris Avellone was a bit wasted on this game, his writing is fantastic but there just isn’t much of it. [/list]\n\n[h1]Verdict: [/h1]\n\nInto the Breach is as close to a perfect strategy game as I’ve ever played and it’s an excellent follow-up to FTL. This game is easy to pick up, hard to master and it looks beautiful the whole time you’re playing this weird mech chess. I can’t recommend this enough and at $15 it’s an absolute steal. This was easily one of my favourite releases of 2018 and anyone who likes strategy absolutely needs this in their library. \n\nIf you found this review helpful, please check out my other reviews over at [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33633486/]Kemo's Corner.[/url]",

      "ORIGINAL REVIEW Posted: Nov 27, 2016:\nExtremely fun and addictive game! That IS if you practice and learn the way the game is supposed to be played.\n\nActually requires a lot of patience, aim control, learning of map locations, etc.\n\nEdit Dec 7, 2018: Stupid crazy full with hackers, now that it's F2P i feel like it's gonna get taken over by even more hackers... RIP 2012 CSGO.\n\nEDIT 2021/09/03: Some of you are morons here... Clearly a huge \"fan\" base of CSGO. I've gathered around 9,000+ hours in total (in my other account as well) No. I wasn't a \"Noob\" or had no skill. I was GE for a very long time.\n\nThis review is from 2018. After all the new updates came into place. I LOVED the game, It was my addiction. After those updates, everything went down hill. MORE toxicity, MORE blatant hackers, and I for one wasn't a big fan of the newest updates. So I decided to leave, updated this review with my most recent experience.\nReviews are meant to talk about your experience, Not to kiss ass and make things look good when they aren't.",
      "Dear Dev, \nI love this game, if you're reading reviews, please consider some ideas to make it better:\n-  Level designing: Add more ways to choose, and different endings. Right now SoR4 is flat from A to B, it made me feel down compare to SoR3.\n- Alternate customs, and playable same characters: Floyd is overrated and all my friends want to pick him. Make a game with 4 Floyds running sound fun. Use lifetime score to unlock customs.\n- 2v2 Battle! WHY NOT?\n- Shiva (new), Max (new), Roo, Estel (Badass Woman Cop)\n- Steam trading cards: I know it's not importance, but who doesnt want some badass backgrounds on steam profile?",
      "This game was sunk by poor customer service as well. I at one point lost years worth of items due to a bug. I was told by one of the devs in an email to \"stop button mashing\". My email was nothing but respect and appreciation for a good game where I also simply asked if they could return my bugged items I have earned over the years. \"Stop Button Mashing\"! Really? And now your game is dead. Good work! Piss poor development. Just sad and dissapointed I have over 2k in hours in crap. And yes this game actually is years old it was originally released Jan 2015. At one point we had a good game to play. I believe even the most played game on steam. Then something happened. It became all about crates. F this game. I'm done!",
      "The good news is the driving physics, fuel and tire mechanics, and multiplayer design are the best the series has ever been. However, the overall package, performance, and presentation are significantly lacking in this game at launch. Unless you're desperate, hold off on purchasing this game until the developers have had time to put in additional content and fix the numerous bugs and the odd design choices they've made that I think may need to be changed. There's a lot of work that needs to be done on this game for it to be considered a complete racing game.\n \nThe performance on an 8700K+RTX4070 has been inconsistent at 1440p. While playing with frame rate unlocked at a mix of ultra and high settings I can get FPS into the high 80s but this is accompanied by regular drops of about 20 FPS so I felt it required the 60 FPS lock setting which was a bit disappointing. The other disappointment comes in how the game looks, which frankly is not visually pleasing even at the highest possible settings and generally just not a sharp enough picture no matter what you adjust.\n\nSo overall it’s a bit of a mixed bag. The racing itself is engaging and fun but the choices the developers have made with this game for presentation and functionality leave much to be desired. If it receives good post-launch support it may correct a lot of those issues but at launch it’s a bit disappointing and I do not recommend buying it.",
      "RIP Johnny Gat and your whole 2 minutes of screentime.\nWhile being a good sandbox game on its own merits, SR3 does NOT improve upon SR2 in very many aspects. In fact, they actually removed a lot of content from the previous game, though it's not like most people probably played that.\nGone are choosing more than one type of shirt to wear, or belts. You can no longer use your phone to dial numbers, or call taxis to transport you or ambulances to heal you. They removed a lot of activities as well as a lot of really cool things the other games had. So many, in fact, that I could probably spend a whole paragraph just listing them.\nThis is for a large part subjective, but the gangs in this game are very unimpressive by Saints Row standards. It comes down mostly to character writing, but the characterization on each faction is not good; motivations are usually left vague and most characters introduced besides the replacement Saints members are left undefined with little personality.\nThe game is extremely buggy (compared to the others in the series, although it's not quite Bethesda level) and the netcode is pretty bad too. Playing co-op is often pretty difficult because most actions done by both players will be out of sync with each other.\nAlso, it isn't a well-optimized port for PC. The graphics are sub-par for the most part, but the game still runs like garbage most of the time. Sub-60 FPS on high unless you're playing on a top-of-the-line system (by 2011 standards).\nOh, and one time I switched to one of the radio stations and was given a 2 minute long lecture by the DJ about how I'm \"wasting my life pressing buttons in a murder simulator\" and how I should \"go out and get a girlfriend or something.\" Game just killed itself on anything immersion related for breaking the fourth wall and trying to antagonize me for playing a video game. Ironically enough.\nThanks Volition.\nMost of the DLC in this game is low-quality and overpriced, and most of them except for the mission packs are already on the disk, by the way.\nThe co-op is cool is you have someone to play it with.",
      "I backed this game back at the end of September 2013 and have finally played it through to completion. \n\nCandle is a beautifully unique game which takes elements from puzzle, platforming and point and click adventures. The puzzles, although sometimes frustratingly difficult, are all different and use different mechanics keeping the game engaging and fresh. Teku's Candle is such a interesting game mechanic that I really enjoyed getting to know and learn. As previously said, the game looks and sounds absolutely stunning. I don't think I have seen a game that looks this good before and that is attritubuted to every character and scene being hand drawn. Controls can be a bit finicky but not game breaking and you can easily adjust too. I would recommend getting this game because it provides a great whole experience.",

      "Very fun game if you are looking for a cozy relaxing farming sim. if you had a hard time with the fishing mechanic in stardew valley then you will have an easier time with this game, ontop of that there are lots of cute little rhythm games to play and the animal raising is alot more in depth then stardew. just a little note of warning to new players, the game doesn't make this very clear but you shouldn't spend too much time gardening in your first year. Automatic watering systems aren't available until later on and if you are like me you will think making the biggest profit possible year one is a great idea but I accidentally ended up upgrading/unlocking everything except irrigation in my first year and now do not have much to spend my currency on. Other then finishing catching every fish, maybe decorating my farm/the village and getting the rare coloured animals theres not much else to do in the game for late game content. It feels like there is the intention of possibly adding more content later on? either way if you decide to play, for your first play through I really recommend exploring first and getting to know the villagers before you start large scale farming.",

And yes, it's got lots of micro transactions. I bought 35,000 VC for my career, but i didnt feel forced. Don't wanna buy? THEN DON'T! It's playable whether you buy or not.

She got it for me, as a means to help with some of my mental health issues I suppose? But it just was very big miss for me, and kinda made me feel worse.

      "I love this game. I've clocked over 300 hours in it through Origin (on my ONE character xD ). It's an excellent game, even despite it being an \"open world faffaround simulator\" which was all the rage at the time.\n\nAnd finally on Steam!? Yay! Or yay..?\n\nBut, as we know, we can't have good things. Massive thumb down to the EA Origin \"integration\" in Steam. EA, how about just stop being such massive ducks?\n\nThis is the same \"we hate our customers\" behaviour expressed by d-bags like Ubisoft and Epic. Only that EA sort of makes it worse. They *know* how much people hate the unnecessary and malicious Uplay \"integration\" that Ubisoft have forced on us for several years. Seeing this, EA decides that doing the exact same thing, with their total-garbage Origin client made even worse, is surely the only way to harass the customers enough to be worthy of the EA brand. \n\nDO NOT BUY OR LINK your Steam account if you own the game on Origin from earlier. \nIf you buy a game on Steam, which you already own on Origin, it will overwrite your Origin game.\nIf you then refund the game on Steam, this will remove the game from Origin too (even if you already own it there!), and you'll spend hours in line to get a hold of customer support. Then you must chat with bots, or people who are so void of understanding (and likely not paid near enough to care) that they might as well be bots. And if you're lucky, you might, after going through 4 or 5 different \"agents\", finally get to talk to a person that comprehends English and is authorised to do anything beyond telling you \"they'll discuss it with their team\". Then you might get your game back. \nBut! You won't get back the GOTY. Because the Steam-Orgin-GOTY overwrites your Origin GOTY. And when refunding, via Steam, you're left with a dumb/lame/placeholder copy of the GOTY in your Origin library, which doesn't work, but somehow just lingers there. Then you need to get a Digital Deluxe Edition + all DLC to get back to where you were.\n\nThis [integration] is such a tremendous show of manure, that I'm actually left wondering if EA planned it. Did Andrew Wilson take one of his billions of pocked change and say \"hey, we should make an extra effort here, to make sure that this integration is as frustrating and poorly implemented as possible, but still functional, such that things are barely limping along but just barely, because nothing is as frustrating as something that just barely sorta works but only sorta, and only by the skin of its teeth. That'll teach those entitled peasants.\"\n\nSo yeah. Great game. Bad EA.\n\nUpdate! A new Origin experience: The EA App! An all new website, wrapped inside an all new Electron wrapper! For an all new Frustrating(TM) experience and much better hogging of your PC performance.",

      "Would I recommend DBD? ...It's complicated.\n\nDead By Daylight is an unique experience of asymmetric hide and seek/tag with shifting rules. \nIs the game fun? Yes. Is it creative? Yes.\nIs it fair and enjoyable? Well, it depends.\nGames get very intense, and playing as killer is some of the most intense gaming experience I've ever accumulated...\nWhich is where things often go wrong. The survivors seem to have decided that the killers have to honor strict code of rules. Don't use these items, these abilities, or these strategies. If you do, you'll be insulted after the game.\nIf you follow these rules, the odds are that you will spend the game running in literal circles, the survivors will win, t-bag you at the gate and then insult you after the game. I don't know about you, but that kind of ruins the game for me. It is actually kind of amazing how helpless one can feel in this game.\n\nSo to conclude my thoughts; I really like the game, but I also really hate it. I can't recommend it, as every time I fire it up, there is about 50% chance I feel more harassed, than entertained.\nI play a lot of online games, from League of Legends to Tekken, but this is the only one that makes me frequently think: \n\"I should really uninstall this\"\n\nEdit: \nI returned after a long break, and I still kinda like the game. \nHowever, same pattern repeats whenever I return. Eventually, I get teabagged one time too many and uninstall the game. The game is fun, the community could not be much worse. And sadly, that often ruins the experience.",

      "AAA Industry: NOOOOOO!!! You can’t have a high quality and feature complete campaign with only a 6.5 GB install made by one guy using Unity, it has to be 200+ GB made by 5 studios and it needs to be an unfinished 3 hour mediocrity and gouge the consumers $70 USD for it!\n\nThis game: [b]HAHA LEG CHAINSAW GO BRRRR[/b]",
      "You will enjoy the game at the beginning, it's fun and entertaining...Until you start playing the harder and larger hospitals and you get plagued with bad pathing issues, bad AI, people getting stuck in rooms, people dieing but they idle in a death state and stay around forever and all kinds of glitches which kills the enjoyment and ruins the management aspects. I've had to stop playing this game until they patch it because right now you're just managing bugs and glitches and you will have to design hospitals to get around these bugs, so that means extra wide corridors and spacing items out so people don't get stuck. Which sucks.\n\nNeeded much more playtesting before being released.\n\n*This is from v1.01.*",
      "Saw a few youtube videos on this and decided to check it out.  Only played 30 min but here's my review from that. \n\nCustomization options are disappointing and boring. All of the character skins were white guys (and a possible vanilla Mexican). The option not to add other races at least to the Allied side is weird. As a gamer, when given the option for customization I expect to be able to create a character I at least somewhat feel represents me so I can get immersed (and don't even talk about 'historical accuracy'). They're also level locked for some reason. The uniforms are basic as they should be and you have a very limited weapon selection depending on the class you choose which is standard for these kinds of games. The character customization is very lacking and the only real reason I see it being there is to create DLC uniforms to buy. \n\nThe game itself seems like it's going in slow motion and maybe it's something people get used to after a while but I couldn't deal with it. The run is more like a speed walk and it feels like the soldier is considering being a conscientious objector with the amount of hesitation in aiming. Also everyone was kind just playing the game like Battlefield anyway.\n\nThis is probably a game that's more fun to play in a serious MilSim community.",
      "Was a bit turn off when I saw it was a stationary shooter, but the game is so fun I look past that and even began to enjoy the room scaling dodging mechanics (game can make you work up a sweat!).\n\nA must for anyone looking for a more intense arcade shooting experience. I cannot overstate how fun it is to build your weapons in VR, the crafting system works flawlessly and seemely without the need of menus or UIs getting in the way, props for the devs for how well the game integrates with VR controls.\n\nWhat I liked:\n- Varied enemies\n - Great VR controls\n- Gun crafting is addicting and allows for a lot of experimentation\n- Great Bosses\n\nWhat I had trouble with:\n- Makes you wish you could run around the rooms like the original game!\n- The reduced FOV of most VR headsets makes it quite difficult to keep track of enemies that come from multiple directions. Some rooms require so much head movement that I tend to get sick.\n- When a room spawns with multiple shield pylons and a healer bot, it gets extremely frustrating if you have slow moving projectile weapons.\n\nWishes:\n- More gun parts! (Maybe future DLC?)",
      "Luzia reminds me of a little me and the banter between the characters is very cute. \nThis game gives me big Spirited Away vibes but even after I finished it I am still lowkey confused who is who and what what whats've? \nThere were many touching moments [spoiler]esp the scene where Luzia said \"I can't save you but I can help you\" it struck me pretty hard because I always question whether or not one has the right to take their own life, and who are we to stop them...[/spoiler] Overall I actually feel this game is wholesome. It can teach one about what depression is like if you've never experienced it.\nI only got jumpscared once but it was a pleasant experience even then :3",
      "The game is very good, it's fun and had everything to be a great success, but unfortunately because the anti-piracy, the game doesn't work well, even above 100 fps it feels lag, the game stutters, a strange gameplay.\n\nJust REMOVE DENUVO and the game will have the deserved success.\n\nUnfortunately, they still haven't realized that those who pirate, don't spend money with or without protection, and those who pay like us, have a game with problems.\n\nA good game doesn't need protection to sell, just be good, simple as that.",
      "I have mixed feelings about this game. It could have been very very good but has been let down by some very shoddy quality issues. This would not in itself have been a problem BUT given its AAA high price tag, to be honest, the consumer deserves better in terms of finish and execution. To name a few of the irritations:\n1.) AI characters shooting through walls.\n2.) Poorly realised inventory system (You can't compare stats of your secondary weapon with inventory items)\n3.) Camera does not follow actions during combat\n4.) Right click items in inventory and you do not always get the correct sub menus.\n5.) Mouse & Keyboard use was definitely an afterthought in terms of design\n6.) The frustrating click to confirm attribute/perk/talent spend.\n7.) UI does not always detail consumed action points to move to a location during combat\n\nAs I said lots of irritations that normally, in an indie game such as this, you would expect... but NOT when the publisher charges AAA prices.\n\nEz\n",
      "Guys literally only want one thing and it's this.\n\npure JRPG nostalgia",
      "Everything apart from the matches is superb, best FM ever. \n\nThe match engine is fundamentally broken - too easy to split a defence open with a long ball resulting in a one-on-one, so SI nerfed the conversion rates of one-on-one chances to keep scorelines acceptable. The result however, is that your world class  striker misses 2-5 easy chances every game. \n\nWingers do not square the ball for strikers, instead preferring to shoot from obscenely acute angles rather than play the ball across the box. \n\nHalf the crowd is a repeated man in an orange jumper. This may sound minor but it's really immersion breaking once you notice it. You can be a team that plays in blue, and yet over 50% of the crowd are dressed in orange. It diminishes the match experience and detracts from the game as a whole.\n\nIt's crap like this, broken for 2 months now, I've bought every game in this series since the year 2000, I pre-order every year (literally the only game I will do so with) and said I'll continue to do so until I get burned. Well, SI Games, you've broken me at last. The 'Bugs' section of your forum is littered with these issues that are \"under review\", well you can consider my purchase of FM 2021 in the same category.\n\nEdit: I played a bunch more because apparently I'm a masochist. The match engine is total cack and has regressed massively since FM 2017. Don't waste your money - take up a more enjoyable pastime such as jamming needles in your eyes, you'll thank me for it.",
      "Yes, the Origin client is somewhere between annoying and broken, depending on your hardware. And yes, Dragon Age Keep is still a big jumble of poorly explained choices that affect your game in a thousand little ways if you choose to use it. And yeah, none of the old technical issues really got fixed before coming to steam - this isn't a remaster - so shiny hair and lips for everyone.\n\nBut it's nice to be able to take a walk in Thedas again, and sink into the story, and admire what is probably the last real Bioware game before EA completely turned them into another ouroboros of live service bullshit. \n\nGet it on sale, for the nostalgia if nothing else.",
      "I'm gonna give this a thumbs up but with like, idk, a cautionary sideways thumb for maybe. \n\nif I read credits right, it looks like this game had all its programming, art, music, and writing done by one guy, so I have to give respect to that. For a real indie game like this, it's very very good. \n\nBut it's still really flawed. If you're looking for a 2D Metroid game, and you've played EVERY other 2D metroid game, I suppose yeah, go for this one, and I think you'll enjoy it. If you're not a fan of metroid, I would not bother, sadly. This game suffers from a lot of problems from metroid games, and does not fix any, and at times exagerates those problems. \n\nThe art style is very interesting and cool, but the way the levels and map design are, leaves most areas feeling like a mess of unmemorable places. \n\nThe combat is INCREDIBLY simplistic, yet somehow bogged down by WAY too many useless weapons and just kind of badly designed controls. I found there were about 5 weapons that were actually useful in the game out of what seems like more than 10. Most enemies you either cheese, or be cheesed. There's no charge up shots, there's not really much nuance to the enemies or bosses. They have about two attacks and repeat while you dodge the same one bullet pattern and just kind of shoot in their general direction. (I played it on hard by the way. Not a particularly difficult game, but even the slightly challenging stuff felt kind of dull and uninteresting.) \n\nThe music was cool again. nothing quite mind blowing, but it was nice. The world itself seems like a mess, but there are cool ideas. The giant robot people were really cool to see. \n\nOne little idea i really liked is that the LOW HEALTH beep sound is actually in sync with every song in the game. I thought that was really cute, and it's not something I've seen any game do. Sounds dumb, but I give a lotta props to that, it was cool. \n\nWriting is okay. I feel it left more to be desired. There seemed to be an interesting world here that wasn't explored enough. It wasn't bad, I suppose, but not really that great. \n\nThat is kind of this game. It's not bad by any means, but not the best game on the planet. Play it if you're in need of a Metroid game, and I'm certain you will be pleased enough despite the flaws. Even if you're just having a hankering for a platformer and have already played Hollow Knight and some other great ones first, I think you should enjoy this, but don't expect a 10/10 game. \n\nGive it a try if you feel it looks interesting.",
      "[h1]I enjoyed the game. Negative reviews can be more helpful though. One negative review can't hurt.[/h1]\n\nI'll keep the pros short:\n - Stress reliever\n - You can kill people in interesting ways\n - Mods can enhance this experience further\n\nCons:\n\n - The performance is pretty shit, so you will probably have to play with lower simulation settings, which aren't that good. Duh.\n\n - The base game is bland. Game is driven entirely by the workshop and your ability to create your own contraptions. Not a problem for me, maybe a problem for someone else.\n\n - The game can get boring pretty quickly because the loop is repetitive: spawn human, kill, repeat. This is coming from someone with over 400 hours played.\n\n - Not really game related, but if you don't like sticking around in communities that are often toxic, childish, annoying and the members are often kids or younger teens [spoiler](I would name a few examples but I feel like angering more than 1 fandom is a death sentence)[/spoiler], then avoid the community and stay away as far as possible and just grab your mods and run. Avoid the workshop comment sections, or just a lot of stuff in the workshop, the community tab, etc. It's just full of self-entitled kids who think they're hot shit.\n\n- Not sure how true this is nowadays, but some things on the workshop are just like farm spam, meaning the trending page was often filled with spam.\n\nRead the comments for anything I possibly missed to add but someone else mentioned.\n\nIn short:\nBuy the game if you like violence and looking like a crazy person that people wanna avoid from fear. It's pretty cool.\nDon't buy it if you aren't interested in that.\n\n[spoiler]The only reason I enabled comments is to possibly show how correct the community point is.[/spoiler]",
      "The premise is that you're a passenger on a ship, waking up on the morning after you've murdered your well-to-do husband. From that point, you're free to go anywhere on board to do whatever you can to avoid justice within the time limit. You could just try to play dumb and cover up enough evidence to put your guilt into doubt. If you're more devious you could try to frame one of your fellow passengers. You could even go the And Then There Were None route and murder everyone else on board just to be thorough, if you can pull it off.\n\nOverboard! was clearly designed for replayability. The ship is full of evidence and red herrings to tamper with, desperate schemes to attempt, and secrets to learn. The first playthrough reveals only a small slice of all this, leaving a collection of unsolved mysteries and unfollowed leads to pursue on the second. The second playthrough prepares you for the third, and so on, until finally you beat the game... but there's much more to it than that. Vague, but I don't want to spoil anything.\n\nThis game was released today without any kind of announcement beforehand from inkle. As usual, their writing and design are superb. If you're captivated by the premise, even by a little, you won't regret the purchase.",
      "Lemme give it to y'all straight, who are on the fence;\n\n- Yes, the game is very much worth it at full price.\n\n- One of the first games in a long while, that has kept me up until 5 A.M. in the morning, because of how lost I get myself into it.\n\n- Doesn't do dumb jump scares, save for a VERY FEW TIMES, and each one counted.\n\n- The game is maybe one of the best zombie based games out there, so long as you do enjoy it with action.\n\n- Parkour in the game is AMAZING. Sometimes I like just playing the game, so I can run\naround, across roof tops, and attacking zombies while talking to friends.\n\n- Co-op in story mode. Freaking amazing. No dumb lobby. Just click 'Join game' and bam,\nyou'll be thrown a few feet away from a friend without them sometimes even noticing you joined!\n\n- Single play and Co-op have a huge impact; co-op feels fun, slightly safer, and adds a lot in the form of friendly rivals! Single player feels way more tense and everything you do counts, making you second guess some choices, for fear or death. Night time in either mode is fun as heck, though four co-op makes it pretty easy.\n\n- Night and Day feel almost like two different modes. In the day, zombies shuffle around, falling off rooftops, being dumb, easy to avoid and kill. Night time? Get those UV Flares ready, and be ready to flee if they catch sight of you.\n\n- Even after beating the story, I keep coming back for more, as it's super fun.\n\n- Took me around 30 hours to do the story, which also included only HALF of the side missions. Still got a little over 50% left to go, and looking forward to it!\n\nTL;DR - Get the game, find friends to play with, enjoy the hell out of one of the few games worth it at full price.",

      "Hi, here's an honest review. Yes I was very hyped about this game, like many of us.\n\nPROS\n-Cheap price \n-Besides that, nothing outstadning,  mostly a blatant copy of dayZ.\n\nCONS\n-Poor optimization, I have a 1070 OC edition with a ryzen 1700 and I play on 1440p, in new titles I usually get 70-100 fps on high-ultra, but in this game I get an outstanding 40-70 fps on MEDIUM, usually 55 when in forest, which is bad, since only 6% of users on steam have 1070 and higher gpus.\n-Servers... Before releasing a game, might as well check if servers work, I can't connect to most of the servers, or the server to which I connect are choppy and laggy (or maybe it's the game?)\n-No loot in normal buldings like regular houses and shacks, and by no loot I mean nothing found, besides nails and metal sheets which are essential to some crafting but you can't afford to carry them due to very limited inventory space when you spawn in. And I haven't found a backpack either. The place to loot is the Airfield but it's made challanging with the 2 robots walking around which is alright but since you cannot find anything anywhere it's rather annoying ( I have found guns and gear from dead bodies) \n-The mouvement is not great, feels unfished and choppy and that scroll wheel sprinting is disgusting.\n-The Metabolism, which they emphasised so hard upon. I PERSONALLY detest this system, it looked interesting but when you can't find anything to keep it on point it becomes boring.\n-The graphics are bad. When compared to games like The Vanishing of Ethan Carter and What Remains of Edith Finch, this game is a shame to UE4\n\nOverall\n-Unfinished, and by that I mean it's not working properly, not the lack of content, I understand that it's early access, but the devs at least have to polish it before releasing it, so that people can play it, and then add new content and mechanics.\n\nI'm extremely dissapointed with the game, I hoped it to be a game to play for 1-2 hours per day with friends to have fun but that's not happening any time soon. I strongly advise to wait for major optimization updates and other patches before buying it",

This might not seem like a lot but go play something like Dragon Age: Inquisition and you'll know what I'm talking about.\n- You can pick up items while on horseback (also no animation), Greatly speeds up looting while in the open world\n- Summoning pools makes getting summoned for bosses is easier than ever. All you have to do is be in the same general overworld location as a pool and all location get a summon sign\n- Sooooo many more bonfire locations. Can also fast travel from almost anywhere using the in-game map.\n- packed with stuff to do. Very rarely are you walking/riding for long periods before running into a dungeon/boss/camp/npc/etc. Every single side location has something to discover, Plus you never know what you're going to get and the feeling of discovery is unlike any other game out there.\n\nThere are a lot of improvements over previous installments as well. In no particular order, here are some of my standouts:\n- POWERSTANCING IS BACK BABYYYYY. Was always my favorite thing from DS2.\n- Slottable weapon arts. Taking the weapon art system from DS3 and making it even better. This system is also tied to the weapon affinity system which allows you to switch up the scaling of a weapon at any bonfire. No more committing to a specific element or stat.\n- The open world makes the game more accessible. Hit a wall with one zone? Just go somewhere else and come back when stronger. Sekiro had this a little but this game it's extremely pronounced.\n- The statues of Marika make it so the runbacks for bosses is not nearly as grueling. These statues work as \"respawn only\" bonfires that you can choose to respawn back at and are usually just outside a boss fight room after a lengthy run. You can't rest at them or adjust your build there, but they prevent the grueling runback and allow you to smash your face into a boss over and over with minimal downtime.\n- Having a dedicated jump button but keep the power of jump attacks. Risky usually, but can also be used as a counter to low swinging attacks. This also adds into the next system of...\n- Poise breaking enemies. Is done by heavy attacking, jump attacking and guard countering. Adds even more move types to the game and makes every weapon a totally different playstyle and adds to the replay value.\n- What are guard counters? After successfully blocking and attack, you can follow it up with a special heavy attack that has high poise damage. Allows for more critical hits. You might think this makes it easier but it takes more skill than you'd think to time these ripostes and it always feels good.\n\nAs with any game, it's not for everyone, but if you love souls games, you'd be doing yourself a disservice by missing this one. If you've never played a souls game, this is the best one to try. The most accessible by far. No crazy hard tutorial bosses, the new ashen summoning bell gives some great support in difficult areas, and the fact you can always leave harder fights and come back to them later makes it so you rarely run into situations where you know booting up the game means you're gonna be brick walling until either the boss dies or you give up.",
      "Absolutely amazing. PLEASE don't judge this game based on how it looks. You must try it yourself! I thought it would be terrible but a friend convinced me to try it, and I'm glad he did. I haven't had so much fun in a game in a long time.",
      "An instant classic.\n---\n\nThe original [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/kunovega/recommended/264200]One Finger Death Punch[/url] was an unexpected treat for me. The refined simplicity of just two buttons that require masterful timing to create a legitimate fighting experience laid out to a selection of music that reminds you of the classic Kung-fu movies of the 1970's but packaged with a carefree stickman aesthetic.\n\nOne Finger Death Punch 2 is a respectable sequel in most ways. The core gameplay is fundamentally the same while the visual indicators and special attack animations have been upgraded and made more fanciful. Other things are changed simply to give you a new experience.\n\nEvery aspect of the game is polished from the interesting tutorial to the many additional modes (survival, gauntlet, etc.) that exist beyond the (very long) main campaign. Once you get into the groove there's potentially dozens if not hundreds of hours of fun to squeeze from this.\n\nThis is a game that just has to be played to truly appreciate it as the feel of your interaction along with the music is what really defines the experience. Simply watching it or looking at the screenshots doesn't do it justice.\n\nThere are a couple of (minor) controversial changes that may not appeal to some fans:\n1. The music in 2 includes a more modernized remix compared to the more traditional music from 1. Personally I love the soundtracks from both, but there are people who have a preference.\n2. The upgrades to special attacks in 2 can be a bit of visual clutter at times. I like both styles, but there are people who prefer 1 over 2.\n3. There are some sequences (like the lightsword rounds) which did not return in 2, replaced instead by other weapons. While I think it would have been cute to include all of that along with the new stuff, it's not a deal breaker. It does however mean that both games retain a bit of unique flair and a reason for you to play and experience them both. 2 is overall an upgrade, but it's also not a 100% replacement.\n\nI would strongly suggest that if you've never played either game, you should begin with the first one. I think it's a better entry point to the series and might have a slightly broader appeal. (it's also slightly cheaper).\n\nThen if you find yourself enjoying it, come back and pick up 2 and you'll find yourself with some remixed music, fancy new special attack animations and a whole new adventure to work through.\n\nJust to be very clear: Both of these games are fantastic and deserve more praise than I can properly express and I'll very likely be putting 100's of hours into this just like I did the first one.\n---\n\nBottom line: Simple to learn, hard to master, and super satisfying fighting along with a great soundtrack.\n---\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38232109/]While you are here, would you consider following my curator page?[/url]\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/kunovega/recommended/]Want to read all of my reviews and not just the curated ones?[/url]",
      "Really fun for the first few rounds... Then the game changes your control scheme without telling you, and with no way to turn it back. This has lead to several hours of frustration, trying to revert it. From what I've read, this is 'intended' to make the game more difficult, but really, is just incredible stupid. If I wanted the game to be more difficult because of a more annoying control scheme, I'd play with a god damn dance pad.\n\nThe game is really fun, but this has frustrated me to the point that I can't enjoy it any more unless it's fixed, and therefore I can't recommend it either",
      "*Sigh* This game was just tiring. I wouldn't come to say it was a complete rip off of Paper's Please, but it was a very similar game but just worse. Mainly to the point that I played, at most, 10 minutes, I saw multiple repeats of the same messages, and the only updates were legislation, unlike in Papers, Please where you got new rules and new tools almost every day. I won't completely judge the game since I haven't played it the entire way through, but it's just not very good. Plain and simple.",
      "Really need a report button to slap some senses into trolls in online matches.\nCan't even escape them at ranked. sigh\nGreat game nonetheless, 4/5",
      "Basically Wizard of Legend, but from a different viewpoint. Same composer, both pixel art, similarly fast paced boss fights with good telegraphs, combos are a little less deliberate, though. Very satisfying build making, with solid build variety. Has couch co-op which is very nice. It has some beautiful pixel art, truly. This game is a feast for the eyes and ears with cutscenes, voice acting, and more. Ok, I just love this game. It's so damn good.",
      "-This game is like the combination of old PC sidescroller like Duke Nukem (pre-3d), NES Contra, and arcade Metal Slug with 80s /90s cyberpunk and action movie tropes.\n-The cheesy humor, plot, and music is top notch. Might look like a shallow nostalgia at a glance but once you played it, they even spiritually nailed the silliness of similar games/story in that era. The guns, the character acting and lines, the costume design, etc.\n-It's not as fast paced as I thought it would be. But actually that makes it relaxing to play. Easy to get into and the challenge is just right for me without being frustrating. \n-I like how the enemies and characters are pretty diverse. \n-I haven't finished the game but I feel like this game will have similar replay value like Streets of Rage 4. Not because of there are many things to do or getting better at the game but because it's somehow just simply tight, fun, and arcadey to replay.",
      "Game is super realistic, got ahead of Hamilton and he pitted me into a wall going 180mph, just like real life!",
      "There is no skill requirement to play this game; everything seems pretty randomized including when and where the demon attacks you. Its rather difficult to play alone or just with two players. So if your looking for a game to play alone for a fright or just with one other buddy of yours. Make sure your ready to lose, This game has a great concept I just hope it will get more refined with the attacks. It seems like you get killed before you can even attempt to complete the objective.",

      "The best games Telltale has ever made, plus one that is very mediocre\n-Season One: 10/10 - A masterpiece, prepare to be hit right on the feelings and cry a lot\n-Season Two: 9/10 - Awesome, and very very sad. More tears at the end\n-A New Frontier:  7/10 - Kinda good, kinda bad, mixed feelings, not much to make me care for the new characters\n-Michonne: 3/10 - Boring as hell, uninspired history, bad characters, Michone is awesome on the comics and the show, here she´s just annoying\n-The Final Season: 10/10 - OMG this game made me cry from the beggining to the end, it´s soooo good, and the end is soooo satisfying",
      "They shadow dropped an update that literally breaks the game and DLC, and for what? Ads.... ads for RS+\n\nNo wonder piracy is the answer in this day and age when stupid business decisions like this are implemented. If I were to write a review a week ago I'd of said yes and recommended this, but this is just another shovel of dirt in the company's deep DEEEEEEEP hole of failures. I'm officially done with Ubisoft because of this. This was a great gateway to learning guitar and even the CDLC made it possible to learn songs that aren't even apart of the + library.\n\nSomeone please get to making a pirated copy of this game with all DLC as that will sell better than anything ubi throws out and it'll be free at that.",
      "This game is a cozy  winter morning, wrapped in a blanket, in the heat of the fireplace with your favorite cartoon on and cup of hot chocolate, it is x-files, it is the music that you hear while walking on the streat, it is people you know,  good people, bad people, real people. This game has the feeling of nostalgia while being totally contemporary and modern.This game is every young adult fear and existential crisis all at once. This game is pure feeling.\n\n\nthat aside, this game is pretty much a perfect game for me, the story is really interesting, the music is beautiful and the art is gorgeous, and the characters and the atmosphere are so fucking believable i think i know everybody in this game, or atleast i feel so.\n\nAs a small town dude i really relate with a lot of thing in this game.\n\nThis game is special, its special for me.",
      "This might literally be the coolest game I've ever played, and possibly the best game that I've played in the last 10 years.\n\nThough, I might be the wrong person to ask though as Earthbound is my favorite game, and this game is obviously heavily Earthbound inspired. Stylistically and comedy wise anyway. The story is much darker than anything in Earthbound, but it's all buried underneath some of the funniest writing I've ever seen in a game. The writing start to finish is amazing, I'm only dissappointed that the game wasn't longer as there's a few questions left unanswered.\n\nI did normal mode, first run, collected all characters and beat the game in 12-13 hours. For 10 dollars, that's pretty alright. The fights are pretty open ended as there are like 20+ characters you can choose from, but I ended up using Rage, Bottles and Mad Dog. I found it wasn't the hardest game I've played, but I also haven't tried pain mode yet.\n\nAnyway, if this game interests you at all, buy it. You won't regret it.",
      "I have always wanted to play Resdient Evil 4, and I wanted to play this game so badly.  I am giving a negative review simply because the games FPS on the PC are bad, that could be because of Windows 10 because I heared rumors that the game does not run well on it and such, so that could be the problem.   Another problem I faced is the lip sync is dealyed when it's on the cutscenes so that makes everything slow and such.  The gameplay from what I seen however is pretty great and I think Resdient Evil 4 is a great game, but this port is not, get it for the GC, Will, PS2, or any of the consloes that has this game.",
      "Some of the tightest controls, buttery smooth animation and gorgeous scenes you'll see all year. I've bought it three times now, (once for me, twice as gifts for friends) and each time was worth it.\n\nSupport developers like these.",
      "I'm gonna give this a thumbs up but with like, idk, a cautionary sideways thumb for maybe. \n\nif I read credits right, it looks like this game had all its programming, art, music, and writing done by one guy, so I have to give respect to that. For a real indie game like this, it's very very good. \n\nBut it's still really flawed. If you're looking for a 2D Metroid game, and you've played EVERY other 2D metroid game, I suppose yeah, go for this one, and I think you'll enjoy it. If you're not a fan of metroid, I would not bother, sadly. This game suffers from a lot of problems from metroid games, and does not fix any, and at times exagerates those problems. \n\nThe art style is very interesting and cool, but the way the levels and map design are, leaves most areas feeling like a mess of unmemorable places. \n\nThe combat is INCREDIBLY simplistic, yet somehow bogged down by WAY too many useless weapons and just kind of badly designed controls. I found there were about 5 weapons that were actually useful in the game out of what seems like more than 10. Most enemies you either cheese, or be cheesed. There's no charge up shots, there's not really much nuance to the enemies or bosses. They have about two attacks and repeat while you dodge the same one bullet pattern and just kind of shoot in their general direction. (I played it on hard by the way. Not a particularly difficult game, but even the slightly challenging stuff felt kind of dull and uninteresting.) \n\nThe music was cool again. nothing quite mind blowing, but it was nice. The world itself seems like a mess, but there are cool ideas. The giant robot people were really cool to see. \n\nOne little idea i really liked is that the LOW HEALTH beep sound is actually in sync with every song in the game. I thought that was really cute, and it's not something I've seen any game do. Sounds dumb, but I give a lotta props to that, it was cool. \n\nWriting is okay. I feel it left more to be desired. There seemed to be an interesting world here that wasn't explored enough. It wasn't bad, I suppose, but not really that great. \n\nThat is kind of this game. It's not bad by any means, but not the best game on the planet. Play it if you're in need of a Metroid game, and I'm certain you will be pleased enough despite the flaws. Even if you're just having a hankering for a platformer and have already played Hollow Knight and some other great ones first, I think you should enjoy this, but don't expect a 10/10 game. \n\nGive it a try if you feel it looks interesting.",
      "After playing thousands of games both singleplayer and multiplayer, unlocking all achievements and getting every solo map medal, I think it's time for a review:\n\nIf you like tower defence games: I recommend.\nIf you like any previous Bloons games: I recommend.\nIf you want something casual and chill: I recommend.\nIf you want a bit of a challenge: I recommend.\n\nThe tower type variety is interesting and diverse, with 5 tiers of upgrades each (plus special \"paragon\" towers)\nThe game devs have been providing free updates for years.\nThere's lots of achievements and medals to get.\nThere's online co-op, boss events and even different game-modes.\n\nThe game is more expensive than it used to be, but literally any sale price makes it worth a buy!",

      "The game balances out and improves on everything from the original KoF2002. \nThat said, this is a bit more fast-paced than other KoF games. If you've played KoF98, this one is faster and more combo heavy. If you've played 13, this one has a higher bar for executing combos. If you're coming from XI, this one doesn't have the tag system. Those are the most important changes from other popular KoF games.",
      "If you like management type games and RPGs, this is the perfect mix. It's just enough management to allow you to thrive with mostly strategy without feeling bogged down, and just enough RPG elements to get you invested in not just your squad, but each individual character in it. \n\nHere's a tale from my experience with the game;\n\nThis is the kind of game to change your entire perspective on life itself. Failure is not the end, nor the beginning, but a constant in this world that you can either let destroy you or make you stronger. Allow me to tell you a story. The story of New Battlehill. \nNear the Shek city of Squin, not far east, was a small town. It went through many names. The first that stuck was Firstyeet, totally not a placeholder. It wasn't an notable settlement, merely consisting of a shack, an iron processor, and some walls to mildly inconvenience the roving gangs of Dust Bandits that liked to bully the residents. After being evicted from their own city once again, the residents, Denver, Soto, Ruka, and Meow, vowed to take back their home. After training and buying the best weapons and armor they could, they made their way back to Firstyeet. To their surprise, however, they would not have to fight. One of the bandits had picked a fight with a herd of goats. The bandits' defense failed against the caprine assault. From this, the town would get its second name - Densorumego. Den for Denver. So for Soto. Ru for Ruka. Me for Meow. And Go for the true heroes, the goats.\nPeace would not last long but soon the residents of Densorumego would become strengthened by their constant fighting. On the elevated, somewhat round land on which Densorumego sat, there were many large fights involving a lot of people. If only there was some sort of name to reflect this... \nAnd from that, the town was renamed for the last time, to Battlehill.\nThings were looking up. The town built its first farms and expanded to be almost four times its original size. But this peace would not last. Battlehill's new ambitions of self sufficiency would attract the attention of a new foe - The Shek Kingdom.\nThe Shek claimed ownership of the land Battlehill was on, and as such, demanded all food grown there be given to them. Confident from their many victories against the Dust Bandits, the Battlehillites refused the Shek demands. Their risk was calculated... but man were they bad at math.\nAll but one were nearly killed in the ensuing battle, and the one person that wasn't knocked into a coma was stuck on the wall because part of the wall was destroyed and he could no longer reach the stairs because of that. The people knew they couldn't fight the Shek, but they would not allow themselves to be subservient either. And so began their malicious compliance. The Shek would get all the food in Battlehill, as it would be none - The Battlehillites were moving.\nI could write entire books about their journey around the west. The Fogmen, the ruins, the Screeching Bandits, there's many a tale. But, eventually, the people would find a new home. In the harsh and Beak Thing infested land of Vain, homeland of the Western Hive, they would found their new home - New Battlehill.\nJump to now, the city is thriving, they have more bread than they know what to do with, they've grown strong from defending their home from the Beak Things, and their population has grown. They are currently planning a reconquest of Battlehill, which was occupied by Dust Bandits shortly after they left.\n\nThere is a part I left out, between Firstyeet and Densorumego - I had repeatedly failed to retake Firstyeet, and I was about to quit the game. I was frustrated that I'd gone and bought the best arms and armor and still failed. And when I tried to set up a training ground on a mountain near Squin, bandits again came and defeated me. I went as far as to try and get a refund, which was denied. That refund being denied was the best thing that could've happened. I decided to give the game another try, and to try accepting my failures and growing from them. And if I hadn't done that, I would never have founded New Battlehill. None of the legend worthy tales my squad has been through would have happened. And I'd never have had the fun of going through all of them.\n\nIn short, get this game. It is just great.",

      "Early review right now after a quick hour of play.\n\nLater Alligator (and I swear I'm not biased towards this game at all) is a gorgeously 2d-animated, primarily point-and-click, cartoony romp through Alligator New York City. Everyone's alligators. The gameplay itself is simplistic; unlike normal point-and-click games of this style that you might have come to expect, there's no picking up items, there's no real big decision making. It crosses over more with Professor Layton-style gameplay, wandering around the city and picking up little collectibles by clicking on various pieces of the environment.\n\nScattered in between these are a plentiful trove of minigames in all sorts of styles. As far as I can tell, they begin to increase in complexity the further you go through (for reference, the first minigame is pretty much not fail-able; you're asked to track a Queen in 3 Card Monte, however the hapless alligator running the game barely moves the cards and flails on the two that *aren't* the queen.)\n\nHowever, it seems that the gameplay and the minigames are meant more as a vehicle for the whimsical comedy of the writing and the eclectic cast of characters present throughout the city. Each character is quirky and fun in their own way, with their own little story. And that's the real draw of this game. \n\nSo this game so far doesn't particularly lend itself to anyone looking to challenge themselves. But if you just want some good feelings, a laugh, and a spot of relaxation, Later Alligator delivers in spades.",

The only reason I stopped playing was because there was a fence that wasn't fully secured to the ground that I was able to get underneath, allowing me to get out of bounds. This lead to me falling into an area where I couldn't get out, and it wouldn't let me respawn at my most recent checkpoint. This would mean I'd have to start from the beginning, which I very much didn't want to do. Anyway, the biggest tips I can give to the developers is to make sure the map is 100% how they want it, and to make the audio design better. That's it. I may come back and change my review in the future.\n\nFINAL RATING: 4 / 10\n- Fun JRPG with some action commands thrown in, good variety of enemies, and a pretty decent skill development tree.\n\nEnemies can feel pretty tough later in the game, but its more of a puzzle when trying to complete these fights so it doesn't feel cheap.\n\nGreat soundtrack too.\n\nRuns great on Steamdeck\n- Guys literally only want one thing and it's this.\n\npure JRPG nostalgia\n- You finally don't need a guide on how to purchase the game.\n\n- 21 different story missions that each take approximately 20 to 50 minutes to complete.\n- DLC sidestory contracts - different targets but same maps.\n- Escalation contracts on those same maps; think of this as a puzzle mode.\n- The new roguelike Freelancer mode that gives randomly generated targets in a randomly generated campaign.\n\nThis game now has such a vast wealth of content that it would take you months to complete it all. I genuinely recommend it.\n- You, yes you, the person that is reading the reviews.\nI envy you because i can't play this game again for the first time.\n\nScroll back up, buy the game, get a drink and take a seat.\n\nEnjoy you waifus, music, sex stories, and reflection on your own life at 2am moments.\nDon't mind the alpacas.\n\n- I didn't like the FPS section; was honestly pretty repetitive and gratuitously violent. Also the 8 hour sex scene was a bit out of nowhere, but after like hour 3 you understand why they devote so much time to it. Overall game was ok I guess\n- Not saying this as a tough guy thing or anything, But it is difficult for me to shed actual tears.\n\nThis game made me ugly cry twice, and happy cry once.\n\nThis not a story about zombies.\n\nIt is about a little girl growing up in the worst possible situation.\n\nAnd what she makes of it.\n\n2/13/2023 finished\n\nPS: If I ever have a daughter I will name her Clementine. This is the tier of impact this game had on me we are talking about.\n- This game is basically awesome, under 3 conditions:\n\n1- You get rid of all on-screen icons (i.e. incoming attacks, ennemy spotting)\n2- Do not care about secondary missions only here to further lenghten the game's lifespan\n3- Play the game as you would if  YOU were in charge\n\nBasically, nevermind the Ubisoft micro transactions' system and other abhorrent company induced  greed-leaned system to get stuff faster and more easily by robbing you out of your hard-earned cash...you can finish the game without spending a single dime in the store, it's all pay to win...\nThe open-world aspect is very satisfying and rewarding, in terms of progression, don't fall for the micro transaction system\nCombat is easy even in the highest difficulty setting, but makes you think you are badass when you slash through waves of ennemies, whose AI is rather basic, with your arsenal of rockets, LMGs and explosives but it is satisfying as fuck!\n\nImagine strapping C4 to your plane, jump out of it, have it crashing down an ennemy outpost meanwhile you are parachuting down and throwing hand grenades their way, land on a roof and eliminate the remaining ennemies with fire ammo shotgun and a motherfucking M60 with armor-piercing bullets while throwing dynamites and there you have it...FarCry5 in a nutshell\n\nOh and don't forget about the flame-thrower lol, who doesn't love a flame-thrower scorching ennemies to their own demise eh?\n\nFarCry5 got it all, extreme freedom of how you wanna handle a situation (stealthily or all guns blazing) while being challenging enough in the highest difficulty setting!\nP.S. don't forget to turn off all the on-screen icons, really ruins it for hardcore FPS fans by making it extremely easy, please hear me out, you don't need these!\n- This game has (while this review is being written) 10076 reviews. 221 of these reviews are negative. I think this ratio of reviews is deserved and here's why:\n\n- It's a fun story, but not something outstandingly new or anything\n- No one ever can deny that it has an amazing soundtrack\n- The combat is a bit bland, but this is compensated by the fact that the game is pretty short\n- It's a short game, but definitely worth it\n\nOverall: it's just a fun short game to play on a day off. Also, I can't get this soundtrack out of my head! PLEASE SEND HELP!\n- I find it hard to describe everything I read, I’m not even the person who usually reviews games in a serious way because of my difficulty in expressing my emotion, however, I felt the need to externalize what I felt in a simple and fast way. \n\nWhat I read is not a game neither a visual novel, it's a story of a life... Everything that’s happened in this story has stolen my heart, there have been so many beautiful moments that will be impossible to forget... \nI found myself crying over tragedies that weren’t mine.\n\nThanks NOVECT for this masterpiece full of love.\n- This game is like cocaine. \nI always tell myself just one more, then im done. I'll do homework. I'll sleep. I'll eat something. \nBut you know what? That last death was cheap, I'll do one more to make up for it. I just need 1000 gold for that upgrade, I'll just do one more to get it. Always just one more. \n\nThings I like:\n\n+Strong RPG Progression - Gold from your run can be spent on stats, equipment, abilities, etc. making multiple runs and longer runs more rewarding.\n\n+The game is witty and has flavor. -- there are various conditions your new characters can have such as being blind, gay or having a fear of chickens, amongst many, many others. Dying is in this sense, pretty fun. The writing has a lot of charm!\n\n+The controls are very tight -- this game has good controls. It's easy to do what you want, which is good because it's very tough and you will die a lot.\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n- The bosses in new game plus don't get harder -- As you progress into new game + or ++ or +++ and beyond, the bosses don't scale well, despite the general enemies leveling up to basically become bosses themselves. Not a huge deal, but it's the only negative I have.\n\nThen at some point you realize you've beaten the game, Thankfully there is a new game plus.\nMaybe just one more playthrough...\n- It's a R@PE SIMULATOR. Games like this should not be played. I was tempted to play, and will do so for a few hours in future, may be a demon has possessed me...or may be I just don't waste my money that I have spent on it. But really, you should not encourage these games. Who have not bought this game, plz don't buy.\n- The good news: you came out of cryogenic suspension in good health.\n\nThe bad news: you're critically low on supplies.\n\nThe good news: there are plenty of other vessels within range.\n\nThe bad news: they're all derelict.\n\nThe good news: you have a fleet of salvage drones you can send into the derelicts to gather supplies.\n\nThe bad news: your drones aren't the only things moving around those derelicts. And the other moving things are hostile. And the half-broken infrastructure on those derelicts is prone to fail explosively. And parts of your drones and your ship break too. And your only interaction with the outside world is with the drones. And your only interaction with the drones is through a clunky command-line interface. And you may be the last human alive anywhere. And if your drones die, you're next.\n\nSo on the balance, it's mostly bad news.\n- I've played a fair amount of games during my time using Steam.\n\nI've never felt as emotionally moved by one as I have with OneShot.\n\nI don't know if anyone reading this has played Transistor, but if you are familiar with and enjoyed that game, continue reading for a little context. (I'm going to put it in spoilers because it contains an integral part of how the game functions, which is likely better for you to experience on your own, rather than learn about it from a third party. Be warned!)\n[spoiler]\nTransistor and OneShot are very different games, but both of them share a similarity in that they have been the most emotionally moving games I've played in my entire life. They both have a huge emphasis on characters, both the one you play as and the ones you interact with or are around you. They also both have brilliantly-developed environments, The combination of these two things is one of the major factors in why I've gotten so immersed in them previously.\n\nHowever, OneShot affected me notably more strongly and for much longer than Transistor, and that is for a very discernable reason. In Transistor, you experience the stories of the characters. When it all ends, you're still a third party, experiencing things through the \"eyes\" of the protagonist.\n\nOneShot, on the other hand, features *you* as basically an integral part of the story. Because of this slight difference (which may seem negligible or gimmicky at first), OneShot basically destroyed me emotionally by the end - not necessarily because of how it ended, but that it ended at all. It wasn't just story of some other charismatic protagonists that came to a close.\n\nIt was mine, and with it, my connection to everything that happened in the game.\n\nIt's really hard to put into words... but I really wanted to put this somewhere, in hopes that someone understands and agrees. :D\n[/spoiler]\n\nAnyways, random game comparison tangent over. It's a phenomenal game - easily one of tmy favorite games of all time, my only complaint being that it ended. Extremely solid 10/10.\n\nIf you enjoy story-driven adventures like Transistor, Undertale, Night in the Woods, etc., this is basically a must-buy.\n\n- I am generally not a big fan of card games, because luck is most often the deciding factor in them, and so it is also here. But there are many solid mechanics that lessen the randomness and make it enjoyable. You can plan builds and be tactical with your card purchases, so you get a strong deck that can beat the boss. \n\nOf course it is also a rougelike, you will die. But that's part of it, you can have a strategy and get better with every run. It is also addicting in a good way. There are no in game purchases, or other such garbage that is common in so many other card games.\n\nThis is one of the best games that went through Early Access, and the developers made good updates, introducing two new characters with new cards and gameplay mechanics and also further balancing the game. They are currently working on a fourth character. They also interact really well with the players, featuring artwork and being active in the discussions.\n\nThere is much to love with this game, I saw myself coming back time and time again. \nI recommend it for everyone =)\n- Don't go in expecting a Soulsborne game. \nYou don't get to customize your character.\nYou don't get to just use any weapon.\n\nThat doesn't mean it is bad. In fact, I think it's a brilliant move. FromSoft has set a narrative with this that makes for a -real- story to be told with the player, rather than AT the player like in other FromSoft titles.\n\nIf you are worried about Activision's name being on the label? Don't be. There are no microtransactions. There is no hurdles to make you pay more. You get the game, you own everything currently available for it.\nAll Activision was in charge of was creating the tutorials, and doing some QA testing.\n\nOptimization is great, as well.\n\nYou owe it to yourself to buy this game and support Fromsoft. Show Activision that singleplayer only games are alive and well. This is a gem.\n- ***NEWBIES*** At least 50%, if not more, of this game is map knowledge. So don't beat yourself up if you're  super lost and everyone is yelling at you over game chat. Just mute the salty people and report them if they TK. Trust me there are a lot of people in the game that will back you up and want to help, so don't let one bad experience make you quit the game for good.\n\nThere are a LOT of maps to learn and a lot of small details in every one. It's going to take the average person until your siege level is at LEAST 50 before you really start recognizing map layouts and details on all maps - including room orientation, call outs, soft wall, hard wall, what should be reinforced in each site, common paths of travel, etc..  And then probably until 75 until you're actually comfortable with most maps and operators. I'll give 15% to your own gun skills, 20% to team work and communication (call outs call outs call outs, people. Don't be that guy that just looks at memes after dying. Unless it's casual.), and 15% to your knowledge of the operators and ability to utilize their gadgets. \n\nMore tips:\n-There are a lot of Diamond/Plat smurfs in newcomer that like to make new accounts and s*** on actual new players because it makes them feel good for some reason, so you're better off playing quick match. \n-To learn maps faster, make your own custom games and run around in them. \n-When you die, make sure you watch the replay so you know what cheeky angle the enemy was holding and then don't do what you did next time, or use it to your advantage when you switch sides. \n-If you're not on cams, watch teammates. Look at the places they check as they sweep rooms. Watch the paths they take. Look at how they engage in gun fights and how they rotate around the map. \n-Spend the extra few dollars to buy a version with some operators - it'll make game play more fun for you and you'll have an easier time finding operators that work best with your play style. \n-Squad up with friends - being able to communicate and laugh in a discord can really improve the game experience, even if it's just one other person.\n-Best way to really understand an operator is to play them, so take advantage when there are siege events that allow you to play whoever you want. Use this information to purchase your next operator with the game currency. \n\n\n- they should pay me to be playing this lmao\n- OBJECTION, YOUR HONOR!\n\nHow can it be a hate crime if my client loved doing it?\n- DON'T BUY THIS GAME!\nThis is one of the best games I've ever played. It is quite possibly the best and most detailed Choose-Your-Own-Adventure novel ever written and if you buy it now the creators will receive *NO COMPENSATION* for their work. I am thankful i bought it when I did, while they were still involved, but due to contracting and political differences (ironically fitting for the content of the game) the 2 or 3 writers who pioneered this project were cut out and can't receive royalties anymore.\nThis is a game about the inherent flaws in dogmatic political ideologies, all ideologies including centrism and being a moderate, and it was essentially stolen by capitalists.\nI love this game with all my heart. It is a beautiful story about loss, depression, and finding meaning in a chaotic and absurd reality. Anything more is kinda spoilery so I'm gonna stop myself there. It is all narrated so you dont have to read the enormous amount of text on your own and it is HILARIOUS. Depressing at times but always that spark of humor lingers.\nDON'T BUY THIS GAME. And *DEFINITELY* don't *PIRATE THIS GAME*. Even though it is totally in line with the messaging of the game, would be a HUGE middle finger to the corporation that cut the writers out of their own creation, and is super easy to do with like an an hour of searching Reddit or something, *YOU SHOULD* not *PIRATE THIS OUTSTANDING GAME*. Thank you for reading this, I hope you do the right thing, and you should totally hit on that girl at the beginning she is super into you and there will be no repercussions. Peace.\n- Great game, Horrible new publishers who stole the IP from the original creators. Do not support these thieves\n- a catgirl, a femme fatale, a japanese idol, a doctor, a chinese soft boy, a religious twink, a merchant and an autistic university professor walk into a bar\n- If you are looking for a game that you can never master, here is the game for you.\n- Since no one with a positive review is willing to explain why, I guess I will.\n\n          Right off the bat, visually, this game is jaw-droppingly phenomenal. The lighting, presentation, and atmosphere has been brilliantly re-captured to ensure older fans from the first game feel like they are returning to somewhere that feels oddly familiar, yet holds many new and unique encounters we have yet to discover. The colors, especially the greens, pop in just the right way to further emphasize the seemingly calm and collected forest during the day that can quickly change into a dark and unsettling nightmare by night.\n\n\tEndnight has again hit the nail on the head with the combat. Considering the old system of charging up momentum to land attacks worked exceptionally well, it's understandable they did not try and reinvent the wheel. Combat has been expanded and smoothed out just enough to keep it feeling fun, fresh and different. Landing hits is just as satisfying as it was in the old game, and mastering these techniques is especially entertaining with both new enemies and their original, upgraded counterparts. \n\n\tAs far as interaction mechanics, the inventory system has been cleverly improved, and Kelvin is a genuinely cool addition to the game. For other friendless losers such as myself, having Kelvin around is good company. Interacting with him is intuitive and straightforward, and losing track of him isn't a problem with the GPS you get right off the bat. Starting off with some way to orient yourself in a map that's five times bigger than the first game is also a welcome change. The \"quick inventory\" while you're on the move is a welcome upgrade as well. The crafting menu has also been improved, separating custom buildings from presets, which makes it easier to keep track of what you can make using custom buildings. Unfortunately, the garbage control scheme returns so for the first five minutes into my new save I was making the game playable instead of... playing the game.\n\n\tBut holy smokes the building is 1000% better than the first game. You still have your already mentioned presets for use in a pinch, and you have the massively improved custom building. Instead of laying out where you want everything to go all at once, you get to pick and choose as you create your desired structure, which makes it way easier to manage your resources while making it, and also allows you to make changes as you see fit. This is a huge step up from the previous game, and it's great.\n\n\tI see some complaints with the performance but I personally had no issues. With the medium preset my game ran at a rock solid 75-80 fps, which is perfectly fine for a game like this. Survival games don't need absurdly high frame-rates; what's more important is certainly the frame times and consistency. And my game would rarely drop frames, it again stayed at 76-77 fps with little deviation.\n\n\tI think that's really this game in a nutshell. The first game, but with pretty much every mechanic getting upgraded and reworked in a positive way (for the most part). There's some reused sound FX throughout the game which I thought was a little disappointing, but there have to be some expectations with a team of just 30 people. People get wrapped up in the fact that visually it competes with triple-A games, but those same people forget a tiny team of 30 put this together, and they are only asking for 30 bucks, which is a steal for a game with this much visual fidelity and replayability. Not to mention the oncoming free updates that will only add more content. It's certainly okay to be critical of a product and point out its flaws, but with expectations in check, this comes out as a pretty solid game.\n- It was a nice little trip, about 8 hours of gameplay (A bit more if you feel like grinding)\nStory went along nicely from start to end, in no place felt rushed.All sidequest can be done as you progress on the story.\nCombat is nice, and gotta apply every mechanic you had learnt about to fight the final boss.\nThe music, both in fights and background is really nice, has some nice Cyber-future feel\nRecommended? Yes. \nRating 9/10. Hoping for DLC or sequel soon enough\n- Sticking with the usual air of cool and weird and the usual musical flair, the latest Cosmo D entry changes up the FPS gameplay for a dice rolling RPG with quirky characters and little surprises to be found (and making pizza, of course). Can be beaten in a couple of hours but rewards multiple playthroughs for different gameplay paths and endings that can be mixed up with difficulty modifiers and challenges.\n- Shoot first ask questions later, like real life. Maybe pepper spray a pregnant woman.\n- The best game ever made by Valve. Great story, beautiful dialogues with funny jokes, interesting puzzles, perfect atmosphere and a lot of fun in co-op with friends. You made a great work, Valve, and thank You for this absolute masterpiece.\n10/10.\n- This game was a real treat. I played the 1st Valfaris and became an instant fan. I love that this is direction went by the developers, I feel it was a really good evolution of the series and mixing it up with a shoot em up gives it that extra punch/kick/slash. The graphics, characters and bosses are just so awesome and you can feel the grittiness of the mechs. Aside from the awesome game play, the environments and atmosphere has really leveled up. Love the boss destruction sequence as you can feel that accomplishment of kicking its ass. looking forward to Valfaris next installment. Congratulations with this metal AF game!\n- This game is boring, and the workshop is too little too late. In short, you should purchase Valheim. Its the best money Ive ever spent on Steam, and would have gladly paid three times the price. Perhaps in the future, other game Devs will make games like Valheim , and stop releasing garbage like this, or Red Dead, or CyberPunk, or Assassians Crud, Ect.\n- Incomphrehesible UI, sloppy controls.\n\n\nGranted I'm a day one player, but very steep learning curve. Couldn't figure out interstellar nav, for the life of me, and the touchy controls made the dogfighting a chore. Save your money. This isn't a jump in and play game.\n- TL;DR - 80-90s retro fun. Will prove you wrong if you think FMV games couldn't ever be good. Check out 5 seconds of playthrough if unsure.\nNOTE: Story isn't written in this review as game is reliant on mysterious plot. \n\n　　　For those unfamiliar, FMV stands for full motion video where you are playing a game that is based primarily/largely on the usage of pre-recorded video clips. Though it is no longer a frequented genre in video gaming, during the 90s, FMV games on CDs would often lead me into the darkened halls of many a thrilling Sherlockian mystery adventure. Unfortunately the majority of FMV games were downright awful. Pre-recorded videos with a small quantity of scenes by actual actors caused the a gaming experience to feel boxed in. Astoundingly, Her Story does the exact opposite while still being as classically FMV as FMV games go. It displays FMV like a shield of pride with the added old school touches being tasteful to a tee. As the game is \"turned on\", the screen whirring into action like any early 90s PC would, making the familiar creaking and croaking, players are introduced to their in-game desktop. The thick 90s computer monitor flares a little and in its reflection can be seen the old tube shaped fluorescent lamps that were common fixtures in most public buildings back then, flickering and popping from time to time. It is like playing a game in the past without the annoying performance issues. [spoiler]The glare on screen where you can see a better reflection towards the end made me jump a little here and there. It is fabulous as a \"moodsetter\" like many of the other suppositious yet important details that worked towards the game's impressive little plot.[/spoiler] In addition to the other details, the background music between searches where players are looking at the desktop felt like a good touch and appropriate in terms of guiding players (reacts to clips/progress etc). There is such an abundance of both subsidiary and essential detail in this game that I'd be happy with the mere nostalgia prompting ambiance. It is an added bonus, which isn't too recurrent in indie games these days where there is a deficiency in either style or story, that makes Her Story such a good FMV. It differs because players can feel as if they are in control as every person works towards the ending down a differing path depending on how they decide to investigate which is conducted solely by which searches are brought up how and when. The secret to any game that lacks the variety and freedom of choice by \"genre default\", is to give the player as much control as possible within the walls of that rigid reality. Within the uncomplicated, search - watch - find clues - check Db repertoire, players are given room to stretch and investigate on their own. The mastery is in the details so it is crucial to pay attention. Everything is told methodically and the acting that seems off in places makes much more sense once you piece the evidence and videos together. You are the \"detective\".\n\n　　　This superlative story told through proficient acting by the talented Viva Seifert (also musician/former British gymnast) weaves a surprisingly thick plot into a very lugubrious tale and the eerie horrors of the truth become more evident the more you unveil. The \"wifey killed him\" synopsis we are inclined to linger on in theory is not as discernible in-game as you'd imagine and it'll keep you guessing and alarm you at several progression points. It'll make your thoughts run wild but mostly you'll be wrong with those assumptions until you get the whole picture, as in as close to 100% off the clips as you can. The short clips have a role in that you're piecing together a very large puzzle. The splintered pieces of a total 7 interviews leaving you with 271 videos spanning between mere seconds to a couple of minutes will feel jumbled up so receiving the story in abstruse titbits as such makes you feel like your own little Jessica Fletcher and adds to the anticipation of piecing everything together. If possible I imagine it would be a fun \"couch co-op\" game for an afternoon in with a friend/SO taking notes and guessing the story together (plot contains mature content). \n\n[i]Other interesting things[/i]:\n- Doesn't stop running while you do other things so you can open up your notepad and type there if you'd rather that over pen and paper\n- Search history is helpful. Anti-Glare Filter is a nice touch. Yellow subtitles are very British. \n- The odd title is actually fittingly chosen\n- Database Checker on your desktop screen will display the overall progress you make, creating a timeline for your discoveries so investigation will be smoother\n- Each keyword brings up 5 clips at most (excluding default keyword*). Keep a list of words that stick out in clips and if you get too stuck, use default keyword to bring up whole Db\n\n*[i]Default keyword:[/i] [spoiler]BLANK[/spoiler] Using the default is not optimal. Uncovering new snippets in turn revealing new clues/plots urging you to solve the case yourself is most of the fun.\n\n[b]TIP[/b]: All clips found will have the default keyword in its details. I assigned a number for every new top she wore. Examples: [spoiler]BLANK5, BLANK1 etc..[/spoiler]. An easier method is just deleting the whole keyword for each clip watched, never to return. ;)\n\n　　　Though the sweet yet unnerving finale didn't feel as inspired, the wrap up was still nicely done. People who are new to FMV games may find it harder to get into, but it has a good depth of story to tell for the short game (3-4 hrs) that it is and I recommend it to people who enjoy a good tale. Chances are it's either going to feel like something new and interesting or old school and nostalgic. \n\n[i]Bought game on dev's site: $4.99 (Steam key + DRM free version).[/i]\n- What a refreshing experience, returning to Ishimura yet again, but with a nice new coat of paint!\nAfter so many years, we finally got a \"new\" Dead Space game, and surprisingly, they actually delivered! \n\nThere are some differences in story and other details, but honestly I think it was all tastefully done.\nThe gameplay borrows from the games after Dead Space 1, like being able to TK enemies with spikes and their claws properly, along with stomping for loot!\n\nThere are also some new differences, like new side missions for extra story, and being able to return and explore areas you have previously been to, which I think was a wonderful addition.\n\nThere were a few small issues occasionally, I imagine with time these may be touched upon, but mainly it was fps hitching when loading new areas sometimes, and very rare crashes (I crashed twice through the entire playthrough)\n\nOtherwise I kept a stable fps for most of the game on Ultra settings, and didn't really experience any other issues (RTX 2080)\n\nIt really was just overall a great singleplayer experience for one of my favorite franchises, and I hope this will do well enough, so we can see more Dead Space in the near future from now on! \n\nGreat game, beautiful visuals, and wonderful experience, for any Dead Space fan. \n\n(Also small side note, you receive the original Dead Space (2008) suit upon visiting your stores inventory, which is a very welcoming surprise! Fun to wear if you are feeling oldschool)\n- [i]While the artwork and combat remain enjoyable, the story, writing, and pacing were a major letdown.[/i]  \n\n***\nMINOR SPOILERS BELOW. If you're going to play the game, play before reading.\n***\n\n[b]The mature storylines, hard-hitting decisions, beautiful worldbuilding, and tight writing that made the first two so immersive is not present in this game.[/b] (You'll notice immediately that the writing for the caravan in the capital is [i]particular[/i] trite, awkward to read, and uninteresting.)\n\nUnfortunately, it's not just the writing that's weak. [i]The pacing is off.[/i] Antecedents are confusing, characters you'd expect to speak don't, events that should have been foreshadowed come out of nowhere. More frustrating are the serious character continuity \"errors,\" and arcs that disappear, change, or go nowhere. [i]In short, the events, decisions, and conflict from the previous games do not appear or resolve in a way that was suggested by the previous two[/i].\n\n\nHere's one example. In Banner Saga 2, Fosolt is unexpectedly rescued by Bolverk. [i]\"I have a message for Alette from the dead varl king,\" [/i]he said. That's pretty intriuging! Maybe there's a mystery, an oracle, an item, or just cool information about the Varl and their strange king? Maybe there'll finally be context about the bridge decision!\n\n[i]No! He has nothing interesting to say or add, and then his storyline just gets dropped and forgotten.[/i]\n\nWell, Bolverk's been possessed by Bellower! Gosh, who knows what Bellower will say? In fact, I can't wait to find out what happens to Bellower's body! \n\nWell, actually, Bolver's [i]not[/i] possessed, not really, certainly not like it was implied last game, and Bellower's body -- [i]a primary focus of the first two games[/i] -- isn't mentioned [i]once[/i]\n\nOr how about how they casually mention that Eyvyn is not only the [i]head[/i] of the Valka order, but also that he's had periodic bursts of hereditary madness all along? That's... odd. And it's not presented as an well-thought out [i]reveal[/i] or anything. It's presented matter-of-factly, like they were trying to ret-con in a less interesting story, or were tone deaf.\n\nYou'll notice that all the characters are underutilized and have unfulfilled storylines/tensions. Hakon has hard choices to make; Canary's a little crazy; Yrsa is mysterious; Gil's in love with Alette, etc. Will these build into choices? Reveals? Dependent endings based on choices? Will there be discussions referencing the past? Reflections on travels? Hints of despair?\n\nNo. In mine, Gil was [i]murdered[/i] and no one even bothered to reference it. Canary's situation never comes to a head. You never have to choose between Varls and Humans. Murdering people doesn't make people threaten to leave. Ubin returns randomly as an uber Varl and he's... learned the horseborne's language? Travelled the southlands? In like, a month? In a way that doesn't advance the plot? It's just... weakly done.\n\n\nThere are [i]so many[/i] examples like this, where the stories don't quite fit correctly, where what you picked up on in the early games about the [i]mysteries[/i] and the [i]world[/i] and what made it a [i]vibrant[/i] place were forgotten about by the writers. [b]The result is that it the game plays out in unsatisfying ways, in tenseless scenarios made vapid by watered-down morality, an inability to leverage the situation in fun ways, and low-quality writing, paucity of choice-making, a lack of exploration, lack of plot twists, simplified overworld mechanics -- all culminating in an almost staggeringly one-dimensional and shallow ending.[/b]\n\nThe Banner Saga series was always an experience that was greater than the sum of its part. An [i]experience[/i]. Of being [i]riveted[/i] to the computer, checking the map, worrying over supplies, guessing at mysteries, having my breath taken away at each hill. Unfortunately, that's not the case in this game. \n\n\nGameplay-wise, it's also a bit of a letdown. Combat is fun-ish, but you can make invincible character combinations and the mechanics don't even try to deal with this. There's an interesting new reinforcement mechanic that's not used heavily, and never pushes you like you think the end of the world would. You never really have to split up your forces. There's no novelty. Like maybe using a hero in a battle makes them fatigued, so you have to switch them up? Maybe you can station them different places, making them unusable for combat? Maybe you need to choose eight for a secret mission caravan? Maybe dream sequences? No, nothing like that. \n\nThe overworld gameplay had some changes that never really felt significant. Moreover, quite a bit felt taken away. You can't rest, do training missions, no longer weigh food vs upgrades. One example of all thise tone deafness was Iver's march through the destroyed world was consistently at \"Great Morale!\"\n\nThere didn't seem to be many flavor choices (\"Do we hang the criminals or let them join us?\"), including much less on social themes (\"Should women fight, if it disturbs the traditionally-minded men?\" \"One clan's rowdy, what do we do?\" \"They threaten to leave if so and so isn't banished\"), and less delayed results and fewer significant decisions, including among the game's built-up tensions among the factions. \n\n\nThere's also some cases of development [i]feeling[/i] cheap. Remember opening Banner Saga 2, and feeling that it was [i]fresh[/i], and [i]upgraded[/i]? There's little to make you feel that way here. The artwork is okay, but the environments feel more generic, with less variety, and the surreal landscapes in the darkness aren't especially interesting to look at for long periods of time. Iver is voiced by Bolverk's voice actor, and they sound exactly the same. The new title system is a fun idea, but is visually integrated into the game's menu system with the finesse of a cheap mod. \n\nThere's a moment in the game where the screen goes black for scrolling text and voiceover narration explaining the upcoming mechanic. Um, a character can't explain that? It was similar how the many two second animations are used, not to supplement the story, but to [i]replace[/i] written portions, making you feel unsure about what's going on. And finally, the game's pretty short, without fun combat challenges or interesting newgame+ challenges. \n\n\nWhat's [i]particularly[/i] frustrating is that the game's release date was moved forward four months. I don't know the story why, but I do know that a few more months of polish and story embellishment might have delivered the beautiful, grippingly interactive story we were hoping for. Because this is a watered down version of the previous two in just about every way.\n\nThis negative review is for whatever processes lead to this mediocre finale.\n\n---\n\n[i]Here's a plot that would have made more sense. Zephyr arrives and speaks to you secretly. There's a god that's still alive! Neat, now we'll finally get more story on that. Yay, fun caravan mode, now we need to take longships somewhere interesting!\n\nBut uh-oh! There's a Sundr villain going there as well, with an army of dredge! But at least now we'll finally get more story about the Sundr! \n\nThe god reveals something interesting, talks about Juno, the sun, gives a means to protect the city and help Iver. But when you return to the city, now the king and rugga and the factions have devolved into fighting based on your choices. How are you going to handle this? Which of many possibilities will ascend to the throne? How will you defend the city? And what mystery lies beneath the mountain of the city...\n\nFor Iver's caravan, there should be pockets of dredge villages kept alive by Spellsingers. Now you need to decide to plunder them or not! More stuff to do! Maybe go to the remains of the Varl capital first? Fight warped Valka? Realize deceptions, machinations, corruption, hear stories? Find new characters, have old ones die?\n\nInstead there... wasn't a plot?[/i]\n- Plants, please: A horticultural document thriller.\nGlory to Undermere.\nPros: \n- the writing and its illusion of effortless brilliance\n- attention to detail and consequences for player actions\n- \"gotta catch 'em all\" mentality that actually makes you feel smart\n- the intrigue, world-building, and game flow\n- petting the cat\n\nCons: I wish there was more music, or just none at all most of the time.\n- Started strong, ended annoyingly.\n\nMoral of the story? People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.\n\nIt paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that \"routine\" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.\n\nI liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters. But it all fell apart and tries to teach a very vapid moral that someone in their early 20's who has never had a meaningful relationship would idealize.\n\nAt least it was short.\n\n- Emily is Away Too is the sequel to Emily is Away.\n\nThe first game, which was free to play, was absolutely fantastic, especially because of its finale: [spoiler] no matter what you felt or what you wanted to do, your choices would always bring the same conclusion of you unable to say to Emily that you wanted to be more than friends, and her spending the summer with her boyfriend. [/spoiler]\nBut that was not because of \"lazyness\" by the developer: it was intentional, and in fact, towards the end of the game, [spoiler] even if you try expressing your feelings your character would delete what you wanted to say replacing the messages with generic questions [/spoiler] . In my opinion, the intention was to deliver the message that [spoiler] sometimes in life, especially when dealing with relationships with other people, there is simply nothing you can do except accepting other people's choices and move on [/spoiler] .\nIt was a very powerful ending that left me thinking about it for days after finishing the game, even if it was a short experience.\n\nUnfortunately, while playing this game I did not feel the same, powerful emotions that I did with the first one. This is because the game features several different endings, this time with two girls instead of just Emily, which isn't a bad thing per se, but it contrasts with the power of the message of the first one. Moreover, here [spoiler] you can actually achieve not one, but several \"good\" endings [/spoiler] .\n\nI liked the integration with your desktop and browser, plus the many different references to artists, TV shows and movies from 10 years ago.\nThere are still some \"twists\" present here, and if you make certain choices you will encounter situations similar to what you do in the first game, but as I said, I feel that they are not as effective as the original game.\n\nThat does not mean this is a bad game by any means: I would still recommend it, especially for its low price, but make sure to download and play the previous one first. It's free, too!\n\nRating: 7.0/10\n- If you somehow don't know what this is: It's a meta-narrative focused walking sim with a funny narrator. Only you know if that kind of thing sounds like a good time to you.\n\nSubtract about 26 hours from my playtime because I'm a lunatic who left the game running for a whole day to get a silly achievement.\n\nI loved the HD remix (never played the og mod), and I really liked this one too, but I will say that a lot of the commentary the original offered doesn't hit as hard or hold up as well almost a decade later, just because the narrative structure and how narrative is tied to gameplay of many story-driven games has changed in that time (because of course it has), as well as the mindset of a lot of players being different. So I think that it's worth keeping in mind the cultural moment the original was made during... if you're the thinky type who likes to overthink things. You massive nerd.\n\nStill, it felt nice to jump back in and spend a little more time with the narrator, and there were some legitimately striking moments in the new content that I found to be quite powerful and engaging. Overall, though, having played the original, getting all the new stuff (and revisiting the old) felt a lot more like checking off a to-do list than active exploration teasing at the boundaries of the game and it's layout than the first one.\n- This game is shit, and the devs should eat shit for shitting this shit on top of gamer community's head.\nCombat? You need a piano keyboard to dodgeparryhitlowhithighlowthendodge. Its a clusterfuck! Reaction time? None. I tried to dodge, I got damaged, Parry same story. And don't get me started on fucking archery! HELLOO ITS 2021, PUT A FUCKING CROSSHAIR so I can hit something !!\n\nWow, what a piece of shit. 18 hours of my life spent TRYING to make sense of this clusterfuck of a game. Pity I can't get a refund AND throw dung at this whitewashed game, like people did to Deuscht.\n\nI hope you devs sit on it and rotate.\n\n- THIS REVIEW IS FOR VERSION 1.3 \n\nStarbound is the space game that all people who crave space games like I do will enjoy. \n\nFrom playing with your friends and colonizing an entire star sytem to role playing as a galactic bounty hunter, this game truly offers what all of us enjoy. \n\nPros \n+ Unique art style \n+ Infinite procedurally generated universe \n+ Creative alien races that are completely customizable \n+ Pets unique to each race \n+ A heart wrenching story that [Spoilers] makes you a hero \n+ Crafting system that requires a plethora of materials \n+ Mining and harvesting isn't a grind \n+ Materials can be acquired through pickaxes, drills, mechs, and the infamous and upgradable Matter Manipulator \n+ Devs constantly working to update and add new features \n+ Every planet is different with several contributing features such as weather, temperature, radiation, and colonization \n+ Many different generated structures such as buildings and towns that generate on some of the planets, with origins of each race \n+ An upgrading and advancement tree that takes time and effort that is always enjoyable.

With all the memes and jokes established, I was finally able to understand what the fuss was all about back in 2011. Despite not having the best gameplay, story or graphics out there, something about this title just made me want to finish every quest I deemed worth completing. \n\n9/10 - mods recommended\n- This is mostly a worse version of the much better \"Slay the Spire\". Slightly different gameplay (Inscryption has a 'field' and some very limited mechanics from Gwent-like games), but both are deck builders with card alteration and deck probability as a core mechanic. Really expected better from the reviews and a demo that promised more gameplay aspects than seem forthcoming. Not an awful game, and has potential, but it feels like they took a basic card game and never bothered to balance it or build better guidelines for the randomized encounters. \n\nPros\n-Atmosphere is decent\n-Gameplay core is fine and could have promise but is highly random. \n-The 'scale' system works well in concept - winner must be X damage points above the opponent, not a set amount of life. X is too small.\n\nCons\n-'Roguelike' aspects are minimal so far. Even as I get more familiar with gameplay my runs are as likely to end on the first or second map. Grinding the same level doesn't get you anywhere in terms of improvements, since the end game 'summary' is determined by random cards you obtained during your run... which can be very poor. Even then, these seldom show up on future runs in my experience.\n-Few ways to guarantee what cards/powerups you get if you want to focus on any specific type of build. Additionally certain paths are OP, while others are next to worthless. With STS there are far more viable builds, and while some are better than others, most times you could construct one to get you far.\n-Powerups sometimes do nothing (e.g., Instant kill on a card with zero attack is... worthless, but if you add 1 attack it suddenly works), and sometimes create amazing combos.\n-Highly variable battles, often hinging on 1 turn or card draw. Get your top card first? Battle is won. Keep drawing the wrong 'fuel' (card summoning) source? You've lost. Sometimes you'll get 1-2 cards that are a permanent squirrel card, other times you'll need to spend a 1-2 draw actions to even summon a card.\n-Overall atmosphere is interesting, but highly limited and very repetitive. Narrative only changes when you advance and isn't skipable so spending 1 minute each death doing the same death sequence 5 times in a row ruins it. \n-You can't just quit a run. Also the stupid UI that has you click + drag to use the menu system. \n-The room, which functions as your 'rogue-like' element is limited, and once explored is dull. Late 90's graphics, low light. Puzzles are mostly bound by gameplay and even completing a puzzle and adding a card to the pool of possible draws isn't that useful. \n\nThe game needs more features to allow for 'controlled randomness' (e.g., lock certain starting cards for each run, set a preferred powerups/creature type, start encounters with +1-2 cards in hand, expand # of result possibilities, better 'rarity' parity), better permanent powerups (expand past # of \"helper items\" that can be held), scale needs to be larger (once you get the right set-up the game is over the next turn, conversely some scenarios the computer can 'rush' you and a match is over by turn 3-4). Possibly expand # of slots for cards and allow player to have 2 rows, like AI does - would also allow certain powers to be more interesting.\n- Phat beatsies,\nSelf-deprecating humour that gives me self affirmation,\nPanders to my need for nostalgic nods,\nPlays smoothly, and so doesn't leave me stuck for hours helping me to feel like I have higher than average intelligence,\nMesses about with you based on the assumption of previous adventure game experience, which leads to making me go \"heh\" outloud more than three times.\n\nMildly amusing, could use more super space dust.\nPlayed on the \"hard\" difficulty option but activated other options out of curiosity, would recommend it for the extra shenanigans.\n\nIf I had to give it a score 8/10,\nWould pay for the soundtrack, that ear crack is cash money.\n\nA hell of a lot of work was put into this game & I suggest you press \" J \" on as many screens as you can handle to get some insight on the thought process behind this game, the effort and imagination that went into it.\n\nThe missing 2 points:\nfew bugs to work out, ain't no big but in a game where you are going to be thinking \"it's not progressing because I haven't mashed the appropriate non-sensical things together\" it needs to not bug out.\n\nSoundtrack not yet out - nah not actually taking points away from that, it'll be out soon as I understand it, but I need that fix Mr. Shellburger.\n- it's a shame but i honestly cannot recommend this game if you are a disabled person, i wasn't that far into the game when my character started panicking apon seeing a disabled person [person with leg braces] and then gets a \"no good answer\" bit of dialog and all the options are saying something wrong or saying nothing, trying to go with the least bad option aside from saying nothing since i know as a disabled person myself [i'm a wheelchair user] it can be pretty upsetting getting people just randomly stare at me and at least when they say something slightly wrong they are engaging with me as a person, my character then proceeds to talk abt what an \"inspiration\" it is 2 c a disabled person living their life,,, not exaggerating when i say i let my head hit the desk, closed the game and uninstalled, i understand that this is probably put in the game to be a teachable moment for the able bodied audience but ironically in trying to educate about us disabled people they then made the assumption that no disabled people would be playing their game as there is no option to make your character disabled or even to make them remotely aware of disability and ended up just making the experience awful for the disabled gamers they seem to be trying to help\n- 100%'ed the LUCT version of the game and I'm slowly working my way through this version now.\n\nOver all the game itself is solid. If you're reading this, its a brilliant tactics game that helped define the genre. However most of the changes they made in reborn, while innovative, ultimately feel constraining. \n\nFor example, they've limited spell slots to 4, so you can only ever take 4 different spells. One or two of which (missile + indirect) are taken by a damage spell of your choice, leaving you with even less spell customization than you'd think. And its unfortunately the same situation with skills, as one will always be taken up by your weapon skill. \n\nThe cards that drop in battle, while an interesting system on paper, just end up cluttering the field most of the time, often with auto-skill activation up, which most of your units won't even really want compared to the other options. \n\nRandom battles were also removed, limiting chances to recruit to a few key dungeons as well as removing some of the more amusing battle locations from the game. \n\nI've also seen some people complain about the level cap, but in my current play-though of the game, it isn't too much of a concern for me, but it may be for others. \n\nOver all, it just feels like they've taken a step back from what Tactics ogre: Let us cling together, gave us. Yes there's bloat in that version, but it also gave us a feeling of freedom when we were putting our teams together that this version lacks. I am grateful that we saw a remake of this game within my lifetime, but I wish they had improved on Luct, rather than take steps back from it. \n\nIf they ever increase the amount of spells and/or skills you can take, to like 6-8, then I'd probably switch my review to a yes. But until then, with a heavy heart I have to say that this version just isn't as good as Luct so far.\n- please don't give an ironic positive review for this \"game\". It truly deserves the tag of \"overwhelmingly negative\" reviews.\n- I love this franchise and NARUTO SHIPPUDEN: Ultimate Ninja STORM 4 really out did itself. I love the story line and everything eles they did with the game, BUT the MAIN problem i have with this is that even with my game pad I had to install another app so that I can use the dame pad. The game couldn't completly figure out my game pad buttons on it's own and I had to re-set every button and it's a pain in the a$$. There's a MAJOR learning curve if you think you can use the keyboard, plus I highly doubt you can hit every single button at the exact time you need to press it. If your getting this in a console then thats awesome. But I don't recommend getting this from steam and playing in your Pc. If only they had figure out the controls then I would have given 10/10. So sad.\n- There is no skill requirement to play this game; everything seems pretty randomized including when and where the demon attacks you. Its rather difficult to play alone or just with two players. So if your looking for a game to play alone for a fright or just with one other buddy of yours. Make sure your ready to lose, This game has a great concept I just hope it will get more refined with the attacks. It seems like you get killed before you can even attempt to complete the objective.\n- In 2013, after 10 years of waiting, the Sim City community of modders, fans, and aficionados rushed out to purchase the fifth installment of Sim City. Ten years is a long time to wait for a game, but people had a lot of faith in Maxis when they announced the title. Long story short, it was a massive dissapointment. Maxis and EA crippled Sim City 5 with DRM, Always On APM, tiny maps, forced origin installation, lacking mod support, no steam support, and a forced multiplayer aspect.  I decided to not purchase the title, so it may have been a decent game, but 2 years later a team of 12 people created a game that does everything maxis insisted was utterly and totaly impossible.  \n\nEverything the mod community did that kept Sim City 4 on the shelves in Wallmarts across America for an entire decade was ignored. Maxis (and to a lesser extent EA) ignored the fans, and gave the people who had kept them in business for twenty years a crippled subpar game.  And for that Maxis is now out of business. They will never make another game, and it is no one's fault but theirs.\n\nNow pretend none of that happened. It's 2013 again, and here it is people: Sim City 5. \n\nThe game balance is a bit on the easy side for veterans of the genre, but the potential map size is ENOURMOUS and customizing your city could fill up years of gameplay time.  The game runs so smoothly with so much going on, it really shows how lazy Maxis was with their approach.  The glass in buildings reflects the sun and the buildings near it, there are dynamic shadows, zoning is back, and it is not 'dumbed down'.  A single tile in this game is twice the size of the alloted map in Sim City, and you can purchase dozens of additional tiles to expand.  The map editor is awesome, the community is thriving, there are mods to do anything you want, and this is the city building game we've all been waiting for.  I can not possibly reccomend this more.\n- An okay game that wastes your time.\n\n\nI played on the hardest difficulty. For me there was a pretty big difficulty spike somewhere in chapter 6 or 7. Apparently I had been skipping on the battles earlier on and was a bit too low level. No problem, I had just unlocked skill trees for the characters, so some XP spending made things manageable. I had to try the map a few times, but once I downed a few mobs and gained some levels, all was going well. The objective was to kill all the enemies by certain time, and that's what I aimed to do. Except, once I'd killed all the enemies, the objective changed and I would've needed to trudge to the other side of the map and kill the boss as well. Yeah, fuck that.\n\n\nThe combat works round-by-round in speed order. If your characters go faster than the enemies, you can simply spam AoE attacks and kill droves of them before they go. If enemies are faster, you're kind of screwed because they hit hard, you're on the defensive, have to spend turns healing and cannot attack that much. And levels seem to make a huge difference here. Combat seems sort of poorly balanced in this respect; maps are hard at the beginning, but by the end just a joke because you gained a few points of speed and are now overall faster and can spam AoE attack and kill enemies in droves.\n\nThe user interface and usability is pretty archaic. For example, to get out of a menu you have to explicitly click on the button that says \"back\" instead of just clicking a right mouse button or Esc or whatever.\n\nThe writing was quite funny at times. It also seemed of a mixed quality. A lot of times it seemed clearly aimed at 13-year olds.  (Especially cringey are the first pair of \"combat helpers\" you get.) I also did play the game for a lot longer at once than I usually do. I think there's some kind of magical simplicity about it, and it's fun to play.\n\nIt's just, in general, the one thing I dislike the most is doing again the exact same thing that I just did. That's the developers' way of saying \"fuck you\" to me, and so I don't want to play this game anymore. If you don't mind that, and the game looks like something you'd like, then I don't doubt you'll like it. Don't get it for 20 moneys though. 15, perhaps... 10 yeah, sure. Because reading the reviews, the one thing many agree on is the later you get the more garbage the combat gets. So, in essence, you only have the visual novel aspect. And if you're not 13 anymore, I don't know. Play something else perhaps.\n- This is a game that I have been looking forward to for at least 2 and a half years. I have wanted to have a game on the PC that had the elements of harvest moon (for the little bit I played of it), Animal crossing (<3) and Rune factory. I was super excited when I was approached by Leth (publishing manager at Chucklefish) at the beginning of December to help him and ConcernedApe (developer of the game) with bug testing and QA. 400+ hours later (off steam and on steam), I still love the game. \n\n[b]Farming.[/b] The farming is fantastic. It is to me one of the main elements of the game, and it's just a joy. Being able to design your farm any way you want it... yes please. Planning out what to buy every season, where to plant them, on top of the thrill of when you can harvest and reap on the gold... it's so enjoyable and addictive. \n\n[b]Fishing.[/b] The fishing is outstanding. From playing WoW and Runescape.. or any game with fishing, the fishing in Stardew Valley is so much fun. At first, the fishing is challenging, but as you progress your skill, you become a pro in no time.\n\n[b]Mining and combat.[/b] Mining and combat is incredible. Going deeper into the mines can be tough, but if you're prepared with your food and weapon in hand, you can fend off the creatures and get your sweet ore/minerals/gems that you want to bring back to your house and possibly hoard. (Hi, I'm Bexy, and i'm a hoarder.) \n\n[b]Social.[/b] Social interactions are great. Being able to become friends with the people in the town,  and eventually being able to get into relationships with people and having a family with them.. what's not to like about that? And what's great is that it gives great replayability because you can have different saves with different spouses! The backstory for each of the characters too is so in depth and well thought out, you will be silly if you don't shed a tear maybe once or twice. \n\n[b]Main story.[/b] The actual main story is well rewarding, and once you \"complete\" it, you can still continue on your adventures and farming life with no problems, hell you might even discover new things afterwards, I sure as hell did! \n\nYes, I was a tester for the game. Yes, I have played for ridiculous amounts of hours. It may feel like i'm being a bit overzealous with this. However you have to remember, I was a tester. I tested the crap out of every aspect with this game, even though there were massive game breaking bugs, errors, glitches, crashes. I still love this game. I reported many a bug, and ConcernedApe was quick to fix them. \n\nAnd that's the thing, not only is the game amazing, the developer is too. ConcernedApe works around the clock to make sure that bugs are fixed in quick time in order for us to have an amazing experience with this game. And that's true. The experience that you have with this game IS amazing. \n\nMinutes playing turn into hours. Hours turn into \"oh no it's time to sleep\".\nYou will forget about time. You will forget about sleep. You will forget that dinner was about 5 hours ago but you couldn't' remember because you were too busy trying to fight off 12 bats that were clobbering you inside the mines while trying to gather that 1 diamond waaaaay in the back. \n\nSo yes, I without a shadow of a doubt 150% recommend this game to anyone that wants to \"escape\" for days on end with what I am classifying as my #1 Game of 2016.\n- Loved the original, and this updated version is just as good.\n\nThe additions along the way are very nice, and the improved graphics are noticeable. \nBeing able to converse with your partners whenever you want is also amazing.\n\nHowever...\n\nWas disappointed to have a few areas and puzzles removed. Since those were the more difficult parts of the original game, I assume this was done for a more streamlined experience. \nInstead of your flower wilting to represent your life, it is now replaced by more accurate \"points\". Although this makes it easier to tell exactly how many hits you can take, I miss the more original old design.\nAn iconic music track was also changed, likely due to licensing issues...\n \nCan't completely replace the original for me, but it's still a very worthwhile experience! \nStill wishing for a sequel a decade later.\n- I only just found out about this game when it released. Saw a few videos and had to get it.\n\nI'm a musician, and instructor. Have been playin music for most my life and this game kicked my butt. \n\nThere's parts of each level that groove and feel \"right\" while a lot of the rest of the level doesn't seem to fit with the tempo/time signature, (each level number represents it's time signature). It frustrated me a LOT. I felt like the devs put in those groove sections to make it seem like a rhythm game but most the filler was just an out of time mess.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nThe more you learn about the mechanics, which are actually fairly complex for one button and stick, the more you'll apreciate how finely tuned this game is. So, a lot of the patterns don't exactly groove like typical rhythm games, but once you start feeling how all the more advanced scoring mechanics work together, you'll start feeling the music in really interesting ways.  It's hard to explain, haha.\n\nYes.... your thumbs will get sore playing this, like... seriously. But man.... when you nail sections and feel how it all fits together there's no comparison to how awesome it makes you feel.  \n\nThere's PLENTY of replay that can be had in this, plus the music will stick with you and make you want to play more just to hear it again.\n\nIt's worth the price.\n- I have not play for long, but know well enough this game deserves a mention. A side on, survival-ish game set in a war. Now, While I admire this game, it does have a few issues I personally find abnoxious.\nI'll start with those, and then will share what I like about it.\n\n-Characters you play seem to have never stolen anything at all from anyone, ever during the war. This is reflected in how unhappy and whiney they become caring more about the people they have taken from than their own wellbeing.\n\n-Characters you play are too softhearted. Just use the example with the point above. \n\n-Characters are expert carfters for being just average people. How many average people know how to pick locks, make servicable firearms and make alcoholic beverages? Well these three certain are capable of all three and more. For that matter, they all can do everything, but have one special skill they are the better at than the rest.\n\n-You get to only visit one building per night. This is bad since if you chose a building with other survivors in it, you will either need to steal from them to get supplies and be faced with a lot of unhappy complaining, or return home with nothing.\n\n-Visting other survivors, you cannot negotiate with them let alone talk to them. What you can do is beat them to death (or kill them with whatever weapon you happen to have on you at the time). I don't see how this was a good design choice at all when the characters you play are not personally that sort of people. Attacking other survivors is certain to cause problems with your characters.\n\n-You can not relocate from your starting place. What you start with is your base of operations.\n\n-Raids happen frequently to you only. You will never kill raiders, only chase them off and this happens behind the scenes, out of your control, while your character is out scavanging.\n\n-You can not sleep in shifts. If a person sleeps, they sleep the whole night.\n\n-Rediculous resource requirements. Some things require far too much, while others require far too little. \n\n-There is little to none interaction between your characters. No idle chatter between them. \n\n\nNow for the good points.\n-You play 3 characters to begin with, each having one specialty. They somewhat have different personalities.\n\n-The art style appeals to me.\n\n-Characters are well animated. Different staes of tiredness, different things they do when unhappy or when they have nothing else to do.\n\n-The overall idea, even though it isn't implemented well enough.\n\n-Building your shelter from ground up.\n\n-Forgaing and stealth play.\n\n\nSo while i find some issues with this game's design, if you ignore the lack of realism and consider this to be just a game with a very narrow play style, it is quite fine. It has a certain atmosphere you generally don't find elsewhere. I still recommend to give it a try.\n- Dandara is inspired by a legendary warrior who fought slavery in Brazil in the 17th Century. The similarities, however, seems to stop at the name and the fact that she is a black woman fighting a vague concept referred in the game as \"opression\". \nThe game mechanics are very unusual as you can`t really move back and forth and the art style is often charming, although sometimes it gets really generic with some enemies  inspired by Egyptian culture (I thought it was supposed to be about Brazil). The difficulty escalates quite suddenly at certain points in the game, and the fact that you have to be standing still at all times to attack your enemies is pretty frustrating. After you get used to the movement in the game, it is quite fun to jump around without the frustration of having to walk slowly through a huge map as you do in some games of the genre, especially before getting upgrades that allow you to teleport or move faster.\n The story and dialogues could also have been polished a little more. Everything is very vague making it feel a little bit like a waste of an interesting idea. Dandara is a little rough around the edges, but  pretty unique for a metroidvania style game. Worth checking out.\n- If you like management type games and RPGs, this is the perfect mix. It's just enough management to allow you to thrive with mostly strategy without feeling bogged down, and just enough RPG elements to get you invested in not just your squad, but each individual character in it. \n\nHere's a tale from my experience with the game;\n\nThis is the kind of game to change your entire perspective on life itself. Failure is not the end, nor the beginning, but a constant in this world that you can either let destroy you or make you stronger. Allow me to tell you a story. The story of New Battlehill. \nNear the Shek city of Squin, not far east, was a small town. It went through many names. The first that stuck was Firstyeet, totally not a placeholder. It wasn't an notable settlement, merely consisting of a shack, an iron processor, and some walls to mildly inconvenience the roving gangs of Dust Bandits that liked to bully the residents. After being evicted from their own city once again, the residents, Denver, Soto, Ruka, and Meow, vowed to take back their home. After training and buying the best weapons and armor they could, they made their way back to Firstyeet. To their surprise, however, they would not have to fight. One of the bandits had picked a fight with a herd of goats. The bandits' defense failed against the caprine assault. From this, the town would get its second name - Densorumego. Den for Denver. So for Soto. Ru for Ruka. Me for Meow. And Go for the true heroes, the goats.\nPeace would not last long but soon the residents of Densorumego would become strengthened by their constant fighting. On the elevated, somewhat round land on which Densorumego sat, there were many large fights involving a lot of people. If only there was some sort of name to reflect this... \nAnd from that, the town was renamed for the last time, to Battlehill.\nThings were looking up. The town built its first farms and expanded to be almost four times its original size. But this peace would not last. Battlehill's new ambitions of self sufficiency would attract the attention of a new foe - The Shek Kingdom.\nThe Shek claimed ownership of the land Battlehill was on, and as such, demanded all food grown there be given to them. Confident from their many victories against the Dust Bandits, the Battlehillites refused the Shek demands. Their risk was calculated... but man were they bad at math.\nAll but one were nearly killed in the ensuing battle, and the one person that wasn't knocked into a coma was stuck on the wall because part of the wall was destroyed and he could no longer reach the stairs because of that. The people knew they couldn't fight the Shek, but they would not allow themselves to be subservient either. And so began their malicious compliance. The Shek would get all the food in Battlehill, as it would be none - The Battlehillites were moving.\nI could write entire books about their journey around the west. The Fogmen, the ruins, the Screeching Bandits, there's many a tale. But, eventually, the people would find a new home. In the harsh and Beak Thing infested land of Vain, homeland of the Western Hive, they would found their new home - New Battlehill.\nJump to now, the city is thriving, they have more bread than they know what to do with, they've grown strong from defending their home from the Beak Things, and their population has grown. They are currently planning a reconquest of Battlehill, which was occupied by Dust Bandits shortly after they left.\n\nThere is a part I left out, between Firstyeet and Densorumego - I had repeatedly failed to retake Firstyeet, and I was about to quit the game. I was frustrated that I'd gone and bought the best arms and armor and still failed. And when I tried to set up a training ground on a mountain near Squin, bandits again came and defeated me. I went as far as to try and get a refund, which was denied. That refund being denied was the best thing that could've happened. I decided to give the game another try, and to try accepting my failures and growing from them. And if I hadn't done that, I would never have founded New Battlehill. None of the legend worthy tales my squad has been through would have happened. And I'd never have had the fun of going through all of them.\n\nIn short, get this game. It is just great.\n- Amazing game that I love to play, but the boyfriend that I was playing it with broke up with me a few days after playing this game. A game that's about fixing your relationship.\n10/10 game.\n0/10 in my heart.\n\nedit: why do people find this funny i wasn't kidding\n\nEdit # 2: It has been 7 months since I had originally played this game. What was originally a game of heartbreak and painful memories, I had managed to find it someone new to play with. While this game had terrible memories, I had decided that a game such as this was undeserving of them, and thus created new memories with another special person in my life.\n\nThe game is remarkable, with good writing, and amazing gameplay, and it is deserving of the buy. Each level is crafted with amazing detail, and all of the mini-games are just as fun as the main game itself. Don't let bad memories keep you down, and instead create happier ones. Live your life, ya'll.\n- How the hell did I not hear about this until the very end of 2021?\n\nA beautiful blend of all your favourite action-adventures: Your Zeldas, Metroidvanias, Dark Souls, Megamans (more Zero/ZX), Features local/steam play-together co-op. \n\nThe OST also slaps. I don't expect very moody noir piano in my dystopian cybernetic future but here we are.\n- I normally hate \"retro\" platformers, I never liked Mega Man, only Mega Man X, didn't care much for Shovel Knight but loved Hollow Knight, things like that. The Messenger IS a platformer, even though the second part of the game makes it less linear, and I loved it.\n\nDevs could take a lot of notes here - checkpoints are frequent, boss fights are short and creative and you don't have to go through 2 easy phases to retry a hard 3rd phase, most rooms and even most trick rooms have multiple ways to approach them given your fairly simple moveset. You never have to do anything pixel-perfect to get through but doing things well is massively rewarding. It constantly surprised you with new things but doesn't overstay anything, and completely foreign mechanics introduced are not punishing (Skylands, for example).\n\nA lot of people comment on how great the writing is, and well... it is great. It's sparse but fantastic throughout, with more personality in what amounts to a few pages than most games can give with 10 times as many words (and lore pickups).\n\nFor reference, I completed it with all the challenge collectibles in 14.5 hours, but did not get all achievements nor go through NG+. It is well paced and hard to put down, but easy enough to play in chunks, and I felt like I was learning new tricks up through the end of the game.\n\nDo the thing!\n- If you're a STAR RAIDERS fan, look elsewhere, it's broken.\nFirst off, I  think they did a fantastic job on the Star Raiders port,\nthe controls are spot on, it works seamlessly with a controller,\nall the keyboard controls were mapped brilliantly, great job.\n\nBut....\n\nAlthough the NOVICE and PILOT missions work well, those who adorn the game will\nselect WARRIOR or COMMANDER and sadly, these higher levels are broken.\n\nOnce you get down to the remaining 8 enemies or so on the map, the difficulty ramps up to insanity.\nCome out of a warp, get plummeted by 3+ meteors in a row.\nPhotons gone.\nRinse and repeat until you just give up, it's relentless, and I've yet to be able to finish a game on COMMANDER\nlevel because of this.\n\nI've tried all the different speed modes, original, opengl and direct3d, nothing helps, it's broken.\n\nAnother minor gripe is that the \"Destroyed Engines\" mode is just the \"Damaged Engines\" and barely impacts\nyour speed.\n\nI really hope that this is patched, I'll gladly revise the review once it is.\n\nEverything else is great, the arcade ports are fine, the controls are practically 1:1 in the trackball games,\nthey all feel just like the arcade (unlike Atari Vault, cough cough).\n\nThe Jaguar games are a blast, T2K still rules. I would have loved to see AvP, perhaps a future DLC.\n\nBut the main reason I spent $40 was for Star Raiders, one of my all time favorite games, and in it's current\nstate, I feel like I've wasted my money, sadly I spent so much time troubleshooting it, my refund window is gone.\n\nI'd say wait for this on a heavy sale and if you're a die hard Star Raiders fan, don't do it until it's patched!\n\nAnd still no word from the developers on any patches.........you guys out there?!? \n\n- Think you’re good at racing? Well, this game will give you a RKO.\n\nI don’t even know much about rally when I bought the game. I just see cars driving at dirt, weaving steering left and right constantly, and thought it looks cool. \n\nThis game is HARD. The learning curve is really steep. The first time I played, I constantly fly off a cliff and hug into trees. Because i don’t understand what my co driver is reading. He talk so fast that my tiny brain couldn’t process in time, sometimes I’m so confused that I go straight in junction because I can’t remember he said turn left or right. The cars are constantly out of control. \n\nAfter I learned about weight transfers that I’m able to start utilizing oversteer into corners. No more cripple into finish line with two tyres missing, that’s when the fun begins. Dirt Rally 2.0 is different from other racing games. You don’t race against other drivers, instead you race against time. If you turn off the hud, then it’s only you and the road, and TREES :)\n\nThe sound of the gravel hitting under your car. Dirt stained on your car as you progress through out the stage. The pops and bang coming out of exhaust when you shift. These combination feels somehow relaxing and satisfying at the same time.\n\nThe only downside of Dirt Rally 2.0 is that it requires constant internet connection, even when most of its content are single player. I wouldn’t complain if the server is stable. But sadly it isn’t. The server down happen quite frequently. Imagine you feel like you completed a 10 minutes perfect run, no crashes or mistakes. But then the game refuses to connect to the server. So the game won’t record your progress. It’s like a big middle finger to the player. \n\nI could make this review a thumbs down solely for the “always online” requirement, cuz it makes the player experience kinda inconsistent, but the gameplay itself does make up for it though. I mean when it works, it works remarkably well.\n\nApart from always online issue. Dirt Rally 2.0 is fantastic, the handling, physics, graphics etc. everything is on point. If you’re interested, buy the GOTY edition, it easily double the contents of the original game had. Worth every single cents.\n- Finally, a video game that is everything televangelists in the 90’s said that video games were. Exactly what my Christian mother would love to catch me playing.\n\nIt’s like Animal Crossing and Doom\nEternal had a son… as was foretold when they released on the same day.\n\nThis game really makes you FEEL like you’re sacrificing your friends to an almighty force. Would I really just sacrifice 5 of my friends  again for some loot chests? I’m a gamer, of course I would.\n\nI fell in love with the aesthetic of this game instantly. It was brilliant when the gameplay held up to those expectations.  \n\nI loved it. I loved the art. The humor. The theme. The premise. The combat. The cult management. Sacrifices. Collecting the bones of my enemies. The juice visual effects. Most of all I loved feeding my followers bowls of poop.\n\nThe combat is fun but definitely not the meat of the game. Building your cult and just upgrading stuff is quite satisfying.  There's some goofy stuff to laugh at and it's quick and responsive. There’s something about the music that makes you feel relaxed and in terrible danger all at the same time.\n\nThis is not a game that you're gonna put 50-100 hours in either.  Which to me is a big plus.  Most of the runs don't take you more than 15 minutes.  So it's an easy game to pick up and play for a bit and jump back in later. It's like Vampire Survivors in that regard.\n\nIt's basically Animal Crossing with a roguelite twist. I could say it's almost original how those elements were combined.\nIt's great entertainment, all around. You could even say the game is bound to become a cult classic…\n\n10/10\n- I couldnt get past the first fight on the inside of the castle because geralt ust sits there and doesnt do anything. Dodging doesnt do anything if i cant kill ther enemy. The combat is atrocious, doesn't let you fight the way you want to (which is utterly asinine and these three things literally made me quit playing the game permanently in 10 minutes time. However since i want to know the story im just going to watch a lets play of this on youtube.\n- Two words: Modding Heaven. This is probably one of the most modular games I've ever played. \n\nYou wanna play Mount and Blade in a historical time period instead of Calradia? OK, which one? Don't answer, it doesn't matter, there's probably a mod for it. \n\nWanna add in some magic and play in a fantasy universe? There's mods for that. \n\nHow about a game set in the modern day? Or in a sci-fi universe? Or a post-apocalypse wasteland? Or the Wild West? Or maybe something specific like throwing your hat into the Game of Thrones, or defending the World of Men in Lord of the Rings, or taking over the Empire from Star Wars?\n\nPerhaps you'd like to set sail on the seven seas as a pirate in a nautical adventu-! Oh, wait, OK, there aren't any of -those-. \n\n...but there's mods for all of the others, with even more being made every day! \n\n\nI guarantee, if you buy this and are open to modding your game, you will never go another year without playing Warband. Maybe a week, maybe a few months-- but just when you think you're done with it, you'll find another mod based on your favorite movie series popping up to pull you back in. \n\nIt is worth well above whatever you'll pay for it.\n\n\n- I definitely would not recommend this. The aesthetic of it might appeal to some people, which is what initially drew me in, but the visual awe wears off after seeing the same scene too many times. The game is best played with paper and pencil in hand so that you waste as little time as possible wandering around in a straight line. \n\nThis game survives off of the mysterious nature of its content in the sense that if people knew how small the experience was, they would not buy it. I was thoroughly let down by this game, especially since its promotional material hyped me up for an exploration game with a unique method of interacting with the world. \n\nThe main feature that sets the game apart from other titles, the use of the telephone to access parts of the static world, becomes little more than a password screen used to pick up where you left off or were booted out of your game by a short time limit. After the first two or three times I used the game's core feature, I was tired of it and wished there was a way to play the game that was faster or had more depth.\n\nFor anyone who has played or seen any amount of gameplay from Yume Nikki, you will realise that this game's design begs the audience to compare the two. However, the most useful comparison to draw between the two is by using the game that Madotsuki can play in her room as an example. In Madotsuki's game, \"Nasu,\" is a joyless game about catching fruit. It is repetitive, intentionally annoying, has no bearing on your progression/success, and is meant to urge you toward doing something else. Unfortunately, this is a suitable comparison, as it succeeded in making me feel like Madotsuki in real life and I want to turn off the game and do almost anything else in record time.\n\nI truly wanted to like this game, but I cannot justify spending $5 for this experience when I played better flash games all the way back in middle school for free.\n- Basic game, extremely well done. Like going home and eating your mom's food after decades on the road.\n\nEditing the review to mention some of the flaws of the game:\n- the level design in general is not that great, with every tiny room requiring some mindlessly easy puzzle to be solved first. Eventually it just feels like a chore.\n- not sure if it's something with my steam deck, but I had to put both the game's and the screen's brightness to the max to be able to see things; before that I was constantly missing objects and having trouble with moving around because some soil path looked like a hole in the ground or something.\n- while the game is 2d, there's a lot of different layers of height and depth that get mixed in together and may be hard to tell apart. You often don't know if some platform can be climbed onto or jumped out of until you try to do it.\n- battle system gets repetitive after a while.\n\nDespite those problems, the game is still great and more than make up for those things in other areas.\n- Great game... who need 1 or 2 years of development. tl;dr: mid game turn into a micromanagment hell.\n\nThe game is fantastic until a certain point. You start as a mercenary, one party, 50-150 soldiers doing missions, small battles or bigger fights joining armies. Good graphics, brutal engagments with 200-1000 units at the same time if your computer can handle, playing as a soldier is a blast.\n\nThe problems start when you get a few towns and a bigger family, the micromanagement never stops and gets worse overtime. You have to physically move your party to towns to fix their issues. When your lords get captured & escapes, they'll go into a random town until you pick em again, then you'll have to reform the party. Same with caravanes for trading, if they get captured, you'll have to go in his town and recreate the caravan. You have to partially fill towns with soldiers, manually, from your own soldiers. All the little fun things of the beginning soon become a hassle, as you can't delegate. Messengers are not a thing.\n\nYou can't manage a town at a distance, you can't tell a party member to move to a location or guard a territory, they do whatever they want if they're out of your army / party, so you have to do it yourself. Either you're leading your huge army to fight what is basically an enless war mid game, or you take care of your cities while the rest of your faction fight... with various success. Some commanders are pretty good, other will throw waves of recruits at highly trained arbalists in the open backed with cavalry. Protip: don't be a recruit in an imperial army.\n\nYou can't tell a party you created to guard an area or to kill all bandits attacking your villagers, it's up to you, or the IA if it feel like it. Worst, if you let the parties you created roam around (parties = group of 70-200 soldiers under a lord) they can be (temporarily) drafted in other armies of your kingdom... and you'll have to physically move to the army, talk to the leader and pay some reputation to get them back. Of course, large armies are slow. This leads the the next problem, swarms.\n\nMy worst fear is not a massive army, it's an army disbanded in the middle of my territory. The small parties usually start raiding all villages in the vicinity while being too fast to be catched by a big army. Raided villages impact your town / castle loyalty and gold quite heavily. Sure, you could disband your army and hunt them yourself... but that makes you take a step back, and all your parties would reform under another army you can't control. And man, some army commanders are really, really stupid. Verdun style charge in the open against walls of archers, cavalry in a forest vs pikemens, you name it. I can't count the time i had parties wiped in someone else army. But let's say you managed to capture the lords burning your villages.\n\nThe capture system is broken. Captured lords escape A LOT. I had some escape 20 seconds after being captured. They never stay in a jail for more than a few in game days. Once they escape, they magically teleport to their hometown, rebuild a fast 80 mens army in the blink of an eye and go back to raiding villages. AI \"cheat\" with recruits, they will always find soldiers in town, even if they're empty for you. Executions you say?\n\nIf you execute a lord, no matter how much of an A-hole he/she is, the whole faction will hate you. He raided dozens of villages and killed hundreds of peasants? Still not good enough. You just can't kill a lord without suffering heavy consequences down the line, and you'll need those lords to be friendly later. Worth to mention, capturing the leader of a faction won't stop a war.\n\nLast - peace / war is on/off. I had 600 days of continuous war, followed by 600 days of complete peace in the entire map (due to a bug apparently), and i'm now back at 300 days of war. Not a single day of peace, when one war stop another start immediatly. They will just never, ever stop fighting. Can't catch a breath, can't leave the front of your lose towns.\n\nOh and the main quest randomly failed after 875 days or so.\n\nI would still recommand the game, it's really fun for a while but it need a HUGE QoL update.\n\n- IRL, I really am an unmotivated 20 year old college student, not many friends, living away from my mom.\nThis is a game that kids might not be able to relate as much as peeps my age.. but Im not saying there's an age restriction or something, no. There's a lot of useful lessons anyone can pick up from this.\n\nThe emotional issues it tackles are pretty grounded and somewhat refreshing to see in a game. There's a HUGE mystery element when it comes to the story. (which is sooo damn good mind you). But the conversations you have with the people in this game are just so real and cherishable, you could just wish these in-game days won't stop. \n\nThe small moments you have with family and friends in Night in the Woods are probably one of the most amazing experiences I ever had in a game\n\nPS: After finishing the story, I got all sappy and tear jerky that I went and called my mom to tell her that I love and miss her and stuff.. that's what this game is.\n\nUgh kill me. Im so corny. I love this feeling. So refreshing. f*ck off all of you.\n- A really well-crafted piece of interactive media, that sets a very high bar for future video game \"making of\" projects. \n\nI had only vaguely heard of Karateka before, but nevertheless really enjoyed how this story was told. All the supporting documents, assets and (playable) prototypes are presented in a neat timeline, alongside the released games and remasters, with video interviews that tie it all together into a great story.\n\nIf you have an interest in video game history, solo video game development, or game publishing in the 1980s, do yourself a favor and check this out!\n- Open world exploration by design, pants soiling horror by incident. Blends the concepts of innate human fear of deep water and unknown danger with constant, all pervading curiosity.\n\nYou have to dive deeper. You have to know what's down there.\n- I'll preface this by admitting that it makes sense for so many of the \"helpful\" reviews to be negative; it's good to warn customers of a game they won't enjoy, and The Witness definitely isn't for everybody.  That said, this is among my favorite games, and I was looking forward to The Witness for a very long time, so the fact that it lived up to my expectations says a lot.\n\n(You may find it helpful to know my preferences, so here are some of my other favorites: Fez, Portal, Infinifactory, LIMBO, The Beginner's Guide, and of course, Braid.)\n\nAs other reviewers have pointed out, The Witness isn't \"fun\"; that's not a criticism, it's just an accurate observation.  The Witness is treading unfamiliar territory, but only for a video game: most other artistic mediums have been used to explore themes other than \"fun,\" and it makes sense that this medium can be used similarly.\n\nInsofar as objective criteria exist for judging the quality of a video game, The Witness meets every standard I can think of: the game runs smoothly, the team have been timely about patching bugs, the visuals (gorgeous and stylized) and audio (understated and lacking music) are expertly executed, and the design of the world and puzzles is meticulous (and ambitious).\n\nThe only objective drawbacks I can think of are:\n\n1) The absence of an FOV slider (important for those who suffer from motion-sickness), which the developers have hinted may be added in a future update. UPDATE: this has been added, along with some other configuration options.\n\n2) Some of the puzzles are impossible to solve if you're deaf or color-blind.\n\nFrom what I can tell, The Witness is about making your own observations and forming your own theories about how the game mechanics work (the title of the game is relevant to its content); it's partly about solving puzzles, but more so it's about figuring out what the puzzles even are and how they work in the first place; given that, it's easy to see why The Witness fails to provide players with a clear goal or feedback: that would undermine the core of the game.  Patient curiosity is the best mindset with which to approach The Witness; it's like a piece of cloth with a loose thread: you pull it, and it keeps unraveling, and unraveling, and unraveling...\n\nThe intrigue of The Witness stems from constant and subtle revelations about how the game functions, which tend to overturn your previous theories and force you to let go of your presumptions, all without ever jumping the shark.\n\nThe Witness is slow to get rolling, patiently waiting while you adjust yourself to the mechanics and freely allowing you hold on to your false sense of comprehension.  You might expect a game like this to be eager to shove its paradigm-shifting revelations in your face, but it generally isn't: The Witness makes no effort to divulge its secrets, and when you peel back another layer, you can take comfort in the fact that it's a real accomplishment on your part.\n\nThe island is dense with puzzles (more so than it appears at first), and each of the nearly 700 puzzles (according to the developers) presents its own unique challenge, and a peek into the mechanics of the game (if you're paying attention).  The puzzles are each short, but satisfying and interconnected, so it's easy to leave the game at any time, and they're grouped into areas, where each area explores a particular game mechanic.\n\nBecause you're free to wander the island, you can walk away from one area if you get stuck and try a different one.  I usually had two or three areas I could choose between at any time.  If you try to play through each area, beginning to end, one at a time, I imagine you'll not enjoy yourself very much.  Once you get stuck on a puzzle, rather than continue banging your head against it, I recommend venturing off to find a different one; returning to a puzzle with a fresh palette and new mechanics under your belt may shake something loose.  The puzzles generally shouldn't require guesswork, and all of them are fair.\n\nThere's no narrative in The Witness.  You'll find recordings scattered around the island, which contain quotes from people throughout history, generally on the topics of awareness, discovery, investigation, and the monotheistic concept of a god.\n\nBeing an atheist, some of these fell flat for me, while others less concerned with theism hit hard, and one even had me teary-eyed.  Each one rang with the sort of sincerity that will either move you, or make you very uncomfortable, depending on how it plays against your own life and beliefs.\n\nIf I'm to be honest, I think The Witness has affected me on a personal level: its themes of exploration and discovery, and its quiet faith in your capacity to unravel its mysteries are comforting.  If you're in the mood for some introspection, you'll probably enjoy it as I have.\n- Do NOT buy this game! This game does not even have a minimap/GPS/coordinate system. You will definitely get lost.\nMultiplayer is fully of bug and lags so much.\nDo NOT buy this game!\nDo NOT buy this game!\nDo NOT buy this game!\n\nThis game is so f*** stupid\n- I didn't want to review this until I was completely done. I've now 100%'d the game. Quite simply, I think everyone should play this game! It's perfect for puzzle players with easy and difficult puzzles, most of which feel very satisfying to solve, has fantastic commentary about all of the perspectives of today's society (it's not just a one-sided view!) and is a genuinely well-crafted game.\n\nMost facets of the game are positive so I have to point out the negatives in the game.\n1: There is no save/load system, it's all automatic checkpoints and you have to go and back up the files manually if you want to see the results of different choices.\n2: The choices you can make, or miss, have some light dialog consequences but they occur over many hours of time. This is something I don't really expect from a puzzle game that used to always tell you \"you can return to any place you want at any time.\" In this game, you can't. The time of day and weather of locations can irrevocably change, the ending itself has some major changes, yet there's no way to see it all without replaying the game (a tough pill to swallow for a puzzle game) or watching the results on YouTube. I'm kinda against that sort of thing unless your game can be played multiple times and be different each time, which this won't be, because it's the same puzzles each time.\n3: The engine is Unreal 5 and it's very unfortunate. Although the game may have been easier to develop for multiple platforms in a faster time via doing this, but it has proven that Croteam's old Serious Engine was a much better engine. Unreal 5 has horrible eye adaptation, anti-aliasing, lighting, and geometry options that are all proven to be horrible via this game. Don't get me wrong, the game runs and looks fine for the most part, but all of it could look better and run better had it been built on any other engine. Yes, *any* other engine. I'd sooner have played this on the Source engine. Epic's Lumen and Nanite technology is still too unproven, early, and crappy to be the generational leap they claim to be. I hope the developer can better tune this stuff so players can have better framerates, less ghosting, better lighting, and eliminated distant object pop-in.\n4: The game's pace at the start and end are worse than they could be. The beginning spends too long (and a lot of later optional dialog depends on your exploration of this) in an open world without puzzles while the end has a final puzzle that includes a frustratingly tedious walk-about aspect that needed to be shortcutted somehow. Everything in between (including the breaks you get back in the open world bit) is perfectly crafted and paced, though.\n\nThese things said, I still insist that if you enjoy any form of puzzle game, like Antichamber or Portal, you play this game. You will enjoy it!\n- This is one of the most beautiful games I played since Shadow of the Colossus. And much like SOTC This game is a visual delight not all the visual feel pointless or feel to in your face no all of it is PURE atmosphere and really enhances the experience when exploring the many levels in the game. The game's ability to tell a very deep story visually without any dialog or exposition to undermine the player is absolutely brilliant. the game be very diffult the first time playing but feels rewarding after you level up Ori as you continue to fight bad guys.\n\n My rating is 10/10\n A stunning game with a compelling storyline that worth every penny\n- I bought this game because it was supposed to be like Harvest Moon. I'm now close to finishing an ingame year.\n\n+ The town and art style is very much like Harvest Moon\n+ There are a lot of interesting characters with lovely art to socialize with\n+ The dog is helpful, barking on spots where you could dig out some items\n+ Some events, scenes and dialogues in this game made me smile to no end. This is a happy game.\n\n- You have a farmland of 40 tiles and farm by seeding tile by tile and watering tile by tile. The watering can is your only tool and upgradable to water 3x3 tiles.\n- Friendship is a grind, as is tradition in the genre. I once gifted a whole harvest to a girl without visable change in the 1 to 10 affection meter. After finishing the friendship grind on 3 villagers, the game seemed to reward me with... some random dialogue lines.\n- You can only bind the shovel and watering can. You cannot bind anything else like the brush or milking device or animal fodder. This makes the daily barn work quite nasty.\n\n\nIf you need a Harvest Moon on PC, this isn't what you want. Games like \"Friends of Mineral Town\" had a significantly larger focus on farming simulation. World's Dawn is a small town simulator with a little gardening on the side.\n- Has combination of tight controls and well designed levels that makes platforming satisfying, excellent graphical style and music, as well as tons of unlockable content that will keep you playing even after finishing the story.\n\nVery solid platformer.\n\nThe only downside is there's no online coop; only local.\n- plz,plz,plz, add a way to easily see what wrong with your car. i built my car and it wont shift into gear, NOW I HAVE TO CHECK EVERY SINGLE FUCK NUT TO SEE WHAT WRONG. i have never felt so betrayed,let down, exaughtsed,hatered, and regret.\nkill me\n\nedit, nvm i just dont know how to drive\n- There is an ethereal beauty to Ori that makes you believe in the power of love. As you play it you know you're experiencing something special that comes around very seldomly and that you should do everything within your power to appreciate it. It feels like a special privilege to play through it. Its a piece of art for the twenty first century. It's a reminder that there still exists impossible beauty in what sometimes feels like a bleak hopeless materialistic world. If you remain steadfast though and look for it, you will find things that will inspire you, things that will give you hope again and things that will remind you of why life is so beautiful and worth fighting for. Don't despair, fight. Fight for Ori and everything she stands for. It's worth it.\n- More broken than Cyberpunk could ever dream. Sure the game has nice graphics but the game play, toxic online players, and poor physics make this one of the most frustrating games I have ever played. Dont even bother using the stable either your game will glitch and youll be stuck looking at you player stuck in the stable and nothing more causing you to reset the game or the rogue horses that will drive by kick you in the face. Good luck if you play.\n- Wow! Let me start by saying that for the last year, I worked in what could be called a high tech arcade. We featured a number of VR stations there, and I watched people playing Beast Pets that entire time. I ended up leaving the arcade before being able to try the game (the stations were only on when customers came in, which is when I left for the day), but since I had watched enough people try it, I felt like I had a pretty good grasp of the gameplay -- cute and light. When I saw it hit the Steam store, I was curious to finally play it. I'm more of an FPS/RPG kind of gamer, so I wasn't sure how much I'd be playing it. Well...it's really fun!! There's an immersive aspect to interacting with little AI's in VR that completely changes the experience. For example, while playing Skyrim, you get to have little companions. You interact with them a bit, they follow you around, and that's basically it. But when you're in VR, it actually feels the same as when I'm playing with my puppies. These little guys can fetch, follow a laser, and interact with the environment. There are places for you to explore, and each location offers something unique for the dragons (and you) to play with. And speaking of the environments, they're really pretty! The art style is low-poly, and it works perfectly to create ambiance while allowing you to interact with your new pets. The creators came up with some really clever conventions for interaction that make the experience smooth and hassle-free. This game is great for everyone, and I promise you it's absolutely worth your time.\n- A Visual Novel meets The Stanley Parable by way of Disco Elysium. This game contains a shocking amount of depth of content and thematics behind it's excellent voice acting and 3-colour sketchy visual style. Well worth a play if you're intrigued.\n- 1. Mea Culpa > Ruego Al Alba\n2. combat feels much better\n3. oops no instakill traps\n4. [strike]bleeding crown prayer is too strong[/strike] wtf, just got the time stop prayer\n- In all honesty, I became a little bored in the middle of playing it. It wasn't until I was almost through with the story that I realized why it had gotten such high ratings. You have no idea how hard it hit me when I realized why he was at the hospital [him being at the hospital is not a spoiler btw], and how relieved I was when he had at last found peace. It was in that moment that I had no regrets in purchasing it and how it was worth my time. Despite how brief the game was, I'm gonna remember it for a while. \n\n\n- One of the hardest game I've ever played, also the most fun. Satisfying gameplay + pretty cool visuals and story. The moment the game clicks for you is like crack. Finishing the game gave me a better feeling than that one time I escaped child services by immigrating to Argentina\n- I'm severely disappointed whenever a game points at the stands and intends to hit a home run, and then instead smashes the pitcher out after the bat flies out of their hands.\n\nIt looks wonderful, it's relentlessly and uncompromisingly unique, and it plays like complete hell.\n\nUnreasonable difficulty, bordering on sadism, a unique idea let down by just-so-imprecise hitboxes and the feeling of being far too weak to take on anything.\n\nI haven't enjoyed this game, I can't recommend it to anyone else, if you buy it and find favour with it then bully for you, but I'll never understand how.\n- Before I begin, are you a fan of modern art? If no, I can safely say move on, this isn't the game for you. If yes, then you can appreciate that there is a lot of famous modern art. Some pieces you will find yourself drawn to and feel something about them, and others won't evoke any real response. This is true for most things in life, but we tend to try and find reasons why we feel a certain way about other mediums, while with art we are usually happy enough to admit the various factors like skill, materials used etc. don't really impact our overall opinion of the piece.\n\nKentucky Route Zero is an incredibly well made and obviously incredibly personal game, and the level of effort put into it is astonishing, and I didn't like it. I wish I liked it, it seems so much like something I should like, but I don't. The strangest thing is, I would call this the game's greatest triumph. \"Games as Art\" has been an ongoing debate for years, but artist's always make something for themselves, while most games are made to be enjoyed. The fact that I didn't like this but I can't actually pinpoint the reason is evidence that this might be something more than most other games in this space.\n\nI won't go on too much longer here because while I cannot recommend something I didn't enjoy, I do absolutely think anyone interested in narrative games try the first two acts. I did enjoy the first act and can recommend that with no reservations, but from the second act onwards my interest and patience just declined more and more. I have no problem with wordy games, I've played plenty of visual novels that took 50+ hours to complete, but here I feel more and more of the story was being told with blanks I was supposed to fill in, but I just wasn't engaged enough with the characters and setting to bother with that, so you can easily see how this would become more frustrating over time.\n\nI wouldn't change a thing about this game, to me that would be like asking a painter to add in a few more trees to a finished piece. This game exists as a piece of art. I didn't like it, but you might love it, and you might not be able say why either, and that's a big achievement.\n- This game's constant revealing of stranger and even stranger esoteric strangeness with every case, the way hitting start you are slammed in the gob by an unexpectedly gnarly tableau, a sinister mise-en-scene with a man burning to death on fire or blasted apart by a canon while wry cultists in various states of masked and undmaskedness make slight comments to say How deserving they were to be killed by us in just that way, oh yes!\n\nAhhhh! That is all about what I love The Case of the Golden Idol for.\n\nIt is 13 deduction puzzles (including the DLC) for you and perhaps a friend on the couch wherein you will become acquainted with a decades long revenge tragedy that tore several families and several kingdoms apart as many people lost there lives in heinous and sometimes magical ways. As you move along the story and investigations grow more complex, which could be a bit fatiguing, especially by the end of the DLC. Though everything here is great, don't mishear me. The art is disgusting. It's visuals and music complete the necessary deranged curious mood to undergird the transmutating tone of a murder-filled horror story into one that equally unnerving as it is subtly hilarious.\n\nThis is a game made by some Latvians from Latvia, and maybe, buster, you should just pay them some money and attention.\n- First thing you see when the game loads is \"You have to buy the game to blahblah\", as i didn't know there was a paid version, i felt betrayed. Anyway,\nSorry, i tried it, not expecting much, but there was not much from it..\n-Graphics are bad\n-Movement and animation are clunky, same with attacking\n-Zombie AI would hit you even if you walked backwards 2 seconds ago\n-Regions are EU and NA, multiple servers each with a PVE server, but it was so empty.\n-Gameplay-wise.... so many questions like, \"Why do i need to hold E for 5 seconds to open a fridge?\", \"Why does headshot being counted but it doesnt insta-kill a basic zombie?\", \"Why does the soldier npc's look like they are making money from you?\", and lasty \"What the heck is the goal of this game?\"\n-Oh and driving vehicles SUCK! *ehem*\n\nSorry NOPE\n- I don't usually give negative reviews on games, but holy shit. The map is not even done and you can go outside the \"map\" so damn easy. You randomly go back to the main menu without any reason.\n- tax evasion\nmild aggression\nbullying vegetables\nfun soundtrack\namazing hats \n\ngameplay is amazing and enjoyable, not too short and not too long either with fun little secret things here and there\n10/10 I would play it again on a rainy day with some tea :)\n- Ahh, CrossCode.\nLet's start this review with what this game does right.\n\nPros:\nEverything. There review is complete. But on a serious note I'll elaborate.\n\nThis game starts out very generically. You got an amnesia stricken heroine. You got fairly archetypal characters. The story is the typical trying to figure out your past. But it's not. I lied about all that, that only covers the first 10-15 hours then you see drastic changes in the pace and tone. The story turns out to be well done, not the best, but enjoyable. 8/10 for story and characters.\n\nLet's talk about gameplay. It's perfect, seriously. The pacing of combat is fairly quick. There's a decent variety of enemy types which nearly all of them have some sort of unique trait. Your skill set leaves you with a lot of variety and different tools to take on different situations. I have yet to get bored of it, despite the fact combat isn't inherently profitable for most of the game. Puzzles. You have timing puzzles, logic puzzles, memory puzzles, enemy based puzzles. It's all there. It's all enjoyable. They're quite varied, no two puzzles feel the same. This game has over 200 'maps'. And just about every 'map' has a puzzle or two (optional or not). Ez 10/10.\n\nArt design. I'm a sucker for 16 and 32 bit graphics. The level designer, this guy made the game. He created some beautiful and interconnected maps with nearly everything having purpose. In all honesty, I have never seen design quality this high, it even beats out SquareSoft games (you know before they became that crappy company that is SE). 10/10 again.\n\nCharacter design. It works. Not the best. Not bad. The characters look the way they should. Lukas' nose drives me crazy, it's huge. But Holiday Man is solid. 7/10.\n\nMusic. Some of it's great. Some of it annoyed ME (but I'm picky). They stayed true to what they were trying to make. But it's obvious their composer was no Yasunori Mitsuda. But still, what I enjoyed, I really enjoyed. 8/10.\n\nDid I enjoy it? Every single minute of it. Even when I was confused. \"I WILL figure this puzzle out.\" 35/40, based off my personal taste, but CrossCode is as damn near perfect as you can get.\n- I really wanted to like it, but i can't, in good faith, recommend A Space for the Unbound to anyone. It's a crying shame, because i deeply respect the intention behind the project. I love the whimsical, yet somewhat grounded premise: anyone who likes Makoto Shinkai movies will feel right at home. The intrigue, even though the plot twists are fairly obvious, still creates an unsettling feeling of uncertainty and dread that clashes (in a good way) with cheerful, bright colors of youth. A Space for the Unbound is mainly a point-and-click quest, but the developers still tried to spice the gameplay up a little with mini-games and little one-off mechanics that successfully break up the monotony.\n\nAnd yet... For every memorable, emotional peak A Space for the Unbound presents an hour of pure, unadulterated filler. Almost every \"puzzle\" is a multi-step fetch quest that requires you to backtrack multiple times with no other reason than to pad the length of the gameplay sections. It also indulges in \"gotcha\" moments, where the game deliberately fools you into the wrong solution, while the right one, of course, requires you to back track somewhere. Yes, the hometown of our main heroes is not that big, but that's hardly an excuse. Even more so in numerous dream sequences, where you are often times forced to go back and forth between someone's mind and reality to collect key items. Spacedives represent a wonderful opportunity to do something different, but A Space for the Unbound rarely delivers on that front.\n\nMost people praise the game for the story, the characters and the fact that it was made in Indonesia -- an under-represented region when it comes to games. But neither of those three have any solid writing to stand on their own. Sure, Atma and Raya can be sweet, but developers never allow their relationship to truly blossom. There's almost no banter, she's not even a constant presence in the story. Raya is important to the world of A Space for the Unbound, but doesn't really feel important to the player. Yes, the game tries really hard to tug at your heartstrings, but more often than not does so in a terribly hamfisted manner. It's supposed to be so profound and melodramatic that, at a certain point, it becomes difficult to take the game seriously.\n\nOh, and speaking of representing the community, A Space for the Unbound doesn't do a good job. The town itself is cute and full of life, there's no argument about that, but all of its inhabintants are either nameless mannequins with a so-so pixel-art, or just item bots. You speak to them once or twice, they give you what you need to advance the plot, and that's it. The fact that the game forces you to run laps around the town on an endless search for items doesn't make it any more charming or cozy. While, on the other hand, the authors only briefly touch on real societal issues, so as not to spoil the whimsy. In short, it's a huge nothingburger of a letdown, despite the fact that the whole setting is clearly supposed to be warm and nostalgic.\n\nYes, you can excuse some of those flaws by the main plot twist, which i will not spoild. But while it does make certain things more clear in hindsight, again, it does not portray the story in a good light. A Space for the Unbound really wants to be a Makoto Shinkai movie by way of Night in the Woods, but falls tragically short wherever you look. However, despite my criticisms, i hope Mojiken will not stop making games. It is very clear that the devs have tremendous passion and some talent on display -- it just needs refinement.\n- > go into time trial\n> classic f1 cars\n> 2004 ferrari\n> put on headphones\n> play with that gorgeous v10 as soundtrack\n> best day ever\n\nalso career mode is great\n- Awesome game. \n\nMy ex gave me this game.  We used to starve together, but now I starve alone. :'(\n- [h1]Press F11 for Fullscreen and know that your inventory has two parts[/h1]\n\n\nThe Steam version seems like an improved version of the mobile version. I got stuck and looked at screenshots and guides and none of them were helpful (I've never played the mobile version just in case you were wondering. A guide I saw mentioned only 5 endings but this version features more than that)\n\nI got over my block when I realized that there were another set of items in my inventory (I didn't notice that it said 1/2 at first)\n\nI haven't finished the game yet though, so I might update my review, but so far, everything looks good!\n- [h1]A Great Time [i]Killer[/i][/h1]\n\nSlayaway Camp is an enjoyable puzzle game that runs great and is well polished.  It's intellectually stimulating, humorous, and fun with just a sprinkle of nostalgia.  \n\nThe difficulty curve is perfect.  It is very clear the entire game was well thought out, planned, and implemented.  Kudos!\n\n[h1]System Info & Performance Report[/h1]\n[table]\n   [tr]\n        [td]Operating System[/td]\n        [td]Ubuntu Linux 14.04 x64[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]CPU[/td]\n        [td]AMD FX-8350[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]GPU[/td]\n        [td]GTX 750[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Technical Notes[/td]\n        [td]No crashes[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n- A fun game for drinking parties, take a shot every time you feel like you just wasted 19 cents.\n- I have played OSU!, Muse Dash and stepmania plenty and I gotta say that this does not feel like a rhythm game at all. The premise of matching the shape of the map to music sounds interesting but some of the songs I feel like are not mapped out correctly. Or in general this game relies less on music cues and more on visual cues? It felt like maps are only 50% related to the song and you have to ignore what you hear because the map randomly demands patterns that have no matching audio equivalent and everything becomes pure visual memorization.\n- No Man’s Sky is like a guy who owes you $1,000 from 6 years ago coming back with $10,000 to repay you after you thought the money was gone.\n\nI really like this game. I’ve been playing it for years on and off, returning after every major update to see the state of things. No man’s Sky might be a fantastic game now, but you gotta always remember how it all begun. When the game first came out it could best be described to had been as wide as the ocean, but having the depth of a puddle. \n\nThe game has improved so much from when it came out that it is easily one of my favorite space exploration games nowadays. One of the greatest redemption stories in video game history. It’s almost like they used the money they earned from sales  to actually improve the game. \n\nI love the idea of having this massive sandbox shared experience, where coincidentally anybody can stumble upon my little bases I scattered, mines, etc. I also love flying around the stars in my ship, discovering new planets, finding weird animals, plants, geography…\n\nThe sense of adventure and the thrill of finding some new world makes me have so much fun. If you like exploring and just taking your time  doing things, this game is a must, and I highly recommend it. \n\nThe truth is no matter what you think of the game we should all be grateful of what we’ve gotten. If No Man’s Sky was made by EA, all these updates throughout the years would probably have been released as $60 new games each.\n\nI’ll be honest, at this rate and with these devs I have a feeling No Man’s Sky has a better chance of of becoming what Star Citizen strives to be than Star Citizen.\n\nEvery now and then though, whenever I see a game trailer that I really enjoy, I like to remember the state of this game when it first came out and how awful it was. It keeps me in check and helps my expectations stay grounded.\n\n10/10\n- This is a passable if grindy 3D first person family friendly farming \"shooter\" with cartoony artwork.  You have a simple \"vacuum\" gun that you use to capture wild critters, throw them into pens, feed them, collect their stuff, sell it, rinse repeat.  \n\nThe implementation here is of high quality and works well on PC with a range of implementation options.  While the gameplay is somewhat repetitive and grindy, this is decent enough family friendly game that should be considered when on sale.  The retail price is too high, however, this game appears on sale and in bundles often enough.\n\n【グループB】\n- if you love trpgs but are getting tired of all the great indie devs emulating ogre tactics and ff tactics while wondering where the fire emblem/langrisser love is at then this is your game. It is hands down THE best non-fire emblem game that falls under the latter category of styles and punches so far above its weight class that at one point while playing i idly wondered if they poached an intelligent systems game designer or something (they didnt).\n- SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT.\n\nAs the store page states, NOREN is supposedly a 'simple' keyfinding game. That would be true if there were any keys actually in the game, but as it stands it seems that NOREN is a simple abandoned shovelware game that's impossible to progress in, let alone beat. You play as some soldier in a massive, dark castle, equipped only with a dying lantern. The light fades quickly, and you can regain light slowly by... standing by a light source. That'd be simple enough if you weren't endlessly pursued by dinosaurs that are programmed with AI which knows your exact location at all times; three chomps and you're 'aparted' from the world, where you respawn with whatever amount of light and sanity you have left. Additionally, the translation attempt is abysmal at best. \n\nBoth NOREN and its developer, ThroneLab, should be banned from Steam. I do not blow the 'scam' whistle lightly, and I only do such when I am 100% certain of something actually being a scam. There are a handful of videos of this title on YouTube as well, with only one being over 5 minutes long. No one found a key. If evidence can be presented to me that there is in fact a way to progress in this game, I will rewrite this review. Until then, beware and stay vigilant.\n\n[h1]Rating: [b]0.0/5.0[/b] - WARNING.

I cannot overstate how fun it is to build your weapons in VR, the crafting system works flawlessly and seemely without the need of menus or UIs getting in the way, props for the devs for how well the game integrates with VR controls.\n\nWhat I liked:\n- Varied enemies\n - Great VR controls\n- Gun crafting is addicting and allows for a lot of experimentation\n- Great Bosses\n\nWhat I had trouble with:\n- Makes you wish you could run around the rooms like the original game!\n- The reduced FOV of most VR headsets makes it quite difficult to keep track of enemies that come from multiple directions. Some rooms require so much head movement that I tend to get sick.\n- When a room spawns with multiple shield pylons and a healer bot, it gets extremely frustrating if you have slow moving projectile weapons.\n\nWishes:\n- More gun parts! (Maybe future DLC?)\n- I was warned a while back not to buy this game because of microtransactions, so I stuck with BTD5 instead. I haven't played much bloons before other than a lot of BTD 3 and 4 back then, but man I was missing out. The microtransactions in this game are nowhere near as bad as people made them out to be. Currently having too much fun with this game.\n- Wow. Just wow. This is BY FAR the best visual novel i have played. the old school forums and cameras feel very detailed as whenever anything happens in a video chat, no matter how small, the characters react to it. the story was very enthralling and every time i slipped up and made a wrong move, my heart would feel as though it was gonna beat out of my chest. talking to violet felt very real and made the ending that i got so much more satisfying. the only bad things i can even say about this absolute masterpiece is just the fact that most of the really impact full options were locked because \"Emmett isn't cocky enough\" or  \"Emmett isn't compassionate enough\" which felt very vague and confining.\n\noverall the game is absolutely amazing and i wish the devs would come out with a game similar to this because of how good it was.\n9/10\n- I bought this game because it was supposed to be like Harvest Moon. I'm now close to finishing an ingame year.\n\n+ The town and art style is very much like Harvest Moon\n+ There are a lot of interesting characters with lovely art to socialize with\n+ The dog is helpful, barking on spots where you could dig out some items\n+ Some events, scenes and dialogues in this game made me smile to no end. This is a happy game.\n\n- You have a farmland of 40 tiles and farm by seeding tile by tile and watering tile by tile. The watering can is your only tool and upgradable to water 3x3 tiles.\n- Friendship is a grind, as is tradition in the genre. I once gifted a whole harvest to a girl without visable change in the 1 to 10 affection meter. After finishing the friendship grind on 3 villagers, the game seemed to reward me with... some random dialogue lines.\n- You can only bind the shovel and watering can. You cannot bind anything else like the brush or milking device or animal fodder. This makes the daily barn work quite nasty.\n\n\nIf you need a Harvest Moon on PC, this isn't what you want. Games like \"Friends of Mineral Town\" had a significantly larger focus on farming simulation. World's Dawn is a small town simulator with a little gardening on the side.\n- As a cybersecurity professional , I would classify this game as malware, or at the least adware.\nWhy? It opens up a number, at least 10 when I checked, of connections to various points on the internet which have no purpose in running the game. They are only there so the vendor can spam you with advertising, track you, or for other unspecified activities. \nAs such, I can NOT recommend this game. \n\nTo verify, I disconnected my computer from the internet. The game ran fine without the advertising and tracking. \nThen I connected back to the internet, and launched the game. The game opened at least 10 connections(!).\nThen, while still connected to the internet, I blocked the game's network-connecting executables in the firewall. In such a case, the game behaves differently, apparently it sees there is an active connection so it runs for a while, then when it cannot make it's for-bad-purposes network connections, it terminates and you can't play. \nThis is bad behavior that I would only expect from spyware and malware. I hope the vendor fixes it so the software runs in the manner they declare - it is supposed to not require network connectivity after the initial run as they describe in the System Requirements. \nSteam should be reigning in this behavior as well.\n- Melatonin is a simple rhythm game, with a focus on ease of gameplay and calmer sounds.\nIf you're expecting something on the tougher or more upbeat side, this ain't it.  Ironically, I had more fun as I stopped focusing on scoring well, and more fun when I was just feeling the music and half-asleep.  The sounds and songs are quite relaxing lol.\n\nOn the shorter side of games, it still delivers an enjoyable experience in what it offers. The timing is a *little* on the forgiving side, and there are even accessibility options if you need a little more help, such as timing circles, metronome, and a bigger Perfect window.  If you'd rather go for a challenge, a Perfect only option is also available.\n\nControls are quite simple, using [strike]4[/strike] 3 directional keys and an action key (Space by default). In each tutorial, you're told whether you'll need to hit directional keys or the action key, and whether they're held or not, as well as general timing.  For some stages, the instructions don't give you as good an idea as the tutorial itself/timing circles do (Work and Time levels for me).  All good, but in some levels you get tempo changes in the middle of the song that can throw you a bit off, especially if you're just grooving to the audio cues... when you can hear and distinguish them.  Unfortunately, there are a few levels where the audio cues are either far too similar to each other, or happen too quickly to react to.  This can be a bit of a bummer, as I prefer working off audio for rhythm games, as their focus should be lol.  \n\nWhile Melatonin doesn't bring a whole lot to the table, it doesn't need to.  Less is more here, and the art and sound direction definitely hit their target.\nRelax.\n- I was hoping for a good game but I can't believe the positive reviews. Really annoying on a personal level. If you like your hand held and revel in 3rd person view then enjoy, but I think it's terrible. I was on the mountain jumping across a platform. \"Press ENTER\" to 'grab' it suggests. I press ENTER and what do you know? Nothing happens. Well, you die continually because what it tells you to do (zzzzz) doesn't work. Ah, maybe this is part of the 'difficulty'...hahahaha.\n\nNot a patch on any Far Cry or GTA even though these are full of directions. First Tomb Raider I've bought and definitely the last. What is it with games these days telling you what to do every step of the way: Do this...do that....go here....find item...take item...drop item...fire now.....pull lever...talk....rest....jump.... quit game and uninstall, ya that's the best option. As this game is created for a dumbed-down society or tailored for intellectually challenged meercats, some of us can see where the industry is heading. What happened to thinking for yourself???\n\nI don't need to progess far in this game because the first 10 minutes says enough. Do this, do that, blah blah blah...\n- Okay this is a weird situation. I personally don't like this game all that much, but I do still recommend it nonetheless. That's because despite me not being personally huge on it, I can't deny that it is a very well-crafted game that definitely will give people the experience they want if this is the type of game they're looking for. I, turns out, am not part of the crowd that is targeted for said experience. I just found the whole trial and error stealth RTS style of this game to just not be my cup of tea, but again I can't deny its very well-crafted. I also think the art style and voice acting and story are all very well done as well. So yeah, if you're fond of games of this type, then go for it. I'm sure you won't be disappointed. I, for one, don't think I'm entirely sold on it though.\n- I've loved this game, put in WAY more hours making maps and modded content for it than I have playing it which is a terrifying statistic to think about, and have made some of the closest friendships from playing with people in the community- but, I'm just really disheartened. This is gonna be a long post, I've nolifed the shit out of this game for the better part of half a decade so there's a bit.\n\nHaving people come into my streams & DMs to ask me if I'm going to be porting my map and mods over to ARK1.5 with ASA and then to ARK2 before all of this immense drama and fleecing happened, before we knew anything about prices and release dates- it was a firm yes! I'd love to bring my creations over to UE5, porting content over was so easy, even myself and people in the modding community were putting our maps and creations into stock UE5 just to see what the possibilities were and get off on the new physics, lumen and nanite.\n\nNow I really don't want to bring that content over. Not only because of the bad business practice, with many other games who have ported over to UE5 or have done engine upgrades been offered for free- but because I've seen this one too many times with this company and the business is just horrifically mismanaged and it's heartbreaking for some of us, it's heartbreaking for me.\n\nWhen someone in a position of power and authority over an IP and business has stated that ARK1.5 would be free, as a gesture of good faith, you take that as a promise, and we were all stoked about that. That was the right thing to do. ARK is not a small indie, unknown survival game in a (mostly) unfinished state anymore like it was- it is a powerhouse in the industry, top survival game charts across the internet for -years- will have ARK in the top 5- it is not a game that has done poorly for revenue, publicity or players. It is one of the giants. The best IP that Snail/WC have to date and continues to be. There is no reason to renege on a promise that was publicly made. And before some moron says \"JuSt DoNt BuY It ThEn\" it's deeper than that, I would have had, at my hours invested, zero issues purchasing ARK1.5 for like $20-$30 bucks with all DLC's included- but to make an offer, after it was promised as free, then to take it back and serve up an even bigger steaming pile of shit that is more expensive on a plate, and for Wildcard to hand you the spoon and be like yum yum dig in! Is so strange.\n\nHonestly, I'm not surprised. I was a public moderator in the ATLAS discord with Jat and other off branched former/current- Wildcard/Grapeshot employees at the release of that absolute dumpsterfire and was there with the rest trying to put out fires that could be witnessed from fu**g Jupiter- because I had faith and volunteered my time to assist with a company I believed in, created for and wanted to succeed so badly for the community. \n\nDark and Light was next. Another abandoned IP. Then Last Oasis- yep- Abandoned. All of the offbranches of ARK have failed so horribly, and haven't managed to capture that excitement that ARK did for the industry but they will absolutely keep trying to push out what they think consumers will like, all without listening to any feedback- and feedback isn't always good, do not get it twisted some suggestions I've seen truly are horrendous- but there are gems in amongst the boulders and landslides. Having the initiative to sift and find them, and then really look at them seems to be the problem. It concerns me deeply when Wildcard state themselves on their newsletters that ARK2 will be such a different experience from ARK1 that it now makes sense why they tried to package it in a non-refundable-at-time-of-play bundle with ARK1.5.\n\nSpeaking from experience here- the best thing Wildcard/Snail have done for ARK, and I will never discredit them for it, is their Sponsored Mods program and hiring modders from the community for ARK and ATLAS. That alone has kept ARK where it is, as popular as it is, as fresh as it is and as revolutionary as it is. There is never a drought of \"content\" with ARK, as the modding community carries it on their backs each and every day. Official servers have their place, and I disagree with how they're being handled, but have no solution for that as I never was an official player for more than an hour at a time to remind me why I prefer modded servers. This is no discredit to the ARK art department, by the way, having looked through the maps in the Devkit- Aberration is still to this day is a visual and technical marvel, and many other maps made since then.\n\nThere is a massive air of uncertainty for modders with ARK1.5 and 2. Logistically, the average number of mods on big unofficial servers is about 18- if each modder listing them on Overwolf decides to list their single mod for say $3 bucks, something very reasonable- times that by 18 and are players really going to be expected to play on a single server they MIGHT not even like, for $54 bucks? Maybe they discovered that server was good but had no players during their playtime- and then they find one in their region but, oh- there's 5 more mods on this server, there's another $15 to play on this one. Is a $69(nice) investment really worth it? I don't think so. Even at what has been discussed quietly behind closed doors with other modders at a $1 a mod price, so 50c to the modder, 50c to Overwolf/Wildcard- that's still, on average, $18 bucks to play on a server- this price is not including ARK1.5, or the DLCs for it- so what was the discussed \"Content creators/Modders can make a living!\" price...? Because when you take a step back from the buzzwords, there's a colossal black hole of a problem in the logistics.\n\nI digress, without any more information to go on regarding priced mods, we can only speculate. Back to what we know. \n\nSelling all DLCs and base game for ARK 1 that will functionally become a single player story mode and mod carried game without any warnings, notices or heads up to new prospective players is scummy as hell. There will absolutely be more delays before ARK 1.5, which will extend the lifecycle of the current game and DLCs, sure, but it's shady. The idea that ARK1 will become, in a sense, a showcase of my above statement about modders carrying the entire ARK community on their backs, and a solo story is fine- but adjust your listings so that people will know they will never experience ARK1 as \"Wilcard intended\" with the removal of official servers, that they will be playing with archived mods no longer receiving updates as many modders move over to 1.5, that they will have a limited playerbase to play with as most have gone to 1.5, that there is limited updates going to be provided due to 1.5- that there is no more official DLC... due to 1.5.\n\nThis isn't even taking into their account their roadmap of the supposed finished content releases for ARK1.5 and ARK2 finishing up and starting at almost the exact same time. So we will have this problem ALL over again when the release of ARK2 is imminent, after it's delays. Players who bought ARK1.5 and all the DLC's will play on that for a month or two before ARK2 is released, then ARK1 is even more abandoned, and ARK1.5 will dwindle.\n\nI know many people will say- damn, this chick gives way too much of a shit about this game, you right lol. I don't like seeing a community be lied to, deceived, fleeced and taken advantage of. ARK is one of those \"coping\" games. If you spend any time with the community, it's a comfort. People come home from work or school and they will turn their brain off and just play. For hours. Not giving any thoughts to how shit their workday was, how badly they were bullied at school, how much anxiety they have or problems they are facing- ARK lets them turn off and have fun, it's an escape game. There's not many other games out there that keep people playing like ARK does, for so many reasons. But, the community is at the core of it.\n\nI wish Wildcard would pay attention to it.\n- I waited 12+ years for a proper sequel to A Crack in Time (yes i know the other games came out but tbh they didn't do much for me) for it only to come out for the PS5. Unfortunately, I wasn't getting a new console for just one game. \n\nNow, two years later I'm playing it on the PC.  While surreal, I am super glad they ported this series to a different platform, and the game was totally worth the wait.\n\nThe port by Nixxes ran very nice for me. I had a few hitches in the dimensional portal scenes, and one crash in a total of 12hrs of playtime. I do understand that some people are having issues and that does suck & does not disqualify their experiences, however, It is not even close to how bad TLOU Pt.1's port was.  \n\nIt's another Insomniac banger, and if you've played any of their games you already know whats up. I beat the game in 12 hrs on the 2nd to last difficulty grabbing whatever side content/collectibles I could before the story captivated me. As is tradition, there is a NG+ mode (haven't touched yet) and I look forward to trying it. I'll probably update the review at that point, but the games are always repayable due to their collect-a-thon nature, that and being so damn fun you have a dumb ear-to-ear smile for all of the playtime.  \n \nIf you enjoyed the Ratchet and Clank games in the past, its way more of that + the dimensional gimmick which is really well done and very neat tech wise. I love the new movement features and Rivet is a very good addition to the cast. I hope she stays relevant in the story in the future. Game feels super good to play as well, weapons are great as always. The writing is still funny and enjoyable. It's just a good time, and I highly recommend it, even at full price.\n\nLastly, I would like to direct a message to Sony/PS Studios/Insomniac Games:\nPLEASE PORT THE OTHER AND OLDER R&C GAMES PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE IPELASE PLs I WILL PAY $70\n- its a very stressful game and rly hard but the fact that u can lose all ur progress because of a mistake is on another level of insane but in the end if u r determined u will finish it and the feeling when u finish it after all the time is very good i never felt this good in my life about finishing a game or a puzzle its a rly good game i recommend\n- I had to purchase Scarlet Hollow after witnessing the excitement of Episode 4 through my friends. I immediately binged the first three episodes the following day and found myself and in rather different spot compared to their playthrough. The choices you make in SH are actually impactful - which is (unfortunately) quite refreshing for the genre! I've since run through several different routes to explore more of the story (and collect those achievements!). While you have the ability to skip through previously seen text, lines within replayed conversations are shaped by your selected traits, choices, and previously selected dialogue; you won't be skipping that many lines before seeing new content. Similarly, characters may be painted in an entirely different light based on choices you've made. The cast and writing truly nails the small town feel of SH (gossip and all). \n\nMake sure you eat the takeaway container in the fridge. Thank me later.\n- Blows every single PFS game of the last decade out of the water, even those shitty D**M games that people who never played FPS games before seems to worship in order to look cool. Smooth and fast gameplay with a lot of variety. Great visuals even on medium/high settings. Story and writing is shit but pretty much on the same level as rest of the Borderlands series with the exception of the Telltale one. Writing has always been the worst part of the series, dont be delusional retards.\n- [b][i]AMID EVIL[/i] is very much [i]Quake[/i] 1 level design in a [i]Hexen[/i]/[i]Heretic[/i] universe.[/b] It's well done. We're a bit spoiled this year with outstanding '90s FPS shooters. Personally, I prefer both [i]Ion Maiden[/i] and [i]DUSK[/i] over this title for the following reasons:\n\n1) I find [i]AMID EVIL[/i] to be a bit generic in terms of theme; the fantasy setting could use a bit more to set it apart.\n\n2) I prefer real or low fantasy weapons/guns over wands and totally high fantasy weapons. Now, don't get it twisted - I appreciate that these high fantasy weapons exist, but yeah, they leave something to be desired. I miss reloading and all of that. \n\n3) The level design in [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is much more 'sprawling' (for lack of a better term) just like the original [i]Quake[/i]. Most levels are indoors in what feels like an underground compound (at the time of writing this review). I personally like the backwoods feel of [i]DUSK[/i], or the dystopian cityscape of [i]Ion Maiden[/i] far more. I want to look up at the sky in most levels.\n\n4) The enemy design is different than the other two games I mention, which is good - but they all mostly have a 'same' kind of feel. The enemies are all super fast, so most of your efforts are focused on running backwards while fending them off. It's fun, but gunplay isn't quite as fun as the other two games for this particular reason.\n\n5) The font and overall menu system definitely feels 'Early Access'. I know the font is being worked on, which is desperately needed. \n\n6) My favorite way to play the game is Endless mode - and I feel like that's a flaw in itself. It's the opposite for me with [i]DUSK[/i]. I want to fall in love with the campaign, but eh, there isn't really any story or anything all that interesting to suck me in. The secrets are super easy to find compared to the other two games, too.\n\n7) No multiplayer. Now, I really don't care about this - but who designs a game in this genre without building this in from the ground up? You know the community is going to whine about this. Questionable design decision to say the least.\n\n[b]Well, it sounds like I just dumped all over the game.[/b] Please don't get me wrong. [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is a welcome addition to the genre. The *great news* is that this is not just some reskin of [i]DUSK[/i] - it certainly is it's own thing. And that's really important. \n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+Fairly polished game for Early Access\n+It's the most modern version of the original [i]Quake[/i] we've seen this year\n+Well optimized\n+Lots of content right now\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-The universe is generic\n-No multiplayer\n-The font is too hard to read\n-Music is nothing to write home about\n-The secrets are easy, and there really aren't all that many of them\n-Weapons could use more 'oomph' to them; also we should be able to use the special ability when we want to as opposed to it autotriggering\n\n[b]I was psyched out of my mind for [i]AMID EVIL[/i] - and while it is certainly good - I think I'll be focused more on [i]DUSK[/i] and [i]Ion Maiden[/i].[/b] Because, let's face it, gaming time is valuable and we can't play everything.\n- Very addictive and challenging\nAlthough the whole game is happening on the same map, with the same enemy and the same weapons, it has a lot of replayability trying and testing new builds and characters.\nMusic is good. After the first 10-20 hours, the music mod made it even better, so is highly recommended to use that mod, even from the beginning\n- \"it's a puzzle game dressed up as a wargame\"\n\n1. puzzle games don't have this much randomness\n\n2. it uses authentic hex wargame conventions/mechanics so it's more of a puzzle game built out of a wargame\n\n3. you can take the puzzle element out of it by customizing your game.yml file to allow +5 turns, then play each scenario slow\n- A very good recursive Sokoban.

Every scene and character portrait is a painstaking work of art that works along with the dreamy soundtrack to draw you into the gorgeous, hazy bible belt setting. The point and click gameplay is straightforward (and at times a little overbearing with handholding), with small minigame sections to mix things up somewhat, but rewards interacting with the world and the people in it to uncover another small truth about it. I don't think I've come across anything that quite captures the sense of melancholy and unease that dominates the current moment in the 20s.\n- Earlier this week I did the impossible - I came out to a family member. One of my two sisters, in specific.\n\nI was nervous but relieved to know she accepted and supported me - and thought, you know, perhaps we should call and talk about some things. We had that call this Wednesday and I expressed a lot of my resentment towards my family - being stuck at home with some of my family, more specifically my [spoiler]mom[/spoiler], has completely wrecked my mental health. I'm still closeted from them and I live with each passing day, worried [spoiler]she'd[/spoiler] reject me - for being non-binary, for dating a trans person, for disappointing [spoiler]her[/spoiler].\n\nMy sister told me that [spoiler] my mom [/spoiler] only hears what [spoiler]she[/spoiler] wants to hear, that [spoiler]she[/spoiler] only thinks about what [spoiler]she[/spoiler] wants to see in [spoiler]her[/spoiler] kids despite often saying otherwise. From her experience, [spoiler]mom[/spoiler] seemed to be a very not open and is often a close-minded individual. \nComing into If Found..., I had only broke down early Thursday morning as my many months of frustrations and anxieties finally given the voice it needed.\n\nIf you've played the game it'd make sense if I told you that Kasio's experience with her parents in If Found... hurt reading for me - it genuinely hurt. Seeing her mom's first letter and annotating it with \"She's trying. But she has all these ideas of how I should be.\" and \"She didn't even consider she might need to apologize too.\" was something I sat at for a long time, probably longer than any other part of her journal that I was erasing through at a normal pace.\n\nMoments like that made me realize that this game is something I never knew I needed - a realization that hey, think about the move out you're doing in a month as rebuilding - as leaving the past behind. That there isn't anything wrong with that, and that you can really be yourself once we're out there, together. That family doesn't have to be bound by blood and it's really about the people who's there for you, even at your absolute worst. That I don't need to seek acceptance through others - but rather be more accepting of myself.\n\n[spoiler]\"I find I care less and less what other people think of me, and more for my own opinion. And these days I'm so much more comfortable in my own skin.\"[/spoiler]\n\nThere's people I can think of who need to read and see this.\n\nIf Found... left me with hope - and it's leaving me with a lot to think about. Thank you so much for this game, DREAMFEEL. I wish I could articulate this game better like other people have - but it's been a lot lately and I need to rest - if you're coming across this review/text you should without a doubt play it, especially if you've felt similarly trapped like both me and Kasio did.\n\nP.S. - If you find the eraser mechanic to be a little strenuous you can increase the size of the eraser in the options!\n- [h1]Borderlands 2 - Excellent Story, Solid Gameplay, Great Characters and one of the very best Coop experiences around.[/h1]\n\n[table]\n  [tr]\n    [th][h1]|| 9.5 ||[/h1][/th]\n    [th]Score[/th]\n    [th]Comment[/th]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td]Graphics[/td]\n    [td]8[/td]\n    [td]Borderlands 2 has a visual style all its own, it may not initially impress some used to a \"next generation, high definition, ultra realistic landscape\", but it is nevertheless very appealing and detailed. Some of the landscapes and views around Pandora (the world on which the story takes place) are beautiful and each area has its own look and atmosphere. Characters and enemies are detailed and extremely varied in appearance. You can customise your characters appearance with a large selection of outfits and heads which you can collect throughout the game.[/td]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td]Audio[/td]\n    [td]10[/td]\n    [td]No real killer soundtrack here (apart from the the introduction video), just really good atmospheric music throughout. Where this game really shines is the voice acting for characters, enemies, audio logs and even weapons (yes some of them can talk!). The dialogue is often very funny, helping to explain and drive the story, fill in background and really adds the the immersion.[/td] \n [/tr]\n [tr]\n    [td]Gameplay[/td]\n    [td]9[/td]\n    [td]A mix of FPS and RPG, Borderlands 2 is a lot of fun to play. So many missions to complete, so many enemies to kill, so much loot to grab. You are given massive area's to explore all over the world of pandora filled with creatures, quests, secrets and homages to lots of popular culture. Controls are responsive, intuitive and the game mechanics (even at higher difficulties) feel fair and well thought through.

The action is character driven, and while the main story is fairly linear, the open world nature of the game allows you to take a break from the main story arc and explorer the hundreds of characters and side missions that can be found all over Pandora. It also has one of the most badass, charasmatic and handsome villians of all time... [/td]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td]Replayability[/td]\n    [td]9[/td]\n    [td]So many reasons to replay this game. Firstly the story can be completed at least 3 times with the same character at increasing difficulty and xp levels (normal, true vault hunter and ultimate vault hunter) with progressively better rewards. There is so much detail in the story and so many optional missions that each play through feels different. Next you have at least 4 (more with DLC) characters each with their own skills, playstyle and story to explore. Finally you have tons of loot in the form of Guns, Shields, Grenades, Relics and Class Mods you can collect for your character. These increase in rarity from white (basic) to orange (legendary) generally the rarer the weapon the more damage it will do and many will have additional unique abilities (red text). [/td]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td]Multiplayer[/td]\n    [td]10[/td]\n    [td]For me, this game remains simply the best cooperative multiplayer experiences you can have. Your character's skills really augment and compliment each other when playing as a team. Enemy and mission difficulty automatically adjusts to the amount of players, requiring real teamwork and synergy to avoid dying at higher levels. The multiplayer allows you to connect (drop in and out midgame) to your steam friends games or to public games, connections for the most part feel quick and responsive even with 4 players and with only a small delay on audio communication. [/td]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td][h1]Overall[/h1][/td]\n    [td]9.5[/td]\n    [td]I can't recommend this game enough, while a minority of missions feel like you are just a glorified delivery boy, most are creative, funny and packed full of classic moments and great characters. So much fun to pick up and play with friends. - I haven't really mentioned the DLC (of which there is a lot) in this review but the main ones (Mr Torgue's, Captain Scarlett and especially Tiny Tina's) are all well worth getting (these are included in the Game of the Year edition), great fun to play and add loads more content to the game. To progress to the highest level in the game (level 72 +overpower levels) you will also need the ultimate vault hunter pack 2 so I would recommend that if you reach the end and still want more.

Please leave me a comment[/i]\n- Did you like the first two chapters?\nWell, here we have everything and tons of new and improved things, like the 2nd chapter did with regards to the first one (which was awesome, but quite simple gameplay-wise).\nA classical turn-based strategy game, now more polished than ever with wave-like combats and tons of units to start with, to upgrade and well, we don't even have real classes here - more correctly, each hero is a class on its own and has different abilities and such.\nThe story follows always the same one-way saga and you'll have to make lots of choices determining your fate, your battles and so on; the graphics are the most beautiful I've ever seen here and the soundtrack is quite amazing and atmospheric too.\nYou'll have also many features like arena combat, and a great history re-telling if you don't remember the first two chapters, plus a great tutorial to start with even if you're not new to the series and the genre.\nIt's quite fundamental if you're a little bit interested in this awesome story to play the other chapters - here in fact we'll start with all the old heroes, all the story right back from the caravan that reached Arberrang.\nWe're basically reviewing one of the best strategy tactical turn-based role-playing games of the last 5-10 years and I won't add more than this, it has already thousands of reviews and mine is quite useless I think. \nLots of endings, lots of characters to explore and promote, lots of weapons, accessories, modes.. we have everything. Recommended to anyone (maybe with a little discount).\n- I've been waiting since the likes of Planescape Torment and Baldurs Gate 2 for a game to match their sheer perfection, many games came quite close, but Divinity Original Sin just manages to hit so many nails on the head its not funny. It looks great and still plays fine on my aging PC, it has a great storyline, it's two protagonists have some great interactions and dialogue. The voice acting is spot on and it has the most sublime OST.\n\nThe combat is turn-based but do not let this put you off, there are so many choices in combat with the interaction of spells with each other and the environment, that the game just begs you to experiment with different tactics.\n\nThis game just oozes pure class, it was a labour of love for Larian and it shows in every tiny detail of the game.\nIf you like RPG games (or even just pure quality games), you need to play this game, it is the benchmark I will use in comparing other games in future.\n\nWell done Larian.\n- Most of the negative reviews cover my complaints already. So I won't rehash the ones I've already read. \n\nHere's my biggest complaints: \n\n- Jumpscares have never been compelling to me. Doubly so on VR. Are you trying to injure me in my computer room? Stop. \n\n- Guns are fun. Not having ammo for them is not fun. (The game is pretty generous with ammo but it also encourages tediously conservative behavior, if you just unload clips at shit you'll run out pretty fast) \n\n- \"Continuous Turning\" feels so bad. Like, how can I turn my headset and everything looks smooth as butter, but as soon as I use the look stick for turning suddenly it's all choppy and looks wrong? I'm familiar with some of the motion sickness issues people get with turning in VR games, but this isn't that... \n\n\nThough honestly it seems like they just leaned really into the whole horror thing, which is fine, but also just super not my thing. \n\nIf the mechanics and some design choices had been better I might have slogged through it anyway. \n\n\nGame's beautiful, though, so they got that going for them.\n- This is more than a game for me.  It has become a hobby.  What started as a random purchase for myself last Christmas -- I had an old electric guitar I never played in the closet, so this gave me an excuse to see if I can learn -- has become an expensive obsession for me.  Warning -- but a good warning -- you'll find that you're learning guitar very quickly on this game, and it will become the start of an expensive habit!  I have downloaded hundreds of dollars worth of songs, bought a brand new guitar, I've signed up for music theory and guitar lessons at the local county college ... this has become a genuine hobby for me.  Literally, it is one of those rare games which has genuinely made an impact on my life.  Six months later, and the game has not gotten old.  I look forward to new songs, I laugh when a new chord I've never seen magically appears on the song that I've practiced the hell out and achieved a new difficulty.  The game is, most importantly, fun.  It remains fresh and only gets better as you get better.  I highly recommend.\n- Minesweeper influenced design feels like a fresh take on the Slay-the-Spire-like genre.  Now that I've won with all six classes, and done some of the unlockable difficulty levels, I feel that I've gotten my money's worth with the game, and I have enjoyed the time I've spent so far, but I don't expect great longevity beyond this point.\n\nI do have some minor gripes:\n\n* The pacing on unlocking new classes feels too slow.  It would be nice if the approach was the fairly standard one of unlocking a new class when you win with the previous one, but here there is a currency which is acquired throughout runs, and I found that I usually had to have two winning runs with the previous class to earn enough currency to unlock a new one.\n* Optimal play with some classes requires memorizing tiles which are revealed, and then on later turns these tiles are hidden.  Taking damage because I misremembered what was hidden behind a tile feels unfun and at-odds with what the game otherwise wants to be.\n* I would prefer if the harder difficulty settings were unlocked from the get-go, rather than grinding through easier difficulty settings to find the challenge.\n\nOtherwise, though, it's a fun game with an adorable art style, and not just a clone of the other Spire-likes around.  Recommended if your expectation is to get ten hours or so of strategic puzzling.\n- I've been completely in love with this game ever since the Mojam prototype \"Wasteland Kings\" was released. It's an insanely fun, fastpaced \"roguelike-like\" or \"roguelite\" with randomly generated worlds and tons of weapons to find. On top of that, the developers stream the development of the game on tuesdays and thursdays over at Twitch and they release updates to the game every week. To me, this is the best game of its kind and I've put tons of hours into mastering it (and I still die. Often. It's difficult okay?).\n- Deathloop is definitely not your average video game.\n\nYou'll either love it or hate it.\n\nThe first few hours are the weakest. You, as a new player, don't know what to do, what's important and you never keep what you find. Only after completing several mission objectives you get the ability to collect residuum and actually infuse your found items for later use in later loops or after you die. That's why it's always better to just go straight to the objectives and not explore the map at all, otherwise it's just gonna be a big time waste.\n\nAfter you acquire the ability to make permanent items (character and weapon trinkets) which you'll be able to use in future runs and collect some crucial weapons (like silent gun) and abilities ([in-game slabs] like Shift that allows you to teleport short distances) - then the game fully opens up. \n\nReal fun begins after you learn all maps and shortcuts and how to toy with your enemies (but it takes quite a lot of time to get there).\n\nStealth is very easy, the enemy AI is dumb at best. The more trinkets and slabs you get - the more variety in gameplay opens up. \n\nAction is very smooth, Abilities are strong and versatile, that's where this game shines to be honest. \n\nThere are 4 different areas and all of them change depending of the time of the day (morning, noon, afternoon and evening). Depending of the time of the day - some areas become accessible, some become closed, The enemies and items also change their locations and sometimes you'll be able to encounter bosses (in-game they are called visionaries). They are not hard to kill, but it's quite hard to get to them. That's the fun part of this whole game. The more you replay all areas, the more information you'll acquire about visionaries and their behaviour. It's possible to deal with them all without killing a single other enemy.\n\nBut with all that comes the not so fun part - exploration and doing the same thing over and over and over again. It's gonna be hard at first, every area is very detailed and it's really easy to miss a code written on a desk or a wall, A lot of sniffing around is required for clues and multiple times per map. It definitely makes repetition your new best friend.\n\nThere are a lot of puzzles and challenges. If you are not shooting dumb NPCs - you're definitely trying to crack a solution to a puzzle. Sometimes you'll need to visit several maps on the exact time of day at which events occur and find the exact required item or piece of information in order to solve a puzzle. Yeah. It's a big hassle, but that's how this game is and how it functions. If you like puzzles, you'll enjoy Deathloop. But be prepared to use a guide or two for some of them and a lot of patience.\n\nDuring some objectives it's very easy to make mistakes and fail. Several challenges require you to be pixel perfect in execution. Didn't notice that mine placed on a generator? Too bad, you'll gonna have to restart or try in another loop.\n\nI disliked that once you find a new weapon, you have to take it with you and drop one of your 3 weapons. You will never be able to use the dropped one for the rest of the loop. Considering that you'll always find a new toy to play with - your loadout will always be half-baked. It's actually extremely annoying, the same can be said about your slab abilities too (only after you find them all, then the ability upgrades will go straight into your inventory after finishing a level).\n\nAnd of course, there is Julianna. She is your \"buddy\" the whole game and she talks to you at the start of every level and well... she is always trying to kill you. It's fun when she invades and disrupts your chill Groundhogday experience. You can even let other real players invade you as Julianna. Fun, if you like to fill yourself with some adrenaline. Either you kill her, or she kills you and you'll have to start over the whole loop ^^\n\nFunny, but Colt reminded me of Draymond Green from Golden State Warriors. In some instances he looks exactly like him haha.\n\nThere are some AI bugs and the game starts to stutter the longer you play. Kinda strage, but it was for me. Occasionally framerates can go from smooth to choppy quite fast.\n\nDeathloop is a decent game overall. Idea is good, but works much better in movies, because there you don't have to sit through the same routines every single time and you get to the next big reveal a lot quicker. \n\nI think Julianna was a bit underused. Imagine how awesome this game could be if Deahtloop worked similar to The Lost Vikings where you control 3 characters at the same time. She could have had different abilities, different strengths. A duo trying to break the loop! Pretty cool, eh? Anyway, That's just my 2 cents.\n- The game is decent but not worth $15 for a slightly better looking version of a 2 hour game that is 9 years old. I can only recommend it if you really like these kind rpg maker horror games, because it's among the best in its field.\n- ooooh im pigging out\n\njust like the original risk of rain but significantly more approachable!\n\nthey added controls, chris christododoldoaul and a bunch of retextures, got rid of that gup blackface enemy\nawesome\n\nthanks poopoo games for the review copy\n\n(spoilers ahead)\n\nincluding the mastery skins and void fiend from risk of rain 2 was an awesome surprise, nice to see so much new content\n\nonly complaint is the 100 dillar price tag for the game but otherwise a must buy\n\nUPDATE!!!\n\nAfter further playing, i have many very genuine issues! These providence trials are IM POSSIBBLE! the critreriar are simply absurd, and drifter is practically unplayable in his current state!!!\n\ni have also found a MULTITUDTE of vines allowing me to clip out of bounds?!?!?!? how did this game get past play testing TWICE\n\ni am not fibbing when i say this game in in an unacceptable state, how is this not in early access?! ridiculous, genuinely. gearbox! how could you\n- My wife left and took the kids\n- Finished pillars of eternity 1 as a priest of berath, pledging my soul to the god of cycles, life and death. Promising to release the thousands of captured souls back to the wheel of reincarnation at the end of the game.\n\nStarted pillars of eternity 2, only to find out I was murdered after the events of the first game by a god who was believed to have been slain during the saints war. \n\nMy soul then comes face to face with the god I have devoted my life to, the god of life, death, and reincarnation.\n\nAfter a brief discussion about how I kept my promise at the end of the first game, my favoured god revealed to me he wants me to come back to life and serve him once again, and slay the being that killed me.\n\nI refused. It is only right that my soul is allowed to be reborn and return to the cycle, as I have worshipped this diety my whole life.\n\nMy god agreed. I was reborn as a wolf and the credits of Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire started to roll.\n\nPretty short game but 10/10\n- I'm an atheist, and even this game made me pray to God to make it stop.\n- Do NOT buy this game! This game does not even have a minimap/GPS/coordinate system. You will definitely get lost.\nMultiplayer is fully of bug and lags so much.\nDo NOT buy this game!\nDo NOT buy this game!\nDo NOT buy this game!\n\nThis game is so f*** stupid\n- [h1]Strategy at its finest[/h1]\n\nInto the Breach is Subset Game’s latest title, following on from their massive hit, FTL. I put off trying Into the Breach for a long while, but I finally got it when it dropped down to $10 on HB a couple of months ago and I’m so glad I did. This game isn’t for everyone, it’s kind of rogue-like mech chess, but if it clicks for you then it’ll be one of the best strategy games you’ll ever play.\n\n[h1]Positives:[/h1]\n[list][*]First up, the game looks fantastic. The pixel art here is great, from the backgrounds to the mechs and even the pilot portraits. The animations here area also really good. There’s nothing too complicated here but it’s all well executed. On the topic of appearances, I also really like the way the maps are laid out, the 8x8 grids on a plain background work really well here and it reminds me of simple boardgames. I think it works well for the game.\n\n[*]As with any good strategy game, it’s easy to pick up, but hard to master. You have a squad of three mechs (there are a few different mech groups to unlock with gold coins (?) and you can also create custom groups from the mechs you’ve unlocked). Each group has a unique element, but they all follow the basic structure of one close-range mech, one long-range mech and one support mech. Each mech has a different ability/weapon and they’re all well varied. The mech teams are really well designed here so that no one mech is super powerful and they all work really well as a unit. \n\n[*]The combat is excellent. It’s really simple but it works so well. You’ll quickly learn the different roles your mechs have and figure out the best strategies to use them. There are two ways to kill most enemies. Getting rid of all of their HP or pushing them into water/lava (with the exception of boss enemies or flying enemies). However, a lot of the time you probably won’t even be trying to kill your enemies in a given turn. You can always see what the enemies will do on their next turn and so you always want to be playing to react to/prevent their next move. Typically, enemies target civilian buildings or buildings related to your objective, so it’s usually better to focus on moving them away from these buildings rather than focusing on killing them. If you’re really smart/lucky you can also push enemies so that they attack each other, as friendly fire is a major part of this game. It’s really satisfying when you line it up right so the enemies are killing each other rather than attacking you or the buildings you defend. You can even block them from spawning by moving something on top of them!\n\n[*]Unlocks in this game are handled better than in FTL in my opinion. There are six actions that you can complete with each mech squad to earn those gold coins I mentioned in order to unlock new mech squads. The first three are the three possible victories: two, three and four island (more on that in a second) and then the other three achievements are unique to each mech squad. They’re centred around the unique aspect of each squad, tasking you to get a bit creative with the way that you’re playing. I know some players didn’t like the way that unlocks worked but I think it’s a really good way to handle it and encourages you to try new strategies. \n\n[*]The game has five islands, with one of those being the final boss fight. Each island is basically a different biome with different enemies and environmental hazards. They aren’t necessarily easier or harder than each other to start with, but the difficulty does increase as you move from island to island. There is some crossover with the enemies you’ll see, but they at the very least have a different appearance and most of them behave differently. There are also enemies unique to each island. \n\n[*]On each island, you’ll need to complete several missions before facing off against the island’s mini-boss. The missions all have different objectives for you to complete, though the win condition is always just to survive all of the turns (typically 5 turns). The different objectives vary but there are usual two, with some easier missions only having one and harder missions having three. Completing these objectives gets you certain rewards. You can either get stars, which are used upon completing an island to purchase new pilots, abilities or weapons. There is grid power which restores or increases the grid power you start with (grid power is lost when buildings are destroyed, losing all grid power results in a loss). Lastly, some of the missions award power cores (usually you only see this as the third reward for a hard mission) which allow you to upgrade your mech’s weapons or abilities (super handy). The mission variety is fairly good.\n\n[*]There are a range of different pilots in the game. You always start with one ‘special’ pilot and two regular pilots but more can be found in cryo-pods or bought at the end-of-island store. All pilots earn xp at the end of missions and when they level up they get some kind of upgrade, like more mech health or an extra movement per turn. The ‘special’ pilots all have some kind of special ability, such as being able to attack twice if you don’t move or the ability for the piloted mech to fly. Some of these require a power core, but they’re definitely worth it.  [/list]\n\n[h1]Negatives: [/h1]\n[list][*]Honestly, I’m clutching at straws here for negatives. One thing I would mention is that I don’t think this game will have as much replay value as FTL does for most people (completionists have an awful lot to do here) which shouldn’t put you off from getting it, but is something to base your expectations on. I also felt like Chris Avellone was a bit wasted on this game, his writing is fantastic but there just isn’t much of it. [/list]\n\n[h1]Verdict: [/h1]\n\nInto the Breach is as close to a perfect strategy game as I’ve ever played and it’s an excellent follow-up to FTL. This game is easy to pick up, hard to master and it looks beautiful the whole time you’re playing this weird mech chess. I can’t recommend this enough and at $15 it’s an absolute steal. This was easily one of my favourite releases of 2018 and anyone who likes strategy absolutely needs this in their library. \n\nIf you found this review helpful, please check out my other reviews over at [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33633486/]Kemo's Corner.[/url]\n- THIS GAME HAS NO LOADING TIMES.\nIT IS INSTANT.\nNever again will a game satisfy me.

That IS if you practice and learn the way the game is supposed to be played.\n\nActually requires a lot of patience, aim control, learning of map locations, etc.\n\nEdit Dec 7, 2018: Stupid crazy full with hackers, now that it's F2P i feel like it's gonna get taken over by even more hackers... RIP 2012 CSGO.\n\nEDIT 2021/09/03: Some of you are morons here... Clearly a huge \"fan\" base of CSGO. I've gathered around 9,000+ hours in total (in my other account as well) No. I wasn't a \"Noob\" or had no skill. I was GE for a very long time.\n\nThis review is from 2018. After all the new updates came into place. I LOVED the game, It was my addiction. After those updates, everything went down hill. MORE toxicity, MORE blatant hackers, and I for one wasn't a big fan of the newest updates. So I decided to leave, updated this review with my most recent experience.\nReviews are meant to talk about your experience, Not to kiss ass and make things look good when they aren't.\n- Dear Dev, \nI love this game, if you're reading reviews, please consider some ideas to make it better:\n-  Level designing: Add more ways to choose, and different endings. Right now SoR4 is flat from A to B, it made me feel down compare to SoR3.\n- Alternate customs, and playable same characters: Floyd is overrated and all my friends want to pick him. Make a game with 4 Floyds running sound fun. Use lifetime score to unlock customs.\n- 2v2 Battle! WHY NOT?\n- Shiva (new), Max (new), Roo, Estel (Badass Woman Cop)\n- Steam trading cards: I know it's not importance, but who doesnt want some badass backgrounds on steam profile?\n- This game was sunk by poor customer service as well. I at one point lost years worth of items due to a bug. I was told by one of the devs in an email to \"stop button mashing\". My email was nothing but respect and appreciation for a good game where I also simply asked if they could return my bugged items I have earned over the years. \"Stop Button Mashing\"! Really? And now your game is dead. Good work! Piss poor development. Just sad and dissapointed I have over 2k in hours in crap. And yes this game actually is years old it was originally released Jan 2015. At one point we had a good game to play. I believe even the most played game on steam. Then something happened. It became all about crates. F this game. I'm done!\n- The good news is the driving physics, fuel and tire mechanics, and multiplayer design are the best the series has ever been. However, the overall package, performance, and presentation are significantly lacking in this game at launch. Unless you're desperate, hold off on purchasing this game until the developers have had time to put in additional content and fix the numerous bugs and the odd design choices they've made that I think may need to be changed. There's a lot of work that needs to be done on this game for it to be considered a complete racing game.\n \nThe performance on an 8700K+RTX4070 has been inconsistent at 1440p. While playing with frame rate unlocked at a mix of ultra and high settings I can get FPS into the high 80s but this is accompanied by regular drops of about 20 FPS so I felt it required the 60 FPS lock setting which was a bit disappointing. The other disappointment comes in how the game looks, which frankly is not visually pleasing even at the highest possible settings and generally just not a sharp enough picture no matter what you adjust.\n\nSo overall it’s a bit of a mixed bag. The racing itself is engaging and fun but the choices the developers have made with this game for presentation and functionality leave much to be desired. If it receives good post-launch support it may correct a lot of those issues but at launch it’s a bit disappointing and I do not recommend buying it.\n- RIP Johnny Gat and your whole 2 minutes of screentime.\nWhile being a good sandbox game on its own merits, SR3 does NOT improve upon SR2 in very many aspects. In fact, they actually removed a lot of content from the previous game, though it's not like most people probably played that.\nGone are choosing more than one type of shirt to wear, or belts. You can no longer use your phone to dial numbers, or call taxis to transport you or ambulances to heal you. They removed a lot of activities as well as a lot of really cool things the other games had. So many, in fact, that I could probably spend a whole paragraph just listing them.\nThis is for a large part subjective, but the gangs in this game are very unimpressive by Saints Row standards. It comes down mostly to character writing, but the characterization on each faction is not good; motivations are usually left vague and most characters introduced besides the replacement Saints members are left undefined with little personality.\nThe game is extremely buggy (compared to the others in the series, although it's not quite Bethesda level) and the netcode is pretty bad too. Playing co-op is often pretty difficult because most actions done by both players will be out of sync with each other.\nAlso, it isn't a well-optimized port for PC. The graphics are sub-par for the most part, but the game still runs like garbage most of the time. Sub-60 FPS on high unless you're playing on a top-of-the-line system (by 2011 standards).\nOh, and one time I switched to one of the radio stations and was given a 2 minute long lecture by the DJ about how I'm \"wasting my life pressing buttons in a murder simulator\" and how I should \"go out and get a girlfriend or something.\" Game just killed itself on anything immersion related for breaking the fourth wall and trying to antagonize me for playing a video game. Ironically enough.\nThanks Volition.\nMost of the DLC in this game is low-quality and overpriced, and most of them except for the mission packs are already on the disk, by the way.\nThe co-op is cool is you have someone to play it with.\n- I backed this game back at the end of September 2013 and have finally played it through to completion. \n\nCandle is a beautifully unique game which takes elements from puzzle, platforming and point and click adventures. The puzzles, although sometimes frustratingly difficult, are all different and use different mechanics keeping the game engaging and fresh. Teku's Candle is such a interesting game mechanic that I really enjoyed getting to know and learn. As previously said, the game looks and sounds absolutely stunning. I don't think I have seen a game that looks this good before and that is attritubuted to every character and scene being hand drawn. Controls can be a bit finicky but not game breaking and you can easily adjust too. I would recommend getting this game because it provides a great whole experience.\n- This is more than a game for me.  It has become a hobby.  What started as a random purchase for myself last Christmas -- I had an old electric guitar I never played in the closet, so this gave me an excuse to see if I can learn -- has become an expensive obsession for me.  Warning -- but a good warning -- you'll find that you're learning guitar very quickly on this game, and it will become the start of an expensive habit!  I have downloaded hundreds of dollars worth of songs, bought a brand new guitar, I've signed up for music theory and guitar lessons at the local county college ... this has become a genuine hobby for me.  Literally, it is one of those rare games which has genuinely made an impact on my life.  Six months later, and the game has not gotten old.  I look forward to new songs, I laugh when a new chord I've never seen magically appears on the song that I've practiced the hell out and achieved a new difficulty.  The game is, most importantly, fun.  It remains fresh and only gets better as you get better.  I highly recommend.\n- The amount of love and fun that went into this game is astounding. If you like minigames, memes, fun, and a challenge, check this game out. The “ending” was a bit lackluster, in my opinion, but it did not taint my views on the game and I had an overwhelmingly fun time with it. Definitely recommend!\n- Very fun game if you are looking for a cozy relaxing farming sim. if you had a hard time with the fishing mechanic in stardew valley then you will have an easier time with this game, ontop of that there are lots of cute little rhythm games to play and the animal raising is alot more in depth then stardew. just a little note of warning to new players, the game doesn't make this very clear but you shouldn't spend too much time gardening in your first year. Automatic watering systems aren't available until later on and if you are like me you will think making the biggest profit possible year one is a great idea but I accidentally ended up upgrading/unlocking everything except irrigation in my first year and now do not have much to spend my currency on. Other then finishing catching every fish, maybe decorating my farm/the village and getting the rare coloured animals theres not much else to do in the game for late game content. It feels like there is the intention of possibly adding more content later on? either way if you decide to play, for your first play through I really recommend exploring first and getting to know the villagers before you start large scale farming.\n- One of the best games I have ever played\n----------------------------------------------\n- Runs really well on most computers\n- Looks great regardless\n- Gameplay is heroin-tier addictive\n- High replay value\n- Big f-ing guns \n- If you like metal this game is for you\n- There isn't much wrong with this game\n- 10/10\n\nFLAWS\n----------------------------------------\n-You have the option to turn the music down\n- WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO DO THAT\n- No additional account, no unnecessary launcher, no denuvo, no epic exclusivity, no microtransactions, just a video game as it always should be..\n- Seriously... ppl are ridiculous. I bought this last week and absolutely love it! That being said, my main game modes that I play are MY CAREER and MY GM. It's got a solid story... much better than the previous years. And feels very realistic! Sure, it's got a few bugs here n there, but nothing that breaks the game or my immersion. And yes, it's got lots of micro transactions. I bought 35,000 VC for my career, but i didnt feel forced. Don't wanna buy? THEN DON'T! It's playable whether you buy or not. Just wish everyone would quit their b****ing and just play the game.\n- Zor strikes again, but agent phoenix is there to stop him! Another great VR puzzle game from Schell, with lot of jokes, hidden stuff and extra challenges for replayability. Took me 4h to finish base game, now time for achievements hunt!\n- I technically got this game for free, as it was bought for me from a friend. And honestly, I didn't really like it. She got it for me, as a means to help with some of my mental health issues I suppose? But it just was very big miss for me, and kinda made me feel worse. A bit anxiety inducing for me, just given the circumstances, talking about life and death. Just not my personal cup of tea.\n- [h1] 🕘          IMPRESSION:[/h1]\n* 2016: Game released\n* 2019: It seem fun, let's buy this\n* 2020: New content added\n* 2022: More content added\n\n🟢 = Available\n🔴 = Not available\n\n[h1]         GAMING CONTENT:[/h1] \n🟢 Teamwork with others\n🟢 Puzzle Challenges\n🟢 No Compass or Map Challenge\n🟢 Funny Avatar\n🟢 Customize Avatar\n🔴 3-4 players share screen\n🔴 Fast Sprint\n🔴 Time Attack for replay value\n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [th]iMeter[/th]\n        [th]SCORED[/th]\n        [th]iNTEREST METER[/th]\n        [th]DISCOUNT?[/th]\n [th]COMMUNITY[/th]\n        [th]REVIEWER[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [th]A+[/th]\n        [td]5[/td]\n        [td]Loving it [/td]\n        [td]No Wait[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [th]A[/th]\n        [td]4[/td]\n        [td]Liked it[/td]\n        [td]No Wait[/td]\n        [td] ✔[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [th]B[/th]\n        [td]2-3[/td]\n        [td]Half satisfied[/td]\n        [td]Wait 50%[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n        [td] ✔[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [th]C[/th]\n        [td] 1[/td]\n        [td]Less Interested[/td]\n        [td]Wait 75%[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [th]D[/th]\n        [td] 0[/td]\n        [td]Not what you need[/td]\n        [td]Wait 100%[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n\n🏅 Community Rating: [b] Very Positive [/b]\n🔎 Long Version Checklist ➜ [u][url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/expectationchecklist/discussions/1/1738883005311884039/]Reveal[/url][/u]\n📢 Disclaimer about Short Hours & English Error ➜ [u][url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/expectationchecklist/discussions/0/4594180031254224809/]Read Here[/url][/u]\n\n[quote]\n⚖️ iMeter {B} Worth a play, if you enjoy Teamwork Challenges with Puzzle.

I've clocked over 300 hours in it through Origin (on my ONE character xD ). It's an excellent game, even despite it being an \"open world faffaround simulator\" which was all the rage at the time.\n\nAnd finally on Steam!? Yay! Or yay..?\n\nBut, as we know, we can't have good things. Massive thumb down to the EA Origin \"integration\" in Steam. EA, how about just stop being such massive ducks?\n\nThis is the same \"we hate our customers\" behaviour expressed by d-bags like Ubisoft and Epic. Only that EA sort of makes it worse. They *know* how much people hate the unnecessary and malicious Uplay \"integration\" that Ubisoft have forced on us for several years. Seeing this, EA decides that doing the exact same thing, with their total-garbage Origin client made even worse, is surely the only way to harass the customers enough to be worthy of the EA brand. \n\nDO NOT BUY OR LINK your Steam account if you own the game on Origin from earlier. \nIf you buy a game on Steam, which you already own on Origin, it will overwrite your Origin game.\nIf you then refund the game on Steam, this will remove the game from Origin too (even if you already own it there!), and you'll spend hours in line to get a hold of customer support. Then you must chat with bots, or people who are so void of understanding (and likely not paid near enough to care) that they might as well be bots. And if you're lucky, you might, after going through 4 or 5 different \"agents\", finally get to talk to a person that comprehends English and is authorised to do anything beyond telling you \"they'll discuss it with their team\". Then you might get your game back. \nBut! You won't get back the GOTY. Because the Steam-Orgin-GOTY overwrites your Origin GOTY. And when refunding, via Steam, you're left with a dumb/lame/placeholder copy of the GOTY in your Origin library, which doesn't work, but somehow just lingers there. Then you need to get a Digital Deluxe Edition + all DLC to get back to where you were.\n\nThis [integration] is such a tremendous show of manure, that I'm actually left wondering if EA planned it. Did Andrew Wilson take one of his billions of pocked change and say \"hey, we should make an extra effort here, to make sure that this integration is as frustrating and poorly implemented as possible, but still functional, such that things are barely limping along but just barely, because nothing is as frustrating as something that just barely sorta works but only sorta, and only by the skin of its teeth. That'll teach those entitled peasants.\"\n\nSo yeah. Great game. Bad EA.\n\nUpdate! A new Origin experience: The EA App! An all new website, wrapped inside an all new Electron wrapper! For an all new Frustrating(TM) experience and much better hogging of your PC performance.\n- THIS GAME IS BORING PIZZA TOWER SHOULDVE WON I LOVE PIZZA TOWER\n\nCOCOON DEVS YOU WILL REGRET TAKING AWAY PIZZA TOWERS GAME AWARDS WIN TO ALL OF US GAMERS WE WANT PIZZA TOWER TO WIN GAME AWARDS NOW YOU WILL GO ON TWITTER YOU WILL REPLY TO EDMUND MCMILLEN AND YOU WILL APOLOGIZE FOR TAKING THE WIN AWAY FROM PIZZA TOWER AND MAYBE YOUR GAME WILL BE FUN!!! AND NOT THE SAME TWO TIMING PUZZLES YOU GOT IT? YOU WILL DO THIS OK I love pizza tower :)\n- Would I recommend DBD? ...It's complicated.\n\nDead By Daylight is an unique experience of asymmetric hide and seek/tag with shifting rules. \nIs the game fun? Yes. Is it creative? Yes.\nIs it fair and enjoyable? Well, it depends.\nGames get very intense, and playing as killer is some of the most intense gaming experience I've ever accumulated...\nWhich is where things often go wrong. The survivors seem to have decided that the killers have to honor strict code of rules. Don't use these items, these abilities, or these strategies. If you do, you'll be insulted after the game.\nIf you follow these rules, the odds are that you will spend the game running in literal circles, the survivors will win, t-bag you at the gate and then insult you after the game. I don't know about you, but that kind of ruins the game for me. It is actually kind of amazing how helpless one can feel in this game.\n\nSo to conclude my thoughts; I really like the game, but I also really hate it. I can't recommend it, as every time I fire it up, there is about 50% chance I feel more harassed, than entertained.\nI play a lot of online games, from League of Legends to Tekken, but this is the only one that makes me frequently think: \n\"I should really uninstall this\"\n\nEdit: \nI returned after a long break, and I still kinda like the game. \nHowever, same pattern repeats whenever I return. Eventually, I get teabagged one time too many and uninstall the game. The game is fun, the community could not be much worse. And sadly, that often ruins the experience.\n- \"Adult Themes from the perspective of an 8-year old\"\nIdk about you, but I wasn't nearly this fucked up as an 8-year old.\n\nJimmy and the Pulsating Mass in three sentences.\n\n--JPM is the most fleshed out, content packed, well made rpg's I have ever played. \n\n --It's unique battle mechanics offer a unique challenge and give players multiple options to overcome them. \n\n--This game has lots of emotional moments , tons of nightmare fuel, countless enimies ranging from cute to scummy, and TONS of exploration. \n\nBottom line: This game is an absolute must buy. It goes waaaaaaaay beyond stereotypical RPG-maker games in-terms of content, quality, and complexity.\n- AAA Industry: NOOOOOO!!! You can’t have a high quality and feature complete campaign with only a 6.5 GB install made by one guy using Unity, it has to be 200+ GB made by 5 studios and it needs to be an unfinished 3 hour mediocrity and gouge the consumers $70 USD for it!\n\nThis game: [b]HAHA LEG CHAINSAW GO BRRRR[/b]\n- You will enjoy the game at the beginning, it's fun and entertaining...Until you start playing the harder and larger hospitals and you get plagued with bad pathing issues, bad AI, people getting stuck in rooms, people dieing but they idle in a death state and stay around forever and all kinds of glitches which kills the enjoyment and ruins the management aspects. I've had to stop playing this game until they patch it because right now you're just managing bugs and glitches and you will have to design hospitals to get around these bugs, so that means extra wide corridors and spacing items out so people don't get stuck. Which sucks.\n\nNeeded much more playtesting before being released.\n\n*This is from v1.01.*\n- Saw a few youtube videos on this and decided to check it out.  Only played 30 min but here's my review from that. \n\nCustomization options are disappointing and boring. All of the character skins were white guys (and a possible vanilla Mexican). The option not to add other races at least to the Allied side is weird. As a gamer, when given the option for customization I expect to be able to create a character I at least somewhat feel represents me so I can get immersed (and don't even talk about 'historical accuracy'). They're also level locked for some reason. The uniforms are basic as they should be and you have a very limited weapon selection depending on the class you choose which is standard for these kinds of games. The character customization is very lacking and the only real reason I see it being there is to create DLC uniforms to buy. \n\nThe game itself seems like it's going in slow motion and maybe it's something people get used to after a while but I couldn't deal with it. The run is more like a speed walk and it feels like the soldier is considering being a conscientious objector with the amount of hesitation in aiming. Also everyone was kind just playing the game like Battlefield anyway.\n\nThis is probably a game that's more fun to play in a serious MilSim community.\n- Was a bit turn off when I saw it was a stationary shooter, but the game is so fun I look past that and even began to enjoy the room scaling dodging mechanics (game can make you work up a sweat!).\n\nA must for anyone looking for a more intense arcade shooting experience. I cannot overstate how fun it is to build your weapons in VR, the crafting system works flawlessly and seemely without the need of menus or UIs getting in the way, props for the devs for how well the game integrates with VR controls.\n\nWhat I liked:\n- Varied enemies\n - Great VR controls\n- Gun crafting is addicting and allows for a lot of experimentation\n- Great Bosses\n\nWhat I had trouble with:\n- Makes you wish you could run around the rooms like the original game!\n- The reduced FOV of most VR headsets makes it quite difficult to keep track of enemies that come from multiple directions. Some rooms require so much head movement that I tend to get sick.\n- When a room spawns with multiple shield pylons and a healer bot, it gets extremely frustrating if you have slow moving projectile weapons.\n\nWishes:\n- More gun parts! (Maybe future DLC?)\n- Luzia reminds me of a little me and the banter between the characters is very cute. \nThis game gives me big Spirited Away vibes but even after I finished it I am still lowkey confused who is who and what what whats've? \nThere were many touching moments [spoiler]esp the scene where Luzia said \"I can't save you but I can help you\" it struck me pretty hard because I always question whether or not one has the right to take their own life, and who are we to stop them...[/spoiler] Overall I actually feel this game is wholesome. It can teach one about what depression is like if you've never experienced it.\nI only got jumpscared once but it was a pleasant experience even then :3\n- The game is very good, it's fun and had everything to be a great success, but unfortunately because the anti-piracy, the game doesn't work well, even above 100 fps it feels lag, the game stutters, a strange gameplay.\n\nJust REMOVE DENUVO and the game will have the deserved success.\n\nUnfortunately, they still haven't realized that those who pirate, don't spend money with or without protection, and those who pay like us, have a game with problems.\n\nA good game doesn't need protection to sell, just be good, simple as that.\n- I have mixed feelings about this game. It could have been very very good but has been let down by some very shoddy quality issues. This would not in itself have been a problem BUT given its AAA high price tag, to be honest, the consumer deserves better in terms of finish and execution. To name a few of the irritations:\n1.) AI characters shooting through walls.\n2.) Poorly realised inventory system (You can't compare stats of your secondary weapon with inventory items)\n3.) Camera does not follow actions during combat\n4.) Right click items in inventory and you do not always get the correct sub menus.\n5.) Mouse & Keyboard use was definitely an afterthought in terms of design\n6.) The frustrating click to confirm attribute/perk/talent spend.\n7.) UI does not always detail consumed action points to move to a location during combat\n\nAs I said lots of irritations that normally, in an indie game such as this, you would expect... but NOT when the publisher charges AAA prices.\n\nEz\n\n- Guys literally only want one thing and it's this.\n\npure JRPG nostalgia\n- Everything apart from the matches is superb, best FM ever. \n\nThe match engine is fundamentally broken - too easy to split a defence open with a long ball resulting in a one-on-one, so SI nerfed the conversion rates of one-on-one chances to keep scorelines acceptable. The result however, is that your world class  striker misses 2-5 easy chances every game. \n\nWingers do not square the ball for strikers, instead preferring to shoot from obscenely acute angles rather than play the ball across the box. \n\nHalf the crowd is a repeated man in an orange jumper. This may sound minor but it's really immersion breaking once you notice it. You can be a team that plays in blue, and yet over 50% of the crowd are dressed in orange. It diminishes the match experience and detracts from the game as a whole.\n\nIt's crap like this, broken for 2 months now, I've bought every game in this series since the year 2000, I pre-order every year (literally the only game I will do so with) and said I'll continue to do so until I get burned. Well, SI Games, you've broken me at last. The 'Bugs' section of your forum is littered with these issues that are \"under review\", well you can consider my purchase of FM 2021 in the same category.\n\nEdit: I played a bunch more because apparently I'm a masochist. The match engine is total cack and has regressed massively since FM 2017. Don't waste your money - take up a more enjoyable pastime such as jamming needles in your eyes, you'll thank me for it.\n- Yes, the Origin client is somewhere between annoying and broken, depending on your hardware. And yes, Dragon Age Keep is still a big jumble of poorly explained choices that affect your game in a thousand little ways if you choose to use it. And yeah, none of the old technical issues really got fixed before coming to steam - this isn't a remaster - so shiny hair and lips for everyone.\n\nBut it's nice to be able to take a walk in Thedas again, and sink into the story, and admire what is probably the last real Bioware game before EA completely turned them into another ouroboros of live service bullshit. \n\nGet it on sale, for the nostalgia if nothing else.\n- I'm gonna give this a thumbs up but with like, idk, a cautionary sideways thumb for maybe. \n\nif I read credits right, it looks like this game had all its programming, art, music, and writing done by one guy, so I have to give respect to that. For a real indie game like this, it's very very good. \n\nBut it's still really flawed. If you're looking for a 2D Metroid game, and you've played EVERY other 2D metroid game, I suppose yeah, go for this one, and I think you'll enjoy it. If you're not a fan of metroid, I would not bother, sadly. This game suffers from a lot of problems from metroid games, and does not fix any, and at times exagerates those problems. \n\nThe art style is very interesting and cool, but the way the levels and map design are, leaves most areas feeling like a mess of unmemorable places. \n\nThe combat is INCREDIBLY simplistic, yet somehow bogged down by WAY too many useless weapons and just kind of badly designed controls. I found there were about 5 weapons that were actually useful in the game out of what seems like more than 10. Most enemies you either cheese, or be cheesed. There's no charge up shots, there's not really much nuance to the enemies or bosses. They have about two attacks and repeat while you dodge the same one bullet pattern and just kind of shoot in their general direction. (I played it on hard by the way. Not a particularly difficult game, but even the slightly challenging stuff felt kind of dull and uninteresting.) \n\nThe music was cool again. nothing quite mind blowing, but it was nice. The world itself seems like a mess, but there are cool ideas. The giant robot people were really cool to see. \n\nOne little idea i really liked is that the LOW HEALTH beep sound is actually in sync with every song in the game. I thought that was really cute, and it's not something I've seen any game do. Sounds dumb, but I give a lotta props to that, it was cool. \n\nWriting is okay. I feel it left more to be desired. There seemed to be an interesting world here that wasn't explored enough. It wasn't bad, I suppose, but not really that great. \n\nThat is kind of this game. It's not bad by any means, but not the best game on the planet. Play it if you're in need of a Metroid game, and I'm certain you will be pleased enough despite the flaws. Even if you're just having a hankering for a platformer and have already played Hollow Knight and some other great ones first, I think you should enjoy this, but don't expect a 10/10 game. \n\nGive it a try if you feel it looks interesting.\n- [h1]I enjoyed the game. Negative reviews can be more helpful though. One negative review can't hurt.[/h1]\n\nI'll keep the pros short:\n - Stress reliever\n - You can kill people in interesting ways\n - Mods can enhance this experience further\n\nCons:\n\n - The performance is pretty shit, so you will probably have to play with lower simulation settings, which aren't that good. Duh.\n\n - The base game is bland. Game is driven entirely by the workshop and your ability to create your own contraptions. Not a problem for me, maybe a problem for someone else.\n\n - The game can get boring pretty quickly because the loop is repetitive: spawn human, kill, repeat. This is coming from someone with over 400 hours played.\n\n - Not really game related, but if you don't like sticking around in communities that are often toxic, childish, annoying and the members are often kids or younger teens [spoiler](I would name a few examples but I feel like angering more than 1 fandom is a death sentence)[/spoiler], then avoid the community and stay away as far as possible and just grab your mods and run. Avoid the workshop comment sections, or just a lot of stuff in the workshop, the community tab, etc. It's just full of self-entitled kids who think they're hot shit.\n\n- Not sure how true this is nowadays, but some things on the workshop are just like farm spam, meaning the trending page was often filled with spam.\n\nRead the comments for anything I possibly missed to add but someone else mentioned.\n\nIn short:\nBuy the game if you like violence and looking like a crazy person that people wanna avoid from fear. It's pretty cool.\nDon't buy it if you aren't interested in that.\n\n[spoiler]The only reason I enabled comments is to possibly show how correct the community point is.[/spoiler]\n- The premise is that you're a passenger on a ship, waking up on the morning after you've murdered your well-to-do husband. From that point, you're free to go anywhere on board to do whatever you can to avoid justice within the time limit. You could just try to play dumb and cover up enough evidence to put your guilt into doubt. If you're more devious you could try to frame one of your fellow passengers. You could even go the And Then There Were None route and murder everyone else on board just to be thorough, if you can pull it off.\n\nOverboard! was clearly designed for replayability. The ship is full of evidence and red herrings to tamper with, desperate schemes to attempt, and secrets to learn. The first playthrough reveals only a small slice of all this, leaving a collection of unsolved mysteries and unfollowed leads to pursue on the second. The second playthrough prepares you for the third, and so on, until finally you beat the game... but there's much more to it than that. Vague, but I don't want to spoil anything.\n\nThis game was released today without any kind of announcement beforehand from inkle. As usual, their writing and design are superb. If you're captivated by the premise, even by a little, you won't regret the purchase.\n- Lemme give it to y'all straight, who are on the fence;\n\n- Yes, the game is very much worth it at full price.\n\n- One of the first games in a long while, that has kept me up until 5 A.M. in the morning, because of how lost I get myself into it.\n\n- Doesn't do dumb jump scares, save for a VERY FEW TIMES, and each one counted.\n\n- The game is maybe one of the best zombie based games out there, so long as you do enjoy it with action.\n\n- Parkour in the game is AMAZING. Sometimes I like just playing the game, so I can run\naround, across roof tops, and attacking zombies while talking to friends.\n\n- Co-op in story mode. Freaking amazing. No dumb lobby. Just click 'Join game' and bam,\nyou'll be thrown a few feet away from a friend without them sometimes even noticing you joined!\n\n- Single play and Co-op have a huge impact; co-op feels fun, slightly safer, and adds a lot in the form of friendly rivals! Single player feels way more tense and everything you do counts, making you second guess some choices, for fear or death. Night time in either mode is fun as heck, though four co-op makes it pretty easy.\n\n- Night and Day feel almost like two different modes. In the day, zombies shuffle around, falling off rooftops, being dumb, easy to avoid and kill. Night time? Get those UV Flares ready, and be ready to flee if they catch sight of you.\n\n- Even after beating the story, I keep coming back for more, as it's super fun.\n\n- Took me around 30 hours to do the story, which also included only HALF of the side missions. Still got a little over 50% left to go, and looking forward to it!\n\nTL;DR - Get the game, find friends to play with, enjoy the hell out of one of the few games worth it at full price.\n- Game slaps, played the first area, unlocked ranked and spent 4 hours grinding a 2 minuet long level to reach the top rank in bronze 1 division and i'm going to do it again tomorrow\n- \"We'll take the top, and it'll be a happy ending. Just like in Dragon Quest.\" - Ichiban Kasuga.\n- Hi, here's an honest review. Yes I was very hyped about this game, like many of us.\n\nPROS\n-Cheap price \n-Besides that, nothing outstadning,  mostly a blatant copy of dayZ.\n\nCONS\n-Poor optimization, I have a 1070 OC edition with a ryzen 1700 and I play on 1440p, in new titles I usually get 70-100 fps on high-ultra, but in this game I get an outstanding 40-70 fps on MEDIUM, usually 55 when in forest, which is bad, since only 6% of users on steam have 1070 and higher gpus.\n-Servers... Before releasing a game, might as well check if servers work, I can't connect to most of the servers, or the server to which I connect are choppy and laggy (or maybe it's the game?)\n-No loot in normal buldings like regular houses and shacks, and by no loot I mean nothing found, besides nails and metal sheets which are essential to some crafting but you can't afford to carry them due to very limited inventory space when you spawn in. And I haven't found a backpack either. The place to loot is the Airfield but it's made challanging with the 2 robots walking around which is alright but since you cannot find anything anywhere it's rather annoying ( I have found guns and gear from dead bodies) \n-The mouvement is not great, feels unfished and choppy and that scroll wheel sprinting is disgusting.\n-The Metabolism, which they emphasised so hard upon. I PERSONALLY detest this system, it looked interesting but when you can't find anything to keep it on point it becomes boring.\n-The graphics are bad. When compared to games like The Vanishing of Ethan Carter and What Remains of Edith Finch, this game is a shame to UE4\n\nOverall\n-Unfinished, and by that I mean it's not working properly, not the lack of content, I understand that it's early access, but the devs at least have to polish it before releasing it, so that people can play it, and then add new content and mechanics.\n\nI'm extremely dissapointed with the game, I hoped it to be a game to play for 1-2 hours per day with friends to have fun but that's not happening any time soon. I strongly advise to wait for major optimization updates and other patches before buying it\n- Horrible FOV, glitchy looking graphics, everything is blurred even with motion blur off, absolutely no chance of that multiplayer mod, shoddy PC port... Pretty boring and clunky tbh. Don't buy this.\n- Medium performance issues (as of 2/28/22) but GOTY game. This game is amazing and absolutely dripping with content. FromSoft didn't make Dark Souls 4. This game is Dark Souls 4, 5, and 6 all in one. Absolutely massive game and the open world part doesn't feel like an attempt to pad the game like most games, here's why:\n- Picking up items in the open world doesn't have a pickup animation. This might not seem like a lot but go play something like Dragon Age: Inquisition and you'll know what I'm talking about.\n- You can pick up items while on horseback (also no animation), Greatly speeds up looting while in the open world\n- Summoning pools makes getting summoned for bosses is easier than ever. All you have to do is be in the same general overworld location as a pool and all location get a summon sign\n- Sooooo many more bonfire locations. Can also fast travel from almost anywhere using the in-game map.\n- packed with stuff to do. Very rarely are you walking/riding for long periods before running into a dungeon/boss/camp/npc/etc. Every single side location has something to discover, Plus you never know what you're going to get and the feeling of discovery is unlike any other game out there.\n\nThere are a lot of improvements over previous installments as well. In no particular order, here are some of my standouts:\n- POWERSTANCING IS BACK BABYYYYY. Was always my favorite thing from DS2.\n- Slottable weapon arts. Taking the weapon art system from DS3 and making it even better. This system is also tied to the weapon affinity system which allows you to switch up the scaling of a weapon at any bonfire. No more committing to a specific element or stat.\n- The open world makes the game more accessible. Hit a wall with one zone? Just go somewhere else and come back when stronger. Sekiro had this a little but this game it's extremely pronounced.\n- The statues of Marika make it so the runbacks for bosses is not nearly as grueling. These statues work as \"respawn only\" bonfires that you can choose to respawn back at and are usually just outside a boss fight room after a lengthy run. You can't rest at them or adjust your build there, but they prevent the grueling runback and allow you to smash your face into a boss over and over with minimal downtime.\n- Having a dedicated jump button but keep the power of jump attacks. Risky usually, but can also be used as a counter to low swinging attacks. This also adds into the next system of...\n- Poise breaking enemies. Is done by heavy attacking, jump attacking and guard countering. Adds even more move types to the game and makes every weapon a totally different playstyle and adds to the replay value.\n- What are guard counters? After successfully blocking and attack, you can follow it up with a special heavy attack that has high poise damage. Allows for more critical hits. You might think this makes it easier but it takes more skill than you'd think to time these ripostes and it always feels good.\n\nAs with any game, it's not for everyone, but if you love souls games, you'd be doing yourself a disservice by missing this one. If you've never played a souls game, this is the best one to try. The most accessible by far. No crazy hard tutorial bosses, the new ashen summoning bell gives some great support in difficult areas, and the fact you can always leave harder fights and come back to them later makes it so you rarely run into situations where you know booting up the game means you're gonna be brick walling until either the boss dies or you give up.\n- Absolutely amazing. PLEASE don't judge this game based on how it looks. You must try it yourself! I thought it would be terrible but a friend convinced me to try it, and I'm glad he did. I haven't had so much fun in a game in a long time.\n- An instant classic.\n---\n\nThe original [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/kunovega/recommended/264200]One Finger Death Punch[/url] was an unexpected treat for me. The refined simplicity of just two buttons that require masterful timing to create a legitimate fighting experience laid out to a selection of music that reminds you of the classic Kung-fu movies of the 1970's but packaged with a carefree stickman aesthetic.\n\nOne Finger Death Punch 2 is a respectable sequel in most ways. The core gameplay is fundamentally the same while the visual indicators and special attack animations have been upgraded and made more fanciful. Other things are changed simply to give you a new experience.\n\nEvery aspect of the game is polished from the interesting tutorial to the many additional modes (survival, gauntlet, etc.) that exist beyond the (very long) main campaign. Once you get into the groove there's potentially dozens if not hundreds of hours of fun to squeeze from this.\n\nThis is a game that just has to be played to truly appreciate it as the feel of your interaction along with the music is what really defines the experience. Simply watching it or looking at the screenshots doesn't do it justice.\n\nThere are a couple of (minor) controversial changes that may not appeal to some fans:\n1. The music in 2 includes a more modernized remix compared to the more traditional music from 1. Personally I love the soundtracks from both, but there are people who have a preference.\n2. The upgrades to special attacks in 2 can be a bit of visual clutter at times. I like both styles, but there are people who prefer 1 over 2.\n3. There are some sequences (like the lightsword rounds) which did not return in 2, replaced instead by other weapons. While I think it would have been cute to include all of that along with the new stuff, it's not a deal breaker. It does however mean that both games retain a bit of unique flair and a reason for you to play and experience them both. 2 is overall an upgrade, but it's also not a 100% replacement.\n\nI would strongly suggest that if you've never played either game, you should begin with the first one. I think it's a better entry point to the series and might have a slightly broader appeal. (it's also slightly cheaper).\n\nThen if you find yourself enjoying it, come back and pick up 2 and you'll find yourself with some remixed music, fancy new special attack animations and a whole new adventure to work through.\n\nJust to be very clear: Both of these games are fantastic and deserve more praise than I can properly express and I'll very likely be putting 100's of hours into this just like I did the first one.\n---\n\nBottom line: Simple to learn, hard to master, and super satisfying fighting along with a great soundtrack.\n---\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38232109/]While you are here, would you consider following my curator page?[/url]\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/kunovega/recommended/]Want to read all of my reviews and not just the curated ones?[/url]\n- Really fun for the first few rounds... Then the game changes your control scheme without telling you, and with no way to turn it back. This has lead to several hours of frustration, trying to revert it. From what I've read, this is 'intended' to make the game more difficult, but really, is just incredible stupid. If I wanted the game to be more difficult because of a more annoying control scheme, I'd play with a god damn dance pad.\n\nThe game is really fun, but this has frustrated me to the point that I can't enjoy it any more unless it's fixed, and therefore I can't recommend it either\n- *Sigh* This game was just tiring. I wouldn't come to say it was a complete rip off of Paper's Please, but it was a very similar game but just worse. Mainly to the point that I played, at most, 10 minutes, I saw multiple repeats of the same messages, and the only updates were legislation, unlike in Papers, Please where you got new rules and new tools almost every day. I won't completely judge the game since I haven't played it the entire way through, but it's just not very good. Plain and simple.\n- Really need a report button to slap some senses into trolls in online matches.\nCan't even escape them at ranked. sigh\nGreat game nonetheless, 4/5\n- Basically Wizard of Legend, but from a different viewpoint. Same composer, both pixel art, similarly fast paced boss fights with good telegraphs, combos are a little less deliberate, though. Very satisfying build making, with solid build variety. Has couch co-op which is very nice. It has some beautiful pixel art, truly. This game is a feast for the eyes and ears with cutscenes, voice acting, and more. Ok, I just love this game. It's so damn good.\n- -This game is like the combination of old PC sidescroller like Duke Nukem (pre-3d), NES Contra, and arcade Metal Slug with 80s /90s cyberpunk and action movie tropes.\n-The cheesy humor, plot, and music is top notch. Might look like a shallow nostalgia at a glance but once you played it, they even spiritually nailed the silliness of similar games/story in that era. The guns, the character acting and lines, the costume design, etc.\n-It's not as fast paced as I thought it would be. But actually that makes it relaxing to play. Easy to get into and the challenge is just right for me without being frustrating. \n-I like how the enemies and characters are pretty diverse. \n-I haven't finished the game but I feel like this game will have similar replay value like Streets of Rage 4. Not because of there are many things to do or getting better at the game but because it's somehow just simply tight, fun, and arcadey to replay.\n- Game is super realistic, got ahead of Hamilton and he pitted me into a wall going 180mph, just like real life!\n- There is no skill requirement to play this game; everything seems pretty randomized including when and where the demon attacks you. Its rather difficult to play alone or just with two players. So if your looking for a game to play alone for a fright or just with one other buddy of yours. Make sure your ready to lose, This game has a great concept I just hope it will get more refined with the attacks. It seems like you get killed before you can even attempt to complete the objective.\n- + Great developer support. Updated quite frequently\n+ Great graphics for its game engine\n+ Great vehicle physics\n+ Dynamic time, weather and vehicle damage.\n+ Friendly interface\n+ Ability to purchase garages and hire drivers to work for you\n+ 1000s of miles of road to drive on\n+ Many cities to discover\n+ Several trucks to choose from\n+ Realistic sounds\n+ Lots of accessories and options to choose\n+ Great wheel support\n+ Many trailers and jobs to choose\n+ Multiplayer available\n+ Integrated radio and music player\n+ Console can be enabled to edit / modify different parameters\n+ Map editor\n+ Inexpensive DLC\n+ Easily the best truck simulator out there\n- The best games Telltale has ever made, plus one that is very mediocre\n-Season One: 10/10 - A masterpiece, prepare to be hit right on the feelings and cry a lot\n-Season Two: 9/10 - Awesome, and very very sad. More tears at the end\n-A New Frontier:  7/10 - Kinda good, kinda bad, mixed feelings, not much to make me care for the new characters\n-Michonne: 3/10 - Boring as hell, uninspired history, bad characters, Michone is awesome on the comics and the show, here she´s just annoying\n-The Final Season: 10/10 - OMG this game made me cry from the beggining to the end, it´s soooo good, and the end is soooo satisfying\n- They shadow dropped an update that literally breaks the game and DLC, and for what? Ads.... ads for RS+\n\nNo wonder piracy is the answer in this day and age when stupid business decisions like this are implemented. If I were to write a review a week ago I'd of said yes and recommended this, but this is just another shovel of dirt in the company's deep DEEEEEEEP hole of failures. I'm officially done with Ubisoft because of this. This was a great gateway to learning guitar and even the CDLC made it possible to learn songs that aren't even apart of the + library.\n\nSomeone please get to making a pirated copy of this game with all DLC as that will sell better than anything ubi throws out and it'll be free at that.\n- This game is a cozy  winter morning, wrapped in a blanket, in the heat of the fireplace with your favorite cartoon on and cup of hot chocolate, it is x-files, it is the music that you hear while walking on the streat, it is people you know,  good people, bad people, real people. This game has the feeling of nostalgia while being totally contemporary and modern.This game is every young adult fear and existential crisis all at once. This game is pure feeling.\n\n\nthat aside, this game is pretty much a perfect game for me, the story is really interesting, the music is beautiful and the art is gorgeous, and the characters and the atmosphere are so fucking believable i think i know everybody in this game, or atleast i feel so.\n\nAs a small town dude i really relate with a lot of thing in this game.\n\nThis game is special, its special for me.\n- This might literally be the coolest game I've ever played, and possibly the best game that I've played in the last 10 years.\n\nThough, I might be the wrong person to ask though as Earthbound is my favorite game, and this game is obviously heavily Earthbound inspired. Stylistically and comedy wise anyway. The story is much darker than anything in Earthbound, but it's all buried underneath some of the funniest writing I've ever seen in a game. The writing start to finish is amazing, I'm only dissappointed that the game wasn't longer as there's a few questions left unanswered.\n\nI did normal mode, first run, collected all characters and beat the game in 12-13 hours. For 10 dollars, that's pretty alright. The fights are pretty open ended as there are like 20+ characters you can choose from, but I ended up using Rage, Bottles and Mad Dog. I found it wasn't the hardest game I've played, but I also haven't tried pain mode yet.\n\nAnyway, if this game interests you at all, buy it. You won't regret it.\n- I have always wanted to play Resdient Evil 4, and I wanted to play this game so badly.  I am giving a negative review simply because the games FPS on the PC are bad, that could be because of Windows 10 because I heared rumors that the game does not run well on it and such, so that could be the problem.   Another problem I faced is the lip sync is dealyed when it's on the cutscenes so that makes everything slow and such.  The gameplay from what I seen however is pretty great and I think Resdient Evil 4 is a great game, but this port is not, get it for the GC, Will, PS2, or any of the consloes that has this game.\n- Some of the tightest controls, buttery smooth animation and gorgeous scenes you'll see all year. I've bought it three times now, (once for me, twice as gifts for friends) and each time was worth it.\n\nSupport developers like these.\n- I'm gonna give this a thumbs up but with like, idk, a cautionary sideways thumb for maybe. \n\nif I read credits right, it looks like this game had all its programming, art, music, and writing done by one guy, so I have to give respect to that. For a real indie game like this, it's very very good. \n\nBut it's still really flawed. If you're looking for a 2D Metroid game, and you've played EVERY other 2D metroid game, I suppose yeah, go for this one, and I think you'll enjoy it. If you're not a fan of metroid, I would not bother, sadly. This game suffers from a lot of problems from metroid games, and does not fix any, and at times exagerates those problems. \n\nThe art style is very interesting and cool, but the way the levels and map design are, leaves most areas feeling like a mess of unmemorable places. \n\nThe combat is INCREDIBLY simplistic, yet somehow bogged down by WAY too many useless weapons and just kind of badly designed controls. I found there were about 5 weapons that were actually useful in the game out of what seems like more than 10. Most enemies you either cheese, or be cheesed. There's no charge up shots, there's not really much nuance to the enemies or bosses. They have about two attacks and repeat while you dodge the same one bullet pattern and just kind of shoot in their general direction. (I played it on hard by the way. Not a particularly difficult game, but even the slightly challenging stuff felt kind of dull and uninteresting.) \n\nThe music was cool again. nothing quite mind blowing, but it was nice. The world itself seems like a mess, but there are cool ideas. The giant robot people were really cool to see. \n\nOne little idea i really liked is that the LOW HEALTH beep sound is actually in sync with every song in the game. I thought that was really cute, and it's not something I've seen any game do. Sounds dumb, but I give a lotta props to that, it was cool. \n\nWriting is okay. I feel it left more to be desired. There seemed to be an interesting world here that wasn't explored enough. It wasn't bad, I suppose, but not really that great. \n\nThat is kind of this game. It's not bad by any means, but not the best game on the planet. Play it if you're in need of a Metroid game, and I'm certain you will be pleased enough despite the flaws. Even if you're just having a hankering for a platformer and have already played Hollow Knight and some other great ones first, I think you should enjoy this, but don't expect a 10/10 game. \n\nGive it a try if you feel it looks interesting.\n- After playing thousands of games both singleplayer and multiplayer, unlocking all achievements and getting every solo map medal, I think it's time for a review:\n\nIf you like tower defence games: I recommend.\nIf you like any previous Bloons games: I recommend.\nIf you want something casual and chill: I recommend.\nIf you want a bit of a challenge: I recommend.\n\nThe tower type variety is interesting and diverse, with 5 tiers of upgrades each (plus special \"paragon\" towers)\nThe game devs have been providing free updates for years.\nThere's lots of achievements and medals to get.\nThere's online co-op, boss events and even different game-modes.\n\nThe game is more expensive than it used to be, but literally any sale price makes it worth a buy!\n- Honestly I've put over 400 hours into 20XX and this game is even better! Even though it's unfinished as of current it's still a fantastic time and truly stands out on it's own.\n- The game balances out and improves on everything from the original KoF2002. \nThat said, this is a bit more fast-paced than other KoF games. If you've played KoF98, this one is faster and more combo heavy. If you've played 13, this one has a higher bar for executing combos. If you're coming from XI, this one doesn't have the tag system. Those are the most important changes from other popular KoF games.\n- If you like management type games and RPGs, this is the perfect mix. It's just enough management to allow you to thrive with mostly strategy without feeling bogged down, and just enough RPG elements to get you invested in not just your squad, but each individual character in it. \n\nHere's a tale from my experience with the game;\n\nThis is the kind of game to change your entire perspective on life itself. Failure is not the end, nor the beginning, but a constant in this world that you can either let destroy you or make you stronger. Allow me to tell you a story. The story of New Battlehill. \nNear the Shek city of Squin, not far east, was a small town. It went through many names. The first that stuck was Firstyeet, totally not a placeholder. It wasn't an notable settlement, merely consisting of a shack, an iron processor, and some walls to mildly inconvenience the roving gangs of Dust Bandits that liked to bully the residents. After being evicted from their own city once again, the residents, Denver, Soto, Ruka, and Meow, vowed to take back their home. After training and buying the best weapons and armor they could, they made their way back to Firstyeet. To their surprise, however, they would not have to fight. One of the bandits had picked a fight with a herd of goats. The bandits' defense failed against the caprine assault. From this, the town would get its second name - Densorumego. Den for Denver. So for Soto. Ru for Ruka. Me for Meow. And Go for the true heroes, the goats.\nPeace would not last long but soon the residents of Densorumego would become strengthened by their constant fighting. On the elevated, somewhat round land on which Densorumego sat, there were many large fights involving a lot of people. If only there was some sort of name to reflect this... \nAnd from that, the town was renamed for the last time, to Battlehill.\nThings were looking up. The town built its first farms and expanded to be almost four times its original size. But this peace would not last. Battlehill's new ambitions of self sufficiency would attract the attention of a new foe - The Shek Kingdom.\nThe Shek claimed ownership of the land Battlehill was on, and as such, demanded all food grown there be given to them. Confident from their many victories against the Dust Bandits, the Battlehillites refused the Shek demands. Their risk was calculated... but man were they bad at math.\nAll but one were nearly killed in the ensuing battle, and the one person that wasn't knocked into a coma was stuck on the wall because part of the wall was destroyed and he could no longer reach the stairs because of that. The people knew they couldn't fight the Shek, but they would not allow themselves to be subservient either. And so began their malicious compliance. The Shek would get all the food in Battlehill, as it would be none - The Battlehillites were moving.\nI could write entire books about their journey around the west. The Fogmen, the ruins, the Screeching Bandits, there's many a tale. But, eventually, the people would find a new home. In the harsh and Beak Thing infested land of Vain, homeland of the Western Hive, they would found their new home - New Battlehill.\nJump to now, the city is thriving, they have more bread than they know what to do with, they've grown strong from defending their home from the Beak Things, and their population has grown. They are currently planning a reconquest of Battlehill, which was occupied by Dust Bandits shortly after they left.\n\nThere is a part I left out, between Firstyeet and Densorumego - I had repeatedly failed to retake Firstyeet, and I was about to quit the game. I was frustrated that I'd gone and bought the best arms and armor and still failed. And when I tried to set up a training ground on a mountain near Squin, bandits again came and defeated me. I went as far as to try and get a refund, which was denied. That refund being denied was the best thing that could've happened. I decided to give the game another try, and to try accepting my failures and growing from them. And if I hadn't done that, I would never have founded New Battlehill. None of the legend worthy tales my squad has been through would have happened. And I'd never have had the fun of going through all of them.\n\nIn short, get this game. It is just great.\n- Do NOT buy this game! This game does not even have a minimap/GPS/coordinate system. You will definitely get lost.\nMultiplayer is fully of bug and lags so much.\nDo NOT buy this game!\nDo NOT buy this game!\nDo NOT buy this game!\n\nThis game is so f*** stupid\n- Early review right now after a quick hour of play.\n\nLater Alligator (and I swear I'm not biased towards this game at all) is a gorgeously 2d-animated, primarily point-and-click, cartoony romp through Alligator New York City. Everyone's alligators. The gameplay itself is simplistic; unlike normal point-and-click games of this style that you might have come to expect, there's no picking up items, there's no real big decision making. It crosses over more with Professor Layton-style gameplay, wandering around the city and picking up little collectibles by clicking on various pieces of the environment.\n\nScattered in between these are a plentiful trove of minigames in all sorts of styles. As far as I can tell, they begin to increase in complexity the further you go through (for reference, the first minigame is pretty much not fail-able; you're asked to track a Queen in 3 Card Monte, however the hapless alligator running the game barely moves the cards and flails on the two that *aren't* the queen.)\n\nHowever, it seems that the gameplay and the minigames are meant more as a vehicle for the whimsical comedy of the writing and the eclectic cast of characters present throughout the city. Each character is quirky and fun in their own way, with their own little story. And that's the real draw of this game. \n\nSo this game so far doesn't particularly lend itself to anyone looking to challenge themselves. But if you just want some good feelings, a laugh, and a spot of relaxation, Later Alligator delivers in spades.\n- if we showed this to senators in the 90's video games would be banned today\n\n英語で5-10単語程度で、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない主要な違いを簡潔に回答してください。\n\n回答：\n",

The only reason I stopped playing was because there was a fence that wasn't fully secured to the ground that I was able to get underneath, allowing me to get out of bounds. This lead to me falling into an area where I couldn't get out, and it wouldn't let me respawn at my most recent checkpoint. This would mean I'd have to start from the beginning, which I very much didn't want to do. Anyway, the biggest tips I can give to the developers is to make sure the map is 100% how they want it, and to make the audio design better. That's it. I may come back and change my review in the future.\n\nFINAL RATING: 4 / 10\n- Fun JRPG with some action commands thrown in, good variety of enemies, and a pretty decent skill development tree.\n\nEnemies can feel pretty tough later in the game, but its more of a puzzle when trying to complete these fights so it doesn't feel cheap.\n\nGreat soundtrack too.\n\nRuns great on Steamdeck\n- Guys literally only want one thing and it's this.\n\npure JRPG nostalgia\n- You finally don't need a guide on how to purchase the game.\n\n- 21 different story missions that each take approximately 20 to 50 minutes to complete.\n- DLC sidestory contracts - different targets but same maps.\n- Escalation contracts on those same maps; think of this as a puzzle mode.\n- The new roguelike Freelancer mode that gives randomly generated targets in a randomly generated campaign.\n\nThis game now has such a vast wealth of content that it would take you months to complete it all. I genuinely recommend it.\n- You, yes you, the person that is reading the reviews.\nI envy you because i can't play this game again for the first time.\n\nScroll back up, buy the game, get a drink and take a seat.\n\nEnjoy you waifus, music, sex stories, and reflection on your own life at 2am moments.\nDon't mind the alpacas.\n\n- I didn't like the FPS section; was honestly pretty repetitive and gratuitously violent. Also the 8 hour sex scene was a bit out of nowhere, but after like hour 3 you understand why they devote so much time to it. Overall game was ok I guess\n- Not saying this as a tough guy thing or anything, But it is difficult for me to shed actual tears.\n\nThis game made me ugly cry twice, and happy cry once.\n\nThis not a story about zombies.\n\nIt is about a little girl growing up in the worst possible situation.\n\nAnd what she makes of it.\n\n2/13/2023 finished\n\nPS: If I ever have a daughter I will name her Clementine. This is the tier of impact this game had on me we are talking about.\n- This game is basically awesome, under 3 conditions:\n\n1- You get rid of all on-screen icons (i.e. incoming attacks, ennemy spotting)\n2- Do not care about secondary missions only here to further lenghten the game's lifespan\n3- Play the game as you would if  YOU were in charge\n\nBasically, nevermind the Ubisoft micro transactions' system and other abhorrent company induced  greed-leaned system to get stuff faster and more easily by robbing you out of your hard-earned cash...you can finish the game without spending a single dime in the store, it's all pay to win...\nThe open-world aspect is very satisfying and rewarding, in terms of progression, don't fall for the micro transaction system\nCombat is easy even in the highest difficulty setting, but makes you think you are badass when you slash through waves of ennemies, whose AI is rather basic, with your arsenal of rockets, LMGs and explosives but it is satisfying as fuck!\n\nImagine strapping C4 to your plane, jump out of it, have it crashing down an ennemy outpost meanwhile you are parachuting down and throwing hand grenades their way, land on a roof and eliminate the remaining ennemies with fire ammo shotgun and a motherfucking M60 with armor-piercing bullets while throwing dynamites and there you have it...FarCry5 in a nutshell\n\nOh and don't forget about the flame-thrower lol, who doesn't love a flame-thrower scorching ennemies to their own demise eh?\n\nFarCry5 got it all, extreme freedom of how you wanna handle a situation (stealthily or all guns blazing) while being challenging enough in the highest difficulty setting!\nP.S. don't forget to turn off all the on-screen icons, really ruins it for hardcore FPS fans by making it extremely easy, please hear me out, you don't need these!\n- This game has (while this review is being written) 10076 reviews. 221 of these reviews are negative. I think this ratio of reviews is deserved and here's why:\n\n- It's a fun story, but not something outstandingly new or anything\n- No one ever can deny that it has an amazing soundtrack\n- The combat is a bit bland, but this is compensated by the fact that the game is pretty short\n- It's a short game, but definitely worth it\n\nOverall: it's just a fun short game to play on a day off. Also, I can't get this soundtrack out of my head! PLEASE SEND HELP!\n- I find it hard to describe everything I read, I’m not even the person who usually reviews games in a serious way because of my difficulty in expressing my emotion, however, I felt the need to externalize what I felt in a simple and fast way. \n\nWhat I read is not a game neither a visual novel, it's a story of a life... Everything that’s happened in this story has stolen my heart, there have been so many beautiful moments that will be impossible to forget... \nI found myself crying over tragedies that weren’t mine.\n\nThanks NOVECT for this masterpiece full of love.\n- This game is like cocaine. \nI always tell myself just one more, then im done. I'll do homework. I'll sleep. I'll eat something. \nBut you know what? That last death was cheap, I'll do one more to make up for it. I just need 1000 gold for that upgrade, I'll just do one more to get it. Always just one more. \n\nThings I like:\n\n+Strong RPG Progression - Gold from your run can be spent on stats, equipment, abilities, etc. making multiple runs and longer runs more rewarding.\n\n+The game is witty and has flavor. -- there are various conditions your new characters can have such as being blind, gay or having a fear of chickens, amongst many, many others. Dying is in this sense, pretty fun. The writing has a lot of charm!\n\n+The controls are very tight -- this game has good controls. It's easy to do what you want, which is good because it's very tough and you will die a lot.\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n- The bosses in new game plus don't get harder -- As you progress into new game + or ++ or +++ and beyond, the bosses don't scale well, despite the general enemies leveling up to basically become bosses themselves. Not a huge deal, but it's the only negative I have.\n\nThen at some point you realize you've beaten the game, Thankfully there is a new game plus.\nMaybe just one more playthrough...\n- It's a R@PE SIMULATOR. Games like this should not be played. I was tempted to play, and will do so for a few hours in future, may be a demon has possessed me...or may be I just don't waste my money that I have spent on it. But really, you should not encourage these games. Who have not bought this game, plz don't buy.\n- The good news: you came out of cryogenic suspension in good health.\n\nThe bad news: you're critically low on supplies.\n\nThe good news: there are plenty of other vessels within range.\n\nThe bad news: they're all derelict.\n\nThe good news: you have a fleet of salvage drones you can send into the derelicts to gather supplies.\n\nThe bad news: your drones aren't the only things moving around those derelicts. And the other moving things are hostile. And the half-broken infrastructure on those derelicts is prone to fail explosively. And parts of your drones and your ship break too. And your only interaction with the outside world is with the drones. And your only interaction with the drones is through a clunky command-line interface. And you may be the last human alive anywhere. And if your drones die, you're next.\n\nSo on the balance, it's mostly bad news.\n- I've played a fair amount of games during my time using Steam.\n\nI've never felt as emotionally moved by one as I have with OneShot.\n\nI don't know if anyone reading this has played Transistor, but if you are familiar with and enjoyed that game, continue reading for a little context. (I'm going to put it in spoilers because it contains an integral part of how the game functions, which is likely better for you to experience on your own, rather than learn about it from a third party. Be warned!)\n[spoiler]\nTransistor and OneShot are very different games, but both of them share a similarity in that they have been the most emotionally moving games I've played in my entire life. They both have a huge emphasis on characters, both the one you play as and the ones you interact with or are around you. They also both have brilliantly-developed environments, The combination of these two things is one of the major factors in why I've gotten so immersed in them previously.\n\nHowever, OneShot affected me notably more strongly and for much longer than Transistor, and that is for a very discernable reason. In Transistor, you experience the stories of the characters. When it all ends, you're still a third party, experiencing things through the \"eyes\" of the protagonist.\n\nOneShot, on the other hand, features *you* as basically an integral part of the story. Because of this slight difference (which may seem negligible or gimmicky at first), OneShot basically destroyed me emotionally by the end - not necessarily because of how it ended, but that it ended at all. It wasn't just story of some other charismatic protagonists that came to a close.\n\nIt was mine, and with it, my connection to everything that happened in the game.\n\nIt's really hard to put into words... but I really wanted to put this somewhere, in hopes that someone understands and agrees. :D\n[/spoiler]\n\nAnyways, random game comparison tangent over. It's a phenomenal game - easily one of tmy favorite games of all time, my only complaint being that it ended. Extremely solid 10/10.\n\nIf you enjoy story-driven adventures like Transistor, Undertale, Night in the Woods, etc., this is basically a must-buy.\n\n- I am generally not a big fan of card games, because luck is most often the deciding factor in them, and so it is also here. But there are many solid mechanics that lessen the randomness and make it enjoyable. You can plan builds and be tactical with your card purchases, so you get a strong deck that can beat the boss. \n\nOf course it is also a rougelike, you will die. But that's part of it, you can have a strategy and get better with every run. It is also addicting in a good way. There are no in game purchases, or other such garbage that is common in so many other card games.\n\nThis is one of the best games that went through Early Access, and the developers made good updates, introducing two new characters with new cards and gameplay mechanics and also further balancing the game. They are currently working on a fourth character. They also interact really well with the players, featuring artwork and being active in the discussions.\n\nThere is much to love with this game, I saw myself coming back time and time again. \nI recommend it for everyone =)\n- Don't go in expecting a Soulsborne game. \nYou don't get to customize your character.\nYou don't get to just use any weapon.\n\nThat doesn't mean it is bad. In fact, I think it's a brilliant move. FromSoft has set a narrative with this that makes for a -real- story to be told with the player, rather than AT the player like in other FromSoft titles.\n\nIf you are worried about Activision's name being on the label? Don't be. There are no microtransactions. There is no hurdles to make you pay more. You get the game, you own everything currently available for it.\nAll Activision was in charge of was creating the tutorials, and doing some QA testing.\n\nOptimization is great, as well.\n\nYou owe it to yourself to buy this game and support Fromsoft. Show Activision that singleplayer only games are alive and well. This is a gem.\n- ***NEWBIES*** At least 50%, if not more, of this game is map knowledge. So don't beat yourself up if you're  super lost and everyone is yelling at you over game chat. Just mute the salty people and report them if they TK. Trust me there are a lot of people in the game that will back you up and want to help, so don't let one bad experience make you quit the game for good.\n\nThere are a LOT of maps to learn and a lot of small details in every one. It's going to take the average person until your siege level is at LEAST 50 before you really start recognizing map layouts and details on all maps - including room orientation, call outs, soft wall, hard wall, what should be reinforced in each site, common paths of travel, etc..  And then probably until 75 until you're actually comfortable with most maps and operators. I'll give 15% to your own gun skills, 20% to team work and communication (call outs call outs call outs, people. Don't be that guy that just looks at memes after dying. Unless it's casual.), and 15% to your knowledge of the operators and ability to utilize their gadgets. \n\nMore tips:\n-There are a lot of Diamond/Plat smurfs in newcomer that like to make new accounts and s*** on actual new players because it makes them feel good for some reason, so you're better off playing quick match. \n-To learn maps faster, make your own custom games and run around in them. \n-When you die, make sure you watch the replay so you know what cheeky angle the enemy was holding and then don't do what you did next time, or use it to your advantage when you switch sides. \n-If you're not on cams, watch teammates. Look at the places they check as they sweep rooms. Watch the paths they take. Look at how they engage in gun fights and how they rotate around the map. \n-Spend the extra few dollars to buy a version with some operators - it'll make game play more fun for you and you'll have an easier time finding operators that work best with your play style. \n-Squad up with friends - being able to communicate and laugh in a discord can really improve the game experience, even if it's just one other person.\n-Best way to really understand an operator is to play them, so take advantage when there are siege events that allow you to play whoever you want. Use this information to purchase your next operator with the game currency. \n\n\n- they should pay me to be playing this lmao\n- OBJECTION, YOUR HONOR!\n\nHow can it be a hate crime if my client loved doing it?\n- DON'T BUY THIS GAME!\nThis is one of the best games I've ever played. It is quite possibly the best and most detailed Choose-Your-Own-Adventure novel ever written and if you buy it now the creators will receive *NO COMPENSATION* for their work. I am thankful i bought it when I did, while they were still involved, but due to contracting and political differences (ironically fitting for the content of the game) the 2 or 3 writers who pioneered this project were cut out and can't receive royalties anymore.\nThis is a game about the inherent flaws in dogmatic political ideologies, all ideologies including centrism and being a moderate, and it was essentially stolen by capitalists.\nI love this game with all my heart. It is a beautiful story about loss, depression, and finding meaning in a chaotic and absurd reality. Anything more is kinda spoilery so I'm gonna stop myself there. It is all narrated so you dont have to read the enormous amount of text on your own and it is HILARIOUS. Depressing at times but always that spark of humor lingers.\nDON'T BUY THIS GAME. And *DEFINITELY* don't *PIRATE THIS GAME*. Even though it is totally in line with the messaging of the game, would be a HUGE middle finger to the corporation that cut the writers out of their own creation, and is super easy to do with like an an hour of searching Reddit or something, *YOU SHOULD* not *PIRATE THIS OUTSTANDING GAME*. Thank you for reading this, I hope you do the right thing, and you should totally hit on that girl at the beginning she is super into you and there will be no repercussions. Peace.\n- Great game, Horrible new publishers who stole the IP from the original creators. Do not support these thieves\n- a catgirl, a femme fatale, a japanese idol, a doctor, a chinese soft boy, a religious twink, a merchant and an autistic university professor walk into a bar\n- If you are looking for a game that you can never master, here is the game for you.\n- Since no one with a positive review is willing to explain why, I guess I will.\n\n          Right off the bat, visually, this game is jaw-droppingly phenomenal. The lighting, presentation, and atmosphere has been brilliantly re-captured to ensure older fans from the first game feel like they are returning to somewhere that feels oddly familiar, yet holds many new and unique encounters we have yet to discover. The colors, especially the greens, pop in just the right way to further emphasize the seemingly calm and collected forest during the day that can quickly change into a dark and unsettling nightmare by night.\n\n\tEndnight has again hit the nail on the head with the combat. Considering the old system of charging up momentum to land attacks worked exceptionally well, it's understandable they did not try and reinvent the wheel. Combat has been expanded and smoothed out just enough to keep it feeling fun, fresh and different. Landing hits is just as satisfying as it was in the old game, and mastering these techniques is especially entertaining with both new enemies and their original, upgraded counterparts. \n\n\tAs far as interaction mechanics, the inventory system has been cleverly improved, and Kelvin is a genuinely cool addition to the game. For other friendless losers such as myself, having Kelvin around is good company. Interacting with him is intuitive and straightforward, and losing track of him isn't a problem with the GPS you get right off the bat. Starting off with some way to orient yourself in a map that's five times bigger than the first game is also a welcome change. The \"quick inventory\" while you're on the move is a welcome upgrade as well. The crafting menu has also been improved, separating custom buildings from presets, which makes it easier to keep track of what you can make using custom buildings. Unfortunately, the garbage control scheme returns so for the first five minutes into my new save I was making the game playable instead of... playing the game.\n\n\tBut holy smokes the building is 1000% better than the first game. You still have your already mentioned presets for use in a pinch, and you have the massively improved custom building. Instead of laying out where you want everything to go all at once, you get to pick and choose as you create your desired structure, which makes it way easier to manage your resources while making it, and also allows you to make changes as you see fit. This is a huge step up from the previous game, and it's great.\n\n\tI see some complaints with the performance but I personally had no issues. With the medium preset my game ran at a rock solid 75-80 fps, which is perfectly fine for a game like this. Survival games don't need absurdly high frame-rates; what's more important is certainly the frame times and consistency. And my game would rarely drop frames, it again stayed at 76-77 fps with little deviation.\n\n\tI think that's really this game in a nutshell. The first game, but with pretty much every mechanic getting upgraded and reworked in a positive way (for the most part). There's some reused sound FX throughout the game which I thought was a little disappointing, but there have to be some expectations with a team of just 30 people. People get wrapped up in the fact that visually it competes with triple-A games, but those same people forget a tiny team of 30 put this together, and they are only asking for 30 bucks, which is a steal for a game with this much visual fidelity and replayability. Not to mention the oncoming free updates that will only add more content. It's certainly okay to be critical of a product and point out its flaws, but with expectations in check, this comes out as a pretty solid game.\n- It was a nice little trip, about 8 hours of gameplay (A bit more if you feel like grinding)\nStory went along nicely from start to end, in no place felt rushed.All sidequest can be done as you progress on the story.\nCombat is nice, and gotta apply every mechanic you had learnt about to fight the final boss.\nThe music, both in fights and background is really nice, has some nice Cyber-future feel\nRecommended? Yes. \nRating 9/10. Hoping for DLC or sequel soon enough\n- Sticking with the usual air of cool and weird and the usual musical flair, the latest Cosmo D entry changes up the FPS gameplay for a dice rolling RPG with quirky characters and little surprises to be found (and making pizza, of course). Can be beaten in a couple of hours but rewards multiple playthroughs for different gameplay paths and endings that can be mixed up with difficulty modifiers and challenges.\n- Shoot first ask questions later, like real life. Maybe pepper spray a pregnant woman.\n- The best game ever made by Valve. Great story, beautiful dialogues with funny jokes, interesting puzzles, perfect atmosphere and a lot of fun in co-op with friends. You made a great work, Valve, and thank You for this absolute masterpiece.\n10/10.\n- This game was a real treat. I played the 1st Valfaris and became an instant fan. I love that this is direction went by the developers, I feel it was a really good evolution of the series and mixing it up with a shoot em up gives it that extra punch/kick/slash. The graphics, characters and bosses are just so awesome and you can feel the grittiness of the mechs. Aside from the awesome game play, the environments and atmosphere has really leveled up. Love the boss destruction sequence as you can feel that accomplishment of kicking its ass. looking forward to Valfaris next installment. Congratulations with this metal AF game!\n- This game is boring, and the workshop is too little too late. In short, you should purchase Valheim. Its the best money Ive ever spent on Steam, and would have gladly paid three times the price. Perhaps in the future, other game Devs will make games like Valheim , and stop releasing garbage like this, or Red Dead, or CyberPunk, or Assassians Crud, Ect.\n- Incomphrehesible UI, sloppy controls.\n\n\nGranted I'm a day one player, but very steep learning curve. Couldn't figure out interstellar nav, for the life of me, and the touchy controls made the dogfighting a chore. Save your money. This isn't a jump in and play game.\n- TL;DR - 80-90s retro fun. Will prove you wrong if you think FMV games couldn't ever be good. Check out 5 seconds of playthrough if unsure.\nNOTE: Story isn't written in this review as game is reliant on mysterious plot. \n\n　　　For those unfamiliar, FMV stands for full motion video where you are playing a game that is based primarily/largely on the usage of pre-recorded video clips. Though it is no longer a frequented genre in video gaming, during the 90s, FMV games on CDs would often lead me into the darkened halls of many a thrilling Sherlockian mystery adventure. Unfortunately the majority of FMV games were downright awful. Pre-recorded videos with a small quantity of scenes by actual actors caused the a gaming experience to feel boxed in. Astoundingly, Her Story does the exact opposite while still being as classically FMV as FMV games go. It displays FMV like a shield of pride with the added old school touches being tasteful to a tee. As the game is \"turned on\", the screen whirring into action like any early 90s PC would, making the familiar creaking and croaking, players are introduced to their in-game desktop. The thick 90s computer monitor flares a little and in its reflection can be seen the old tube shaped fluorescent lamps that were common fixtures in most public buildings back then, flickering and popping from time to time. It is like playing a game in the past without the annoying performance issues. [spoiler]The glare on screen where you can see a better reflection towards the end made me jump a little here and there. It is fabulous as a \"moodsetter\" like many of the other suppositious yet important details that worked towards the game's impressive little plot.[/spoiler] In addition to the other details, the background music between searches where players are looking at the desktop felt like a good touch and appropriate in terms of guiding players (reacts to clips/progress etc). There is such an abundance of both subsidiary and essential detail in this game that I'd be happy with the mere nostalgia prompting ambiance. It is an added bonus, which isn't too recurrent in indie games these days where there is a deficiency in either style or story, that makes Her Story such a good FMV. It differs because players can feel as if they are in control as every person works towards the ending down a differing path depending on how they decide to investigate which is conducted solely by which searches are brought up how and when. The secret to any game that lacks the variety and freedom of choice by \"genre default\", is to give the player as much control as possible within the walls of that rigid reality. Within the uncomplicated, search - watch - find clues - check Db repertoire, players are given room to stretch and investigate on their own. The mastery is in the details so it is crucial to pay attention. Everything is told methodically and the acting that seems off in places makes much more sense once you piece the evidence and videos together. You are the \"detective\".\n\n　　　This superlative story told through proficient acting by the talented Viva Seifert (also musician/former British gymnast) weaves a surprisingly thick plot into a very lugubrious tale and the eerie horrors of the truth become more evident the more you unveil. The \"wifey killed him\" synopsis we are inclined to linger on in theory is not as discernible in-game as you'd imagine and it'll keep you guessing and alarm you at several progression points. It'll make your thoughts run wild but mostly you'll be wrong with those assumptions until you get the whole picture, as in as close to 100% off the clips as you can. The short clips have a role in that you're piecing together a very large puzzle. The splintered pieces of a total 7 interviews leaving you with 271 videos spanning between mere seconds to a couple of minutes will feel jumbled up so receiving the story in abstruse titbits as such makes you feel like your own little Jessica Fletcher and adds to the anticipation of piecing everything together. If possible I imagine it would be a fun \"couch co-op\" game for an afternoon in with a friend/SO taking notes and guessing the story together (plot contains mature content). \n\n[i]Other interesting things[/i]:\n- Doesn't stop running while you do other things so you can open up your notepad and type there if you'd rather that over pen and paper\n- Search history is helpful. Anti-Glare Filter is a nice touch. Yellow subtitles are very British. \n- The odd title is actually fittingly chosen\n- Database Checker on your desktop screen will display the overall progress you make, creating a timeline for your discoveries so investigation will be smoother\n- Each keyword brings up 5 clips at most (excluding default keyword*). Keep a list of words that stick out in clips and if you get too stuck, use default keyword to bring up whole Db\n\n*[i]Default keyword:[/i] [spoiler]BLANK[/spoiler] Using the default is not optimal. Uncovering new snippets in turn revealing new clues/plots urging you to solve the case yourself is most of the fun.\n\n[b]TIP[/b]: All clips found will have the default keyword in its details. I assigned a number for every new top she wore. Examples: [spoiler]BLANK5, BLANK1 etc..[/spoiler]. An easier method is just deleting the whole keyword for each clip watched, never to return. ;)\n\n　　　Though the sweet yet unnerving finale didn't feel as inspired, the wrap up was still nicely done. People who are new to FMV games may find it harder to get into, but it has a good depth of story to tell for the short game (3-4 hrs) that it is and I recommend it to people who enjoy a good tale. Chances are it's either going to feel like something new and interesting or old school and nostalgic. \n\n[i]Bought game on dev's site: $4.99 (Steam key + DRM free version).[/i]\n- What a refreshing experience, returning to Ishimura yet again, but with a nice new coat of paint!\nAfter so many years, we finally got a \"new\" Dead Space game, and surprisingly, they actually delivered! \n\nThere are some differences in story and other details, but honestly I think it was all tastefully done.\nThe gameplay borrows from the games after Dead Space 1, like being able to TK enemies with spikes and their claws properly, along with stomping for loot!\n\nThere are also some new differences, like new side missions for extra story, and being able to return and explore areas you have previously been to, which I think was a wonderful addition.\n\nThere were a few small issues occasionally, I imagine with time these may be touched upon, but mainly it was fps hitching when loading new areas sometimes, and very rare crashes (I crashed twice through the entire playthrough)\n\nOtherwise I kept a stable fps for most of the game on Ultra settings, and didn't really experience any other issues (RTX 2080)\n\nIt really was just overall a great singleplayer experience for one of my favorite franchises, and I hope this will do well enough, so we can see more Dead Space in the near future from now on! \n\nGreat game, beautiful visuals, and wonderful experience, for any Dead Space fan. \n\n(Also small side note, you receive the original Dead Space (2008) suit upon visiting your stores inventory, which is a very welcoming surprise! Fun to wear if you are feeling oldschool)\n- [i]While the artwork and combat remain enjoyable, the story, writing, and pacing were a major letdown.[/i]  \n\n***\nMINOR SPOILERS BELOW. If you're going to play the game, play before reading.\n***\n\n[b]The mature storylines, hard-hitting decisions, beautiful worldbuilding, and tight writing that made the first two so immersive is not present in this game.[/b] (You'll notice immediately that the writing for the caravan in the capital is [i]particular[/i] trite, awkward to read, and uninteresting.)\n\nUnfortunately, it's not just the writing that's weak. [i]The pacing is off.[/i] Antecedents are confusing, characters you'd expect to speak don't, events that should have been foreshadowed come out of nowhere. More frustrating are the serious character continuity \"errors,\" and arcs that disappear, change, or go nowhere. [i]In short, the events, decisions, and conflict from the previous games do not appear or resolve in a way that was suggested by the previous two[/i].\n\n\nHere's one example. In Banner Saga 2, Fosolt is unexpectedly rescued by Bolverk. [i]\"I have a message for Alette from the dead varl king,\" [/i]he said. That's pretty intriuging! Maybe there's a mystery, an oracle, an item, or just cool information about the Varl and their strange king? Maybe there'll finally be context about the bridge decision!\n\n[i]No! He has nothing interesting to say or add, and then his storyline just gets dropped and forgotten.[/i]\n\nWell, Bolverk's been possessed by Bellower! Gosh, who knows what Bellower will say? In fact, I can't wait to find out what happens to Bellower's body! \n\nWell, actually, Bolver's [i]not[/i] possessed, not really, certainly not like it was implied last game, and Bellower's body -- [i]a primary focus of the first two games[/i] -- isn't mentioned [i]once[/i]\n\nOr how about how they casually mention that Eyvyn is not only the [i]head[/i] of the Valka order, but also that he's had periodic bursts of hereditary madness all along? That's... odd. And it's not presented as an well-thought out [i]reveal[/i] or anything. It's presented matter-of-factly, like they were trying to ret-con in a less interesting story, or were tone deaf.\n\nYou'll notice that all the characters are underutilized and have unfulfilled storylines/tensions. Hakon has hard choices to make; Canary's a little crazy; Yrsa is mysterious; Gil's in love with Alette, etc. Will these build into choices? Reveals? Dependent endings based on choices? Will there be discussions referencing the past? Reflections on travels? Hints of despair?\n\nNo. In mine, Gil was [i]murdered[/i] and no one even bothered to reference it. Canary's situation never comes to a head. You never have to choose between Varls and Humans. Murdering people doesn't make people threaten to leave. Ubin returns randomly as an uber Varl and he's... learned the horseborne's language? Travelled the southlands? In like, a month? In a way that doesn't advance the plot? It's just... weakly done.\n\n\nThere are [i]so many[/i] examples like this, where the stories don't quite fit correctly, where what you picked up on in the early games about the [i]mysteries[/i] and the [i]world[/i] and what made it a [i]vibrant[/i] place were forgotten about by the writers. [b]The result is that it the game plays out in unsatisfying ways, in tenseless scenarios made vapid by watered-down morality, an inability to leverage the situation in fun ways, and low-quality writing, paucity of choice-making, a lack of exploration, lack of plot twists, simplified overworld mechanics -- all culminating in an almost staggeringly one-dimensional and shallow ending.[/b]\n\nThe Banner Saga series was always an experience that was greater than the sum of its part. An [i]experience[/i]. Of being [i]riveted[/i] to the computer, checking the map, worrying over supplies, guessing at mysteries, having my breath taken away at each hill. Unfortunately, that's not the case in this game. \n\n\nGameplay-wise, it's also a bit of a letdown. Combat is fun-ish, but you can make invincible character combinations and the mechanics don't even try to deal with this. There's an interesting new reinforcement mechanic that's not used heavily, and never pushes you like you think the end of the world would. You never really have to split up your forces. There's no novelty. Like maybe using a hero in a battle makes them fatigued, so you have to switch them up? Maybe you can station them different places, making them unusable for combat? Maybe you need to choose eight for a secret mission caravan? Maybe dream sequences? No, nothing like that. \n\nThe overworld gameplay had some changes that never really felt significant. Moreover, quite a bit felt taken away. You can't rest, do training missions, no longer weigh food vs upgrades. One example of all thise tone deafness was Iver's march through the destroyed world was consistently at \"Great Morale!\"\n\nThere didn't seem to be many flavor choices (\"Do we hang the criminals or let them join us?\"), including much less on social themes (\"Should women fight, if it disturbs the traditionally-minded men?\" \"One clan's rowdy, what do we do?\" \"They threaten to leave if so and so isn't banished\"), and less delayed results and fewer significant decisions, including among the game's built-up tensions among the factions. \n\n\nThere's also some cases of development [i]feeling[/i] cheap. Remember opening Banner Saga 2, and feeling that it was [i]fresh[/i], and [i]upgraded[/i]? There's little to make you feel that way here. The artwork is okay, but the environments feel more generic, with less variety, and the surreal landscapes in the darkness aren't especially interesting to look at for long periods of time. Iver is voiced by Bolverk's voice actor, and they sound exactly the same. The new title system is a fun idea, but is visually integrated into the game's menu system with the finesse of a cheap mod. \n\nThere's a moment in the game where the screen goes black for scrolling text and voiceover narration explaining the upcoming mechanic. Um, a character can't explain that? It was similar how the many two second animations are used, not to supplement the story, but to [i]replace[/i] written portions, making you feel unsure about what's going on. And finally, the game's pretty short, without fun combat challenges or interesting newgame+ challenges. \n\n\nWhat's [i]particularly[/i] frustrating is that the game's release date was moved forward four months. I don't know the story why, but I do know that a few more months of polish and story embellishment might have delivered the beautiful, grippingly interactive story we were hoping for. Because this is a watered down version of the previous two in just about every way.\n\nThis negative review is for whatever processes lead to this mediocre finale.\n\n---\n\n[i]Here's a plot that would have made more sense. Zephyr arrives and speaks to you secretly. There's a god that's still alive! Neat, now we'll finally get more story on that. Yay, fun caravan mode, now we need to take longships somewhere interesting!\n\nBut uh-oh! There's a Sundr villain going there as well, with an army of dredge! But at least now we'll finally get more story about the Sundr! \n\nThe god reveals something interesting, talks about Juno, the sun, gives a means to protect the city and help Iver. But when you return to the city, now the king and rugga and the factions have devolved into fighting based on your choices. How are you going to handle this? Which of many possibilities will ascend to the throne? How will you defend the city? And what mystery lies beneath the mountain of the city...\n\nFor Iver's caravan, there should be pockets of dredge villages kept alive by Spellsingers. Now you need to decide to plunder them or not! More stuff to do! Maybe go to the remains of the Varl capital first? Fight warped Valka? Realize deceptions, machinations, corruption, hear stories? Find new characters, have old ones die?\n\nInstead there... wasn't a plot?[/i]\n- Plants, please: A horticultural document thriller.\nGlory to Undermere.\nPros: \n- the writing and its illusion of effortless brilliance\n- attention to detail and consequences for player actions\n- \"gotta catch 'em all\" mentality that actually makes you feel smart\n- the intrigue, world-building, and game flow\n- petting the cat\n\nCons: I wish there was more music, or just none at all most of the time.\n- Started strong, ended annoyingly.\n\nMoral of the story? People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.\n\nIt paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that \"routine\" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.\n\nI liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters. But it all fell apart and tries to teach a very vapid moral that someone in their early 20's who has never had a meaningful relationship would idealize.\n\nAt least it was short.\n\n- Emily is Away Too is the sequel to Emily is Away.\n\nThe first game, which was free to play, was absolutely fantastic, especially because of its finale: [spoiler] no matter what you felt or what you wanted to do, your choices would always bring the same conclusion of you unable to say to Emily that you wanted to be more than friends, and her spending the summer with her boyfriend. [/spoiler]\nBut that was not because of \"lazyness\" by the developer: it was intentional, and in fact, towards the end of the game, [spoiler] even if you try expressing your feelings your character would delete what you wanted to say replacing the messages with generic questions [/spoiler] . In my opinion, the intention was to deliver the message that [spoiler] sometimes in life, especially when dealing with relationships with other people, there is simply nothing you can do except accepting other people's choices and move on [/spoiler] .\nIt was a very powerful ending that left me thinking about it for days after finishing the game, even if it was a short experience.\n\nUnfortunately, while playing this game I did not feel the same, powerful emotions that I did with the first one. This is because the game features several different endings, this time with two girls instead of just Emily, which isn't a bad thing per se, but it contrasts with the power of the message of the first one. Moreover, here [spoiler] you can actually achieve not one, but several \"good\" endings [/spoiler] .\n\nI liked the integration with your desktop and browser, plus the many different references to artists, TV shows and movies from 10 years ago.\nThere are still some \"twists\" present here, and if you make certain choices you will encounter situations similar to what you do in the first game, but as I said, I feel that they are not as effective as the original game.\n\nThat does not mean this is a bad game by any means: I would still recommend it, especially for its low price, but make sure to download and play the previous one first. It's free, too!\n\nRating: 7.0/10\n- If you somehow don't know what this is: It's a meta-narrative focused walking sim with a funny narrator. Only you know if that kind of thing sounds like a good time to you.\n\nSubtract about 26 hours from my playtime because I'm a lunatic who left the game running for a whole day to get a silly achievement.\n\nI loved the HD remix (never played the og mod), and I really liked this one too, but I will say that a lot of the commentary the original offered doesn't hit as hard or hold up as well almost a decade later, just because the narrative structure and how narrative is tied to gameplay of many story-driven games has changed in that time (because of course it has), as well as the mindset of a lot of players being different. So I think that it's worth keeping in mind the cultural moment the original was made during... if you're the thinky type who likes to overthink things. You massive nerd.\n\nStill, it felt nice to jump back in and spend a little more time with the narrator, and there were some legitimately striking moments in the new content that I found to be quite powerful and engaging. Overall, though, having played the original, getting all the new stuff (and revisiting the old) felt a lot more like checking off a to-do list than active exploration teasing at the boundaries of the game and it's layout than the first one.\n- This game is shit, and the devs should eat shit for shitting this shit on top of gamer community's head.\nCombat? You need a piano keyboard to dodgeparryhitlowhithighlowthendodge. Its a clusterfuck! Reaction time? None. I tried to dodge, I got damaged, Parry same story. And don't get me started on fucking archery! HELLOO ITS 2021, PUT A FUCKING CROSSHAIR so I can hit something !!\n\nWow, what a piece of shit. 18 hours of my life spent TRYING to make sense of this clusterfuck of a game. Pity I can't get a refund AND throw dung at this whitewashed game, like people did to Deuscht.\n\nI hope you devs sit on it and rotate.\n\n- THIS REVIEW IS FOR VERSION 1.3 \n\nStarbound is the space game that all people who crave space games like I do will enjoy. \n\nFrom playing with your friends and colonizing an entire star sytem to role playing as a galactic bounty hunter, this game truly offers what all of us enjoy. \n\nPros \n+ Unique art style \n+ Infinite procedurally generated universe \n+ Creative alien races that are completely customizable \n+ Pets unique to each race \n+ A heart wrenching story that [Spoilers] makes you a hero \n+ Crafting system that requires a plethora of materials \n+ Mining and harvesting isn't a grind \n+ Materials can be acquired through pickaxes, drills, mechs, and the infamous and upgradable Matter Manipulator \n+ Devs constantly working to update and add new features \n+ Every planet is different with several contributing features such as weather, temperature, radiation, and colonization \n+ Many different generated structures such as buildings and towns that generate on some of the planets, with origins of each race \n+ An upgrading and advancement tree that takes time and effort that is always enjoyable. Exploration is necessary to advance upon it, is unique to each race, and customizable to each player \n+ Crew members can be added to your ship, but I'll say more later \n+ Your own space station can be created for players and NPCs to visit \n+ You can create and fully cutomize a mech to fly through space and stomp along the ground \n+ You can visit and trade inside of other space stations full of NPCs / other players \n+ You can create colonies for NPCs to live in \n+ Treasures can be discovered pretty much anywhere \n+ Tech can give you powers like dashing, jumping, and morphing into a ball \n+ The bosses get harder and are all quite cleverly created \n+ The quests link into the web of connections that advance your tech, systems, and story \n+ Moddable in any way you like, from the intro scene to Robbie Rotten's clothes \n+ Vehicles such as hover bikes and boats are available. \n+ Port forwarding isn't required to host games, your friends can join you through Steam at any time \n+ Tiny easter eggs and hints from the devs can be found throughout the game \n+ It's fairly cheap price-wise, I mean it's a fourth of No Man's Sky and four hundred times better \n+ The soundtrack is beautiful and has brought tears to my eyes more times than I'd like to admit \n+ So many possibilities that can lead to my 700 plus hours on this game \n\nNeutralities \n~ The universe doesn't feel losslessly empty and gigantic, it's fairly easy to get from star to star \n~ Life is extremely abundant \n~ 2D and pixelated; the graphics aren't 'next gen' \n\nCons \n- You can't customize the exterior of your ship \n- Crew members are a little dumb AI-wise and not extremely useful \n- It's a bit slow paced, which a lot people don't like [strike] because they all are stupid and get bored way too fast and don't have the drive to actually work for anything [/strike] but I love it. \n\nTL;DR \n* It's a great space exporation game with a web of slow-ish paced advancement that's extremeley wide in possibilites and customization.\n* Much of the game is unique, including the races, planets, stars, and generated structures. \n* If you don't like it, you probably don't like space games :p\n- Playing this game for the first time six years after its initial release proved to be a delight in disguise. With all the memes and jokes established, I was finally able to understand what the fuss was all about back in 2011. Despite not having the best gameplay, story or graphics out there, something about this title just made me want to finish every quest I deemed worth completing. \n\n9/10 - mods recommended\n- This is mostly a worse version of the much better \"Slay the Spire\". Slightly different gameplay (Inscryption has a 'field' and some very limited mechanics from Gwent-like games), but both are deck builders with card alteration and deck probability as a core mechanic. Really expected better from the reviews and a demo that promised more gameplay aspects than seem forthcoming. Not an awful game, and has potential, but it feels like they took a basic card game and never bothered to balance it or build better guidelines for the randomized encounters. \n\nPros\n-Atmosphere is decent\n-Gameplay core is fine and could have promise but is highly random. \n-The 'scale' system works well in concept - winner must be X damage points above the opponent, not a set amount of life. X is too small.\n\nCons\n-'Roguelike' aspects are minimal so far. Even as I get more familiar with gameplay my runs are as likely to end on the first or second map. Grinding the same level doesn't get you anywhere in terms of improvements, since the end game 'summary' is determined by random cards you obtained during your run... which can be very poor. Even then, these seldom show up on future runs in my experience.\n-Few ways to guarantee what cards/powerups you get if you want to focus on any specific type of build. Additionally certain paths are OP, while others are next to worthless. With STS there are far more viable builds, and while some are better than others, most times you could construct one to get you far.\n-Powerups sometimes do nothing (e.g., Instant kill on a card with zero attack is... worthless, but if you add 1 attack it suddenly works), and sometimes create amazing combos.\n-Highly variable battles, often hinging on 1 turn or card draw. Get your top card first? Battle is won. Keep drawing the wrong 'fuel' (card summoning) source? You've lost. Sometimes you'll get 1-2 cards that are a permanent squirrel card, other times you'll need to spend a 1-2 draw actions to even summon a card.\n-Overall atmosphere is interesting, but highly limited and very repetitive. Narrative only changes when you advance and isn't skipable so spending 1 minute each death doing the same death sequence 5 times in a row ruins it. \n-You can't just quit a run. Also the stupid UI that has you click + drag to use the menu system. \n-The room, which functions as your 'rogue-like' element is limited, and once explored is dull. Late 90's graphics, low light. Puzzles are mostly bound by gameplay and even completing a puzzle and adding a card to the pool of possible draws isn't that useful. \n\nThe game needs more features to allow for 'controlled randomness' (e.g., lock certain starting cards for each run, set a preferred powerups/creature type, start encounters with +1-2 cards in hand, expand # of result possibilities, better 'rarity' parity), better permanent powerups (expand past # of \"helper items\" that can be held), scale needs to be larger (once you get the right set-up the game is over the next turn, conversely some scenarios the computer can 'rush' you and a match is over by turn 3-4). Possibly expand # of slots for cards and allow player to have 2 rows, like AI does - would also allow certain powers to be more interesting.\n- Phat beatsies,\nSelf-deprecating humour that gives me self affirmation,\nPanders to my need for nostalgic nods,\nPlays smoothly, and so doesn't leave me stuck for hours helping me to feel like I have higher than average intelligence,\nMesses about with you based on the assumption of previous adventure game experience, which leads to making me go \"heh\" outloud more than three times.\n\nMildly amusing, could use more super space dust.\nPlayed on the \"hard\" difficulty option but activated other options out of curiosity, would recommend it for the extra shenanigans.\n\nIf I had to give it a score 8/10,\nWould pay for the soundtrack, that ear crack is cash money.\n\nA hell of a lot of work was put into this game & I suggest you press \" J \" on as many screens as you can handle to get some insight on the thought process behind this game, the effort and imagination that went into it.\n\nThe missing 2 points:\nfew bugs to work out, ain't no big but in a game where you are going to be thinking \"it's not progressing because I haven't mashed the appropriate non-sensical things together\" it needs to not bug out.\n\nSoundtrack not yet out - nah not actually taking points away from that, it'll be out soon as I understand it, but I need that fix Mr. Shellburger.\n- it's a shame but i honestly cannot recommend this game if you are a disabled person, i wasn't that far into the game when my character started panicking apon seeing a disabled person [person with leg braces] and then gets a \"no good answer\" bit of dialog and all the options are saying something wrong or saying nothing, trying to go with the least bad option aside from saying nothing since i know as a disabled person myself [i'm a wheelchair user] it can be pretty upsetting getting people just randomly stare at me and at least when they say something slightly wrong they are engaging with me as a person, my character then proceeds to talk abt what an \"inspiration\" it is 2 c a disabled person living their life,,, not exaggerating when i say i let my head hit the desk, closed the game and uninstalled, i understand that this is probably put in the game to be a teachable moment for the able bodied audience but ironically in trying to educate about us disabled people they then made the assumption that no disabled people would be playing their game as there is no option to make your character disabled or even to make them remotely aware of disability and ended up just making the experience awful for the disabled gamers they seem to be trying to help\n- 100%'ed the LUCT version of the game and I'm slowly working my way through this version now.\n\nOver all the game itself is solid. If you're reading this, its a brilliant tactics game that helped define the genre. However most of the changes they made in reborn, while innovative, ultimately feel constraining. \n\nFor example, they've limited spell slots to 4, so you can only ever take 4 different spells. One or two of which (missile + indirect) are taken by a damage spell of your choice, leaving you with even less spell customization than you'd think. And its unfortunately the same situation with skills, as one will always be taken up by your weapon skill. \n\nThe cards that drop in battle, while an interesting system on paper, just end up cluttering the field most of the time, often with auto-skill activation up, which most of your units won't even really want compared to the other options. \n\nRandom battles were also removed, limiting chances to recruit to a few key dungeons as well as removing some of the more amusing battle locations from the game. \n\nI've also seen some people complain about the level cap, but in my current play-though of the game, it isn't too much of a concern for me, but it may be for others. \n\nOver all, it just feels like they've taken a step back from what Tactics ogre: Let us cling together, gave us. Yes there's bloat in that version, but it also gave us a feeling of freedom when we were putting our teams together that this version lacks. I am grateful that we saw a remake of this game within my lifetime, but I wish they had improved on Luct, rather than take steps back from it. \n\nIf they ever increase the amount of spells and/or skills you can take, to like 6-8, then I'd probably switch my review to a yes. But until then, with a heavy heart I have to say that this version just isn't as good as Luct so far.\n- please don't give an ironic positive review for this \"game\". It truly deserves the tag of \"overwhelmingly negative\" reviews.\n- I love this franchise and NARUTO SHIPPUDEN: Ultimate Ninja STORM 4 really out did itself. I love the story line and everything eles they did with the game, BUT the MAIN problem i have with this is that even with my game pad I had to install another app so that I can use the dame pad. The game couldn't completly figure out my game pad buttons on it's own and I had to re-set every button and it's a pain in the a$$. There's a MAJOR learning curve if you think you can use the keyboard, plus I highly doubt you can hit every single button at the exact time you need to press it. If your getting this in a console then thats awesome. But I don't recommend getting this from steam and playing in your Pc. If only they had figure out the controls then I would have given 10/10. So sad.\n- There is no skill requirement to play this game; everything seems pretty randomized including when and where the demon attacks you. Its rather difficult to play alone or just with two players. So if your looking for a game to play alone for a fright or just with one other buddy of yours. Make sure your ready to lose, This game has a great concept I just hope it will get more refined with the attacks. It seems like you get killed before you can even attempt to complete the objective.\n- In 2013, after 10 years of waiting, the Sim City community of modders, fans, and aficionados rushed out to purchase the fifth installment of Sim City. Ten years is a long time to wait for a game, but people had a lot of faith in Maxis when they announced the title. Long story short, it was a massive dissapointment. Maxis and EA crippled Sim City 5 with DRM, Always On APM, tiny maps, forced origin installation, lacking mod support, no steam support, and a forced multiplayer aspect.  I decided to not purchase the title, so it may have been a decent game, but 2 years later a team of 12 people created a game that does everything maxis insisted was utterly and totaly impossible.  \n\nEverything the mod community did that kept Sim City 4 on the shelves in Wallmarts across America for an entire decade was ignored. Maxis (and to a lesser extent EA) ignored the fans, and gave the people who had kept them in business for twenty years a crippled subpar game.  And for that Maxis is now out of business. They will never make another game, and it is no one's fault but theirs.\n\nNow pretend none of that happened. It's 2013 again, and here it is people: Sim City 5. \n\nThe game balance is a bit on the easy side for veterans of the genre, but the potential map size is ENOURMOUS and customizing your city could fill up years of gameplay time.  The game runs so smoothly with so much going on, it really shows how lazy Maxis was with their approach.  The glass in buildings reflects the sun and the buildings near it, there are dynamic shadows, zoning is back, and it is not 'dumbed down'.  A single tile in this game is twice the size of the alloted map in Sim City, and you can purchase dozens of additional tiles to expand.  The map editor is awesome, the community is thriving, there are mods to do anything you want, and this is the city building game we've all been waiting for.  I can not possibly reccomend this more.\n- An okay game that wastes your time.\n\n\nI played on the hardest difficulty. For me there was a pretty big difficulty spike somewhere in chapter 6 or 7. Apparently I had been skipping on the battles earlier on and was a bit too low level. No problem, I had just unlocked skill trees for the characters, so some XP spending made things manageable. I had to try the map a few times, but once I downed a few mobs and gained some levels, all was going well. The objective was to kill all the enemies by certain time, and that's what I aimed to do. Except, once I'd killed all the enemies, the objective changed and I would've needed to trudge to the other side of the map and kill the boss as well. Yeah, fuck that.\n\n\nThe combat works round-by-round in speed order. If your characters go faster than the enemies, you can simply spam AoE attacks and kill droves of them before they go. If enemies are faster, you're kind of screwed because they hit hard, you're on the defensive, have to spend turns healing and cannot attack that much. And levels seem to make a huge difference here. Combat seems sort of poorly balanced in this respect; maps are hard at the beginning, but by the end just a joke because you gained a few points of speed and are now overall faster and can spam AoE attack and kill enemies in droves.\n\nThe user interface and usability is pretty archaic. For example, to get out of a menu you have to explicitly click on the button that says \"back\" instead of just clicking a right mouse button or Esc or whatever.\n\nThe writing was quite funny at times. It also seemed of a mixed quality. A lot of times it seemed clearly aimed at 13-year olds.  (Especially cringey are the first pair of \"combat helpers\" you get.) I also did play the game for a lot longer at once than I usually do. I think there's some kind of magical simplicity about it, and it's fun to play.\n\nIt's just, in general, the one thing I dislike the most is doing again the exact same thing that I just did. That's the developers' way of saying \"fuck you\" to me, and so I don't want to play this game anymore. If you don't mind that, and the game looks like something you'd like, then I don't doubt you'll like it. Don't get it for 20 moneys though. 15, perhaps... 10 yeah, sure. Because reading the reviews, the one thing many agree on is the later you get the more garbage the combat gets. So, in essence, you only have the visual novel aspect. And if you're not 13 anymore, I don't know. Play something else perhaps.\n- This is a game that I have been looking forward to for at least 2 and a half years. I have wanted to have a game on the PC that had the elements of harvest moon (for the little bit I played of it), Animal crossing (<3) and Rune factory. I was super excited when I was approached by Leth (publishing manager at Chucklefish) at the beginning of December to help him and ConcernedApe (developer of the game) with bug testing and QA. 400+ hours later (off steam and on steam), I still love the game. \n\n[b]Farming.[/b] The farming is fantastic. It is to me one of the main elements of the game, and it's just a joy. Being able to design your farm any way you want it... yes please. Planning out what to buy every season, where to plant them, on top of the thrill of when you can harvest and reap on the gold... it's so enjoyable and addictive. \n\n[b]Fishing.[/b] The fishing is outstanding. From playing WoW and Runescape.. or any game with fishing, the fishing in Stardew Valley is so much fun. At first, the fishing is challenging, but as you progress your skill, you become a pro in no time.\n\n[b]Mining and combat.[/b] Mining and combat is incredible. Going deeper into the mines can be tough, but if you're prepared with your food and weapon in hand, you can fend off the creatures and get your sweet ore/minerals/gems that you want to bring back to your house and possibly hoard. (Hi, I'm Bexy, and i'm a hoarder.) \n\n[b]Social.[/b] Social interactions are great. Being able to become friends with the people in the town,  and eventually being able to get into relationships with people and having a family with them.. what's not to like about that? And what's great is that it gives great replayability because you can have different saves with different spouses! The backstory for each of the characters too is so in depth and well thought out, you will be silly if you don't shed a tear maybe once or twice. \n\n[b]Main story.[/b] The actual main story is well rewarding, and once you \"complete\" it, you can still continue on your adventures and farming life with no problems, hell you might even discover new things afterwards, I sure as hell did! \n\nYes, I was a tester for the game. Yes, I have played for ridiculous amounts of hours. It may feel like i'm being a bit overzealous with this. However you have to remember, I was a tester. I tested the crap out of every aspect with this game, even though there were massive game breaking bugs, errors, glitches, crashes. I still love this game. I reported many a bug, and ConcernedApe was quick to fix them. \n\nAnd that's the thing, not only is the game amazing, the developer is too. ConcernedApe works around the clock to make sure that bugs are fixed in quick time in order for us to have an amazing experience with this game. And that's true. The experience that you have with this game IS amazing. \n\nMinutes playing turn into hours. Hours turn into \"oh no it's time to sleep\".\nYou will forget about time. You will forget about sleep. You will forget that dinner was about 5 hours ago but you couldn't' remember because you were too busy trying to fight off 12 bats that were clobbering you inside the mines while trying to gather that 1 diamond waaaaay in the back. \n\nSo yes, I without a shadow of a doubt 150% recommend this game to anyone that wants to \"escape\" for days on end with what I am classifying as my #1 Game of 2016.\n- Loved the original, and this updated version is just as good.\n\nThe additions along the way are very nice, and the improved graphics are noticeable. \nBeing able to converse with your partners whenever you want is also amazing.\n\nHowever...\n\nWas disappointed to have a few areas and puzzles removed. Since those were the more difficult parts of the original game, I assume this was done for a more streamlined experience. \nInstead of your flower wilting to represent your life, it is now replaced by more accurate \"points\". Although this makes it easier to tell exactly how many hits you can take, I miss the more original old design.\nAn iconic music track was also changed, likely due to licensing issues...\n \nCan't completely replace the original for me, but it's still a very worthwhile experience! \nStill wishing for a sequel a decade later.\n- I only just found out about this game when it released. Saw a few videos and had to get it.\n\nI'm a musician, and instructor. Have been playin music for most my life and this game kicked my butt. \n\nThere's parts of each level that groove and feel \"right\" while a lot of the rest of the level doesn't seem to fit with the tempo/time signature, (each level number represents it's time signature). It frustrated me a LOT. I felt like the devs put in those groove sections to make it seem like a rhythm game but most the filler was just an out of time mess.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nThe more you learn about the mechanics, which are actually fairly complex for one button and stick, the more you'll apreciate how finely tuned this game is. So, a lot of the patterns don't exactly groove like typical rhythm games, but once you start feeling how all the more advanced scoring mechanics work together, you'll start feeling the music in really interesting ways.  It's hard to explain, haha.\n\nYes.... your thumbs will get sore playing this, like... seriously. But man.... when you nail sections and feel how it all fits together there's no comparison to how awesome it makes you feel.  \n\nThere's PLENTY of replay that can be had in this, plus the music will stick with you and make you want to play more just to hear it again.\n\nIt's worth the price.\n- I have not play for long, but know well enough this game deserves a mention. A side on, survival-ish game set in a war. Now, While I admire this game, it does have a few issues I personally find abnoxious.\nI'll start with those, and then will share what I like about it.\n\n-Characters you play seem to have never stolen anything at all from anyone, ever during the war. This is reflected in how unhappy and whiney they become caring more about the people they have taken from than their own wellbeing.\n\n-Characters you play are too softhearted. Just use the example with the point above. \n\n-Characters are expert carfters for being just average people. How many average people know how to pick locks, make servicable firearms and make alcoholic beverages? Well these three certain are capable of all three and more. For that matter, they all can do everything, but have one special skill they are the better at than the rest.\n\n-You get to only visit one building per night. This is bad since if you chose a building with other survivors in it, you will either need to steal from them to get supplies and be faced with a lot of unhappy complaining, or return home with nothing.\n\n-Visting other survivors, you cannot negotiate with them let alone talk to them. What you can do is beat them to death (or kill them with whatever weapon you happen to have on you at the time). I don't see how this was a good design choice at all when the characters you play are not personally that sort of people. Attacking other survivors is certain to cause problems with your characters.\n\n-You can not relocate from your starting place. What you start with is your base of operations.\n\n-Raids happen frequently to you only. You will never kill raiders, only chase them off and this happens behind the scenes, out of your control, while your character is out scavanging.\n\n-You can not sleep in shifts. If a person sleeps, they sleep the whole night.\n\n-Rediculous resource requirements. Some things require far too much, while others require far too little. \n\n-There is little to none interaction between your characters. No idle chatter between them. \n\n\nNow for the good points.\n-You play 3 characters to begin with, each having one specialty. They somewhat have different personalities.\n\n-The art style appeals to me.\n\n-Characters are well animated. Different staes of tiredness, different things they do when unhappy or when they have nothing else to do.\n\n-The overall idea, even though it isn't implemented well enough.\n\n-Building your shelter from ground up.\n\n-Forgaing and stealth play.\n\n\nSo while i find some issues with this game's design, if you ignore the lack of realism and consider this to be just a game with a very narrow play style, it is quite fine. It has a certain atmosphere you generally don't find elsewhere. I still recommend to give it a try.\n- Dandara is inspired by a legendary warrior who fought slavery in Brazil in the 17th Century. The similarities, however, seems to stop at the name and the fact that she is a black woman fighting a vague concept referred in the game as \"opression\". \nThe game mechanics are very unusual as you can`t really move back and forth and the art style is often charming, although sometimes it gets really generic with some enemies  inspired by Egyptian culture (I thought it was supposed to be about Brazil). The difficulty escalates quite suddenly at certain points in the game, and the fact that you have to be standing still at all times to attack your enemies is pretty frustrating. After you get used to the movement in the game, it is quite fun to jump around without the frustration of having to walk slowly through a huge map as you do in some games of the genre, especially before getting upgrades that allow you to teleport or move faster.\n The story and dialogues could also have been polished a little more. Everything is very vague making it feel a little bit like a waste of an interesting idea. Dandara is a little rough around the edges, but  pretty unique for a metroidvania style game. Worth checking out.\n- If you like management type games and RPGs, this is the perfect mix. It's just enough management to allow you to thrive with mostly strategy without feeling bogged down, and just enough RPG elements to get you invested in not just your squad, but each individual character in it. \n\nHere's a tale from my experience with the game;\n\nThis is the kind of game to change your entire perspective on life itself. Failure is not the end, nor the beginning, but a constant in this world that you can either let destroy you or make you stronger. Allow me to tell you a story. The story of New Battlehill. \nNear the Shek city of Squin, not far east, was a small town. It went through many names. The first that stuck was Firstyeet, totally not a placeholder. It wasn't an notable settlement, merely consisting of a shack, an iron processor, and some walls to mildly inconvenience the roving gangs of Dust Bandits that liked to bully the residents. After being evicted from their own city once again, the residents, Denver, Soto, Ruka, and Meow, vowed to take back their home. After training and buying the best weapons and armor they could, they made their way back to Firstyeet. To their surprise, however, they would not have to fight. One of the bandits had picked a fight with a herd of goats. The bandits' defense failed against the caprine assault. From this, the town would get its second name - Densorumego. Den for Denver. So for Soto. Ru for Ruka. Me for Meow. And Go for the true heroes, the goats.\nPeace would not last long but soon the residents of Densorumego would become strengthened by their constant fighting. On the elevated, somewhat round land on which Densorumego sat, there were many large fights involving a lot of people. If only there was some sort of name to reflect this... \nAnd from that, the town was renamed for the last time, to Battlehill.\nThings were looking up. The town built its first farms and expanded to be almost four times its original size. But this peace would not last. Battlehill's new ambitions of self sufficiency would attract the attention of a new foe - The Shek Kingdom.\nThe Shek claimed ownership of the land Battlehill was on, and as such, demanded all food grown there be given to them. Confident from their many victories against the Dust Bandits, the Battlehillites refused the Shek demands. Their risk was calculated... but man were they bad at math.\nAll but one were nearly killed in the ensuing battle, and the one person that wasn't knocked into a coma was stuck on the wall because part of the wall was destroyed and he could no longer reach the stairs because of that. The people knew they couldn't fight the Shek, but they would not allow themselves to be subservient either. And so began their malicious compliance. The Shek would get all the food in Battlehill, as it would be none - The Battlehillites were moving.\nI could write entire books about their journey around the west. The Fogmen, the ruins, the Screeching Bandits, there's many a tale. But, eventually, the people would find a new home. In the harsh and Beak Thing infested land of Vain, homeland of the Western Hive, they would found their new home - New Battlehill.\nJump to now, the city is thriving, they have more bread than they know what to do with, they've grown strong from defending their home from the Beak Things, and their population has grown. They are currently planning a reconquest of Battlehill, which was occupied by Dust Bandits shortly after they left.\n\nThere is a part I left out, between Firstyeet and Densorumego - I had repeatedly failed to retake Firstyeet, and I was about to quit the game. I was frustrated that I'd gone and bought the best arms and armor and still failed. And when I tried to set up a training ground on a mountain near Squin, bandits again came and defeated me. I went as far as to try and get a refund, which was denied. That refund being denied was the best thing that could've happened. I decided to give the game another try, and to try accepting my failures and growing from them. And if I hadn't done that, I would never have founded New Battlehill. None of the legend worthy tales my squad has been through would have happened. And I'd never have had the fun of going through all of them.\n\nIn short, get this game. It is just great.\n- Amazing game that I love to play, but the boyfriend that I was playing it with broke up with me a few days after playing this game. A game that's about fixing your relationship.\n10/10 game.\n0/10 in my heart.\n\nedit: why do people find this funny i wasn't kidding\n\nEdit # 2: It has been 7 months since I had originally played this game. What was originally a game of heartbreak and painful memories, I had managed to find it someone new to play with. While this game had terrible memories, I had decided that a game such as this was undeserving of them, and thus created new memories with another special person in my life.\n\nThe game is remarkable, with good writing, and amazing gameplay, and it is deserving of the buy. Each level is crafted with amazing detail, and all of the mini-games are just as fun as the main game itself. Don't let bad memories keep you down, and instead create happier ones. Live your life, ya'll.\n- How the hell did I not hear about this until the very end of 2021?\n\nA beautiful blend of all your favourite action-adventures: Your Zeldas, Metroidvanias, Dark Souls, Megamans (more Zero/ZX), Features local/steam play-together co-op. \n\nThe OST also slaps. I don't expect very moody noir piano in my dystopian cybernetic future but here we are.\n- I normally hate \"retro\" platformers, I never liked Mega Man, only Mega Man X, didn't care much for Shovel Knight but loved Hollow Knight, things like that. The Messenger IS a platformer, even though the second part of the game makes it less linear, and I loved it.\n\nDevs could take a lot of notes here - checkpoints are frequent, boss fights are short and creative and you don't have to go through 2 easy phases to retry a hard 3rd phase, most rooms and even most trick rooms have multiple ways to approach them given your fairly simple moveset. You never have to do anything pixel-perfect to get through but doing things well is massively rewarding. It constantly surprised you with new things but doesn't overstay anything, and completely foreign mechanics introduced are not punishing (Skylands, for example).\n\nA lot of people comment on how great the writing is, and well... it is great. It's sparse but fantastic throughout, with more personality in what amounts to a few pages than most games can give with 10 times as many words (and lore pickups).\n\nFor reference, I completed it with all the challenge collectibles in 14.5 hours, but did not get all achievements nor go through NG+. It is well paced and hard to put down, but easy enough to play in chunks, and I felt like I was learning new tricks up through the end of the game.\n\nDo the thing!\n- If you're a STAR RAIDERS fan, look elsewhere, it's broken.\nFirst off, I  think they did a fantastic job on the Star Raiders port,\nthe controls are spot on, it works seamlessly with a controller,\nall the keyboard controls were mapped brilliantly, great job.\n\nBut....\n\nAlthough the NOVICE and PILOT missions work well, those who adorn the game will\nselect WARRIOR or COMMANDER and sadly, these higher levels are broken.\n\nOnce you get down to the remaining 8 enemies or so on the map, the difficulty ramps up to insanity.\nCome out of a warp, get plummeted by 3+ meteors in a row.\nPhotons gone.\nRinse and repeat until you just give up, it's relentless, and I've yet to be able to finish a game on COMMANDER\nlevel because of this.\n\nI've tried all the different speed modes, original, opengl and direct3d, nothing helps, it's broken.\n\nAnother minor gripe is that the \"Destroyed Engines\" mode is just the \"Damaged Engines\" and barely impacts\nyour speed.\n\nI really hope that this is patched, I'll gladly revise the review once it is.\n\nEverything else is great, the arcade ports are fine, the controls are practically 1:1 in the trackball games,\nthey all feel just like the arcade (unlike Atari Vault, cough cough).\n\nThe Jaguar games are a blast, T2K still rules. I would have loved to see AvP, perhaps a future DLC.\n\nBut the main reason I spent $40 was for Star Raiders, one of my all time favorite games, and in it's current\nstate, I feel like I've wasted my money, sadly I spent so much time troubleshooting it, my refund window is gone.\n\nI'd say wait for this on a heavy sale and if you're a die hard Star Raiders fan, don't do it until it's patched!\n\nAnd still no word from the developers on any patches.........you guys out there?!? \n\n- Think you’re good at racing? Well, this game will give you a RKO.\n\nI don’t even know much about rally when I bought the game. I just see cars driving at dirt, weaving steering left and right constantly, and thought it looks cool. \n\nThis game is HARD. The learning curve is really steep. The first time I played, I constantly fly off a cliff and hug into trees. Because i don’t understand what my co driver is reading. He talk so fast that my tiny brain couldn’t process in time, sometimes I’m so confused that I go straight in junction because I can’t remember he said turn left or right. The cars are constantly out of control. \n\nAfter I learned about weight transfers that I’m able to start utilizing oversteer into corners. No more cripple into finish line with two tyres missing, that’s when the fun begins. Dirt Rally 2.0 is different from other racing games. You don’t race against other drivers, instead you race against time. If you turn off the hud, then it’s only you and the road, and TREES :)\n\nThe sound of the gravel hitting under your car. Dirt stained on your car as you progress through out the stage. The pops and bang coming out of exhaust when you shift. These combination feels somehow relaxing and satisfying at the same time.\n\nThe only downside of Dirt Rally 2.0 is that it requires constant internet connection, even when most of its content are single player. I wouldn’t complain if the server is stable. But sadly it isn’t. The server down happen quite frequently. Imagine you feel like you completed a 10 minutes perfect run, no crashes or mistakes. But then the game refuses to connect to the server. So the game won’t record your progress. It’s like a big middle finger to the player. \n\nI could make this review a thumbs down solely for the “always online” requirement, cuz it makes the player experience kinda inconsistent, but the gameplay itself does make up for it though. I mean when it works, it works remarkably well.\n\nApart from always online issue. Dirt Rally 2.0 is fantastic, the handling, physics, graphics etc. everything is on point. If you’re interested, buy the GOTY edition, it easily double the contents of the original game had. Worth every single cents.\n- Finally, a video game that is everything televangelists in the 90’s said that video games were. Exactly what my Christian mother would love to catch me playing.\n\nIt’s like Animal Crossing and Doom\nEternal had a son… as was foretold when they released on the same day.\n\nThis game really makes you FEEL like you’re sacrificing your friends to an almighty force. Would I really just sacrifice 5 of my friends  again for some loot chests? I’m a gamer, of course I would.\n\nI fell in love with the aesthetic of this game instantly. It was brilliant when the gameplay held up to those expectations.  \n\nI loved it. I loved the art. The humor. The theme. The premise. The combat. The cult management. Sacrifices. Collecting the bones of my enemies. The juice visual effects. Most of all I loved feeding my followers bowls of poop.\n\nThe combat is fun but definitely not the meat of the game. Building your cult and just upgrading stuff is quite satisfying.  There's some goofy stuff to laugh at and it's quick and responsive. There’s something about the music that makes you feel relaxed and in terrible danger all at the same time.\n\nThis is not a game that you're gonna put 50-100 hours in either.  Which to me is a big plus.  Most of the runs don't take you more than 15 minutes.  So it's an easy game to pick up and play for a bit and jump back in later. It's like Vampire Survivors in that regard.\n\nIt's basically Animal Crossing with a roguelite twist. I could say it's almost original how those elements were combined.\nIt's great entertainment, all around. You could even say the game is bound to become a cult classic…\n\n10/10\n- I couldnt get past the first fight on the inside of the castle because geralt ust sits there and doesnt do anything. Dodging doesnt do anything if i cant kill ther enemy. The combat is atrocious, doesn't let you fight the way you want to (which is utterly asinine and these three things literally made me quit playing the game permanently in 10 minutes time. However since i want to know the story im just going to watch a lets play of this on youtube.\n- Two words: Modding Heaven. This is probably one of the most modular games I've ever played. \n\nYou wanna play Mount and Blade in a historical time period instead of Calradia? OK, which one? Don't answer, it doesn't matter, there's probably a mod for it. \n\nWanna add in some magic and play in a fantasy universe? There's mods for that. \n\nHow about a game set in the modern day? Or in a sci-fi universe? Or a post-apocalypse wasteland? Or the Wild West? Or maybe something specific like throwing your hat into the Game of Thrones, or defending the World of Men in Lord of the Rings, or taking over the Empire from Star Wars?\n\nPerhaps you'd like to set sail on the seven seas as a pirate in a nautical adventu-! Oh, wait, OK, there aren't any of -those-. \n\n...but there's mods for all of the others, with even more being made every day! \n\n\nI guarantee, if you buy this and are open to modding your game, you will never go another year without playing Warband. Maybe a week, maybe a few months-- but just when you think you're done with it, you'll find another mod based on your favorite movie series popping up to pull you back in. \n\nIt is worth well above whatever you'll pay for it.\n\n\n- I definitely would not recommend this. The aesthetic of it might appeal to some people, which is what initially drew me in, but the visual awe wears off after seeing the same scene too many times. The game is best played with paper and pencil in hand so that you waste as little time as possible wandering around in a straight line. \n\nThis game survives off of the mysterious nature of its content in the sense that if people knew how small the experience was, they would not buy it. I was thoroughly let down by this game, especially since its promotional material hyped me up for an exploration game with a unique method of interacting with the world. \n\nThe main feature that sets the game apart from other titles, the use of the telephone to access parts of the static world, becomes little more than a password screen used to pick up where you left off or were booted out of your game by a short time limit. After the first two or three times I used the game's core feature, I was tired of it and wished there was a way to play the game that was faster or had more depth.\n\nFor anyone who has played or seen any amount of gameplay from Yume Nikki, you will realise that this game's design begs the audience to compare the two. However, the most useful comparison to draw between the two is by using the game that Madotsuki can play in her room as an example. In Madotsuki's game, \"Nasu,\" is a joyless game about catching fruit. It is repetitive, intentionally annoying, has no bearing on your progression/success, and is meant to urge you toward doing something else. Unfortunately, this is a suitable comparison, as it succeeded in making me feel like Madotsuki in real life and I want to turn off the game and do almost anything else in record time.\n\nI truly wanted to like this game, but I cannot justify spending $5 for this experience when I played better flash games all the way back in middle school for free.\n- Basic game, extremely well done. Like going home and eating your mom's food after decades on the road.\n\nEditing the review to mention some of the flaws of the game:\n- the level design in general is not that great, with every tiny room requiring some mindlessly easy puzzle to be solved first. Eventually it just feels like a chore.\n- not sure if it's something with my steam deck, but I had to put both the game's and the screen's brightness to the max to be able to see things; before that I was constantly missing objects and having trouble with moving around because some soil path looked like a hole in the ground or something.\n- while the game is 2d, there's a lot of different layers of height and depth that get mixed in together and may be hard to tell apart. You often don't know if some platform can be climbed onto or jumped out of until you try to do it.\n- battle system gets repetitive after a while.\n\nDespite those problems, the game is still great and more than make up for those things in other areas.\n- Great game... who need 1 or 2 years of development. tl;dr: mid game turn into a micromanagment hell.\n\nThe game is fantastic until a certain point. You start as a mercenary, one party, 50-150 soldiers doing missions, small battles or bigger fights joining armies. Good graphics, brutal engagments with 200-1000 units at the same time if your computer can handle, playing as a soldier is a blast.\n\nThe problems start when you get a few towns and a bigger family, the micromanagement never stops and gets worse overtime. You have to physically move your party to towns to fix their issues. When your lords get captured & escapes, they'll go into a random town until you pick em again, then you'll have to reform the party. Same with caravanes for trading, if they get captured, you'll have to go in his town and recreate the caravan. You have to partially fill towns with soldiers, manually, from your own soldiers. All the little fun things of the beginning soon become a hassle, as you can't delegate. Messengers are not a thing.\n\nYou can't manage a town at a distance, you can't tell a party member to move to a location or guard a territory, they do whatever they want if they're out of your army / party, so you have to do it yourself. Either you're leading your huge army to fight what is basically an enless war mid game, or you take care of your cities while the rest of your faction fight... with various success. Some commanders are pretty good, other will throw waves of recruits at highly trained arbalists in the open backed with cavalry. Protip: don't be a recruit in an imperial army.\n\nYou can't tell a party you created to guard an area or to kill all bandits attacking your villagers, it's up to you, or the IA if it feel like it. Worst, if you let the parties you created roam around (parties = group of 70-200 soldiers under a lord) they can be (temporarily) drafted in other armies of your kingdom... and you'll have to physically move to the army, talk to the leader and pay some reputation to get them back. Of course, large armies are slow. This leads the the next problem, swarms.\n\nMy worst fear is not a massive army, it's an army disbanded in the middle of my territory. The small parties usually start raiding all villages in the vicinity while being too fast to be catched by a big army. Raided villages impact your town / castle loyalty and gold quite heavily. Sure, you could disband your army and hunt them yourself... but that makes you take a step back, and all your parties would reform under another army you can't control. And man, some army commanders are really, really stupid. Verdun style charge in the open against walls of archers, cavalry in a forest vs pikemens, you name it. I can't count the time i had parties wiped in someone else army. But let's say you managed to capture the lords burning your villages.\n\nThe capture system is broken. Captured lords escape A LOT. I had some escape 20 seconds after being captured. They never stay in a jail for more than a few in game days. Once they escape, they magically teleport to their hometown, rebuild a fast 80 mens army in the blink of an eye and go back to raiding villages. AI \"cheat\" with recruits, they will always find soldiers in town, even if they're empty for you. Executions you say?\n\nIf you execute a lord, no matter how much of an A-hole he/she is, the whole faction will hate you. He raided dozens of villages and killed hundreds of peasants? Still not good enough. You just can't kill a lord without suffering heavy consequences down the line, and you'll need those lords to be friendly later. Worth to mention, capturing the leader of a faction won't stop a war.\n\nLast - peace / war is on/off. I had 600 days of continuous war, followed by 600 days of complete peace in the entire map (due to a bug apparently), and i'm now back at 300 days of war. Not a single day of peace, when one war stop another start immediatly. They will just never, ever stop fighting. Can't catch a breath, can't leave the front of your lose towns.\n\nOh and the main quest randomly failed after 875 days or so.\n\nI would still recommand the game, it's really fun for a while but it need a HUGE QoL update.\n\n- IRL, I really am an unmotivated 20 year old college student, not many friends, living away from my mom.\nThis is a game that kids might not be able to relate as much as peeps my age.. but Im not saying there's an age restriction or something, no. There's a lot of useful lessons anyone can pick up from this.\n\nThe emotional issues it tackles are pretty grounded and somewhat refreshing to see in a game. There's a HUGE mystery element when it comes to the story. (which is sooo damn good mind you). But the conversations you have with the people in this game are just so real and cherishable, you could just wish these in-game days won't stop. \n\nThe small moments you have with family and friends in Night in the Woods are probably one of the most amazing experiences I ever had in a game\n\nPS: After finishing the story, I got all sappy and tear jerky that I went and called my mom to tell her that I love and miss her and stuff.. that's what this game is.\n\nUgh kill me. Im so corny. I love this feeling. So refreshing. f*ck off all of you.\n- A really well-crafted piece of interactive media, that sets a very high bar for future video game \"making of\" projects. \n\nI had only vaguely heard of Karateka before, but nevertheless really enjoyed how this story was told. All the supporting documents, assets and (playable) prototypes are presented in a neat timeline, alongside the released games and remasters, with video interviews that tie it all together into a great story.\n\nIf you have an interest in video game history, solo video game development, or game publishing in the 1980s, do yourself a favor and check this out!\n- Open world exploration by design, pants soiling horror by incident. Blends the concepts of innate human fear of deep water and unknown danger with constant, all pervading curiosity.\n\nYou have to dive deeper. You have to know what's down there.\n- I'll preface this by admitting that it makes sense for so many of the \"helpful\" reviews to be negative; it's good to warn customers of a game they won't enjoy, and The Witness definitely isn't for everybody.  That said, this is among my favorite games, and I was looking forward to The Witness for a very long time, so the fact that it lived up to my expectations says a lot.\n\n(You may find it helpful to know my preferences, so here are some of my other favorites: Fez, Portal, Infinifactory, LIMBO, The Beginner's Guide, and of course, Braid.)\n\nAs other reviewers have pointed out, The Witness isn't \"fun\"; that's not a criticism, it's just an accurate observation.  The Witness is treading unfamiliar territory, but only for a video game: most other artistic mediums have been used to explore themes other than \"fun,\" and it makes sense that this medium can be used similarly.\n\nInsofar as objective criteria exist for judging the quality of a video game, The Witness meets every standard I can think of: the game runs smoothly, the team have been timely about patching bugs, the visuals (gorgeous and stylized) and audio (understated and lacking music) are expertly executed, and the design of the world and puzzles is meticulous (and ambitious).\n\nThe only objective drawbacks I can think of are:\n\n1) The absence of an FOV slider (important for those who suffer from motion-sickness), which the developers have hinted may be added in a future update. UPDATE: this has been added, along with some other configuration options.\n\n2) Some of the puzzles are impossible to solve if you're deaf or color-blind.\n\nFrom what I can tell, The Witness is about making your own observations and forming your own theories about how the game mechanics work (the title of the game is relevant to its content); it's partly about solving puzzles, but more so it's about figuring out what the puzzles even are and how they work in the first place; given that, it's easy to see why The Witness fails to provide players with a clear goal or feedback: that would undermine the core of the game.  Patient curiosity is the best mindset with which to approach The Witness; it's like a piece of cloth with a loose thread: you pull it, and it keeps unraveling, and unraveling, and unraveling...\n\nThe intrigue of The Witness stems from constant and subtle revelations about how the game functions, which tend to overturn your previous theories and force you to let go of your presumptions, all without ever jumping the shark.\n\nThe Witness is slow to get rolling, patiently waiting while you adjust yourself to the mechanics and freely allowing you hold on to your false sense of comprehension.  You might expect a game like this to be eager to shove its paradigm-shifting revelations in your face, but it generally isn't: The Witness makes no effort to divulge its secrets, and when you peel back another layer, you can take comfort in the fact that it's a real accomplishment on your part.\n\nThe island is dense with puzzles (more so than it appears at first), and each of the nearly 700 puzzles (according to the developers) presents its own unique challenge, and a peek into the mechanics of the game (if you're paying attention).  The puzzles are each short, but satisfying and interconnected, so it's easy to leave the game at any time, and they're grouped into areas, where each area explores a particular game mechanic.\n\nBecause you're free to wander the island, you can walk away from one area if you get stuck and try a different one.  I usually had two or three areas I could choose between at any time.  If you try to play through each area, beginning to end, one at a time, I imagine you'll not enjoy yourself very much.  Once you get stuck on a puzzle, rather than continue banging your head against it, I recommend venturing off to find a different one; returning to a puzzle with a fresh palette and new mechanics under your belt may shake something loose.  The puzzles generally shouldn't require guesswork, and all of them are fair.\n\nThere's no narrative in The Witness.  You'll find recordings scattered around the island, which contain quotes from people throughout history, generally on the topics of awareness, discovery, investigation, and the monotheistic concept of a god.\n\nBeing an atheist, some of these fell flat for me, while others less concerned with theism hit hard, and one even had me teary-eyed.  Each one rang with the sort of sincerity that will either move you, or make you very uncomfortable, depending on how it plays against your own life and beliefs.\n\nIf I'm to be honest, I think The Witness has affected me on a personal level: its themes of exploration and discovery, and its quiet faith in your capacity to unravel its mysteries are comforting.  If you're in the mood for some introspection, you'll probably enjoy it as I have.\n- Do NOT buy this game! This game does not even have a minimap/GPS/coordinate system. You will definitely get lost.\nMultiplayer is fully of bug and lags so much.\nDo NOT buy this game!\nDo NOT buy this game!\nDo NOT buy this game!\n\nThis game is so f*** stupid\n- I didn't want to review this until I was completely done. I've now 100%'d the game. Quite simply, I think everyone should play this game! It's perfect for puzzle players with easy and difficult puzzles, most of which feel very satisfying to solve, has fantastic commentary about all of the perspectives of today's society (it's not just a one-sided view!) and is a genuinely well-crafted game.\n\nMost facets of the game are positive so I have to point out the negatives in the game.\n1: There is no save/load system, it's all automatic checkpoints and you have to go and back up the files manually if you want to see the results of different choices.\n2: The choices you can make, or miss, have some light dialog consequences but they occur over many hours of time. This is something I don't really expect from a puzzle game that used to always tell you \"you can return to any place you want at any time.\" In this game, you can't. The time of day and weather of locations can irrevocably change, the ending itself has some major changes, yet there's no way to see it all without replaying the game (a tough pill to swallow for a puzzle game) or watching the results on YouTube. I'm kinda against that sort of thing unless your game can be played multiple times and be different each time, which this won't be, because it's the same puzzles each time.\n3: The engine is Unreal 5 and it's very unfortunate. Although the game may have been easier to develop for multiple platforms in a faster time via doing this, but it has proven that Croteam's old Serious Engine was a much better engine. Unreal 5 has horrible eye adaptation, anti-aliasing, lighting, and geometry options that are all proven to be horrible via this game. Don't get me wrong, the game runs and looks fine for the most part, but all of it could look better and run better had it been built on any other engine. Yes, *any* other engine. I'd sooner have played this on the Source engine. Epic's Lumen and Nanite technology is still too unproven, early, and crappy to be the generational leap they claim to be. I hope the developer can better tune this stuff so players can have better framerates, less ghosting, better lighting, and eliminated distant object pop-in.\n4: The game's pace at the start and end are worse than they could be. The beginning spends too long (and a lot of later optional dialog depends on your exploration of this) in an open world without puzzles while the end has a final puzzle that includes a frustratingly tedious walk-about aspect that needed to be shortcutted somehow. Everything in between (including the breaks you get back in the open world bit) is perfectly crafted and paced, though.\n\nThese things said, I still insist that if you enjoy any form of puzzle game, like Antichamber or Portal, you play this game. You will enjoy it!\n- This is one of the most beautiful games I played since Shadow of the Colossus. And much like SOTC This game is a visual delight not all the visual feel pointless or feel to in your face no all of it is PURE atmosphere and really enhances the experience when exploring the many levels in the game. The game's ability to tell a very deep story visually without any dialog or exposition to undermine the player is absolutely brilliant. the game be very diffult the first time playing but feels rewarding after you level up Ori as you continue to fight bad guys.\n\n My rating is 10/10\n A stunning game with a compelling storyline that worth every penny\n- I bought this game because it was supposed to be like Harvest Moon. I'm now close to finishing an ingame year.\n\n+ The town and art style is very much like Harvest Moon\n+ There are a lot of interesting characters with lovely art to socialize with\n+ The dog is helpful, barking on spots where you could dig out some items\n+ Some events, scenes and dialogues in this game made me smile to no end. This is a happy game.\n\n- You have a farmland of 40 tiles and farm by seeding tile by tile and watering tile by tile. The watering can is your only tool and upgradable to water 3x3 tiles.\n- Friendship is a grind, as is tradition in the genre. I once gifted a whole harvest to a girl without visable change in the 1 to 10 affection meter. After finishing the friendship grind on 3 villagers, the game seemed to reward me with... some random dialogue lines.\n- You can only bind the shovel and watering can. You cannot bind anything else like the brush or milking device or animal fodder. This makes the daily barn work quite nasty.\n\n\nIf you need a Harvest Moon on PC, this isn't what you want. Games like \"Friends of Mineral Town\" had a significantly larger focus on farming simulation. World's Dawn is a small town simulator with a little gardening on the side.\n- Has combination of tight controls and well designed levels that makes platforming satisfying, excellent graphical style and music, as well as tons of unlockable content that will keep you playing even after finishing the story.\n\nVery solid platformer.\n\nThe only downside is there's no online coop; only local.\n- plz,plz,plz, add a way to easily see what wrong with your car. i built my car and it wont shift into gear, NOW I HAVE TO CHECK EVERY SINGLE FUCK NUT TO SEE WHAT WRONG. i have never felt so betrayed,let down, exaughtsed,hatered, and regret.\nkill me\n\nedit, nvm i just dont know how to drive\n- There is an ethereal beauty to Ori that makes you believe in the power of love. As you play it you know you're experiencing something special that comes around very seldomly and that you should do everything within your power to appreciate it. It feels like a special privilege to play through it. Its a piece of art for the twenty first century. It's a reminder that there still exists impossible beauty in what sometimes feels like a bleak hopeless materialistic world. If you remain steadfast though and look for it, you will find things that will inspire you, things that will give you hope again and things that will remind you of why life is so beautiful and worth fighting for. Don't despair, fight. Fight for Ori and everything she stands for. It's worth it.\n- More broken than Cyberpunk could ever dream. Sure the game has nice graphics but the game play, toxic online players, and poor physics make this one of the most frustrating games I have ever played. Dont even bother using the stable either your game will glitch and youll be stuck looking at you player stuck in the stable and nothing more causing you to reset the game or the rogue horses that will drive by kick you in the face. Good luck if you play.\n- Wow! Let me start by saying that for the last year, I worked in what could be called a high tech arcade. We featured a number of VR stations there, and I watched people playing Beast Pets that entire time. I ended up leaving the arcade before being able to try the game (the stations were only on when customers came in, which is when I left for the day), but since I had watched enough people try it, I felt like I had a pretty good grasp of the gameplay -- cute and light. When I saw it hit the Steam store, I was curious to finally play it. I'm more of an FPS/RPG kind of gamer, so I wasn't sure how much I'd be playing it. Well...it's really fun!! There's an immersive aspect to interacting with little AI's in VR that completely changes the experience. For example, while playing Skyrim, you get to have little companions. You interact with them a bit, they follow you around, and that's basically it. But when you're in VR, it actually feels the same as when I'm playing with my puppies. These little guys can fetch, follow a laser, and interact with the environment. There are places for you to explore, and each location offers something unique for the dragons (and you) to play with. And speaking of the environments, they're really pretty! The art style is low-poly, and it works perfectly to create ambiance while allowing you to interact with your new pets. The creators came up with some really clever conventions for interaction that make the experience smooth and hassle-free. This game is great for everyone, and I promise you it's absolutely worth your time.\n- A Visual Novel meets The Stanley Parable by way of Disco Elysium. This game contains a shocking amount of depth of content and thematics behind it's excellent voice acting and 3-colour sketchy visual style. Well worth a play if you're intrigued.\n- 1. Mea Culpa > Ruego Al Alba\n2. combat feels much better\n3. oops no instakill traps\n4. [strike]bleeding crown prayer is too strong[/strike] wtf, just got the time stop prayer\n- In all honesty, I became a little bored in the middle of playing it. It wasn't until I was almost through with the story that I realized why it had gotten such high ratings. You have no idea how hard it hit me when I realized why he was at the hospital [him being at the hospital is not a spoiler btw], and how relieved I was when he had at last found peace. It was in that moment that I had no regrets in purchasing it and how it was worth my time. Despite how brief the game was, I'm gonna remember it for a while. \n\n\n- One of the hardest game I've ever played, also the most fun. Satisfying gameplay + pretty cool visuals and story. The moment the game clicks for you is like crack. Finishing the game gave me a better feeling than that one time I escaped child services by immigrating to Argentina\n- I'm severely disappointed whenever a game points at the stands and intends to hit a home run, and then instead smashes the pitcher out after the bat flies out of their hands.\n\nIt looks wonderful, it's relentlessly and uncompromisingly unique, and it plays like complete hell.\n\nUnreasonable difficulty, bordering on sadism, a unique idea let down by just-so-imprecise hitboxes and the feeling of being far too weak to take on anything.\n\nI haven't enjoyed this game, I can't recommend it to anyone else, if you buy it and find favour with it then bully for you, but I'll never understand how.\n- Before I begin, are you a fan of modern art? If no, I can safely say move on, this isn't the game for you. If yes, then you can appreciate that there is a lot of famous modern art. Some pieces you will find yourself drawn to and feel something about them, and others won't evoke any real response. This is true for most things in life, but we tend to try and find reasons why we feel a certain way about other mediums, while with art we are usually happy enough to admit the various factors like skill, materials used etc. don't really impact our overall opinion of the piece.\n\nKentucky Route Zero is an incredibly well made and obviously incredibly personal game, and the level of effort put into it is astonishing, and I didn't like it. I wish I liked it, it seems so much like something I should like, but I don't. The strangest thing is, I would call this the game's greatest triumph. \"Games as Art\" has been an ongoing debate for years, but artist's always make something for themselves, while most games are made to be enjoyed. The fact that I didn't like this but I can't actually pinpoint the reason is evidence that this might be something more than most other games in this space.\n\nI won't go on too much longer here because while I cannot recommend something I didn't enjoy, I do absolutely think anyone interested in narrative games try the first two acts. I did enjoy the first act and can recommend that with no reservations, but from the second act onwards my interest and patience just declined more and more. I have no problem with wordy games, I've played plenty of visual novels that took 50+ hours to complete, but here I feel more and more of the story was being told with blanks I was supposed to fill in, but I just wasn't engaged enough with the characters and setting to bother with that, so you can easily see how this would become more frustrating over time.\n\nI wouldn't change a thing about this game, to me that would be like asking a painter to add in a few more trees to a finished piece. This game exists as a piece of art. I didn't like it, but you might love it, and you might not be able say why either, and that's a big achievement.\n- This game's constant revealing of stranger and even stranger esoteric strangeness with every case, the way hitting start you are slammed in the gob by an unexpectedly gnarly tableau, a sinister mise-en-scene with a man burning to death on fire or blasted apart by a canon while wry cultists in various states of masked and undmaskedness make slight comments to say How deserving they were to be killed by us in just that way, oh yes!\n\nAhhhh! That is all about what I love The Case of the Golden Idol for.\n\nIt is 13 deduction puzzles (including the DLC) for you and perhaps a friend on the couch wherein you will become acquainted with a decades long revenge tragedy that tore several families and several kingdoms apart as many people lost there lives in heinous and sometimes magical ways. As you move along the story and investigations grow more complex, which could be a bit fatiguing, especially by the end of the DLC. Though everything here is great, don't mishear me. The art is disgusting. It's visuals and music complete the necessary deranged curious mood to undergird the transmutating tone of a murder-filled horror story into one that equally unnerving as it is subtly hilarious.\n\nThis is a game made by some Latvians from Latvia, and maybe, buster, you should just pay them some money and attention.\n- First thing you see when the game loads is \"You have to buy the game to blahblah\", as i didn't know there was a paid version, i felt betrayed. Anyway,\nSorry, i tried it, not expecting much, but there was not much from it..\n-Graphics are bad\n-Movement and animation are clunky, same with attacking\n-Zombie AI would hit you even if you walked backwards 2 seconds ago\n-Regions are EU and NA, multiple servers each with a PVE server, but it was so empty.\n-Gameplay-wise.... so many questions like, \"Why do i need to hold E for 5 seconds to open a fridge?\", \"Why does headshot being counted but it doesnt insta-kill a basic zombie?\", \"Why does the soldier npc's look like they are making money from you?\", and lasty \"What the heck is the goal of this game?\"\n-Oh and driving vehicles SUCK! *ehem*\n\nSorry NOPE\n- I don't usually give negative reviews on games, but holy shit. The map is not even done and you can go outside the \"map\" so damn easy. You randomly go back to the main menu without any reason.\n- tax evasion\nmild aggression\nbullying vegetables\nfun soundtrack\namazing hats \n\ngameplay is amazing and enjoyable, not too short and not too long either with fun little secret things here and there\n10/10 I would play it again on a rainy day with some tea :)\n- Ahh, CrossCode.\nLet's start this review with what this game does right.\n\nPros:\nEverything. There review is complete. But on a serious note I'll elaborate.\n\nThis game starts out very generically. You got an amnesia stricken heroine. You got fairly archetypal characters. The story is the typical trying to figure out your past. But it's not. I lied about all that, that only covers the first 10-15 hours then you see drastic changes in the pace and tone. The story turns out to be well done, not the best, but enjoyable. 8/10 for story and characters.\n\nLet's talk about gameplay. It's perfect, seriously. The pacing of combat is fairly quick. There's a decent variety of enemy types which nearly all of them have some sort of unique trait. Your skill set leaves you with a lot of variety and different tools to take on different situations. I have yet to get bored of it, despite the fact combat isn't inherently profitable for most of the game. Puzzles. You have timing puzzles, logic puzzles, memory puzzles, enemy based puzzles. It's all there. It's all enjoyable. They're quite varied, no two puzzles feel the same. This game has over 200 'maps'. And just about every 'map' has a puzzle or two (optional or not). Ez 10/10.\n\nArt design. I'm a sucker for 16 and 32 bit graphics. The level designer, this guy made the game. He created some beautiful and interconnected maps with nearly everything having purpose. In all honesty, I have never seen design quality this high, it even beats out SquareSoft games (you know before they became that crappy company that is SE). 10/10 again.\n\nCharacter design. It works. Not the best. Not bad. The characters look the way they should. Lukas' nose drives me crazy, it's huge. But Holiday Man is solid. 7/10.\n\nMusic. Some of it's great. Some of it annoyed ME (but I'm picky). They stayed true to what they were trying to make. But it's obvious their composer was no Yasunori Mitsuda. But still, what I enjoyed, I really enjoyed. 8/10.\n\nDid I enjoy it? Every single minute of it. Even when I was confused. \"I WILL figure this puzzle out.\" 35/40, based off my personal taste, but CrossCode is as damn near perfect as you can get.\n- I really wanted to like it, but i can't, in good faith, recommend A Space for the Unbound to anyone. It's a crying shame, because i deeply respect the intention behind the project. I love the whimsical, yet somewhat grounded premise: anyone who likes Makoto Shinkai movies will feel right at home. The intrigue, even though the plot twists are fairly obvious, still creates an unsettling feeling of uncertainty and dread that clashes (in a good way) with cheerful, bright colors of youth. A Space for the Unbound is mainly a point-and-click quest, but the developers still tried to spice the gameplay up a little with mini-games and little one-off mechanics that successfully break up the monotony.\n\nAnd yet... For every memorable, emotional peak A Space for the Unbound presents an hour of pure, unadulterated filler. Almost every \"puzzle\" is a multi-step fetch quest that requires you to backtrack multiple times with no other reason than to pad the length of the gameplay sections. It also indulges in \"gotcha\" moments, where the game deliberately fools you into the wrong solution, while the right one, of course, requires you to back track somewhere. Yes, the hometown of our main heroes is not that big, but that's hardly an excuse. Even more so in numerous dream sequences, where you are often times forced to go back and forth between someone's mind and reality to collect key items. Spacedives represent a wonderful opportunity to do something different, but A Space for the Unbound rarely delivers on that front.\n\nMost people praise the game for the story, the characters and the fact that it was made in Indonesia -- an under-represented region when it comes to games. But neither of those three have any solid writing to stand on their own. Sure, Atma and Raya can be sweet, but developers never allow their relationship to truly blossom. There's almost no banter, she's not even a constant presence in the story. Raya is important to the world of A Space for the Unbound, but doesn't really feel important to the player. Yes, the game tries really hard to tug at your heartstrings, but more often than not does so in a terribly hamfisted manner. It's supposed to be so profound and melodramatic that, at a certain point, it becomes difficult to take the game seriously.\n\nOh, and speaking of representing the community, A Space for the Unbound doesn't do a good job. The town itself is cute and full of life, there's no argument about that, but all of its inhabintants are either nameless mannequins with a so-so pixel-art, or just item bots. You speak to them once or twice, they give you what you need to advance the plot, and that's it. The fact that the game forces you to run laps around the town on an endless search for items doesn't make it any more charming or cozy. While, on the other hand, the authors only briefly touch on real societal issues, so as not to spoil the whimsy. In short, it's a huge nothingburger of a letdown, despite the fact that the whole setting is clearly supposed to be warm and nostalgic.\n\nYes, you can excuse some of those flaws by the main plot twist, which i will not spoild. But while it does make certain things more clear in hindsight, again, it does not portray the story in a good light. A Space for the Unbound really wants to be a Makoto Shinkai movie by way of Night in the Woods, but falls tragically short wherever you look. However, despite my criticisms, i hope Mojiken will not stop making games. It is very clear that the devs have tremendous passion and some talent on display -- it just needs refinement.\n- > go into time trial\n> classic f1 cars\n> 2004 ferrari\n> put on headphones\n> play with that gorgeous v10 as soundtrack\n> best day ever\n\nalso career mode is great\n- Awesome game. \n\nMy ex gave me this game.  We used to starve together, but now I starve alone. :'(\n- [h1]Press F11 for Fullscreen and know that your inventory has two parts[/h1]\n\n\nThe Steam version seems like an improved version of the mobile version. I got stuck and looked at screenshots and guides and none of them were helpful (I've never played the mobile version just in case you were wondering. A guide I saw mentioned only 5 endings but this version features more than that)\n\nI got over my block when I realized that there were another set of items in my inventory (I didn't notice that it said 1/2 at first)\n\nI haven't finished the game yet though, so I might update my review, but so far, everything looks good!\n- [h1]A Great Time [i]Killer[/i][/h1]\n\nSlayaway Camp is an enjoyable puzzle game that runs great and is well polished.  It's intellectually stimulating, humorous, and fun with just a sprinkle of nostalgia.  \n\nThe difficulty curve is perfect.  It is very clear the entire game was well thought out, planned, and implemented.  Kudos!\n\n[h1]System Info & Performance Report[/h1]\n[table]\n   [tr]\n        [td]Operating System[/td]\n        [td]Ubuntu Linux 14.04 x64[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]CPU[/td]\n        [td]AMD FX-8350[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]GPU[/td]\n        [td]GTX 750[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Technical Notes[/td]\n        [td]No crashes[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n- A fun game for drinking parties, take a shot every time you feel like you just wasted 19 cents.\n- I have played OSU!, Muse Dash and stepmania plenty and I gotta say that this does not feel like a rhythm game at all. The premise of matching the shape of the map to music sounds interesting but some of the songs I feel like are not mapped out correctly. Or in general this game relies less on music cues and more on visual cues? It felt like maps are only 50% related to the song and you have to ignore what you hear because the map randomly demands patterns that have no matching audio equivalent and everything becomes pure visual memorization.\n- No Man’s Sky is like a guy who owes you $1,000 from 6 years ago coming back with $10,000 to repay you after you thought the money was gone.\n\nI really like this game. I’ve been playing it for years on and off, returning after every major update to see the state of things. No man’s Sky might be a fantastic game now, but you gotta always remember how it all begun. When the game first came out it could best be described to had been as wide as the ocean, but having the depth of a puddle. \n\nThe game has improved so much from when it came out that it is easily one of my favorite space exploration games nowadays. One of the greatest redemption stories in video game history. It’s almost like they used the money they earned from sales  to actually improve the game. \n\nI love the idea of having this massive sandbox shared experience, where coincidentally anybody can stumble upon my little bases I scattered, mines, etc. I also love flying around the stars in my ship, discovering new planets, finding weird animals, plants, geography…\n\nThe sense of adventure and the thrill of finding some new world makes me have so much fun. If you like exploring and just taking your time  doing things, this game is a must, and I highly recommend it. \n\nThe truth is no matter what you think of the game we should all be grateful of what we’ve gotten. If No Man’s Sky was made by EA, all these updates throughout the years would probably have been released as $60 new games each.\n\nI’ll be honest, at this rate and with these devs I have a feeling No Man’s Sky has a better chance of of becoming what Star Citizen strives to be than Star Citizen.\n\nEvery now and then though, whenever I see a game trailer that I really enjoy, I like to remember the state of this game when it first came out and how awful it was. It keeps me in check and helps my expectations stay grounded.\n\n10/10\n- This is a passable if grindy 3D first person family friendly farming \"shooter\" with cartoony artwork.  You have a simple \"vacuum\" gun that you use to capture wild critters, throw them into pens, feed them, collect their stuff, sell it, rinse repeat.  \n\nThe implementation here is of high quality and works well on PC with a range of implementation options.  While the gameplay is somewhat repetitive and grindy, this is decent enough family friendly game that should be considered when on sale.  The retail price is too high, however, this game appears on sale and in bundles often enough.\n\n【グループB】\n- if you love trpgs but are getting tired of all the great indie devs emulating ogre tactics and ff tactics while wondering where the fire emblem/langrisser love is at then this is your game. It is hands down THE best non-fire emblem game that falls under the latter category of styles and punches so far above its weight class that at one point while playing i idly wondered if they poached an intelligent systems game designer or something (they didnt).\n- SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT.\n\nAs the store page states, NOREN is supposedly a 'simple' keyfinding game. That would be true if there were any keys actually in the game, but as it stands it seems that NOREN is a simple abandoned shovelware game that's impossible to progress in, let alone beat. You play as some soldier in a massive, dark castle, equipped only with a dying lantern. The light fades quickly, and you can regain light slowly by... standing by a light source. That'd be simple enough if you weren't endlessly pursued by dinosaurs that are programmed with AI which knows your exact location at all times; three chomps and you're 'aparted' from the world, where you respawn with whatever amount of light and sanity you have left. Additionally, the translation attempt is abysmal at best. \n\nBoth NOREN and its developer, ThroneLab, should be banned from Steam. I do not blow the 'scam' whistle lightly, and I only do such when I am 100% certain of something actually being a scam. There are a handful of videos of this title on YouTube as well, with only one being over 5 minutes long. No one found a key.

I cannot overstate how fun it is to build your weapons in VR, the crafting system works flawlessly and seemely without the need of menus or UIs getting in the way, props for the devs for how well the game integrates with VR controls.\n\nWhat I liked:\n- Varied enemies\n - Great VR controls\n- Gun crafting is addicting and allows for a lot of experimentation\n- Great Bosses\n\nWhat I had trouble with:\n- Makes you wish you could run around the rooms like the original game!\n- The reduced FOV of most VR headsets makes it quite difficult to keep track of enemies that come from multiple directions. Some rooms require so much head movement that I tend to get sick.\n- When a room spawns with multiple shield pylons and a healer bot, it gets extremely frustrating if you have slow moving projectile weapons.\n\nWishes:\n- More gun parts! (Maybe future DLC?)\n- I was warned a while back not to buy this game because of microtransactions, so I stuck with BTD5 instead. I haven't played much bloons before other than a lot of BTD 3 and 4 back then, but man I was missing out. The microtransactions in this game are nowhere near as bad as people made them out to be. Currently having too much fun with this game.\n- Wow. Just wow. This is BY FAR the best visual novel i have played. the old school forums and cameras feel very detailed as whenever anything happens in a video chat, no matter how small, the characters react to it. the story was very enthralling and every time i slipped up and made a wrong move, my heart would feel as though it was gonna beat out of my chest. talking to violet felt very real and made the ending that i got so much more satisfying. the only bad things i can even say about this absolute masterpiece is just the fact that most of the really impact full options were locked because \"Emmett isn't cocky enough\" or  \"Emmett isn't compassionate enough\" which felt very vague and confining.\n\noverall the game is absolutely amazing and i wish the devs would come out with a game similar to this because of how good it was.\n9/10\n- I bought this game because it was supposed to be like Harvest Moon. I'm now close to finishing an ingame year.\n\n+ The town and art style is very much like Harvest Moon\n+ There are a lot of interesting characters with lovely art to socialize with\n+ The dog is helpful, barking on spots where you could dig out some items\n+ Some events, scenes and dialogues in this game made me smile to no end. This is a happy game.\n\n- You have a farmland of 40 tiles and farm by seeding tile by tile and watering tile by tile. The watering can is your only tool and upgradable to water 3x3 tiles.\n- Friendship is a grind, as is tradition in the genre. I once gifted a whole harvest to a girl without visable change in the 1 to 10 affection meter. After finishing the friendship grind on 3 villagers, the game seemed to reward me with... some random dialogue lines.\n- You can only bind the shovel and watering can. You cannot bind anything else like the brush or milking device or animal fodder. This makes the daily barn work quite nasty.\n\n\nIf you need a Harvest Moon on PC, this isn't what you want. Games like \"Friends of Mineral Town\" had a significantly larger focus on farming simulation. World's Dawn is a small town simulator with a little gardening on the side.\n- As a cybersecurity professional , I would classify this game as malware, or at the least adware.\nWhy? It opens up a number, at least 10 when I checked, of connections to various points on the internet which have no purpose in running the game. They are only there so the vendor can spam you with advertising, track you, or for other unspecified activities. \nAs such, I can NOT recommend this game. \n\nTo verify, I disconnected my computer from the internet. The game ran fine without the advertising and tracking. \nThen I connected back to the internet, and launched the game. The game opened at least 10 connections(!).\nThen, while still connected to the internet, I blocked the game's network-connecting executables in the firewall. In such a case, the game behaves differently, apparently it sees there is an active connection so it runs for a while, then when it cannot make it's for-bad-purposes network connections, it terminates and you can't play. \nThis is bad behavior that I would only expect from spyware and malware. I hope the vendor fixes it so the software runs in the manner they declare - it is supposed to not require network connectivity after the initial run as they describe in the System Requirements. \nSteam should be reigning in this behavior as well.\n- Melatonin is a simple rhythm game, with a focus on ease of gameplay and calmer sounds.\nIf you're expecting something on the tougher or more upbeat side, this ain't it.  Ironically, I had more fun as I stopped focusing on scoring well, and more fun when I was just feeling the music and half-asleep.  The sounds and songs are quite relaxing lol.\n\nOn the shorter side of games, it still delivers an enjoyable experience in what it offers. The timing is a *little* on the forgiving side, and there are even accessibility options if you need a little more help, such as timing circles, metronome, and a bigger Perfect window.  If you'd rather go for a challenge, a Perfect only option is also available.\n\nControls are quite simple, using [strike]4[/strike] 3 directional keys and an action key (Space by default). In each tutorial, you're told whether you'll need to hit directional keys or the action key, and whether they're held or not, as well as general timing.  For some stages, the instructions don't give you as good an idea as the tutorial itself/timing circles do (Work and Time levels for me).  All good, but in some levels you get tempo changes in the middle of the song that can throw you a bit off, especially if you're just grooving to the audio cues... when you can hear and distinguish them.  Unfortunately, there are a few levels where the audio cues are either far too similar to each other, or happen too quickly to react to.  This can be a bit of a bummer, as I prefer working off audio for rhythm games, as their focus should be lol.  \n\nWhile Melatonin doesn't bring a whole lot to the table, it doesn't need to.  Less is more here, and the art and sound direction definitely hit their target.\nRelax.\n- I was hoping for a good game but I can't believe the positive reviews. Really annoying on a personal level. If you like your hand held and revel in 3rd person view then enjoy, but I think it's terrible. I was on the mountain jumping across a platform. \"Press ENTER\" to 'grab' it suggests. I press ENTER and what do you know? Nothing happens. Well, you die continually because what it tells you to do (zzzzz) doesn't work. Ah, maybe this is part of the 'difficulty'...hahahaha.\n\nNot a patch on any Far Cry or GTA even though these are full of directions. First Tomb Raider I've bought and definitely the last. What is it with games these days telling you what to do every step of the way: Do this...do that....go here....find item...take item...drop item...fire now.....pull lever...talk....rest....jump.... quit game and uninstall, ya that's the best option. As this game is created for a dumbed-down society or tailored for intellectually challenged meercats, some of us can see where the industry is heading. What happened to thinking for yourself???\n\nI don't need to progess far in this game because the first 10 minutes says enough. Do this, do that, blah blah blah...\n- Okay this is a weird situation. I personally don't like this game all that much, but I do still recommend it nonetheless. That's because despite me not being personally huge on it, I can't deny that it is a very well-crafted game that definitely will give people the experience they want if this is the type of game they're looking for. I, turns out, am not part of the crowd that is targeted for said experience. I just found the whole trial and error stealth RTS style of this game to just not be my cup of tea, but again I can't deny its very well-crafted. I also think the art style and voice acting and story are all very well done as well. So yeah, if you're fond of games of this type, then go for it. I'm sure you won't be disappointed. I, for one, don't think I'm entirely sold on it though.\n- I've loved this game, put in WAY more hours making maps and modded content for it than I have playing it which is a terrifying statistic to think about, and have made some of the closest friendships from playing with people in the community- but, I'm just really disheartened. This is gonna be a long post, I've nolifed the shit out of this game for the better part of half a decade so there's a bit.\n\nHaving people come into my streams & DMs to ask me if I'm going to be porting my map and mods over to ARK1.5 with ASA and then to ARK2 before all of this immense drama and fleecing happened, before we knew anything about prices and release dates- it was a firm yes! I'd love to bring my creations over to UE5, porting content over was so easy, even myself and people in the modding community were putting our maps and creations into stock UE5 just to see what the possibilities were and get off on the new physics, lumen and nanite.\n\nNow I really don't want to bring that content over. Not only because of the bad business practice, with many other games who have ported over to UE5 or have done engine upgrades been offered for free- but because I've seen this one too many times with this company and the business is just horrifically mismanaged and it's heartbreaking for some of us, it's heartbreaking for me.\n\nWhen someone in a position of power and authority over an IP and business has stated that ARK1.5 would be free, as a gesture of good faith, you take that as a promise, and we were all stoked about that. That was the right thing to do. ARK is not a small indie, unknown survival game in a (mostly) unfinished state anymore like it was- it is a powerhouse in the industry, top survival game charts across the internet for -years- will have ARK in the top 5- it is not a game that has done poorly for revenue, publicity or players. It is one of the giants. The best IP that Snail/WC have to date and continues to be. There is no reason to renege on a promise that was publicly made. And before some moron says \"JuSt DoNt BuY It ThEn\" it's deeper than that, I would have had, at my hours invested, zero issues purchasing ARK1.5 for like $20-$30 bucks with all DLC's included- but to make an offer, after it was promised as free, then to take it back and serve up an even bigger steaming pile of shit that is more expensive on a plate, and for Wildcard to hand you the spoon and be like yum yum dig in! Is so strange.\n\nHonestly, I'm not surprised. I was a public moderator in the ATLAS discord with Jat and other off branched former/current- Wildcard/Grapeshot employees at the release of that absolute dumpsterfire and was there with the rest trying to put out fires that could be witnessed from fu**g Jupiter- because I had faith and volunteered my time to assist with a company I believed in, created for and wanted to succeed so badly for the community. \n\nDark and Light was next. Another abandoned IP. Then Last Oasis- yep- Abandoned. All of the offbranches of ARK have failed so horribly, and haven't managed to capture that excitement that ARK did for the industry but they will absolutely keep trying to push out what they think consumers will like, all without listening to any feedback- and feedback isn't always good, do not get it twisted some suggestions I've seen truly are horrendous- but there are gems in amongst the boulders and landslides. Having the initiative to sift and find them, and then really look at them seems to be the problem. It concerns me deeply when Wildcard state themselves on their newsletters that ARK2 will be such a different experience from ARK1 that it now makes sense why they tried to package it in a non-refundable-at-time-of-play bundle with ARK1.5.\n\nSpeaking from experience here- the best thing Wildcard/Snail have done for ARK, and I will never discredit them for it, is their Sponsored Mods program and hiring modders from the community for ARK and ATLAS. That alone has kept ARK where it is, as popular as it is, as fresh as it is and as revolutionary as it is. There is never a drought of \"content\" with ARK, as the modding community carries it on their backs each and every day. Official servers have their place, and I disagree with how they're being handled, but have no solution for that as I never was an official player for more than an hour at a time to remind me why I prefer modded servers. This is no discredit to the ARK art department, by the way, having looked through the maps in the Devkit- Aberration is still to this day is a visual and technical marvel, and many other maps made since then.\n\nThere is a massive air of uncertainty for modders with ARK1.5 and 2. Logistically, the average number of mods on big unofficial servers is about 18- if each modder listing them on Overwolf decides to list their single mod for say $3 bucks, something very reasonable- times that by 18 and are players really going to be expected to play on a single server they MIGHT not even like, for $54 bucks? Maybe they discovered that server was good but had no players during their playtime- and then they find one in their region but, oh- there's 5 more mods on this server, there's another $15 to play on this one. Is a $69(nice) investment really worth it? I don't think so. Even at what has been discussed quietly behind closed doors with other modders at a $1 a mod price, so 50c to the modder, 50c to Overwolf/Wildcard- that's still, on average, $18 bucks to play on a server- this price is not including ARK1.5, or the DLCs for it- so what was the discussed \"Content creators/Modders can make a living!\" price...? Because when you take a step back from the buzzwords, there's a colossal black hole of a problem in the logistics.\n\nI digress, without any more information to go on regarding priced mods, we can only speculate. Back to what we know. \n\nSelling all DLCs and base game for ARK 1 that will functionally become a single player story mode and mod carried game without any warnings, notices or heads up to new prospective players is scummy as hell. There will absolutely be more delays before ARK 1.5, which will extend the lifecycle of the current game and DLCs, sure, but it's shady. The idea that ARK1 will become, in a sense, a showcase of my above statement about modders carrying the entire ARK community on their backs, and a solo story is fine- but adjust your listings so that people will know they will never experience ARK1 as \"Wilcard intended\" with the removal of official servers, that they will be playing with archived mods no longer receiving updates as many modders move over to 1.5, that they will have a limited playerbase to play with as most have gone to 1.5, that there is limited updates going to be provided due to 1.5- that there is no more official DLC... due to 1.5.\n\nThis isn't even taking into their account their roadmap of the supposed finished content releases for ARK1.5 and ARK2 finishing up and starting at almost the exact same time. So we will have this problem ALL over again when the release of ARK2 is imminent, after it's delays. Players who bought ARK1.5 and all the DLC's will play on that for a month or two before ARK2 is released, then ARK1 is even more abandoned, and ARK1.5 will dwindle.\n\nI know many people will say- damn, this chick gives way too much of a shit about this game, you right lol. I don't like seeing a community be lied to, deceived, fleeced and taken advantage of. ARK is one of those \"coping\" games. If you spend any time with the community, it's a comfort. People come home from work or school and they will turn their brain off and just play. For hours. Not giving any thoughts to how shit their workday was, how badly they were bullied at school, how much anxiety they have or problems they are facing- ARK lets them turn off and have fun, it's an escape game. There's not many other games out there that keep people playing like ARK does, for so many reasons. But, the community is at the core of it.\n\nI wish Wildcard would pay attention to it.\n- I waited 12+ years for a proper sequel to A Crack in Time (yes i know the other games came out but tbh they didn't do much for me) for it only to come out for the PS5. Unfortunately, I wasn't getting a new console for just one game. \n\nNow, two years later I'm playing it on the PC.  While surreal, I am super glad they ported this series to a different platform, and the game was totally worth the wait.\n\nThe port by Nixxes ran very nice for me. I had a few hitches in the dimensional portal scenes, and one crash in a total of 12hrs of playtime. I do understand that some people are having issues and that does suck & does not disqualify their experiences, however, It is not even close to how bad TLOU Pt.1's port was.  \n\nIt's another Insomniac banger, and if you've played any of their games you already know whats up. I beat the game in 12 hrs on the 2nd to last difficulty grabbing whatever side content/collectibles I could before the story captivated me. As is tradition, there is a NG+ mode (haven't touched yet) and I look forward to trying it. I'll probably update the review at that point, but the games are always repayable due to their collect-a-thon nature, that and being so damn fun you have a dumb ear-to-ear smile for all of the playtime.  \n \nIf you enjoyed the Ratchet and Clank games in the past, its way more of that + the dimensional gimmick which is really well done and very neat tech wise. I love the new movement features and Rivet is a very good addition to the cast. I hope she stays relevant in the story in the future. Game feels super good to play as well, weapons are great as always. The writing is still funny and enjoyable. It's just a good time, and I highly recommend it, even at full price.\n\nLastly, I would like to direct a message to Sony/PS Studios/Insomniac Games:\nPLEASE PORT THE OTHER AND OLDER R&C GAMES PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE IPELASE PLs I WILL PAY $70\n- its a very stressful game and rly hard but the fact that u can lose all ur progress because of a mistake is on another level of insane but in the end if u r determined u will finish it and the feeling when u finish it after all the time is very good i never felt this good in my life about finishing a game or a puzzle its a rly good game i recommend\n- I had to purchase Scarlet Hollow after witnessing the excitement of Episode 4 through my friends. I immediately binged the first three episodes the following day and found myself and in rather different spot compared to their playthrough. The choices you make in SH are actually impactful - which is (unfortunately) quite refreshing for the genre! I've since run through several different routes to explore more of the story (and collect those achievements!). While you have the ability to skip through previously seen text, lines within replayed conversations are shaped by your selected traits, choices, and previously selected dialogue; you won't be skipping that many lines before seeing new content. Similarly, characters may be painted in an entirely different light based on choices you've made. The cast and writing truly nails the small town feel of SH (gossip and all). \n\nMake sure you eat the takeaway container in the fridge. Thank me later.\n- Blows every single PFS game of the last decade out of the water, even those shitty D**M games that people who never played FPS games before seems to worship in order to look cool. Smooth and fast gameplay with a lot of variety. Great visuals even on medium/high settings. Story and writing is shit but pretty much on the same level as rest of the Borderlands series with the exception of the Telltale one. Writing has always been the worst part of the series, dont be delusional retards.\n- [b][i]AMID EVIL[/i] is very much [i]Quake[/i] 1 level design in a [i]Hexen[/i]/[i]Heretic[/i] universe.[/b] It's well done. We're a bit spoiled this year with outstanding '90s FPS shooters. Personally, I prefer both [i]Ion Maiden[/i] and [i]DUSK[/i] over this title for the following reasons:\n\n1) I find [i]AMID EVIL[/i] to be a bit generic in terms of theme; the fantasy setting could use a bit more to set it apart.\n\n2) I prefer real or low fantasy weapons/guns over wands and totally high fantasy weapons. Now, don't get it twisted - I appreciate that these high fantasy weapons exist, but yeah, they leave something to be desired. I miss reloading and all of that. \n\n3) The level design in [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is much more 'sprawling' (for lack of a better term) just like the original [i]Quake[/i]. Most levels are indoors in what feels like an underground compound (at the time of writing this review). I personally like the backwoods feel of [i]DUSK[/i], or the dystopian cityscape of [i]Ion Maiden[/i] far more. I want to look up at the sky in most levels.\n\n4) The enemy design is different than the other two games I mention, which is good - but they all mostly have a 'same' kind of feel. The enemies are all super fast, so most of your efforts are focused on running backwards while fending them off. It's fun, but gunplay isn't quite as fun as the other two games for this particular reason.\n\n5) The font and overall menu system definitely feels 'Early Access'. I know the font is being worked on, which is desperately needed. \n\n6) My favorite way to play the game is Endless mode - and I feel like that's a flaw in itself. It's the opposite for me with [i]DUSK[/i]. I want to fall in love with the campaign, but eh, there isn't really any story or anything all that interesting to suck me in. The secrets are super easy to find compared to the other two games, too.\n\n7) No multiplayer. Now, I really don't care about this - but who designs a game in this genre without building this in from the ground up? You know the community is going to whine about this. Questionable design decision to say the least.\n\n[b]Well, it sounds like I just dumped all over the game.[/b] Please don't get me wrong. [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is a welcome addition to the genre. The *great news* is that this is not just some reskin of [i]DUSK[/i] - it certainly is it's own thing. And that's really important. \n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+Fairly polished game for Early Access\n+It's the most modern version of the original [i]Quake[/i] we've seen this year\n+Well optimized\n+Lots of content right now\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-The universe is generic\n-No multiplayer\n-The font is too hard to read\n-Music is nothing to write home about\n-The secrets are easy, and there really aren't all that many of them\n-Weapons could use more 'oomph' to them; also we should be able to use the special ability when we want to as opposed to it autotriggering\n\n[b]I was psyched out of my mind for [i]AMID EVIL[/i] - and while it is certainly good - I think I'll be focused more on [i]DUSK[/i] and [i]Ion Maiden[/i].[/b] Because, let's face it, gaming time is valuable and we can't play everything.\n- Very addictive and challenging\nAlthough the whole game is happening on the same map, with the same enemy and the same weapons, it has a lot of replayability trying and testing new builds and characters.\nMusic is good. After the first 10-20 hours, the music mod made it even better, so is highly recommended to use that mod, even from the beginning\n- \"it's a puzzle game dressed up as a wargame\"\n\n1. puzzle games don't have this much randomness\n\n2. it uses authentic hex wargame conventions/mechanics so it's more of a puzzle game built out of a wargame\n\n3. you can take the puzzle element out of it by customizing your game.yml file to allow +5 turns, then play each scenario slow\n- A very good recursive Sokoban.

Every scene and character portrait is a painstaking work of art that works along with the dreamy soundtrack to draw you into the gorgeous, hazy bible belt setting. The point and click gameplay is straightforward (and at times a little overbearing with handholding), with small minigame sections to mix things up somewhat, but rewards interacting with the world and the people in it to uncover another small truth about it. I don't think I've come across anything that quite captures the sense of melancholy and unease that dominates the current moment in the 20s.\n- Earlier this week I did the impossible - I came out to a family member. One of my two sisters, in specific.\n\nI was nervous but relieved to know she accepted and supported me - and thought, you know, perhaps we should call and talk about some things. We had that call this Wednesday and I expressed a lot of my resentment towards my family - being stuck at home with some of my family, more specifically my [spoiler]mom[/spoiler], has completely wrecked my mental health. I'm still closeted from them and I live with each passing day, worried [spoiler]she'd[/spoiler] reject me - for being non-binary, for dating a trans person, for disappointing [spoiler]her[/spoiler].\n\nMy sister told me that [spoiler] my mom [/spoiler] only hears what [spoiler]she[/spoiler] wants to hear, that [spoiler]she[/spoiler] only thinks about what [spoiler]she[/spoiler] wants to see in [spoiler]her[/spoiler] kids despite often saying otherwise. From her experience, [spoiler]mom[/spoiler] seemed to be a very not open and is often a close-minded individual. \nComing into If Found..., I had only broke down early Thursday morning as my many months of frustrations and anxieties finally given the voice it needed.\n\nIf you've played the game it'd make sense if I told you that Kasio's experience with her parents in If Found... hurt reading for me - it genuinely hurt. Seeing her mom's first letter and annotating it with \"She's trying. But she has all these ideas of how I should be.\" and \"She didn't even consider she might need to apologize too.\" was something I sat at for a long time, probably longer than any other part of her journal that I was erasing through at a normal pace.\n\nMoments like that made me realize that this game is something I never knew I needed - a realization that hey, think about the move out you're doing in a month as rebuilding - as leaving the past behind. That there isn't anything wrong with that, and that you can really be yourself once we're out there, together. That family doesn't have to be bound by blood and it's really about the people who's there for you, even at your absolute worst. That I don't need to seek acceptance through others - but rather be more accepting of myself.\n\n[spoiler]\"I find I care less and less what other people think of me, and more for my own opinion. And these days I'm so much more comfortable in my own skin.\"[/spoiler]\n\nThere's people I can think of who need to read and see this.\n\nIf Found... left me with hope - and it's leaving me with a lot to think about. Thank you so much for this game, DREAMFEEL. I wish I could articulate this game better like other people have - but it's been a lot lately and I need to rest - if you're coming across this review/text you should without a doubt play it, especially if you've felt similarly trapped like both me and Kasio did.\n\nP.S. - If you find the eraser mechanic to be a little strenuous you can increase the size of the eraser in the options!\n- [h1]Borderlands 2 - Excellent Story, Solid Gameplay, Great Characters and one of the very best Coop experiences around.[/h1]\n\n[table]\n  [tr]\n    [th][h1]|| 9.5 ||[/h1][/th]\n    [th]Score[/th]\n    [th]Comment[/th]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td]Graphics[/td]\n    [td]8[/td]\n    [td]Borderlands 2 has a visual style all its own, it may not initially impress some used to a \"next generation, high definition, ultra realistic landscape\", but it is nevertheless very appealing and detailed. Some of the landscapes and views around Pandora (the world on which the story takes place) are beautiful and each area has its own look and atmosphere. Characters and enemies are detailed and extremely varied in appearance. You can customise your characters appearance with a large selection of outfits and heads which you can collect throughout the game.[/td]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td]Audio[/td]\n    [td]10[/td]\n    [td]No real killer soundtrack here (apart from the the introduction video), just really good atmospheric music throughout. Where this game really shines is the voice acting for characters, enemies, audio logs and even weapons (yes some of them can talk!). The dialogue is often very funny, helping to explain and drive the story, fill in background and really adds the the immersion.[/td] \n [/tr]\n [tr]\n    [td]Gameplay[/td]\n    [td]9[/td]\n    [td]A mix of FPS and RPG, Borderlands 2 is a lot of fun to play. So many missions to complete, so many enemies to kill, so much loot to grab. You are given massive area's to explore all over the world of pandora filled with creatures, quests, secrets and homages to lots of popular culture. Controls are responsive, intuitive and the game mechanics (even at higher difficulties) feel fair and well thought through. As you progress through the game you will earn xp and levels which allow you to customise your characters skills giving a large variety of gameplay styles.[/td]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td]Story[/td]\n    [td]9[/td]\n    [td]The story in Borderlands 2 is rich and engaging. The action is character driven, and while the main story is fairly linear, the open world nature of the game allows you to take a break from the main story arc and explorer the hundreds of characters and side missions that can be found all over Pandora. It also has one of the most badass, charasmatic and handsome villians of all time... [/td]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td]Replayability[/td]\n    [td]9[/td]\n    [td]So many reasons to replay this game. Firstly the story can be completed at least 3 times with the same character at increasing difficulty and xp levels (normal, true vault hunter and ultimate vault hunter) with progressively better rewards. There is so much detail in the story and so many optional missions that each play through feels different. Next you have at least 4 (more with DLC) characters each with their own skills, playstyle and story to explore. Finally you have tons of loot in the form of Guns, Shields, Grenades, Relics and Class Mods you can collect for your character. These increase in rarity from white (basic) to orange (legendary) generally the rarer the weapon the more damage it will do and many will have additional unique abilities (red text). [/td]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td]Multiplayer[/td]\n    [td]10[/td]\n    [td]For me, this game remains simply the best cooperative multiplayer experiences you can have. Your character's skills really augment and compliment each other when playing as a team. Enemy and mission difficulty automatically adjusts to the amount of players, requiring real teamwork and synergy to avoid dying at higher levels. The multiplayer allows you to connect (drop in and out midgame) to your steam friends games or to public games, connections for the most part feel quick and responsive even with 4 players and with only a small delay on audio communication. [/td]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td][h1]Overall[/h1][/td]\n    [td]9.5[/td]\n    [td]I can't recommend this game enough, while a minority of missions feel like you are just a glorified delivery boy, most are creative, funny and packed full of classic moments and great characters. So much fun to pick up and play with friends. - I haven't really mentioned the DLC (of which there is a lot) in this review but the main ones (Mr Torgue's, Captain Scarlett and especially Tiny Tina's) are all well worth getting (these are included in the Game of the Year edition), great fun to play and add loads more content to the game. To progress to the highest level in the game (level 72 +overpower levels) you will also need the ultimate vault hunter pack 2 so I would recommend that if you reach the end and still want more.

Please leave me a comment[/i]\n- Did you like the first two chapters?\nWell, here we have everything and tons of new and improved things, like the 2nd chapter did with regards to the first one (which was awesome, but quite simple gameplay-wise).\nA classical turn-based strategy game, now more polished than ever with wave-like combats and tons of units to start with, to upgrade and well, we don't even have real classes here - more correctly, each hero is a class on its own and has different abilities and such.\nThe story follows always the same one-way saga and you'll have to make lots of choices determining your fate, your battles and so on; the graphics are the most beautiful I've ever seen here and the soundtrack is quite amazing and atmospheric too.\nYou'll have also many features like arena combat, and a great history re-telling if you don't remember the first two chapters, plus a great tutorial to start with even if you're not new to the series and the genre.\nIt's quite fundamental if you're a little bit interested in this awesome story to play the other chapters - here in fact we'll start with all the old heroes, all the story right back from the caravan that reached Arberrang.\nWe're basically reviewing one of the best strategy tactical turn-based role-playing games of the last 5-10 years and I won't add more than this, it has already thousands of reviews and mine is quite useless I think. \nLots of endings, lots of characters to explore and promote, lots of weapons, accessories, modes.. we have everything. Recommended to anyone (maybe with a little discount).\n- I've been waiting since the likes of Planescape Torment and Baldurs Gate 2 for a game to match their sheer perfection, many games came quite close, but Divinity Original Sin just manages to hit so many nails on the head its not funny. It looks great and still plays fine on my aging PC, it has a great storyline, it's two protagonists have some great interactions and dialogue. The voice acting is spot on and it has the most sublime OST.\n\nThe combat is turn-based but do not let this put you off, there are so many choices in combat with the interaction of spells with each other and the environment, that the game just begs you to experiment with different tactics.\n\nThis game just oozes pure class, it was a labour of love for Larian and it shows in every tiny detail of the game.\nIf you like RPG games (or even just pure quality games), you need to play this game, it is the benchmark I will use in comparing other games in future.\n\nWell done Larian.\n- Most of the negative reviews cover my complaints already. So I won't rehash the ones I've already read. \n\nHere's my biggest complaints: \n\n- Jumpscares have never been compelling to me. Doubly so on VR. Are you trying to injure me in my computer room? Stop. \n\n- Guns are fun. Not having ammo for them is not fun. (The game is pretty generous with ammo but it also encourages tediously conservative behavior, if you just unload clips at shit you'll run out pretty fast) \n\n- \"Continuous Turning\" feels so bad. Like, how can I turn my headset and everything looks smooth as butter, but as soon as I use the look stick for turning suddenly it's all choppy and looks wrong? I'm familiar with some of the motion sickness issues people get with turning in VR games, but this isn't that... \n\n\nThough honestly it seems like they just leaned really into the whole horror thing, which is fine, but also just super not my thing. \n\nIf the mechanics and some design choices had been better I might have slogged through it anyway. \n\n\nGame's beautiful, though, so they got that going for them.\n- This is more than a game for me.  It has become a hobby.  What started as a random purchase for myself last Christmas -- I had an old electric guitar I never played in the closet, so this gave me an excuse to see if I can learn -- has become an expensive obsession for me.  Warning -- but a good warning -- you'll find that you're learning guitar very quickly on this game, and it will become the start of an expensive habit!  I have downloaded hundreds of dollars worth of songs, bought a brand new guitar, I've signed up for music theory and guitar lessons at the local county college ... this has become a genuine hobby for me.  Literally, it is one of those rare games which has genuinely made an impact on my life.  Six months later, and the game has not gotten old.  I look forward to new songs, I laugh when a new chord I've never seen magically appears on the song that I've practiced the hell out and achieved a new difficulty.  The game is, most importantly, fun.  It remains fresh and only gets better as you get better.  I highly recommend.\n- Minesweeper influenced design feels like a fresh take on the Slay-the-Spire-like genre.  Now that I've won with all six classes, and done some of the unlockable difficulty levels, I feel that I've gotten my money's worth with the game, and I have enjoyed the time I've spent so far, but I don't expect great longevity beyond this point.\n\nI do have some minor gripes:\n\n* The pacing on unlocking new classes feels too slow.  It would be nice if the approach was the fairly standard one of unlocking a new class when you win with the previous one, but here there is a currency which is acquired throughout runs, and I found that I usually had to have two winning runs with the previous class to earn enough currency to unlock a new one.\n* Optimal play with some classes requires memorizing tiles which are revealed, and then on later turns these tiles are hidden.  Taking damage because I misremembered what was hidden behind a tile feels unfun and at-odds with what the game otherwise wants to be.\n* I would prefer if the harder difficulty settings were unlocked from the get-go, rather than grinding through easier difficulty settings to find the challenge.\n\nOtherwise, though, it's a fun game with an adorable art style, and not just a clone of the other Spire-likes around.  Recommended if your expectation is to get ten hours or so of strategic puzzling.\n- I've been completely in love with this game ever since the Mojam prototype \"Wasteland Kings\" was released. It's an insanely fun, fastpaced \"roguelike-like\" or \"roguelite\" with randomly generated worlds and tons of weapons to find. On top of that, the developers stream the development of the game on tuesdays and thursdays over at Twitch and they release updates to the game every week. To me, this is the best game of its kind and I've put tons of hours into mastering it (and I still die. Often. It's difficult okay?).\n- Deathloop is definitely not your average video game.\n\nYou'll either love it or hate it.\n\nThe first few hours are the weakest. You, as a new player, don't know what to do, what's important and you never keep what you find. Only after completing several mission objectives you get the ability to collect residuum and actually infuse your found items for later use in later loops or after you die. That's why it's always better to just go straight to the objectives and not explore the map at all, otherwise it's just gonna be a big time waste.\n\nAfter you acquire the ability to make permanent items (character and weapon trinkets) which you'll be able to use in future runs and collect some crucial weapons (like silent gun) and abilities ([in-game slabs] like Shift that allows you to teleport short distances) - then the game fully opens up. \n\nReal fun begins after you learn all maps and shortcuts and how to toy with your enemies (but it takes quite a lot of time to get there).\n\nStealth is very easy, the enemy AI is dumb at best. The more trinkets and slabs you get - the more variety in gameplay opens up. \n\nAction is very smooth, Abilities are strong and versatile, that's where this game shines to be honest. \n\nThere are 4 different areas and all of them change depending of the time of the day (morning, noon, afternoon and evening). Depending of the time of the day - some areas become accessible, some become closed, The enemies and items also change their locations and sometimes you'll be able to encounter bosses (in-game they are called visionaries). They are not hard to kill, but it's quite hard to get to them. That's the fun part of this whole game. The more you replay all areas, the more information you'll acquire about visionaries and their behaviour. It's possible to deal with them all without killing a single other enemy.\n\nBut with all that comes the not so fun part - exploration and doing the same thing over and over and over again. It's gonna be hard at first, every area is very detailed and it's really easy to miss a code written on a desk or a wall, A lot of sniffing around is required for clues and multiple times per map. It definitely makes repetition your new best friend.\n\nThere are a lot of puzzles and challenges. If you are not shooting dumb NPCs - you're definitely trying to crack a solution to a puzzle. Sometimes you'll need to visit several maps on the exact time of day at which events occur and find the exact required item or piece of information in order to solve a puzzle. Yeah. It's a big hassle, but that's how this game is and how it functions. If you like puzzles, you'll enjoy Deathloop. But be prepared to use a guide or two for some of them and a lot of patience.\n\nDuring some objectives it's very easy to make mistakes and fail. Several challenges require you to be pixel perfect in execution. Didn't notice that mine placed on a generator? Too bad, you'll gonna have to restart or try in another loop.\n\nI disliked that once you find a new weapon, you have to take it with you and drop one of your 3 weapons. You will never be able to use the dropped one for the rest of the loop. Considering that you'll always find a new toy to play with - your loadout will always be half-baked. It's actually extremely annoying, the same can be said about your slab abilities too (only after you find them all, then the ability upgrades will go straight into your inventory after finishing a level).\n\nAnd of course, there is Julianna. She is your \"buddy\" the whole game and she talks to you at the start of every level and well... she is always trying to kill you. It's fun when she invades and disrupts your chill Groundhogday experience. You can even let other real players invade you as Julianna. Fun, if you like to fill yourself with some adrenaline. Either you kill her, or she kills you and you'll have to start over the whole loop ^^\n\nFunny, but Colt reminded me of Draymond Green from Golden State Warriors. In some instances he looks exactly like him haha.\n\nThere are some AI bugs and the game starts to stutter the longer you play. Kinda strage, but it was for me. Occasionally framerates can go from smooth to choppy quite fast.\n\nDeathloop is a decent game overall. Idea is good, but works much better in movies, because there you don't have to sit through the same routines every single time and you get to the next big reveal a lot quicker. \n\nI think Julianna was a bit underused. Imagine how awesome this game could be if Deahtloop worked similar to The Lost Vikings where you control 3 characters at the same time. She could have had different abilities, different strengths. A duo trying to break the loop! Pretty cool, eh? Anyway, That's just my 2 cents.\n- The game is decent but not worth $15 for a slightly better looking version of a 2 hour game that is 9 years old. I can only recommend it if you really like these kind rpg maker horror games, because it's among the best in its field.\n- ooooh im pigging out\n\njust like the original risk of rain but significantly more approachable!\n\nthey added controls, chris christododoldoaul and a bunch of retextures, got rid of that gup blackface enemy\nawesome\n\nthanks poopoo games for the review copy\n\n(spoilers ahead)\n\nincluding the mastery skins and void fiend from risk of rain 2 was an awesome surprise, nice to see so much new content\n\nonly complaint is the 100 dillar price tag for the game but otherwise a must buy\n\nUPDATE!!!\n\nAfter further playing, i have many very genuine issues! These providence trials are IM POSSIBBLE! the critreriar are simply absurd, and drifter is practically unplayable in his current state!!!\n\ni have also found a MULTITUDTE of vines allowing me to clip out of bounds?!?!?!? how did this game get past play testing TWICE\n\ni am not fibbing when i say this game in in an unacceptable state, how is this not in early access?! ridiculous, genuinely. gearbox! how could you\n- My wife left and took the kids\n- Finished pillars of eternity 1 as a priest of berath, pledging my soul to the god of cycles, life and death. Promising to release the thousands of captured souls back to the wheel of reincarnation at the end of the game.\n\nStarted pillars of eternity 2, only to find out I was murdered after the events of the first game by a god who was believed to have been slain during the saints war. \n\nMy soul then comes face to face with the god I have devoted my life to, the god of life, death, and reincarnation.\n\nAfter a brief discussion about how I kept my promise at the end of the first game, my favoured god revealed to me he wants me to come back to life and serve him once again, and slay the being that killed me.\n\nI refused. It is only right that my soul is allowed to be reborn and return to the cycle, as I have worshipped this diety my whole life.\n\nMy god agreed. I was reborn as a wolf and the credits of Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire started to roll.\n\nPretty short game but 10/10\n- I'm an atheist, and even this game made me pray to God to make it stop.\n- Do NOT buy this game! This game does not even have a minimap/GPS/coordinate system. You will definitely get lost.\nMultiplayer is fully of bug and lags so much.\nDo NOT buy this game!\nDo NOT buy this game!\nDo NOT buy this game!\n\nThis game is so f*** stupid\n- [h1]Strategy at its finest[/h1]\n\nInto the Breach is Subset Game’s latest title, following on from their massive hit, FTL. I put off trying Into the Breach for a long while, but I finally got it when it dropped down to $10 on HB a couple of months ago and I’m so glad I did. This game isn’t for everyone, it’s kind of rogue-like mech chess, but if it clicks for you then it’ll be one of the best strategy games you’ll ever play.\n\n[h1]Positives:[/h1]\n[list][*]First up, the game looks fantastic. The pixel art here is great, from the backgrounds to the mechs and even the pilot portraits. The animations here area also really good. There’s nothing too complicated here but it’s all well executed. On the topic of appearances, I also really like the way the maps are laid out, the 8x8 grids on a plain background work really well here and it reminds me of simple boardgames. I think it works well for the game.\n\n[*]As with any good strategy game, it’s easy to pick up, but hard to master. You have a squad of three mechs (there are a few different mech groups to unlock with gold coins (?) and you can also create custom groups from the mechs you’ve unlocked). Each group has a unique element, but they all follow the basic structure of one close-range mech, one long-range mech and one support mech. Each mech has a different ability/weapon and they’re all well varied. The mech teams are really well designed here so that no one mech is super powerful and they all work really well as a unit. \n\n[*]The combat is excellent. It’s really simple but it works so well. You’ll quickly learn the different roles your mechs have and figure out the best strategies to use them. There are two ways to kill most enemies. Getting rid of all of their HP or pushing them into water/lava (with the exception of boss enemies or flying enemies). However, a lot of the time you probably won’t even be trying to kill your enemies in a given turn. You can always see what the enemies will do on their next turn and so you always want to be playing to react to/prevent their next move. Typically, enemies target civilian buildings or buildings related to your objective, so it’s usually better to focus on moving them away from these buildings rather than focusing on killing them. If you’re really smart/lucky you can also push enemies so that they attack each other, as friendly fire is a major part of this game. It’s really satisfying when you line it up right so the enemies are killing each other rather than attacking you or the buildings you defend. You can even block them from spawning by moving something on top of them!\n\n[*]Unlocks in this game are handled better than in FTL in my opinion. There are six actions that you can complete with each mech squad to earn those gold coins I mentioned in order to unlock new mech squads. The first three are the three possible victories: two, three and four island (more on that in a second) and then the other three achievements are unique to each mech squad. They’re centred around the unique aspect of each squad, tasking you to get a bit creative with the way that you’re playing. I know some players didn’t like the way that unlocks worked but I think it’s a really good way to handle it and encourages you to try new strategies. \n\n[*]The game has five islands, with one of those being the final boss fight. Each island is basically a different biome with different enemies and environmental hazards. They aren’t necessarily easier or harder than each other to start with, but the difficulty does increase as you move from island to island. There is some crossover with the enemies you’ll see, but they at the very least have a different appearance and most of them behave differently. There are also enemies unique to each island. \n\n[*]On each island, you’ll need to complete several missions before facing off against the island’s mini-boss. The missions all have different objectives for you to complete, though the win condition is always just to survive all of the turns (typically 5 turns). The different objectives vary but there are usual two, with some easier missions only having one and harder missions having three. Completing these objectives gets you certain rewards. You can either get stars, which are used upon completing an island to purchase new pilots, abilities or weapons. There is grid power which restores or increases the grid power you start with (grid power is lost when buildings are destroyed, losing all grid power results in a loss). Lastly, some of the missions award power cores (usually you only see this as the third reward for a hard mission) which allow you to upgrade your mech’s weapons or abilities (super handy). The mission variety is fairly good.\n\n[*]There are a range of different pilots in the game. You always start with one ‘special’ pilot and two regular pilots but more can be found in cryo-pods or bought at the end-of-island store. All pilots earn xp at the end of missions and when they level up they get some kind of upgrade, like more mech health or an extra movement per turn. The ‘special’ pilots all have some kind of special ability, such as being able to attack twice if you don’t move or the ability for the piloted mech to fly. Some of these require a power core, but they’re definitely worth it.  [/list]\n\n[h1]Negatives: [/h1]\n[list][*]Honestly, I’m clutching at straws here for negatives. One thing I would mention is that I don’t think this game will have as much replay value as FTL does for most people (completionists have an awful lot to do here) which shouldn’t put you off from getting it, but is something to base your expectations on. I also felt like Chris Avellone was a bit wasted on this game, his writing is fantastic but there just isn’t much of it. [/list]\n\n[h1]Verdict: [/h1]\n\nInto the Breach is as close to a perfect strategy game as I’ve ever played and it’s an excellent follow-up to FTL. This game is easy to pick up, hard to master and it looks beautiful the whole time you’re playing this weird mech chess. I can’t recommend this enough and at $15 it’s an absolute steal. This was easily one of my favourite releases of 2018 and anyone who likes strategy absolutely needs this in their library. \n\nIf you found this review helpful, please check out my other reviews over at [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33633486/]Kemo's Corner.[/url]\n- THIS GAME HAS NO LOADING TIMES.\nIT IS INSTANT.\nNever again will a game satisfy me.

That IS if you practice and learn the way the game is supposed to be played.\n\nActually requires a lot of patience, aim control, learning of map locations, etc.\n\nEdit Dec 7, 2018: Stupid crazy full with hackers, now that it's F2P i feel like it's gonna get taken over by even more hackers... RIP 2012 CSGO.\n\nEDIT 2021/09/03: Some of you are morons here... Clearly a huge \"fan\" base of CSGO. I've gathered around 9,000+ hours in total (in my other account as well) No. I wasn't a \"Noob\" or had no skill. I was GE for a very long time.\n\nThis review is from 2018. After all the new updates came into place. I LOVED the game, It was my addiction. After those updates, everything went down hill. MORE toxicity, MORE blatant hackers, and I for one wasn't a big fan of the newest updates. So I decided to leave, updated this review with my most recent experience.\nReviews are meant to talk about your experience, Not to kiss ass and make things look good when they aren't.\n- Dear Dev, \nI love this game, if you're reading reviews, please consider some ideas to make it better:\n-  Level designing: Add more ways to choose, and different endings. Right now SoR4 is flat from A to B, it made me feel down compare to SoR3.\n- Alternate customs, and playable same characters: Floyd is overrated and all my friends want to pick him. Make a game with 4 Floyds running sound fun. Use lifetime score to unlock customs.\n- 2v2 Battle! WHY NOT?\n- Shiva (new), Max (new), Roo, Estel (Badass Woman Cop)\n- Steam trading cards: I know it's not importance, but who doesnt want some badass backgrounds on steam profile?\n- This game was sunk by poor customer service as well. I at one point lost years worth of items due to a bug. I was told by one of the devs in an email to \"stop button mashing\". My email was nothing but respect and appreciation for a good game where I also simply asked if they could return my bugged items I have earned over the years. \"Stop Button Mashing\"! Really? And now your game is dead. Good work! Piss poor development. Just sad and dissapointed I have over 2k in hours in crap. And yes this game actually is years old it was originally released Jan 2015. At one point we had a good game to play. I believe even the most played game on steam. Then something happened. It became all about crates. F this game. I'm done!\n- The good news is the driving physics, fuel and tire mechanics, and multiplayer design are the best the series has ever been. However, the overall package, performance, and presentation are significantly lacking in this game at launch. Unless you're desperate, hold off on purchasing this game until the developers have had time to put in additional content and fix the numerous bugs and the odd design choices they've made that I think may need to be changed. There's a lot of work that needs to be done on this game for it to be considered a complete racing game.\n \nThe performance on an 8700K+RTX4070 has been inconsistent at 1440p. While playing with frame rate unlocked at a mix of ultra and high settings I can get FPS into the high 80s but this is accompanied by regular drops of about 20 FPS so I felt it required the 60 FPS lock setting which was a bit disappointing. The other disappointment comes in how the game looks, which frankly is not visually pleasing even at the highest possible settings and generally just not a sharp enough picture no matter what you adjust.\n\nSo overall it’s a bit of a mixed bag. The racing itself is engaging and fun but the choices the developers have made with this game for presentation and functionality leave much to be desired. If it receives good post-launch support it may correct a lot of those issues but at launch it’s a bit disappointing and I do not recommend buying it.\n- RIP Johnny Gat and your whole 2 minutes of screentime.\nWhile being a good sandbox game on its own merits, SR3 does NOT improve upon SR2 in very many aspects. In fact, they actually removed a lot of content from the previous game, though it's not like most people probably played that.\nGone are choosing more than one type of shirt to wear, or belts. You can no longer use your phone to dial numbers, or call taxis to transport you or ambulances to heal you. They removed a lot of activities as well as a lot of really cool things the other games had. So many, in fact, that I could probably spend a whole paragraph just listing them.\nThis is for a large part subjective, but the gangs in this game are very unimpressive by Saints Row standards. It comes down mostly to character writing, but the characterization on each faction is not good; motivations are usually left vague and most characters introduced besides the replacement Saints members are left undefined with little personality.\nThe game is extremely buggy (compared to the others in the series, although it's not quite Bethesda level) and the netcode is pretty bad too. Playing co-op is often pretty difficult because most actions done by both players will be out of sync with each other.\nAlso, it isn't a well-optimized port for PC. The graphics are sub-par for the most part, but the game still runs like garbage most of the time. Sub-60 FPS on high unless you're playing on a top-of-the-line system (by 2011 standards).\nOh, and one time I switched to one of the radio stations and was given a 2 minute long lecture by the DJ about how I'm \"wasting my life pressing buttons in a murder simulator\" and how I should \"go out and get a girlfriend or something.\" Game just killed itself on anything immersion related for breaking the fourth wall and trying to antagonize me for playing a video game. Ironically enough.\nThanks Volition.\nMost of the DLC in this game is low-quality and overpriced, and most of them except for the mission packs are already on the disk, by the way.\nThe co-op is cool is you have someone to play it with.\n- I backed this game back at the end of September 2013 and have finally played it through to completion. \n\nCandle is a beautifully unique game which takes elements from puzzle, platforming and point and click adventures. The puzzles, although sometimes frustratingly difficult, are all different and use different mechanics keeping the game engaging and fresh. Teku's Candle is such a interesting game mechanic that I really enjoyed getting to know and learn. As previously said, the game looks and sounds absolutely stunning. I don't think I have seen a game that looks this good before and that is attritubuted to every character and scene being hand drawn. Controls can be a bit finicky but not game breaking and you can easily adjust too. I would recommend getting this game because it provides a great whole experience.\n- This is more than a game for me.  It has become a hobby.  What started as a random purchase for myself last Christmas -- I had an old electric guitar I never played in the closet, so this gave me an excuse to see if I can learn -- has become an expensive obsession for me.  Warning -- but a good warning -- you'll find that you're learning guitar very quickly on this game, and it will become the start of an expensive habit!  I have downloaded hundreds of dollars worth of songs, bought a brand new guitar, I've signed up for music theory and guitar lessons at the local county college ... this has become a genuine hobby for me.  Literally, it is one of those rare games which has genuinely made an impact on my life.  Six months later, and the game has not gotten old.  I look forward to new songs, I laugh when a new chord I've never seen magically appears on the song that I've practiced the hell out and achieved a new difficulty.  The game is, most importantly, fun.  It remains fresh and only gets better as you get better.  I highly recommend.\n- The amount of love and fun that went into this game is astounding. If you like minigames, memes, fun, and a challenge, check this game out. The “ending” was a bit lackluster, in my opinion, but it did not taint my views on the game and I had an overwhelmingly fun time with it. Definitely recommend!\n- Very fun game if you are looking for a cozy relaxing farming sim. if you had a hard time with the fishing mechanic in stardew valley then you will have an easier time with this game, ontop of that there are lots of cute little rhythm games to play and the animal raising is alot more in depth then stardew. just a little note of warning to new players, the game doesn't make this very clear but you shouldn't spend too much time gardening in your first year. Automatic watering systems aren't available until later on and if you are like me you will think making the biggest profit possible year one is a great idea but I accidentally ended up upgrading/unlocking everything except irrigation in my first year and now do not have much to spend my currency on. Other then finishing catching every fish, maybe decorating my farm/the village and getting the rare coloured animals theres not much else to do in the game for late game content. It feels like there is the intention of possibly adding more content later on? either way if you decide to play, for your first play through I really recommend exploring first and getting to know the villagers before you start large scale farming.\n- One of the best games I have ever played\n----------------------------------------------\n- Runs really well on most computers\n- Looks great regardless\n- Gameplay is heroin-tier addictive\n- High replay value\n- Big f-ing guns \n- If you like metal this game is for you\n- There isn't much wrong with this game\n- 10/10\n\nFLAWS\n----------------------------------------\n-You have the option to turn the music down\n- WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO DO THAT\n- No additional account, no unnecessary launcher, no denuvo, no epic exclusivity, no microtransactions, just a video game as it always should be..\n- Seriously... ppl are ridiculous. I bought this last week and absolutely love it! That being said, my main game modes that I play are MY CAREER and MY GM. It's got a solid story... much better than the previous years. And feels very realistic! Sure, it's got a few bugs here n there, but nothing that breaks the game or my immersion. And yes, it's got lots of micro transactions. I bought 35,000 VC for my career, but i didnt feel forced. Don't wanna buy? THEN DON'T! It's playable whether you buy or not. Just wish everyone would quit their b****ing and just play the game.\n- Zor strikes again, but agent phoenix is there to stop him! Another great VR puzzle game from Schell, with lot of jokes, hidden stuff and extra challenges for replayability. Took me 4h to finish base game, now time for achievements hunt!\n- I technically got this game for free, as it was bought for me from a friend. And honestly, I didn't really like it. She got it for me, as a means to help with some of my mental health issues I suppose? But it just was very big miss for me, and kinda made me feel worse. A bit anxiety inducing for me, just given the circumstances, talking about life and death. Just not my personal cup of tea.\n- [h1] 🕘          IMPRESSION:[/h1]\n* 2016: Game released\n* 2019: It seem fun, let's buy this\n* 2020: New content added\n* 2022: More content added\n\n🟢 = Available\n🔴 = Not available\n\n[h1]         GAMING CONTENT:[/h1] \n🟢 Teamwork with others\n🟢 Puzzle Challenges\n🟢 No Compass or Map Challenge\n🟢 Funny Avatar\n🟢 Customize Avatar\n🔴 3-4 players share screen\n🔴 Fast Sprint\n🔴 Time Attack for replay value\n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [th]iMeter[/th]\n        [th]SCORED[/th]\n        [th]iNTEREST METER[/th]\n        [th]DISCOUNT?[/th]\n [th]COMMUNITY[/th]\n        [th]REVIEWER[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [th]A+[/th]\n        [td]5[/td]\n        [td]Loving it [/td]\n        [td]No Wait[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [th]A[/th]\n        [td]4[/td]\n        [td]Liked it[/td]\n        [td]No Wait[/td]\n        [td] ✔[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [th]B[/th]\n        [td]2-3[/td]\n        [td]Half satisfied[/td]\n        [td]Wait 50%[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n        [td] ✔[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [th]C[/th]\n        [td] 1[/td]\n        [td]Less Interested[/td]\n        [td]Wait 75%[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [th]D[/th]\n        [td] 0[/td]\n        [td]Not what you need[/td]\n        [td]Wait 100%[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n\n🏅 Community Rating: [b] Very Positive [/b]\n🔎 Long Version Checklist ➜ [u][url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/expectationchecklist/discussions/1/1738883005311884039/]Reveal[/url][/u]\n📢 Disclaimer about Short Hours & English Error ➜ [u][url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/expectationchecklist/discussions/0/4594180031254224809/]Read Here[/url][/u]\n\n[quote]\n⚖️ iMeter {B} Worth a play, if you enjoy Teamwork Challenges with Puzzle.

I've clocked over 300 hours in it through Origin (on my ONE character xD ). It's an excellent game, even despite it being an \"open world faffaround simulator\" which was all the rage at the time.\n\nAnd finally on Steam!? Yay! Or yay..?\n\nBut, as we know, we can't have good things. Massive thumb down to the EA Origin \"integration\" in Steam. EA, how about just stop being such massive ducks?\n\nThis is the same \"we hate our customers\" behaviour expressed by d-bags like Ubisoft and Epic. Only that EA sort of makes it worse. They *know* how much people hate the unnecessary and malicious Uplay \"integration\" that Ubisoft have forced on us for several years. Seeing this, EA decides that doing the exact same thing, with their total-garbage Origin client made even worse, is surely the only way to harass the customers enough to be worthy of the EA brand. \n\nDO NOT BUY OR LINK your Steam account if you own the game on Origin from earlier. \nIf you buy a game on Steam, which you already own on Origin, it will overwrite your Origin game.\nIf you then refund the game on Steam, this will remove the game from Origin too (even if you already own it there!), and you'll spend hours in line to get a hold of customer support. Then you must chat with bots, or people who are so void of understanding (and likely not paid near enough to care) that they might as well be bots. And if you're lucky, you might, after going through 4 or 5 different \"agents\", finally get to talk to a person that comprehends English and is authorised to do anything beyond telling you \"they'll discuss it with their team\". Then you might get your game back. \nBut! You won't get back the GOTY. Because the Steam-Orgin-GOTY overwrites your Origin GOTY. And when refunding, via Steam, you're left with a dumb/lame/placeholder copy of the GOTY in your Origin library, which doesn't work, but somehow just lingers there. Then you need to get a Digital Deluxe Edition + all DLC to get back to where you were.\n\nThis [integration] is such a tremendous show of manure, that I'm actually left wondering if EA planned it. Did Andrew Wilson take one of his billions of pocked change and say \"hey, we should make an extra effort here, to make sure that this integration is as frustrating and poorly implemented as possible, but still functional, such that things are barely limping along but just barely, because nothing is as frustrating as something that just barely sorta works but only sorta, and only by the skin of its teeth. That'll teach those entitled peasants.\"\n\nSo yeah. Great game. Bad EA.\n\nUpdate! A new Origin experience: The EA App! An all new website, wrapped inside an all new Electron wrapper! For an all new Frustrating(TM) experience and much better hogging of your PC performance.\n- THIS GAME IS BORING PIZZA TOWER SHOULDVE WON I LOVE PIZZA TOWER\n\nCOCOON DEVS YOU WILL REGRET TAKING AWAY PIZZA TOWERS GAME AWARDS WIN TO ALL OF US GAMERS WE WANT PIZZA TOWER TO WIN GAME AWARDS NOW YOU WILL GO ON TWITTER YOU WILL REPLY TO EDMUND MCMILLEN AND YOU WILL APOLOGIZE FOR TAKING THE WIN AWAY FROM PIZZA TOWER AND MAYBE YOUR GAME WILL BE FUN!!! AND NOT THE SAME TWO TIMING PUZZLES YOU GOT IT? YOU WILL DO THIS OK I love pizza tower :)\n- Would I recommend DBD? ...It's complicated.\n\nDead By Daylight is an unique experience of asymmetric hide and seek/tag with shifting rules. \nIs the game fun? Yes. Is it creative? Yes.\nIs it fair and enjoyable? Well, it depends.\nGames get very intense, and playing as killer is some of the most intense gaming experience I've ever accumulated...\nWhich is where things often go wrong. The survivors seem to have decided that the killers have to honor strict code of rules. Don't use these items, these abilities, or these strategies. If you do, you'll be insulted after the game.\nIf you follow these rules, the odds are that you will spend the game running in literal circles, the survivors will win, t-bag you at the gate and then insult you after the game. I don't know about you, but that kind of ruins the game for me. It is actually kind of amazing how helpless one can feel in this game.\n\nSo to conclude my thoughts; I really like the game, but I also really hate it. I can't recommend it, as every time I fire it up, there is about 50% chance I feel more harassed, than entertained.\nI play a lot of online games, from League of Legends to Tekken, but this is the only one that makes me frequently think: \n\"I should really uninstall this\"\n\nEdit: \nI returned after a long break, and I still kinda like the game. \nHowever, same pattern repeats whenever I return. Eventually, I get teabagged one time too many and uninstall the game. The game is fun, the community could not be much worse. And sadly, that often ruins the experience.\n- \"Adult Themes from the perspective of an 8-year old\"\nIdk about you, but I wasn't nearly this fucked up as an 8-year old.\n\nJimmy and the Pulsating Mass in three sentences.\n\n--JPM is the most fleshed out, content packed, well made rpg's I have ever played. \n\n --It's unique battle mechanics offer a unique challenge and give players multiple options to overcome them. \n\n--This game has lots of emotional moments , tons of nightmare fuel, countless enimies ranging from cute to scummy, and TONS of exploration. \n\nBottom line: This game is an absolute must buy. It goes waaaaaaaay beyond stereotypical RPG-maker games in-terms of content, quality, and complexity.\n- AAA Industry: NOOOOOO!!! You can’t have a high quality and feature complete campaign with only a 6.5 GB install made by one guy using Unity, it has to be 200+ GB made by 5 studios and it needs to be an unfinished 3 hour mediocrity and gouge the consumers $70 USD for it!\n\nThis game: [b]HAHA LEG CHAINSAW GO BRRRR[/b]\n- You will enjoy the game at the beginning, it's fun and entertaining...Until you start playing the harder and larger hospitals and you get plagued with bad pathing issues, bad AI, people getting stuck in rooms, people dieing but they idle in a death state and stay around forever and all kinds of glitches which kills the enjoyment and ruins the management aspects. I've had to stop playing this game until they patch it because right now you're just managing bugs and glitches and you will have to design hospitals to get around these bugs, so that means extra wide corridors and spacing items out so people don't get stuck. Which sucks.\n\nNeeded much more playtesting before being released.\n\n*This is from v1.01.*\n- Saw a few youtube videos on this and decided to check it out.  Only played 30 min but here's my review from that. \n\nCustomization options are disappointing and boring. All of the character skins were white guys (and a possible vanilla Mexican). The option not to add other races at least to the Allied side is weird. As a gamer, when given the option for customization I expect to be able to create a character I at least somewhat feel represents me so I can get immersed (and don't even talk about 'historical accuracy'). They're also level locked for some reason. The uniforms are basic as they should be and you have a very limited weapon selection depending on the class you choose which is standard for these kinds of games. The character customization is very lacking and the only real reason I see it being there is to create DLC uniforms to buy. \n\nThe game itself seems like it's going in slow motion and maybe it's something people get used to after a while but I couldn't deal with it. The run is more like a speed walk and it feels like the soldier is considering being a conscientious objector with the amount of hesitation in aiming. Also everyone was kind just playing the game like Battlefield anyway.\n\nThis is probably a game that's more fun to play in a serious MilSim community.\n- Was a bit turn off when I saw it was a stationary shooter, but the game is so fun I look past that and even began to enjoy the room scaling dodging mechanics (game can make you work up a sweat!).\n\nA must for anyone looking for a more intense arcade shooting experience. I cannot overstate how fun it is to build your weapons in VR, the crafting system works flawlessly and seemely without the need of menus or UIs getting in the way, props for the devs for how well the game integrates with VR controls.\n\nWhat I liked:\n- Varied enemies\n - Great VR controls\n- Gun crafting is addicting and allows for a lot of experimentation\n- Great Bosses\n\nWhat I had trouble with:\n- Makes you wish you could run around the rooms like the original game!\n- The reduced FOV of most VR headsets makes it quite difficult to keep track of enemies that come from multiple directions. Some rooms require so much head movement that I tend to get sick.\n- When a room spawns with multiple shield pylons and a healer bot, it gets extremely frustrating if you have slow moving projectile weapons.\n\nWishes:\n- More gun parts! (Maybe future DLC?)\n- Luzia reminds me of a little me and the banter between the characters is very cute. \nThis game gives me big Spirited Away vibes but even after I finished it I am still lowkey confused who is who and what what whats've? \nThere were many touching moments [spoiler]esp the scene where Luzia said \"I can't save you but I can help you\" it struck me pretty hard because I always question whether or not one has the right to take their own life, and who are we to stop them...[/spoiler] Overall I actually feel this game is wholesome. It can teach one about what depression is like if you've never experienced it.\nI only got jumpscared once but it was a pleasant experience even then :3\n- The game is very good, it's fun and had everything to be a great success, but unfortunately because the anti-piracy, the game doesn't work well, even above 100 fps it feels lag, the game stutters, a strange gameplay.\n\nJust REMOVE DENUVO and the game will have the deserved success.\n\nUnfortunately, they still haven't realized that those who pirate, don't spend money with or without protection, and those who pay like us, have a game with problems.\n\nA good game doesn't need protection to sell, just be good, simple as that.\n- I have mixed feelings about this game. It could have been very very good but has been let down by some very shoddy quality issues. This would not in itself have been a problem BUT given its AAA high price tag, to be honest, the consumer deserves better in terms of finish and execution. To name a few of the irritations:\n1.) AI characters shooting through walls.\n2.) Poorly realised inventory system (You can't compare stats of your secondary weapon with inventory items)\n3.) Camera does not follow actions during combat\n4.) Right click items in inventory and you do not always get the correct sub menus.\n5.) Mouse & Keyboard use was definitely an afterthought in terms of design\n6.) The frustrating click to confirm attribute/perk/talent spend.\n7.) UI does not always detail consumed action points to move to a location during combat\n\nAs I said lots of irritations that normally, in an indie game such as this, you would expect... but NOT when the publisher charges AAA prices.\n\nEz\n\n- Guys literally only want one thing and it's this.\n\npure JRPG nostalgia\n- Everything apart from the matches is superb, best FM ever. \n\nThe match engine is fundamentally broken - too easy to split a defence open with a long ball resulting in a one-on-one, so SI nerfed the conversion rates of one-on-one chances to keep scorelines acceptable. The result however, is that your world class  striker misses 2-5 easy chances every game. \n\nWingers do not square the ball for strikers, instead preferring to shoot from obscenely acute angles rather than play the ball across the box. \n\nHalf the crowd is a repeated man in an orange jumper. This may sound minor but it's really immersion breaking once you notice it. You can be a team that plays in blue, and yet over 50% of the crowd are dressed in orange. It diminishes the match experience and detracts from the game as a whole.\n\nIt's crap like this, broken for 2 months now, I've bought every game in this series since the year 2000, I pre-order every year (literally the only game I will do so with) and said I'll continue to do so until I get burned. Well, SI Games, you've broken me at last. The 'Bugs' section of your forum is littered with these issues that are \"under review\", well you can consider my purchase of FM 2021 in the same category.\n\nEdit: I played a bunch more because apparently I'm a masochist. The match engine is total cack and has regressed massively since FM 2017. Don't waste your money - take up a more enjoyable pastime such as jamming needles in your eyes, you'll thank me for it.\n- Yes, the Origin client is somewhere between annoying and broken, depending on your hardware. And yes, Dragon Age Keep is still a big jumble of poorly explained choices that affect your game in a thousand little ways if you choose to use it. And yeah, none of the old technical issues really got fixed before coming to steam - this isn't a remaster - so shiny hair and lips for everyone.\n\nBut it's nice to be able to take a walk in Thedas again, and sink into the story, and admire what is probably the last real Bioware game before EA completely turned them into another ouroboros of live service bullshit. \n\nGet it on sale, for the nostalgia if nothing else.\n- I'm gonna give this a thumbs up but with like, idk, a cautionary sideways thumb for maybe. \n\nif I read credits right, it looks like this game had all its programming, art, music, and writing done by one guy, so I have to give respect to that. For a real indie game like this, it's very very good. \n\nBut it's still really flawed. If you're looking for a 2D Metroid game, and you've played EVERY other 2D metroid game, I suppose yeah, go for this one, and I think you'll enjoy it. If you're not a fan of metroid, I would not bother, sadly. This game suffers from a lot of problems from metroid games, and does not fix any, and at times exagerates those problems. \n\nThe art style is very interesting and cool, but the way the levels and map design are, leaves most areas feeling like a mess of unmemorable places. \n\nThe combat is INCREDIBLY simplistic, yet somehow bogged down by WAY too many useless weapons and just kind of badly designed controls. I found there were about 5 weapons that were actually useful in the game out of what seems like more than 10. Most enemies you either cheese, or be cheesed. There's no charge up shots, there's not really much nuance to the enemies or bosses. They have about two attacks and repeat while you dodge the same one bullet pattern and just kind of shoot in their general direction. (I played it on hard by the way. Not a particularly difficult game, but even the slightly challenging stuff felt kind of dull and uninteresting.) \n\nThe music was cool again. nothing quite mind blowing, but it was nice. The world itself seems like a mess, but there are cool ideas. The giant robot people were really cool to see. \n\nOne little idea i really liked is that the LOW HEALTH beep sound is actually in sync with every song in the game. I thought that was really cute, and it's not something I've seen any game do. Sounds dumb, but I give a lotta props to that, it was cool. \n\nWriting is okay. I feel it left more to be desired. There seemed to be an interesting world here that wasn't explored enough. It wasn't bad, I suppose, but not really that great. \n\nThat is kind of this game. It's not bad by any means, but not the best game on the planet. Play it if you're in need of a Metroid game, and I'm certain you will be pleased enough despite the flaws. Even if you're just having a hankering for a platformer and have already played Hollow Knight and some other great ones first, I think you should enjoy this, but don't expect a 10/10 game. \n\nGive it a try if you feel it looks interesting.\n- [h1]I enjoyed the game. Negative reviews can be more helpful though. One negative review can't hurt.[/h1]\n\nI'll keep the pros short:\n - Stress reliever\n - You can kill people in interesting ways\n - Mods can enhance this experience further\n\nCons:\n\n - The performance is pretty shit, so you will probably have to play with lower simulation settings, which aren't that good. Duh.\n\n - The base game is bland. Game is driven entirely by the workshop and your ability to create your own contraptions. Not a problem for me, maybe a problem for someone else.\n\n - The game can get boring pretty quickly because the loop is repetitive: spawn human, kill, repeat. This is coming from someone with over 400 hours played.\n\n - Not really game related, but if you don't like sticking around in communities that are often toxic, childish, annoying and the members are often kids or younger teens [spoiler](I would name a few examples but I feel like angering more than 1 fandom is a death sentence)[/spoiler], then avoid the community and stay away as far as possible and just grab your mods and run. Avoid the workshop comment sections, or just a lot of stuff in the workshop, the community tab, etc. It's just full of self-entitled kids who think they're hot shit.\n\n- Not sure how true this is nowadays, but some things on the workshop are just like farm spam, meaning the trending page was often filled with spam.\n\nRead the comments for anything I possibly missed to add but someone else mentioned.\n\nIn short:\nBuy the game if you like violence and looking like a crazy person that people wanna avoid from fear. It's pretty cool.\nDon't buy it if you aren't interested in that.\n\n[spoiler]The only reason I enabled comments is to possibly show how correct the community point is.[/spoiler]\n- The premise is that you're a passenger on a ship, waking up on the morning after you've murdered your well-to-do husband. From that point, you're free to go anywhere on board to do whatever you can to avoid justice within the time limit. You could just try to play dumb and cover up enough evidence to put your guilt into doubt. If you're more devious you could try to frame one of your fellow passengers. You could even go the And Then There Were None route and murder everyone else on board just to be thorough, if you can pull it off.\n\nOverboard! was clearly designed for replayability. The ship is full of evidence and red herrings to tamper with, desperate schemes to attempt, and secrets to learn. The first playthrough reveals only a small slice of all this, leaving a collection of unsolved mysteries and unfollowed leads to pursue on the second. The second playthrough prepares you for the third, and so on, until finally you beat the game... but there's much more to it than that. Vague, but I don't want to spoil anything.\n\nThis game was released today without any kind of announcement beforehand from inkle. As usual, their writing and design are superb. If you're captivated by the premise, even by a little, you won't regret the purchase.\n- Lemme give it to y'all straight, who are on the fence;\n\n- Yes, the game is very much worth it at full price.\n\n- One of the first games in a long while, that has kept me up until 5 A.M. in the morning, because of how lost I get myself into it.\n\n- Doesn't do dumb jump scares, save for a VERY FEW TIMES, and each one counted.\n\n- The game is maybe one of the best zombie based games out there, so long as you do enjoy it with action.\n\n- Parkour in the game is AMAZING. Sometimes I like just playing the game, so I can run\naround, across roof tops, and attacking zombies while talking to friends.\n\n- Co-op in story mode. Freaking amazing. No dumb lobby. Just click 'Join game' and bam,\nyou'll be thrown a few feet away from a friend without them sometimes even noticing you joined!\n\n- Single play and Co-op have a huge impact; co-op feels fun, slightly safer, and adds a lot in the form of friendly rivals! Single player feels way more tense and everything you do counts, making you second guess some choices, for fear or death. Night time in either mode is fun as heck, though four co-op makes it pretty easy.\n\n- Night and Day feel almost like two different modes. In the day, zombies shuffle around, falling off rooftops, being dumb, easy to avoid and kill. Night time? Get those UV Flares ready, and be ready to flee if they catch sight of you.\n\n- Even after beating the story, I keep coming back for more, as it's super fun.\n\n- Took me around 30 hours to do the story, which also included only HALF of the side missions. Still got a little over 50% left to go, and looking forward to it!\n\nTL;DR - Get the game, find friends to play with, enjoy the hell out of one of the few games worth it at full price.\n- Game slaps, played the first area, unlocked ranked and spent 4 hours grinding a 2 minuet long level to reach the top rank in bronze 1 division and i'm going to do it again tomorrow\n- \"We'll take the top, and it'll be a happy ending. Just like in Dragon Quest.\" - Ichiban Kasuga.\n- Hi, here's an honest review. Yes I was very hyped about this game, like many of us.\n\nPROS\n-Cheap price \n-Besides that, nothing outstadning,  mostly a blatant copy of dayZ.\n\nCONS\n-Poor optimization, I have a 1070 OC edition with a ryzen 1700 and I play on 1440p, in new titles I usually get 70-100 fps on high-ultra, but in this game I get an outstanding 40-70 fps on MEDIUM, usually 55 when in forest, which is bad, since only 6% of users on steam have 1070 and higher gpus.\n-Servers... Before releasing a game, might as well check if servers work, I can't connect to most of the servers, or the server to which I connect are choppy and laggy (or maybe it's the game?)\n-No loot in normal buldings like regular houses and shacks, and by no loot I mean nothing found, besides nails and metal sheets which are essential to some crafting but you can't afford to carry them due to very limited inventory space when you spawn in. And I haven't found a backpack either. The place to loot is the Airfield but it's made challanging with the 2 robots walking around which is alright but since you cannot find anything anywhere it's rather annoying ( I have found guns and gear from dead bodies) \n-The mouvement is not great, feels unfished and choppy and that scroll wheel sprinting is disgusting.\n-The Metabolism, which they emphasised so hard upon. I PERSONALLY detest this system, it looked interesting but when you can't find anything to keep it on point it becomes boring.\n-The graphics are bad. When compared to games like The Vanishing of Ethan Carter and What Remains of Edith Finch, this game is a shame to UE4\n\nOverall\n-Unfinished, and by that I mean it's not working properly, not the lack of content, I understand that it's early access, but the devs at least have to polish it before releasing it, so that people can play it, and then add new content and mechanics.\n\nI'm extremely dissapointed with the game, I hoped it to be a game to play for 1-2 hours per day with friends to have fun but that's not happening any time soon. I strongly advise to wait for major optimization updates and other patches before buying it\n- Horrible FOV, glitchy looking graphics, everything is blurred even with motion blur off, absolutely no chance of that multiplayer mod, shoddy PC port... Pretty boring and clunky tbh. Don't buy this.\n- Medium performance issues (as of 2/28/22) but GOTY game. This game is amazing and absolutely dripping with content. FromSoft didn't make Dark Souls 4. This game is Dark Souls 4, 5, and 6 all in one. Absolutely massive game and the open world part doesn't feel like an attempt to pad the game like most games, here's why:\n- Picking up items in the open world doesn't have a pickup animation. This might not seem like a lot but go play something like Dragon Age: Inquisition and you'll know what I'm talking about.\n- You can pick up items while on horseback (also no animation), Greatly speeds up looting while in the open world\n- Summoning pools makes getting summoned for bosses is easier than ever. All you have to do is be in the same general overworld location as a pool and all location get a summon sign\n- Sooooo many more bonfire locations. Can also fast travel from almost anywhere using the in-game map.\n- packed with stuff to do. Very rarely are you walking/riding for long periods before running into a dungeon/boss/camp/npc/etc. Every single side location has something to discover, Plus you never know what you're going to get and the feeling of discovery is unlike any other game out there.\n\nThere are a lot of improvements over previous installments as well. In no particular order, here are some of my standouts:\n- POWERSTANCING IS BACK BABYYYYY. Was always my favorite thing from DS2.\n- Slottable weapon arts. Taking the weapon art system from DS3 and making it even better. This system is also tied to the weapon affinity system which allows you to switch up the scaling of a weapon at any bonfire. No more committing to a specific element or stat.\n- The open world makes the game more accessible. Hit a wall with one zone? Just go somewhere else and come back when stronger. Sekiro had this a little but this game it's extremely pronounced.\n- The statues of Marika make it so the runbacks for bosses is not nearly as grueling. These statues work as \"respawn only\" bonfires that you can choose to respawn back at and are usually just outside a boss fight room after a lengthy run. You can't rest at them or adjust your build there, but they prevent the grueling runback and allow you to smash your face into a boss over and over with minimal downtime.\n- Having a dedicated jump button but keep the power of jump attacks. Risky usually, but can also be used as a counter to low swinging attacks. This also adds into the next system of...\n- Poise breaking enemies. Is done by heavy attacking, jump attacking and guard countering. Adds even more move types to the game and makes every weapon a totally different playstyle and adds to the replay value.\n- What are guard counters? After successfully blocking and attack, you can follow it up with a special heavy attack that has high poise damage. Allows for more critical hits. You might think this makes it easier but it takes more skill than you'd think to time these ripostes and it always feels good.\n\nAs with any game, it's not for everyone, but if you love souls games, you'd be doing yourself a disservice by missing this one. If you've never played a souls game, this is the best one to try. The most accessible by far. No crazy hard tutorial bosses, the new ashen summoning bell gives some great support in difficult areas, and the fact you can always leave harder fights and come back to them later makes it so you rarely run into situations where you know booting up the game means you're gonna be brick walling until either the boss dies or you give up.\n- Absolutely amazing. PLEASE don't judge this game based on how it looks. You must try it yourself! I thought it would be terrible but a friend convinced me to try it, and I'm glad he did. I haven't had so much fun in a game in a long time.\n- An instant classic.\n---\n\nThe original [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/kunovega/recommended/264200]One Finger Death Punch[/url] was an unexpected treat for me. The refined simplicity of just two buttons that require masterful timing to create a legitimate fighting experience laid out to a selection of music that reminds you of the classic Kung-fu movies of the 1970's but packaged with a carefree stickman aesthetic.\n\nOne Finger Death Punch 2 is a respectable sequel in most ways. The core gameplay is fundamentally the same while the visual indicators and special attack animations have been upgraded and made more fanciful. Other things are changed simply to give you a new experience.\n\nEvery aspect of the game is polished from the interesting tutorial to the many additional modes (survival, gauntlet, etc.) that exist beyond the (very long) main campaign. Once you get into the groove there's potentially dozens if not hundreds of hours of fun to squeeze from this.\n\nThis is a game that just has to be played to truly appreciate it as the feel of your interaction along with the music is what really defines the experience. Simply watching it or looking at the screenshots doesn't do it justice.\n\nThere are a couple of (minor) controversial changes that may not appeal to some fans:\n1. The music in 2 includes a more modernized remix compared to the more traditional music from 1. Personally I love the soundtracks from both, but there are people who have a preference.\n2. The upgrades to special attacks in 2 can be a bit of visual clutter at times. I like both styles, but there are people who prefer 1 over 2.\n3. There are some sequences (like the lightsword rounds) which did not return in 2, replaced instead by other weapons. While I think it would have been cute to include all of that along with the new stuff, it's not a deal breaker. It does however mean that both games retain a bit of unique flair and a reason for you to play and experience them both. 2 is overall an upgrade, but it's also not a 100% replacement.\n\nI would strongly suggest that if you've never played either game, you should begin with the first one. I think it's a better entry point to the series and might have a slightly broader appeal. (it's also slightly cheaper).\n\nThen if you find yourself enjoying it, come back and pick up 2 and you'll find yourself with some remixed music, fancy new special attack animations and a whole new adventure to work through.\n\nJust to be very clear: Both of these games are fantastic and deserve more praise than I can properly express and I'll very likely be putting 100's of hours into this just like I did the first one.\n---\n\nBottom line: Simple to learn, hard to master, and super satisfying fighting along with a great soundtrack.\n---\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38232109/]While you are here, would you consider following my curator page?[/url]\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/kunovega/recommended/]Want to read all of my reviews and not just the curated ones?[/url]\n- Really fun for the first few rounds... Then the game changes your control scheme without telling you, and with no way to turn it back. This has lead to several hours of frustration, trying to revert it. From what I've read, this is 'intended' to make the game more difficult, but really, is just incredible stupid. If I wanted the game to be more difficult because of a more annoying control scheme, I'd play with a god damn dance pad.\n\nThe game is really fun, but this has frustrated me to the point that I can't enjoy it any more unless it's fixed, and therefore I can't recommend it either\n- *Sigh* This game was just tiring. I wouldn't come to say it was a complete rip off of Paper's Please, but it was a very similar game but just worse. Mainly to the point that I played, at most, 10 minutes, I saw multiple repeats of the same messages, and the only updates were legislation, unlike in Papers, Please where you got new rules and new tools almost every day. I won't completely judge the game since I haven't played it the entire way through, but it's just not very good. Plain and simple.\n- Really need a report button to slap some senses into trolls in online matches.\nCan't even escape them at ranked. sigh\nGreat game nonetheless, 4/5\n- Basically Wizard of Legend, but from a different viewpoint. Same composer, both pixel art, similarly fast paced boss fights with good telegraphs, combos are a little less deliberate, though. Very satisfying build making, with solid build variety. Has couch co-op which is very nice. It has some beautiful pixel art, truly. This game is a feast for the eyes and ears with cutscenes, voice acting, and more. Ok, I just love this game. It's so damn good.\n- -This game is like the combination of old PC sidescroller like Duke Nukem (pre-3d), NES Contra, and arcade Metal Slug with 80s /90s cyberpunk and action movie tropes.\n-The cheesy humor, plot, and music is top notch. Might look like a shallow nostalgia at a glance but once you played it, they even spiritually nailed the silliness of similar games/story in that era. The guns, the character acting and lines, the costume design, etc.\n-It's not as fast paced as I thought it would be. But actually that makes it relaxing to play. Easy to get into and the challenge is just right for me without being frustrating. \n-I like how the enemies and characters are pretty diverse. \n-I haven't finished the game but I feel like this game will have similar replay value like Streets of Rage 4. Not because of there are many things to do or getting better at the game but because it's somehow just simply tight, fun, and arcadey to replay.\n- Game is super realistic, got ahead of Hamilton and he pitted me into a wall going 180mph, just like real life!\n- There is no skill requirement to play this game; everything seems pretty randomized including when and where the demon attacks you. Its rather difficult to play alone or just with two players. So if your looking for a game to play alone for a fright or just with one other buddy of yours. Make sure your ready to lose, This game has a great concept I just hope it will get more refined with the attacks. It seems like you get killed before you can even attempt to complete the objective.\n- + Great developer support. Updated quite frequently\n+ Great graphics for its game engine\n+ Great vehicle physics\n+ Dynamic time, weather and vehicle damage.\n+ Friendly interface\n+ Ability to purchase garages and hire drivers to work for you\n+ 1000s of miles of road to drive on\n+ Many cities to discover\n+ Several trucks to choose from\n+ Realistic sounds\n+ Lots of accessories and options to choose\n+ Great wheel support\n+ Many trailers and jobs to choose\n+ Multiplayer available\n+ Integrated radio and music player\n+ Console can be enabled to edit / modify different parameters\n+ Map editor\n+ Inexpensive DLC\n+ Easily the best truck simulator out there\n- The best games Telltale has ever made, plus one that is very mediocre\n-Season One: 10/10 - A masterpiece, prepare to be hit right on the feelings and cry a lot\n-Season Two: 9/10 - Awesome, and very very sad. More tears at the end\n-A New Frontier:  7/10 - Kinda good, kinda bad, mixed feelings, not much to make me care for the new characters\n-Michonne: 3/10 - Boring as hell, uninspired history, bad characters, Michone is awesome on the comics and the show, here she´s just annoying\n-The Final Season: 10/10 - OMG this game made me cry from the beggining to the end, it´s soooo good, and the end is soooo satisfying\n- They shadow dropped an update that literally breaks the game and DLC, and for what? Ads.... ads for RS+\n\nNo wonder piracy is the answer in this day and age when stupid business decisions like this are implemented. If I were to write a review a week ago I'd of said yes and recommended this, but this is just another shovel of dirt in the company's deep DEEEEEEEP hole of failures. I'm officially done with Ubisoft because of this. This was a great gateway to learning guitar and even the CDLC made it possible to learn songs that aren't even apart of the + library.\n\nSomeone please get to making a pirated copy of this game with all DLC as that will sell better than anything ubi throws out and it'll be free at that.\n- This game is a cozy  winter morning, wrapped in a blanket, in the heat of the fireplace with your favorite cartoon on and cup of hot chocolate, it is x-files, it is the music that you hear while walking on the streat, it is people you know,  good people, bad people, real people. This game has the feeling of nostalgia while being totally contemporary and modern.This game is every young adult fear and existential crisis all at once. This game is pure feeling.\n\n\nthat aside, this game is pretty much a perfect game for me, the story is really interesting, the music is beautiful and the art is gorgeous, and the characters and the atmosphere are so fucking believable i think i know everybody in this game, or atleast i feel so.\n\nAs a small town dude i really relate with a lot of thing in this game.\n\nThis game is special, its special for me.\n- This might literally be the coolest game I've ever played, and possibly the best game that I've played in the last 10 years.\n\nThough, I might be the wrong person to ask though as Earthbound is my favorite game, and this game is obviously heavily Earthbound inspired. Stylistically and comedy wise anyway. The story is much darker than anything in Earthbound, but it's all buried underneath some of the funniest writing I've ever seen in a game. The writing start to finish is amazing, I'm only dissappointed that the game wasn't longer as there's a few questions left unanswered.\n\nI did normal mode, first run, collected all characters and beat the game in 12-13 hours. For 10 dollars, that's pretty alright. The fights are pretty open ended as there are like 20+ characters you can choose from, but I ended up using Rage, Bottles and Mad Dog. I found it wasn't the hardest game I've played, but I also haven't tried pain mode yet.\n\nAnyway, if this game interests you at all, buy it. You won't regret it.\n- I have always wanted to play Resdient Evil 4, and I wanted to play this game so badly.  I am giving a negative review simply because the games FPS on the PC are bad, that could be because of Windows 10 because I heared rumors that the game does not run well on it and such, so that could be the problem.   Another problem I faced is the lip sync is dealyed when it's on the cutscenes so that makes everything slow and such.  The gameplay from what I seen however is pretty great and I think Resdient Evil 4 is a great game, but this port is not, get it for the GC, Will, PS2, or any of the consloes that has this game.\n- Some of the tightest controls, buttery smooth animation and gorgeous scenes you'll see all year. I've bought it three times now, (once for me, twice as gifts for friends) and each time was worth it.\n\nSupport developers like these.\n- I'm gonna give this a thumbs up but with like, idk, a cautionary sideways thumb for maybe. \n\nif I read credits right, it looks like this game had all its programming, art, music, and writing done by one guy, so I have to give respect to that. For a real indie game like this, it's very very good. \n\nBut it's still really flawed. If you're looking for a 2D Metroid game, and you've played EVERY other 2D metroid game, I suppose yeah, go for this one, and I think you'll enjoy it. If you're not a fan of metroid, I would not bother, sadly. This game suffers from a lot of problems from metroid games, and does not fix any, and at times exagerates those problems. \n\nThe art style is very interesting and cool, but the way the levels and map design are, leaves most areas feeling like a mess of unmemorable places. \n\nThe combat is INCREDIBLY simplistic, yet somehow bogged down by WAY too many useless weapons and just kind of badly designed controls. I found there were about 5 weapons that were actually useful in the game out of what seems like more than 10. Most enemies you either cheese, or be cheesed. There's no charge up shots, there's not really much nuance to the enemies or bosses. They have about two attacks and repeat while you dodge the same one bullet pattern and just kind of shoot in their general direction. (I played it on hard by the way. Not a particularly difficult game, but even the slightly challenging stuff felt kind of dull and uninteresting.) \n\nThe music was cool again. nothing quite mind blowing, but it was nice. The world itself seems like a mess, but there are cool ideas. The giant robot people were really cool to see. \n\nOne little idea i really liked is that the LOW HEALTH beep sound is actually in sync with every song in the game. I thought that was really cute, and it's not something I've seen any game do. Sounds dumb, but I give a lotta props to that, it was cool. \n\nWriting is okay. I feel it left more to be desired. There seemed to be an interesting world here that wasn't explored enough. It wasn't bad, I suppose, but not really that great. \n\nThat is kind of this game. It's not bad by any means, but not the best game on the planet. Play it if you're in need of a Metroid game, and I'm certain you will be pleased enough despite the flaws. Even if you're just having a hankering for a platformer and have already played Hollow Knight and some other great ones first, I think you should enjoy this, but don't expect a 10/10 game. \n\nGive it a try if you feel it looks interesting.\n- After playing thousands of games both singleplayer and multiplayer, unlocking all achievements and getting every solo map medal, I think it's time for a review:\n\nIf you like tower defence games: I recommend.\nIf you like any previous Bloons games: I recommend.\nIf you want something casual and chill: I recommend.\nIf you want a bit of a challenge: I recommend.\n\nThe tower type variety is interesting and diverse, with 5 tiers of upgrades each (plus special \"paragon\" towers)\nThe game devs have been providing free updates for years.\nThere's lots of achievements and medals to get.\nThere's online co-op, boss events and even different game-modes.\n\nThe game is more expensive than it used to be, but literally any sale price makes it worth a buy!\n- Honestly I've put over 400 hours into 20XX and this game is even better! Even though it's unfinished as of current it's still a fantastic time and truly stands out on it's own.\n- The game balances out and improves on everything from the original KoF2002. \nThat said, this is a bit more fast-paced than other KoF games. If you've played KoF98, this one is faster and more combo heavy. If you've played 13, this one has a higher bar for executing combos. If you're coming from XI, this one doesn't have the tag system. Those are the most important changes from other popular KoF games.\n- If you like management type games and RPGs, this is the perfect mix. It's just enough management to allow you to thrive with mostly strategy without feeling bogged down, and just enough RPG elements to get you invested in not just your squad, but each individual character in it. \n\nHere's a tale from my experience with the game;\n\nThis is the kind of game to change your entire perspective on life itself. Failure is not the end, nor the beginning, but a constant in this world that you can either let destroy you or make you stronger. Allow me to tell you a story. The story of New Battlehill. \nNear the Shek city of Squin, not far east, was a small town. It went through many names. The first that stuck was Firstyeet, totally not a placeholder. It wasn't an notable settlement, merely consisting of a shack, an iron processor, and some walls to mildly inconvenience the roving gangs of Dust Bandits that liked to bully the residents. After being evicted from their own city once again, the residents, Denver, Soto, Ruka, and Meow, vowed to take back their home. After training and buying the best weapons and armor they could, they made their way back to Firstyeet. To their surprise, however, they would not have to fight. One of the bandits had picked a fight with a herd of goats. The bandits' defense failed against the caprine assault. From this, the town would get its second name - Densorumego. Den for Denver. So for Soto. Ru for Ruka. Me for Meow. And Go for the true heroes, the goats.\nPeace would not last long but soon the residents of Densorumego would become strengthened by their constant fighting. On the elevated, somewhat round land on which Densorumego sat, there were many large fights involving a lot of people. If only there was some sort of name to reflect this... \nAnd from that, the town was renamed for the last time, to Battlehill.\nThings were looking up. The town built its first farms and expanded to be almost four times its original size. But this peace would not last. Battlehill's new ambitions of self sufficiency would attract the attention of a new foe - The Shek Kingdom.\nThe Shek claimed ownership of the land Battlehill was on, and as such, demanded all food grown there be given to them. Confident from their many victories against the Dust Bandits, the Battlehillites refused the Shek demands. Their risk was calculated... but man were they bad at math.\nAll but one were nearly killed in the ensuing battle, and the one person that wasn't knocked into a coma was stuck on the wall because part of the wall was destroyed and he could no longer reach the stairs because of that. The people knew they couldn't fight the Shek, but they would not allow themselves to be subservient either. And so began their malicious compliance. The Shek would get all the food in Battlehill, as it would be none - The Battlehillites were moving.\nI could write entire books about their journey around the west. The Fogmen, the ruins, the Screeching Bandits, there's many a tale. But, eventually, the people would find a new home. In the harsh and Beak Thing infested land of Vain, homeland of the Western Hive, they would found their new home - New Battlehill.\nJump to now, the city is thriving, they have more bread than they know what to do with, they've grown strong from defending their home from the Beak Things, and their population has grown. They are currently planning a reconquest of Battlehill, which was occupied by Dust Bandits shortly after they left.\n\nThere is a part I left out, between Firstyeet and Densorumego - I had repeatedly failed to retake Firstyeet, and I was about to quit the game. I was frustrated that I'd gone and bought the best arms and armor and still failed. And when I tried to set up a training ground on a mountain near Squin, bandits again came and defeated me. I went as far as to try and get a refund, which was denied. That refund being denied was the best thing that could've happened. I decided to give the game another try, and to try accepting my failures and growing from them. And if I hadn't done that, I would never have founded New Battlehill. None of the legend worthy tales my squad has been through would have happened. And I'd never have had the fun of going through all of them.\n\nIn short, get this game. It is just great.\n- Do NOT buy this game! This game does not even have a minimap/GPS/coordinate system. You will definitely get lost.\nMultiplayer is fully of bug and lags so much.\nDo NOT buy this game!\nDo NOT buy this game!\nDo NOT buy this game!\n\nThis game is so f*** stupid\n- Early review right now after a quick hour of play.\n\nLater Alligator (and I swear I'm not biased towards this game at all) is a gorgeously 2d-animated, primarily point-and-click, cartoony romp through Alligator New York City. Everyone's alligators. The gameplay itself is simplistic; unlike normal point-and-click games of this style that you might have come to expect, there's no picking up items, there's no real big decision making. It crosses over more with Professor Layton-style gameplay, wandering around the city and picking up little collectibles by clicking on various pieces of the environment.\n\nScattered in between these are a plentiful trove of minigames in all sorts of styles. As far as I can tell, they begin to increase in complexity the further you go through (for reference, the first minigame is pretty much not fail-able; you're asked to track a Queen in 3 Card Monte, however the hapless alligator running the game barely moves the cards and flails on the two that *aren't* the queen.)\n\nHowever, it seems that the gameplay and the minigames are meant more as a vehicle for the whimsical comedy of the writing and the eclectic cast of characters present throughout the city. Each character is quirky and fun in their own way, with their own little story. And that's the real draw of this game. \n\nSo this game so far doesn't particularly lend itself to anyone looking to challenge themselves. But if you just want some good feelings, a laugh, and a spot of relaxation, Later Alligator delivers in spades.\n- if we showed this to senators in the 90's video games would be banned today\n\n英語で5-10単語程度で、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない主要な違いを簡潔に回答してください。\n\n回答：\n",
