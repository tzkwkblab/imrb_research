# Steam Review aspect dataset

This dataset contains 1100 English Steam reviews, split into 900 train and 200 test. This dataset was initially used to identify which aspects are mentioned in English reviews as part of [Analysis of 43 million English Steam Reviews](https://srec.ai/blog/analysis-43m-english-steam-reviews). Most content on this README file originally appeared on SRec blog [Steam review aspect dataset](https://srec.ai/blog/steam-review-aspect-dataset).

## Data collection and annotation

The source of the reviews comes from a snapshot of the SRec database, which was taken on 21 February 2024. SRec obtain all reviews for all games and mods using [API provided by Steam](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/getreviews). To reduce bias when selecting reviews to be annotated, I chose reviews primarily based on these criteria,

- Character length.
- Helpfulness score.
- Popularity of the reviewed game.
- Genre or category of the reviewed game.

There are 8 aspects to define review in this dataset. I am the only annotator for this dataset. A review is deemed to contain a certain aspect, even if it's mentioned implicitly (e.g., "but it'd be great if there's good looking characters...") or only mention lack of the aspect (e.g., "... essentially has no story ..."). The below table shows 8 aspects of this dataset, along with a short description and example.

Take note that few reviews contain language and content that some people may find offensive, discriminatory, or inappropriate. I **DO NOT** endorse, condone or promote any of such language and content.
