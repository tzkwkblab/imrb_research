long time .\n- Well I spilled something on it and they replaced it with this model , which gets hot and the $T$ does n't make it through 1 DVD .\n- That included the extra Sony Sonic Stage software , the speakers and the subwoofer I got -LRB- that WAS worth the money -RRB- , the bluetooth mouse for my supposedly bluetooth enabled computer , the $T$ and the Docking port .\n- Has a 5-6 hour $T$ .\n- It 's so nice that the $T$ last so long and that this machine has the snow lion !\n- The $T$ holds up well , it 's built very solidly , and runs fast .\n- The $T$ was supposed to be 6 hours , but even if I ran off the battery with the high effeciency setting the battery would only last me on average about 2.5 to 3 hours .\n- It has a 10 hour $T$ when you 're doing web browsing and word editing , making it perfect for the classroom or office , and in terms of gaming and movie playing it 'll have a battery life of just over 5 hours .\n- The battery life was supposed to be 6 hours , but even if I ran off the battery with the high effeciency setting the $T$ would only last me on average about 2.5 to 3 hours .\n- It was also suffering from hardware -LRB- keyboard -RRB- issues , relatively slow performance and shortening $T$ .\n- My $T$ went bad about a year and a half after having it and it cost around eighty to a hundred dollars !\n- I bought it for my mom and she reports that the $T$ lasts all day for her , it 's very lightweight , and the response for the computing she 's doing -LRB- Internet focused activity : mail , research , etc. -RRB- is excellent ;\n- The $T$ is probably an hour at best .\n- The battery life was supposed to be 6 hours , but even if I ran off the $T$ with the high effeciency setting the battery would only last me on average about 2.5 to 3 hours .\n- And not to mention after using it for a few months or so , the $T$ will slowly less and less hold a charge until you ca n't leave it unplugged for more than 5 minutes without the thing dying .\n- $T$ needs more life .\n\n【グループB】\n- The comments about fried foods is correct -LRB- below -RRB- but the other $T$ , including the lamb entree and many of the salads -LRB- avocado shrimp -RRB- were quite good .\n- Good cake BUT : it was not the best cake i 've ever had , and definately not worth standing outside on the sidewalk being herded like cattle by indifferent and overworked $T$ .\n- Upgrading from Windows 7 Starter , thru Windows 7 Home Premium , to $T$ was a snap ;\n- The battery lasts as advertised -LRB- give or take 15-20 minutes -RRB- , and the entire $T$ is very elegant .\n- I had never had $T$ before but I thought it was innovative and tasty -LRB- could 've used a bit more salt -RRB- .\n- His $T$ are very inventive , delicious and classy .\n- I was very impressed by this low-key upper eastsider and their authentically $T$ !!!\n- Mac also has many apps and $T$ that are quite cheap or free .\n- While we thoroughly enjoyed the $T$ , it was annoying to scream across the table for conversation .\n- '' The menu includes $T$ -- burgers , steaks and shepherds pie -- and even a portabella lasagna for those black sheep known as `` vegetarians .\n- It has just enough RAM to run smoothly and enough $T$ to satisfy my needs .\n- However , in the summer of 2003 , it seems the $T$ has changed and the great big door has been replaced for a glass front ridding itself of the dark romantic getup .\n- The service was fast and friendly and the food was very tasty and they had the best $T$ to add to your meals .\n- great $T$ -LRB- italian -RRB- , good food , service was INITIALLY fine .\n- I wanted it for it 's $T$ and man , this little bad boy is very nice .\n- It is far more popular as a $T$ than as a restaurant , with only a few tables and the waiter being the bartender , but we greatly enjoyed the unobtrusive atmosphere .\n- The $T$ was attentive .\n- The $T$ was on point - what else you would expect from a Ritz ?\n- Works well , and I am extremely happy to be back to an $T$ .\n- The service was bad , the $T$ took to forever to come , we sat on the upper level .\n- $T$ are purely amazing .\n- I complete the total $T$ experience by having it lightly toasted .\n- But with A WAY Bigger Screen , and IS able to connect to an $T$ .\n- The only thing I wish is the 15 inch MacBook Pro has much better $T$ on the side of the keyboard .\n- Yes , the computer was light weight , less expensive than the average laptop , and was pretty self explantory in $T$ .\n- I went there for $T$ and it was not as good as I expected from the reviews I read .\n- We did n't even see a $T$ , as our waiter described both the specials and the main dishes .\n- For the next hour and a half we stood in the crowded $T$ of this touristy restaurant listening to all types of explanations of why we were not being seated .\n- I bought it for my mom and she reports that the battery life lasts all day for her , it 's very lightweight , and the $T$ for the computing she 's doing -LRB- Internet focused activity : mail , research , etc. -RRB- is excellent ;\n- The only thing I miss are the $T$ and other things that I grew accustomed to after so long .\n- The $T$ was rather over cooked and dried but the chicken was fine .\n- The restaurant is rather small but we were lucky to get a $T$ quickly .\n- We ordered some $T$ and noodle soup dishes from the Thai section of the menu but nothing we got was Thai .\n- I believe that the quality of a mac is worth the $T$ .\n- As much as I like the $T$ there , I ca n't bring myself to go back .\n- The $T$ is a bit too small for live music , so on jazz nights , it can be loud and cramped .\n- Wine list selection is good and $T$ was generously filled to the top .\n- Two complaints - their appetizer selection stinks , it would be nice to get some mozzarella sticks on the $T$ .\n- The service was attentive without being overbearing and each dish we tried was wonderful from the $T$ to the cod with pineapple tempura .\n- Although I moved uptown I try to stop in as often as possible for the GREAT cheap $T$ and to pay the friendly staff a visit .\n- I was n't a big fan of the Netbooks but this one was very well $T$ .\n- Next time , we would n't dare ordering anything else other than some simple $T$ and drinks .\n- The atmosphere is unheralded , the $T$ impecible , and the food magnificant .\n- Two people in our party felt like something else , and Volare immediately obliged with two great $T$ that were not in their regular menu .\n- At first , the computer seemed a great deal -- seemingly high-end specs for a low , low $T$ .\n- $T$ is a mixed bag .\n- I had to flag down a third staff person for a $T$ ... so now it 's goodbye Little RUDE Pie Company .\n- The chocolate raspberry cake is heavenly - not too sweet , but full of $T$ .\n- The ground chickpea soup we sampled as a $T$ tasted somewhat thin .\n- Fresh veggies , all sorts of middle eastern spreads , $T$ and falafel , soup , fish , rice , root vegetables , a rice medley , some spinach thing , lamb kebabs , cheese baclava ... soooo much fooood , and all of it delicious .\n- Based on the reviews for dinner , this is a place I would reconsider revisiting for that , but definitely not for $T$ again .\n- I bought it from HSN because it was `` bundled '' with extra software , but as it turns out , that $T$ just crashes it more often ...\n- Try the $T$ !!!\n- The Mac takes about the same amount of $T$ as the average PC , but keeps itself cleaned up and ready to use .\n- The pro is a great product , I wish that the 13 inch models came with the Intel i processors and had a more comfortable edge -LRB- the $T$ hurt my wrists -RRB- .\n- They had scrapped the bottom of the vessel in which they make the $T$ - RESULT - WE HAD LARGE CHUNKS OF BURNT RICE IN OUR SERVING BOWL .\n- There are several programs for school or office use -LRB- $T$ , Numbers , Keynote , etc. -RRB- , music -LRB- Garageband -RRB- , photo management -LRB- Photo Booth , iPhoto -RRB- , video-editing or movie-making -LRB- iMovie -RRB- , etc. .\n- I had the $T$ telling me older version did not make the fan noise cause it is a `` different '' computer .\n- I must warn the reader that the $T$ sizes are very small -LRB- especially the appetizers -RRB- , so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef 's special tasting menu , prepare to order and pay for an appetizer -LRB- 1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing -RRB- , a main entree , and the cold udon at the end of the meal .\n- Very good $T$ and well made .\n- The size is perfect and I do not recomend anything bigger except for any person who can exceed the limited $T$ it gives you .\n- The duck confit is always amazing and the $T$ was out of this world .\n- An excellent $T$\n- Cords coming out the right for $T$ plus cords coming out front for headphones/mic plus network connection on left make for a very messy setup with cords going every direction .\n- Screen , keyboard , and $T$ : If you cant see yourself spending the extra money to jump up to a Mac the beautiful screen , responsive island backlit keyboard , and fun multi-touch mouse is worth the extra money to me alone .\n- While the new restaurant still features much of the same classical furniture that made Tiffin so attractive , the $T$ has been overhauled .\n- But the $T$ of Mac Mini is a huge disappointment .\n- I like the somosas , $T$ , and the chole , but the dhosas and dhal were kinda dissapointing .\n- With so many good restaurants on the UWS , I do n't need overpriced $T$ , absurdly arrogant wait-staff who do n't recognize they work at a glorified diner , clumsy service , and management that does n't care .\n- Best $T$ and sour spicy soup in town !\n- It had a cooling system malfunction after 10 minutes of general $T$ , and would not move past this error .\n- I play a lot of casual games online , and the $T$ is very responsive .\n- $T$ was slow , but the people were friendly .\n- We made early $T$ and were thoroughly impressed , reminds me of my grandfather , its old school Italian scenery with lots of fun stuff to admire .\n- I like the $T$ .\n- I recommend their Pad See Ew , Pork Chops or $T$ .\n- The only thing that can be updated is the $T$ , other than that you 're all set .\n- The waitress came by to pick up the soy sauce WHILE we were eating our $T$ !!!!!\n- $T$ smooth and quick .\n- A nice space , as long as it does n't get too crowded and a singleminded devotion to its chosen $T$ make Mare a great choice for seafood lovers .\n- I was back-to-back with the $T$ at the table behind me and wait staff had to hoist trays over our heads as they squeezed past us again and again .\n- The Material this Pro is made out of seems a lot nicer than any PC Specs : Like I said this $T$ a lot better than any computer I 've had in the past .\n- $T$ are close , so you better be comfortable bumping elbows with other patrons .\n- Not sure how I recommend it for quality $T$ , as I have a desktop rig for that reason .\n- Each table has a pot of boiling water sunken into its surface , and you get platters of thin sliced meats , various $T$ , and rice and glass noodles .\n- The $T$ is solicitous and friendly and always seems glad to see us , and the food is wonderful , if not stunningly creative .\n- $ 160 for 2 $T$ , 2 sides , an appetizer and drinks .\n- Bigger HD , better $T$ , and a bid HD .\n- The real stand out on this computer is the feel of the keyboard and it 's $T$ .\n- The drinks are always welll made and wine selection is fairly $T$ .\n- If you go to Roth 's try to be $T$ by Mike , he is GREAT !!\n- The $T$ and staff go to great lengths to make you feel comfortable .\n- Saturday , Nov. 6th I had a group from work come in with about 35 people and the $T$ was amazing to accomodate us .\n- I work in film editing and post production , so I need a laptop that not only has power , but $T$ and speed as well .\n- It 's charmingly small and that leads to an $T$ that is extremely cozy and romantic , even .\n- I like Mamoun 's $T$ as well , but side by side , Kati Rolls just produce tastier food hands down .\n- The $T$ is among the best .\n- of course my $T$ runs out next month .\n- An oasis of refinement : Food , though somewhat uneven , often reaches the pinnacles of new American fine cuisine - chef 's passion -LRB- and $T$ 's precise execution -RRB- is most evident in the fish dishes and soups .\n- The $T$ , however , is a peg or two below the quality of food -LRB- horrible bartenders -RRB- , and the clientele , for the most part , are rowdy , loud-mouthed commuters -LRB- this could explain the bad attitudes from the staff -RRB- getting loaded for an AC/DC concert or a Knicks game .\n\n英語で5-10単語程度で、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない主要な違いを簡潔に回答してください。\n\n回答：\n",
