Ref is really bad.\n- Ok, I will take this with a pinch of salt, but take it into consideration nonetheless. Thanks.\n- Yeah you're right. That's the problem. Not guys thinking it's ok to message someone they haven't matched with outside of Tinder.\n- Yeah. Unless you live in a desert, ditch the scarcity mindset. It can keep you in relationships that aren't any good.\n- unplanned pregnancy != rape Not commenting on the beings involved in the story up above, but seriously those two things are not equivalent\n- Agree on the last point. My INTP friend's ENFP is immature since she's still young. Gets jealous at every damn girl that approaches... Sigh\n- Dude it was an old video. Your porn math is way off.\n- Yah he is right, just find it hypocritical.\n- Thats true. Those kinds of drinks can give you a heart attack.\n- This looks more like 1954.\n- Yeah, it is for the organizers\n- Of course there are a lot of people who think feminism and diversity are bad.\n- I can easily relate to that as well. The siblings are the ones who will stick with us for the whole journey to the very end.\n- Not an effective solution. Shooter always has first move, taking out an unsuspecting teacher would give a shooter access to better arms.\n- Reddit is so right wing I can’t even believe it\n- Doesn't matter if we stop, everyone else will do it. You're telling a whole world looks don't matter, yah good luck.\n- I think a budget PHD or DNP would cost me 35k so not happening.\n- man this gif is weird both directions\n- i'm not that into shower sex tho. like it's fun sometimes, but it takes me so long to get off when i'm wet.\n- Destroyed property is the same as lynching someone for their race.\n- If an addict gets clean of booze/drugs, you congratulate them! What a horrible crabbycrab to try to shut down someone who got their addiction under control.\n- And whatever car he buys MUST have a strong Air Conditioning system. This is an absolute MUST here.\n- I’m interested!\n- 36 and definitely not what I used to be... still ok though!!!\n- One day you should go get that donut! Personally, life wouldn’t be worth living if I couldn’t occasionally enjoy a gourmet donut 🍩 \n- All I know is everyone is Tuscaloosa considers this season an abysmal failure.\n- I totally agree with you, I just wish she hadn't tossed his sweater away :(\n- He looks like that one guy\n- I totally would tbh. He's a very handsome man.\n- The economy is heavily controlled and subsidized by the government. In any case, I was poking at the lack of nuance in US politics today\n- Peaky Blinders is the shit. I don't understand how there isn't more hype around this show.\n- Booty matters MUCH more in my opinion\n- Yes he is a hard worker for sure. Just wish he could get his shot back on track.\n- the ancap ideology has spread to birds now. Our numbers grow stronger every day😂\n- I would have to agree. He acts for himself and wants revenge but also cares for and respects life so, chaotic neutral.\n- Lol no.\n- Sounds like you might need some time out in the re-education camp. You are getting frighteningly close to realizing that our system is designed to keep you imprisoned.\n- Yeah, that will reduce the number of kids taking pills - make enjoying a drink at a festival even more difficult!\n- Unfortunately not.\n- Getting AB for anything less than a 2nd rounder + something else definitely isn't realistic.\n- I’ve done pajamas before but I think sweatpants would be way too thick\n- I find that telling the truth as much as possible makes things less complicated. I've learned to spin the truth when needed, though.\n- Same boat here, man.\n- It doesn’t really change anything, just side with your preference \n- Because most shit right wingers say is so awful that if they said it in a space where they weren't anonymous they would be fucking done\n- I don't think any [RELIGION] woman would care about such a thing. If they did then they have their own problems.\n- Man. Really bad last possession there. Bummer.\n- I don't like this gif and that makes me a [NAME] supporter? My argument has not once brought him up. You are an insidious liar.\n- Oh interesting username\n- The coolest of beans my friend\n- They didn't even spell his actor's name correctly...\n- Yeah I've become extremely cynical since I started making these sorts of realizations.\n- Ya it would suck good luck too you and your family man 👨✌️👍👍👍🤜\n- Ok dude!\n- If everyone else can figure this out, then I don't see why it's so implausible for the US.\n- There's DOJ guidelines that he cannot be indicted.\n- As a BMW owner, I don't understand what this meme is even talking about.\n- honestly, individually he's been awful so far.\n- No it doesn't work like that you're wrong\n- You need to look in the mirror if you going to say that [NAME] is overrated yet want to trade him for scrubs like Dedmon\n- Definitely, I'd do that. The league pass deal isn't awful though.\n- So, that's super illegal in the U.S. And a cooler is not worth slicing someone's finger tips open. \n- Hmmm I dont think I listen to only [NAME] if I last checked. These arent INTP playlists they're just playlists I like as an INTP\n- Born and raised in New Britain. Love these sodas.\n- to be fair it wouldnt be bad living there since its normal to have giant shoes so its a win basically^^\n- It seems like the problem predates the current administration, which makes me think it has more institutional roots.\n- Not offended just dont care to debate over game development or how long it takes 🤷🏽‍♂️ lol you win sir\n- I thought that too, but I was wrong. And I know that full health is 170.\n- I dont think anyone said it would make the game better, it won't, but it certainly won't make the game any worse either \n- Jazz fan here. I completely feel. [NAME] cousins has more votes than [NAME], and [NAME] hasn't even stepped on the court this year\n- Ok so this doesn't seem like a cover given they made a whole comp for him\n- Couldn’t agree more\n- I agree I think they hyped it up\n- Didn't realize they were shipping the challenge coins with Israeli FAL rifles, that makes this whole thing even weirder.\n- Yeah, but I just don't want to pay for a full blown wedding, those can get expensive.\n- It would actually make me more comfortable if someone did that to me\n- I agree a million percent. People on this sub are way too emotional about ghosting in early stage dating.\n- I have and it didn't help. It's only a matter of time now for how long I can hold on.\n- If this is a medical situation the analogy still applies 🙄\n- This hurts to hear because we know it's true. There are 16 year olds who have experienced more than me.\n- Long hair for guys should happen more, it looks cool *and feels nice too*\n- You shouldn't be using hydrocortisone on your face:\n- You could be right!\n- As someone else has mentioned it is not theft technically. So that will probably only cause more problems for myself.\n- I would not recommend water panties, you might find things a bit squishy! ;)\n- In that case you're very welcome to call your representative and tell them to agree to a bill which would reopen the government. Or tweet the president.\n- Pretty much same. It’s always me who has to change. I’m the one wrong.\n- All of Disney is cringey. It needs to be stopped\n- He sounds like a real piece of work. Get him gone and live your life free of his physical and mental burden.\n- We don't deserves horses\n- Yeah I just googled that, I still wouldn't call them my favourite restaurant but its cheap!\n- I don’t want everybody to live the same way as me, I just wanted to express the stupidity of it.\n- I did not post this. I really do find it funny tho\n- 1 5v5 goal in 2 months is not good anyway you spin it. But pleasure being downvoted by you, enjoy believing in WAR \n- Yes its absolutely freeing! And so pure :) Aaah my heart\n- Absolutely not! If religions didn’t exist on this planet, we would be a far more advanced society.\n- You should like a troll.
