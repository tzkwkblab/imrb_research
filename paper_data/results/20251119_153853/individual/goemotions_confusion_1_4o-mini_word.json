Looks like an Israeli Galil but I'm not sure.\n- Are you retarded?\n- It's also surprising that Valve released a dud game. Maybe it's time for Valve to grow up and introduce themselves to the digital communication age?\n- >US isn't a de facto dictatorship Not sure anyone has told [NAME] that to be honest\n- in many cases both. but this has nothing to do with Japan.

That Magnesium supplement is doing its job methinks\n- deleted ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.1122 ^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?\n- What does all that pill shit they talk about mean anyways? Like what the fuck is a black pill and a red pill?\n- What country have you move to?\n- why is this being downvoted?\n- I think it can be good, bad, and everything in between.

The gel is just gelatin.\n- Where do you think the [NAME] came from, before they arrived in Spain?\n- She said she was ok moving out ... now she isn’t.
