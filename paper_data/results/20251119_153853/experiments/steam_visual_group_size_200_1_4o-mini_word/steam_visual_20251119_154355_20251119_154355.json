      "An amazing game, you can go from doing great and having a full and maxed level crew, and end up fighting the wrong guy as they systematically destroy your ship systems leaving your weapons and shields off-line as your crew burns to death while suffocating.

      "I only have 3 hours in this game but I can say it ain't worth £45. Graphics are trying to look cool but just look crap. Glitched unit textures. Runs well doesn't crash but I just hate the changes from the old total war games. Unit icons look crap I can't tell what is what. My general dies there are no notifications. Can't find how much ammo archers have. No tutorial at all. Tried attacking a tier 1 settlement only to lose everything to the towers. I'd rather play rome 2. I really hate the general idea, the fact that any old general can rock up and kill 600 men is stupid.",
      "Most of the negative reviews cover my complaints already. So I won't rehash the ones I've already read. \n\nHere's my biggest complaints: \n\n- Jumpscares have never been compelling to me. Doubly so on VR. Are you trying to injure me in my computer room? Stop. \n\n- Guns are fun. Not having ammo for them is not fun. (The game is pretty generous with ammo but it also encourages tediously conservative behavior, if you just unload clips at shit you'll run out pretty fast) \n\n- \"Continuous Turning\" feels so bad. Like, how can I turn my headset and everything looks smooth as butter, but as soon as I use the look stick for turning suddenly it's all choppy and looks wrong? I'm familiar with some of the motion sickness issues people get with turning in VR games, but this isn't that... \n\n\nThough honestly it seems like they just leaned really into the whole horror thing, which is fine, but also just super not my thing. \n\nIf the mechanics and some design choices had been better I might have slogged through it anyway. \n\n\nGame's beautiful, though, so they got that going for them.",

      "I am a 43 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he helped me. Loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.\nThank you <3",
      "Early Access Review:\nPros: \n- Hilarious flavor text in the form of Books and Proverbs. Seriously, someone took a lot of time creating all that.\n- Really enjoyable music\n- Beautiful pixel art\n- Engaging and interesting story\n- Overall very fun introduction to a huge world\n- Highly responsive dev team that's not only advacing on completion of the game but actively listens to their already large community of players\n- There's a lot of secrets and things to do that you might run out of time to do before the end of the year deadline. You may find yourself needing to play the early access a few times to find everything.\n\nCons:\n- This is early access folks, there's going to be a few bugs here and there\n- The early access content ramps up really fast and gets very interesting and then ends with you really wanting to know what's next. This is really only a con because I'm really impatient and want the full game asap. ;)",
      "I would recommend ARK only in 1 specific case – you have a group of friends and will play on a private/local server. You get to enjoy the game at your own pace, with modified server multipliers, without the worry of PvP and server-dominating tribes. Graphics are great, the world is beautiful, lots of cool dinos to tame. There’s a lot to do, to build, to explore, to figure out.\n\nBut playing on a large PvP server is horrible experience. You are at a mercy of alpha tribes that have everything and can do anything. Slow progression, server wipes, laggy combat, so much grinding to catch up just to have your base destroyed while offline. Maybe you could find some servers where all this is more balanced but even then, it just becomes a game of who can grind more. It’s just not something I would ever recommend.",
      "No matter what the reviews say, this game is pretty excellent.\nGameplay wise its pretty good, the match 3 systems are fun and almost exciting to play at times.\nTheres no sex, which isn't a bad thing as if thats what you're looking for just search for it online lol\nThe stories are good and the designs are pretty, sure it's short but it fits the pricepoint.\n\nThe developers have announced that they've gone bankrupt which is a shame but what can you do.\n\nOverall 8/10",
      "I have a serious love/hate relationship with Sea of Thieves. It is both one of the best games I have ever played and one of the most frustrating games I have ever played, all wrapped into one. The gameplay of Sea of Thieves is INCREDIBLE. The sailing is the best in any game I have ever played. The feeling of exploration and discovery as you blast through treasure hunts and puzzles and mysteries is unlike any feeling you can get from any other game. The cooking mechanic, the healing from food, the not-terrible fishing mechanic... all subsystems that prop up the rest of the gameplay are unique and interesting in their own right. The land-based combat is relatively uninspired, yet still satisfying when part of the greater picture that the game presents. Some of my favorite memories in gaming, full stop, come from completing long nights on the high seas or doing long-form content available in the game. The game is gorgeous, some of the best ocean/water graphics in any game. The rest of the game is equally beautiful while perfectly conveying the environment of the map you are in. I swear to Gaben that I can freaking smell the wet sand or sulfurous lava on some of these islands. The music and sound design are some of the best in the industry. Outright, the game is incredible. \n\nBUT... Sea of Thieves sweaties ruin the game for me. There is absolutely nothing worse than having a night full of fun absolutely destroyed by some player who's enjoyment of the game is derived from eliminating anyone else's fun. I understand that PvP is part of the \"pirate life\", but it is by far the worst part of the game by far. I would be willing to pay money, hell a freaking monthly subscription, for the opportunity to play SoT as a strictly PvE game with just my friends and the rest of the server populated by bots. I actively avoid playing the game now because of how many of my last play sessions started with me spawning at an outpost and subsequently being sunk less than 15 feet off the dock by some sweaty that hasn't seen sunlight since the Obama administration. I know that this is an incredibly unpopular opinion in the greater SoT-sphere, but part of the enjoyment of games is letting players enjoy them how they wish, and I really freaking wish that I could enjoy the aspects of SoT that are fun to me without being the plaything of those pirates who live only to ruin the fun of others.",
      "Write a review they said.. alright.. here it is... \n\nI am at year 5, day 29, Population 250, its winter right now in my little village.. my vikings are freezing, but they should not be. I have stores of coal available to them but they just do not go get it. \n\non a scale of 1 - 10, right now.. a solid solid 7. Why just a 7, well.. its new.. its not finished yet.. and still a tiny bit buggy. \n\nGameplay. It's good.. but i would really like to be able to grab the map with a left click hold and drag it around that way. The camera movement when trying to move the map is slow.. too slow for me. Also the fact that you have to clear whatever you have selected before you can selected the next thing you want to build. \n\nGraphics... VERY nice.. love it.. everything has great detail. People walking really nicely. Now for the not great part.. zoom in on a fishing boat.. boats moving.. oars. well.. they are not moving, I think I have even seen a fisherperson sleeping in the boat as well.. little more on the animations will probably be inserted at a later time.. but I thought it humorous, People also do tend to walk right into the side of a mountain and vanish.. then poof.. they walk back out at another area. \n\nHousing:  Great looks on both the poor and good housing. the option to just upgrade from poor to good would be nice.. \n\nStorage: Storage needs some work.. seriously.. So you have the Wood storage and you have stone storage.. they are basicly the same looking building.. I'd like to see them combined, with that being said.. please add COAL and IRON as well. Make it so that we can set whats to be stored in that building and make it have workers.. that way we can have dedicated vikings move the specific stuff.. \n\nWater: Please allow the area of coverage to overlap.. OR. make the coverage a square so we can fully cover the areas.\n\nFOOD: You gave us these great fields to use. But um.. can we grow something other than wheat and barley? like. potatoes? carrots? I mean, the vikings didn't only eat meat and bread?(but i am also aware the games still in progress)\n\nThe only real issue I have had with the game so far on my system is I was spending point on the tree and when I went back to the village it was gone and I had to reload. I do know once in a while a reload will fix the workers from gathering resources but it doesn't always work.\n\nSo over all I really enjoy this game. I'd definitely recommend  this game to anyone who enjoys city building survival type game. \n\nHope everyone enjoys this game...",
      "My previous review reflected the terrible state of the game as it was on launch day. After years of improvements, the game has had its map design & cover placement tweaked, pretty-boy playermodels have been dirtied up, cringy voicelines were adjusted & a bunch of new content has been added. A lot of my complaints were addressed and I recognize the amount of work the team has done to bring the game back. It finally feels content complete and has reached an acceptable level of quality that should've been there when it came out.\n\nHowever, I am still disappointed to say it falls very short of its predecessors in terms of gameplay, map design and atmosphere. I see no reason to play this instead of BF3/BF4. \n\nPlay the map Grand Bazaar in Battlefield 3. Look at all of the particle effects, post processing and detail that map has. It has such a thick rainy atmosphere. Play it through to the end and you'll see how players tear up the map and make it look destroyed. In BF4's Paracel Storm, the foliage will sway & the waves will rise as the strong winds of a storm approaches the map. Watch as a sandstorm creeps up in Gulf of Oman and eventually engulfs it in a torrent of chaos. These landscapes have so much drama that the ones in 2042 lack. Sure, there are sandstorms and tornadoes, but they still look so sterile compared to the previous games this title stands upon.\n\nConceptually, 2042's world is supposed to be on its knees. The growing reality of extreme climate, natural disasters becoming commonplace and the world powers fighting over the last resources Earth has to offer depicts a dire situation to immerse ourselves in. This makes me imagine maps where earthquakes adjust the layout of flags throughout the round, or tsunamis roll in and what once was a playable area is now flooded. Giant tornado events that tear down skyscrapers. Sandstorms that turn the widest of maps into a close-quarters brawl. \n\nThe maps in the game have some aspects of this concept but nowhere to the amount that it should. The technology is there. The previous games have had a genuinely impressive level of immersion and atmosphere. 2042 did not have this on launch and it still doesn't. This could have been the wild natural disaster Battlefield game where we see SHTF.\n\nI don't care that we have 128 player matches or goofy butt specialists to play as. They missed the mark with 2042 and no update can fix that, conceptually, it never was able to realize its potential.",

      "[h1]Technology[/h1]\nThe game is (was?) awfully poorly optimized.\nI don't think this game looks good enough for the hardware it requires. Some old RTS games looked similar to this title but required much less to run (I am referencing how the technology is better but the \"PC to FPS\" ratio has gone downhills).\n\nI understand that calculating AI choices and the simulation take a lot of resources, but this is not a game with a few thousand AI players like e.g. EU4 is. This is a relatively small map with just some AI players. This game also does not look that much better than some other RTS/TBS titles and I had FPS issues even with the lowest settings.\n\nI first ran this title with R9 280, so a quite old GPU, but that GPU was fully capable of running many decently modern games. This is IMO unacceptable, the developer can't optimize the game, and releases poorly coded product. I tested different graphic settings and noticed nearly no differences in the framerate.\n\nI then upgraded my PC to the top AM4 CPU and a very new GPU card (6600XT, overclocked) and the game ran fine on the highest settings, but I would not call it super smooth. All the other games run perfectly.\nElden Ring, Baldurs Gate 3, Cyberpunk (absolutely 0 issues in Cyberpunk). I would say CA messed up their game and didn't care to optimize it.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThe game is rather decent, it's enjoyable and has a connection to the lore of Warhammer.\nYou can't say a bad word about the general RTS mechanics, the battles and whatever. Just a normal RTS...\n\nIt just isn't the greatest RTS/TBS. Compared to Heroes of Might and Magic 3, or titles like let's say Cossacks, Age of Empires, or maybe Supreme Commander... It is unique in the Total War way, but given the amount of games in the series, it's ... not unique really (I have seen everything this game offers in different titles over the years).\n\nJust a giant simulation with a surprising lack of mechanics for an RTS game (as in economic aspect, diplomacy, map tactics. I think Europa Universalis IV is a good example of a really advanced tactics model in an RTS/TBS game and Civ 6 would be a great example of map design/economics). I personally don't like the maps for real-time battles. These maps seem quite crude and the skirmishes are badly designed.\n\nIn order to inflict maximum casualties you would need to kill every single unit. It should be enough that you break the enemy and automatically win. It's also quite unbalanced. Depending on what you kill first the results can wildly vary (including the AI acting much differently every time and the proposed outcomes of auto-resolved battles are just unhinged).\n\n I probably would like this game more without the \"real-time\" battles, but I assume it's the \"Total War\" way. To me it's time intensive and just not interesting. I liked Warhammer 40k's battles much more. They felt more tactical. Placement of units in this game does matter, but I had more fun playing The Battle for Middle Earth 15 years ago than this. I think the units panic too quickly and the characters don't matter enough.\n\nIt's the closest to the HoMM in terms of map and characters, however it lacks many things that made HoMM great (like tailored character development with meaningful spells and ability to recruit units, find artifacts on the map etc). The cities feel kind of empty, the mechanics are rather poorly described/introduced and just weird for an RTS (for my liking). \n\nI am not sure why there is so little care about the main characters. It would be very cool to build them up, be able to find artifacts on the map (besides the Sword of Khaine, that's just one item) and do something else than just advance some skills in the skill tree. Even if you invest your time in them then they can be sieged and just die.\n\nI also don't like some mechanics, for example the corruption, or slaves (they are not much intuitive. I think they should create clearer GUI and work on the general set of game rules, rather than make every faction different but also following totally different rules. Are we supposed to compete in a campaign and how if we follow different rules?). \nSome game prompts are meant to \"help\" learning the game, but they not always load up and they also don't explain small logos (traits) of the units, it's pretty useless. You need to use web browser anyway. Why to bother?\nIn that aspect - I think the designers totally messed up the UI/UX.\n\n21st August 2023 update: I played Baldur's Gate 3 and imagine they paid enough of work to actually make icons explain the traits of characters or items, amazing is it not? Seems to be lack of care. Every single icon in BG3 is fully explained. I could learn the game's rules and effectively build my characters.\n\n[h1]Genre[/h1]\nThe game is pretty fine, it gives some fun when playing it. Feels like Warhammer I guess? I personally am more of the 40k fan, but a game in the old universe is making lots of sense and the character design with world design are high quality.\n\n[h1] Summary (what made me dump this game also) [/h1]\nThe character design is quite impressive and it seems that they cared about the \"vibe\", but the game is just a money grab. why are there 3 game titles instead of one? What is the main improvement in between all of these titles?\nEach one of them has dozens of DLCs. An average person surely won't spend 300$ just to play more factions.\n\nWhat angered me so much I stopped playing after the purchase:\nThe publisher releases a paid product that claims to have free DLCs - some of them are, but the most important one isn't, and without it the game has got only 50% functionality and feels like a demo.\nRTS game without skirmish mode or some kind of \"do whatever\" mode is a meme. This isn't a DnD campaign board (and ironically such a campaign would allow for much more than selection of 5 heroes on one map lol), but an RTS in a specific universe.\n\nEvery normal RTS game has got a skirmish/free play mode (The Battle for the Middle-earth, Command and Conquer, Supreme Commander, Cossacks, Starcraft. Like every single RTS EVER) and this is especially filthy when you proclaim to release FREE functionality for the title, but then the player gets informed that they must buy TWO titles (WH1 and WH2) to get functionalities in the one they wanted to expand. Such a money grab, and even then the game is still locked behind micro-transactions/DLCs. I wanted to play a game, not donate to the \"poor\" publisher in 10 different ways. If the publisher wants money then they can sell better games.\n\nAwfully lot of DLCs, that don't add many things into the game. The base game doesn't feel like a game, but a rather Free to Play game account, that has 80% of content locked. Choosing from like 4 factions, especially in a game which varies so wildly depending on the faction (the factions aren't meant to be following any common rules it seems).\n\nWhat I also dislike is the publisher urging you to create an account to claim some of the \"free\" DLCs - the purpose is to collect data, and force you into their own website I assume (to raise statistics and show it to the management?). Why bother releasing game on Steam if you can't offer free DLCs to Steam users? I don't want your stupid 3rd party website.\n\nI don't recommend this game. I like Warhammer, but CA is a terrible company. I updated this review and in the meantime there have been at least a few different internet dramas with them involved.\n\nI would personally rather pay 70$ to a company that cares and provides a fun product (e.g. Lorian), than a DLC-locked tech demo... that \"stock\" Warhammer sure is.",
      "Great game! At times it can get frustrating (boss battles), but the good out weighs the bad by a landslide. Even when i did get mad, which was a lot, I never stayed mad for long. There is just far too much to enjoy about the game. The art style is just simply amazing, the movement of your character around the world is just so satisfying once you get used to it, the puzzles aren't too easy or too hard, and everything in the game just goes together pretty much perfectly. All in all this game is extremely well made. Would recommend buying if you want a super unique experience 11/10",
      "Did you like the first two chapters?\nWell, here we have everything and tons of new and improved things, like the 2nd chapter did with regards to the first one (which was awesome, but quite simple gameplay-wise).\nA classical turn-based strategy game, now more polished than ever with wave-like combats and tons of units to start with, to upgrade and well, we don't even have real classes here - more correctly, each hero is a class on its own and has different abilities and such.\nThe story follows always the same one-way saga and you'll have to make lots of choices determining your fate, your battles and so on; the graphics are the most beautiful I've ever seen here and the soundtrack is quite amazing and atmospheric too.\nYou'll have also many features like arena combat, and a great history re-telling if you don't remember the first two chapters, plus a great tutorial to start with even if you're not new to the series and the genre.\nIt's quite fundamental if you're a little bit interested in this awesome story to play the other chapters - here in fact we'll start with all the old heroes, all the story right back from the caravan that reached Arberrang.\nWe're basically reviewing one of the best strategy tactical turn-based role-playing games of the last 5-10 years and I won't add more than this, it has already thousands of reviews and mine is quite useless I think. \nLots of endings, lots of characters to explore and promote, lots of weapons, accessories, modes.. we have everything. Recommended to anyone (maybe with a little discount).",
      "Wow, talk about a disappointment. I was really excited to check out \"ASU Global\" but it's clear that the developers didn't put much effort into it. From the glitchy login process to the lack of translation and sound effects, it's clear that this game is a rushed, poorly executed mess. And to top it off, it's just a generic mobile Korean port. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one. It's not worth the hassle.",
      "I have a hard time recommending this game because even though I liked it, I know it's the kind of thing that can only appeal to a very small demographic :/ Anyway, I believe small devs who try weird things deserve all the exposure they can get, so here's a review. This is the second episode of a series (the first one can be found [url=https://etherane.itch.io/hello-charlotte-ep1]here[/url] - it's free - and the last one is [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/760890/Hello_Charlotte_Childhoods_End/]on Steam[/url]). It's recommended to play them in order unless you don't want to understand anything in a story that's already pretty confusing in itself.\n\n+ Very original visuals. The artwork is mostly composed of cute characters, but there are writhing masses of eyes and flesh everywhere (guro fans rejoice). Areas are arranged into colorful, geometrical patterns similar to Mondrian's paintings.\n\n+ The setting is extremely strange. It's definitely dystopian, but it can go from completely silly to incredibly tragic in a matter of seconds.\n\n+ Production values increase with each episode. I wasn't very impressed with the first game (apart from its artwork, which I loved, and its ending, which... opened interesting possibilities), but starting from this one the writing gets way better, the characters are more developed, and the gameplay feels more focused.\n\n+ - Hello Charlotte is more or less Trigger Warning Land. This series is among the most disturbing things I have ever played, and it's not because of the omipresent gore (most of it being used for aesthetics or comedy instead of shock value). It deals with heavy themes (mental illness, social pressure, bullying, suicide, the value of life and death - from what I could gather, a lot of these come from the author's personal experience) and it felt so suffocating sometimes I had to play in short bursts to give me time to recover. I note this as both a positive and a negative, since I consider games that can make me uncomfortable are valuable - but don't play this if you're not sure you can handle it.\n\n- The gameplay mostly consists of going back and forth to the same locations, and can sometimes feel tedious. Sadly I don't really think this can be improved unless the game is changed into a full visual novel, but it would mean losing the environments.\n\n8/10 It's a weird game made for weird people.",
      "very well made cant stop playing. only complaint is keyboard set up and i get that the game says play with controller but thats not an option for me but the keys are all over the place r select upgrade e to reroll f to chat with npc r to enter their shop its like that for everything and you cant change the keybinds for UI stuff i wish it was just e to interact its all over the place and i find my self still miss typing things. if you buy the game use a controller \n",
      "Melatonin is a simple rhythm game, with a focus on ease of gameplay and calmer sounds.\nIf you're expecting something on the tougher or more upbeat side, this ain't it.  Ironically, I had more fun as I stopped focusing on scoring well, and more fun when I was just feeling the music and half-asleep.  The sounds and songs are quite relaxing lol.\n\nOn the shorter side of games, it still delivers an enjoyable experience in what it offers. The timing is a *little* on the forgiving side, and there are even accessibility options if you need a little more help, such as timing circles, metronome, and a bigger Perfect window.  If you'd rather go for a challenge, a Perfect only option is also available.\n\nControls are quite simple, using [strike]4[/strike] 3 directional keys and an action key (Space by default). In each tutorial, you're told whether you'll need to hit directional keys or the action key, and whether they're held or not, as well as general timing.  For some stages, the instructions don't give you as good an idea as the tutorial itself/timing circles do (Work and Time levels for me).  All good, but in some levels you get tempo changes in the middle of the song that can throw you a bit off, especially if you're just grooving to the audio cues... when you can hear and distinguish them.  Unfortunately, there are a few levels where the audio cues are either far too similar to each other, or happen too quickly to react to.  This can be a bit of a bummer, as I prefer working off audio for rhythm games, as their focus should be lol.  \n\nWhile Melatonin doesn't bring a whole lot to the table, it doesn't need to.  Less is more here, and the art and sound direction definitely hit their target.\nRelax.",

Which it kinda is, but in some points it maybe isnt.\n\nThis first section of the review doesnt contain any major spoilers for the story, just a comment on the overall progress through the game stages.\nAt the time of writing this review, I played the game for ~ 35 hours, I have advanced quite a bit. The first few hours were fantastic, I was looking for new things to explore, the blueprints for all the stuff that I need and every new thing felt like I made a progress. But then at a certain point nothing new happend. It seemed to me like I had all resources I could ever need (even the blue crystals), I had all the vehicles you could build, all the upgrades I needed.\nAnd then there was no challenge anymore. You build your submarines, your bases and the game gets too easy, its not a challenge anymore. Don't continue reading after this point, if you havent played the game yet.\n\n[spoiler] The big strength of this game is the immersion in the seemingly endless underwater worlds. But at a certain point this immersion breaks (at least it did for me).\nNone of the monsters can really harm you, not even the biggest ones are a real threat. Just hop into you seamoth and out-speed everything. If there is a leviathan, just hug the walls or strave, they cant catch you. And if they do, just step out, repair your ship and continue. None of the threats is really dangerous. You really need to have bad luck to die. And if you do ... nothing happens. You just respawn.\nAt first the map seems endless, since you cant move fast. But once you get the seamoth, the map is very finite. Sure, there are deeper levels you cant access with the moth, but everything on the surface is within reach. Its the same with the deeper levels and the prawnsuit.\nSurvival is hard at first, since you constantly need to get water and food. Once you can plant you own food, you have unlimited supply and the survival aspect becomes just an annoyence.\n\nAnother thing that bothers me is the amount of resources you need to build stuff. In the later part of the game you need to build a giant structure. But the necessary resources are just like \"get 3 wooden planks, 2 nails and a hammer\". And with these resources you build the statue of liberty.\n\nMy last point is about the storyline. After something like 15 hours into the game there was a major stall for me - I had no clue where to go, to me it seemed like I searched everything I had access to at that time. I searched for 10 hours and found nothing. I went to the Islands twice to check if I missed anything, but no. I dont know, maybe I just had bad luck and something didnt trigger right, I missed a hint somewhere or something. It eventually went on, but on that point I already had the big submarine, the prawnsuit and everything. The story felt like I just need to run from A to B and back, there was no challenge anymore. \n [/spoiler]\n\nSo anyways. If you made it this far in the review, thanks for reading. If you disagree with me, thats totally fine for me. I don't want to ruin the game for anyone, maybe the points that bother me dont mean much to you.\nI know that my critique is pretty harsh. There are many positive aspects in this game. If you can really dive into this game and fully roleplay it, submerge in its story and ignore some flaws, this is a fantastic game.\nBut maybe some of you are like me, so some of my mentioned points could bother you too.\nThanks for reading, I hope I didnt butcher the English language too badly, feel free to comment, if you like.",
      "Ok to make it short.\n\n- Poor graphics (like 10 years old PC game)\nBUT nothing more to complain about.\n\n- great atmosphere, great story, very good fighting mechanics. Of course great price.\n\nIf you have nothing against japan style - just play the game. One of funniest games in some years for me.",
      "Dark Soul Combat System without health bar, and a better Romantic story than Twilight.\nLooks a lot like Agony trailer thought. Badass Bosses.

      "Oh man. Where to even begin with this one. It would be an extreme disservice to simply call Arma 3 a shooter, as it is so, so much more than that. Arma 3 is a military simulator. This is a distinction that it’s developers hold sacred and are proud of, and one to which I can attest is completely accurate and deserved. But it’s even more than that. Arma 3 is a gaming platform, upon which so much has already been and will continue to be built for years to come. \n\nAt its core though, Arma 3 in a supremely excellent military sim. The graphics are stunning, the gameplay is excellent, the mechanics are solid, and Bohemia Interactive has done an absolutely amazing job packaging this all together. New comers to the Arma series (as I was) may initially be overwhelmed by the game’s complex mechanics and decidedly different pace from your typical FPS/shooter. Enemy engagements happen at much greater distance than is typical in the genre and are often brief, brutal, and more times than not will conclude with your demise. There is no handholding here. No mini-maps, no enemy UI icons/indicators, no hit markers, no health bars. If you get shot a couple of times, you will find yourself unceremoniously dispatched. While this creates a high barrier for entry and a steep learning curve for new players, it provides a unique and distinctive play style. Situational awareness, cover, teamwork, suppressive fire, and generally moving purposefully and as if your ass depended on knowing what was behind the next ridge or hiding in the bushes are paramount to your success. Add to these infantry mechanics the amazingly rendered vehicles, armor, helicopters, and planes, each with their own realistic mechanics to learn and master, and you end up with a truly amazing military simulation experience. \n\nOut of the box, Arma comes with a great single player campaign comprised of 3 separate acts, each containing ~12-15 missions. The campaign focuses on a well crafted story of a military conflict that has erupted over Arma 3’s two HUGE islands of Stratis and Altis. You play the part of a NATO soldier who finds himself stuck in the middle of a complex engagement. The campaign is rewarding, and challenging. (I have yet to complete it as I’m stuck on one mission that I simply can’t seem to complete.)\n\nHowever the single-player campaign is FAR from the end of this title. The mission editing tools have allowed this amazing community to develop some absolutely awesome single player missions, all of which can be downloaded free of charge from the Steam workshop and numerous other sites around the interwebs. I would also recommend you check out the supremely excellent full game conversion single player mods Whole Lotta Altis and Dynamic Universal War System which will provide countless additional single player hours and could be completely stand alone titles in themselves.\n\nOh and the multiplayer, oh god the multiplayer. Wasteland, King of the Hill, Invade and Annex, Battle Royale, Breaking Point, so many Co-Op opportunities, the amazing looking upcoming Epoch (currently in closed Alpha). I’m sure there are so many others that I haven’t even discovered yet. Each of these represent COMPLETELY USER GENERATED and totally disparate ways to play Multiplayer within the Arma 3 platform. By purchasing Arma 3, you immediately have access to each of these completely gratis and each could essentially be considered totally separate game.\n\nIn wrapping up this lengthy review, Arma 3 is an amazing experience and a true accomplishment in game development. It is the only game in recent memory that I can say with confidence that I never get bored with playing. Bohemia Interactive has made it clear that they plan to support this game for years to come, and they have built something amazing on which the possibilities are truly endless.  \n\nPurchase this game. Purchase it now. Thank me later. \n\n(IF YOU DO NOT FIND MY REVIEW HELPFUL, please leave a comment as to why. I welcome the constructive feedback.)",
      "It may not be that similar to what most people are familiar with, as a building game, but in most every sense which counts, I believe this is the greatest building game I have ever played.\n\nThe controls are smooth, the Building Mechanics are smooth, the interplay of cuteness and silliness is so smooth, and Lillian has the cutest face in the known universe.\n\nTruly a fantastic game with enjoyable and concise mechanics, the Block Grid is as malleable as Minecraft (except that some areas cannot be mined, usually story quest locations), the ally AI is more involved than Conan (sitting at a table with Rosie to gobble some greens? cute), and the combat is slightly dangerous at first, but mostly very mellow and not in any way detrimental to the building side (the villagers even fix up the damage done to your village in story battles - at least in the 'tutorial' island).\n\nMy only advices:\n\n- If the Camera is too tight on you and too slow to zoom out, switch perspective and back, if that doesn't work, look down at the ground and jump a couple times! (your head will push the camera up into the sky faster)\n\n- Don't get too creative on Furrowfield Farm! I spent a lot of time building and customising, being slightly annoyed at the small build area of the island, but now I discover that the whole thing was essentially a tutorial, and that completing the story missions there opened up the game in a much bigger way. Now I am back on the home Island and am able to build across a much larger area. If you're still in Furrowfield, you basically haven't started the game yet, so get that story done!\n\n- IF YOU SUFFER FROM REGULAR COMPUTER OR PROGRAMME CRASHES:\nWhen loading a Game you can press (A) / (X) on Controller to Copy the Save File and Back it up on one of the other Save Slots. I recommend doing this every day you play in case of  Corrupted Save Data caused by Crashing while Sailing to another Island.\n\nI am tempted to give this game a 9/10 - which is a serious seal of approval from me. Even on my strictest day, I would never give it less than a 7 - it is fun, cute, silly, serious, touching, exciting, and above all else, architexcellent!",
      "[h1] Brief summary of why the Chinese players are so pissed: [/h1]\n\nThe reason for the chinese players to absolutely despise the third party modding website is that the \"official modding\" was promised to be released over a year ago, but kept getting delayed. When it finally got released, everyone felt betrayed because it was a garbage third party website with so many restrictions.\n\nBut the reason why the game is still getting review bombed is the [b] developer's initial response [/b] to the first round of complaints. The team was dead silent for about 2 weeks, no comments about all the fiasco, yet people that were complaining about the modding on the chinese forums got their accounts banned left and right. Thats why many resorted to steam review bombing, and almost as soon as the steam review tanked, the developer came out and said the steam workshop will be launching in the end of the month, something he had being saying was \"really hard for the team\" and kept \"facing difficulties\" for the past year.\n\nSo yeah.... I kinda understand why people are still really mad about this one",
      "This game was sunk by poor customer service as well. I at one point lost years worth of items due to a bug. I was told by one of the devs in an email to \"stop button mashing\". My email was nothing but respect and appreciation for a good game where I also simply asked if they could return my bugged items I have earned over the years. \"Stop Button Mashing\"! Really? And now your game is dead. Good work! Piss poor development. Just sad and dissapointed I have over 2k in hours in crap. And yes this game actually is years old it was originally released Jan 2015. At one point we had a good game to play. I believe even the most played game on steam. Then something happened. It became all about crates. F this game. I'm done!",

      "Not For Broadcast is in the simplest of terms, a multi-tasking simulator.\n\nYou sit in a news control room and you have to keep track of multiple things: censoring curse words, switching between cameras, playing ads at the right time, ensuring your broadcast frequency isn't disrupted, as well as keeping an eye out for a bunch of other strange things that appear later in the game.\n\nThis isn't the easiest of games as it requires a good deal of attentiveness. The description isn't joking when they call this \"high-pressure\". You have to rely heavily on both audio and visual cues to make sure your broadcast doesn't get screwed up. As this is the news (and live), there is no rewind or undo button. If you mess up and want to get a good performance grade, you'll need to redo the entire news segment. \nIf you're a perfectionist like me, a 10 min segment can end up turning into an hour of trying to perfect that news segment. As such, I do hope an option to quick save, or at the very least, save and quit, can later be put into the game. It felt rather taxing having to keep an eye on so many things for so long. But as with any game, excellence isn't an art, it's a habit. You'll find yourself turning into a multitasking expert eventually.\n\nThankfully, the actors in the game do a great job of making the experience an entertaining one. There is a good amount of humour written into each broadcast, although I must admit I wasn't quite able to pay attention to all the dialogue, as I was too busy trying to switch to the right cameras whilst ensuring my electricity didn't get cut out. Luckily, the game does have an archive which allows you to playback the broadcasts. Without that, I'd probably be missing out on 70% of what was going on.\n\nThere is also a text narrative, choices matter portion in between news segments. As of now, it feels a little out of place and incomplete, but then again, this is an Early Access review.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that at the time of writing this review, there isn't really any \"propaganda\" aspect to the game yet.\n\nPerformance-wise, the game runs pretty smoothly. I did encounter occasional crashes if I looked left or right and back and forth too quickly, but other than that, the game is pretty much bug-free. Also, this game has my RTX 2070 Super running at rather high temps for some reason. Rather surprising for a game that doesn't appear to have particularly high-end graphics.\n\nAnyway, I'll be looking forward to see what comes next for this game. Definitely worth the buy despite being Early Access.",
      "Before you flame this review to note that \"Clicker\" is literally right there in the name and I should have known better:\n\n1) the game tags list \"Clicker\" and \"Idler\" as the top two tags\n2) This genre as a whole tends to wrestle with how to appeal to both camps, often being better at one than the other.  \n\nAs such, this is really a neutral review.  In short, Cookie Clicker is a good active clicker game, but not much of an idler.\n\n Until your first ascension you won't gain any progress off-line, and even leaving the game running in the background, your progress will be significantly hampered both because of the need to buy upgrades and grandmas steadliy, but moreso because clicking Golden Cookies and later also wrinklers are a huge percentage of your revenue, and farms and towers will also require some regular attention. As a result it feels to me like the game doesn't really value strategy either, it really just values in-game time and clicking.\n\nI'd say if you want a very active clicker game that you can dedicate a lot of time to paying attention to, Cookie Clicker does have a lot of charm (albeit the text flashes at the top get old very quickly) and a lot of bells and whistles to keep you clicking.\n\nIf you're wanting something you can really walk away from, and still feel like you're progressing, Cookie Clicker really isn't that game.\n",
      "One of the few exceptions of \"dont buy games on Early Access\".\n\nThis game, on early access, has more gameplay value than a lot of games on full access + 5 dlcs.\n",
      "Would I recommend DBD? ...It's complicated.\n\nDead By Daylight is an unique experience of asymmetric hide and seek/tag with shifting rules. \nIs the game fun? Yes. Is it creative? Yes.\nIs it fair and enjoyable? Well, it depends.\nGames get very intense, and playing as killer is some of the most intense gaming experience I've ever accumulated...\nWhich is where things often go wrong. The survivors seem to have decided that the killers have to honor strict code of rules. Don't use these items, these abilities, or these strategies. If you do, you'll be insulted after the game.\nIf you follow these rules, the odds are that you will spend the game running in literal circles, the survivors will win, t-bag you at the gate and then insult you after the game. I don't know about you, but that kind of ruins the game for me. It is actually kind of amazing how helpless one can feel in this game.\n\nSo to conclude my thoughts; I really like the game, but I also really hate it. I can't recommend it, as every time I fire it up, there is about 50% chance I feel more harassed, than entertained.\nI play a lot of online games, from League of Legends to Tekken, but this is the only one that makes me frequently think: \n\"I should really uninstall this\"\n\nEdit: \nI returned after a long break, and I still kinda like the game. \nHowever, same pattern repeats whenever I return. Eventually, I get teabagged one time too many and uninstall the game. The game is fun, the community could not be much worse. And sadly, that often ruins the experience.",

      "This game is basically awesome, under 3 conditions:\n\n1- You get rid of all on-screen icons (i.e. incoming attacks, ennemy spotting)\n2- Do not care about secondary missions only here to further lenghten the game's lifespan\n3- Play the game as you would if  YOU were in charge\n\nBasically, nevermind the Ubisoft micro transactions' system and other abhorrent company induced  greed-leaned system to get stuff faster and more easily by robbing you out of your hard-earned cash...you can finish the game without spending a single dime in the store, it's all pay to win...\nThe open-world aspect is very satisfying and rewarding, in terms of progression, don't fall for the micro transaction system\nCombat is easy even in the highest difficulty setting, but makes you think you are badass when you slash through waves of ennemies, whose AI is rather basic, with your arsenal of rockets, LMGs and explosives but it is satisfying as fuck!\n\nImagine strapping C4 to your plane, jump out of it, have it crashing down an ennemy outpost meanwhile you are parachuting down and throwing hand grenades their way, land on a roof and eliminate the remaining ennemies with fire ammo shotgun and a motherfucking M60 with armor-piercing bullets while throwing dynamites and there you have it...FarCry5 in a nutshell\n\nOh and don't forget about the flame-thrower lol, who doesn't love a flame-thrower scorching ennemies to their own demise eh?\n\nFarCry5 got it all, extreme freedom of how you wanna handle a situation (stealthily or all guns blazing) while being challenging enough in the highest difficulty setting!\nP.S. don't forget to turn off all the on-screen icons, really ruins it for hardcore FPS fans by making it extremely easy, please hear me out, you don't need these!",
      "This now classic arcade made history as being one of the first twin-stick shooters that employed 3D arenas in an interesting manner - this was an important addition to the shmup genre, which really blew me away as a developer working in the same genre. But this also brought a problem: the gameplay was made harder by the 3D rotating camera. \n \nIt impacts overall visibility and the clarity of collision between the player and the enemies. Also, the game is often late with its warnings to the player related to the incoming appearance of enemies.\n \nThis makes the player die occasionally not because of their own error but due to visual glitches. \n \nI personally didn't like the upgrades because I found it unclear in what ways are they affecting the gameplay and they didn’t really help me achieve higher scores. \nOther noteworthy features include 12 battle modes including Paciﬁsm, King, Claustrophobia and 4 all-new modes, but also the local co-op.\n \nOverall this is an interesting addition to Geometry Wars franchise, but Geometry Wars 2 still sits on the throne. If you are a GW fan, I would recommend this game because it shines in all other aspects. \n\nIf you are looking for other interesting shooter games, I would like to invite you to check our community group on Steam:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/593680\n\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/593680/Rocking_Pilot/",

I'd be semi OK to buy these at $40.

      "RIP Johnny Gat and your whole 2 minutes of screentime.\nWhile being a good sandbox game on its own merits, SR3 does NOT improve upon SR2 in very many aspects. In fact, they actually removed a lot of content from the previous game, though it's not like most people probably played that.\nGone are choosing more than one type of shirt to wear, or belts. You can no longer use your phone to dial numbers, or call taxis to transport you or ambulances to heal you. They removed a lot of activities as well as a lot of really cool things the other games had. So many, in fact, that I could probably spend a whole paragraph just listing them.\nThis is for a large part subjective, but the gangs in this game are very unimpressive by Saints Row standards. It comes down mostly to character writing, but the characterization on each faction is not good; motivations are usually left vague and most characters introduced besides the replacement Saints members are left undefined with little personality.\nThe game is extremely buggy (compared to the others in the series, although it's not quite Bethesda level) and the netcode is pretty bad too. Playing co-op is often pretty difficult because most actions done by both players will be out of sync with each other.\nAlso, it isn't a well-optimized port for PC. The graphics are sub-par for the most part, but the game still runs like garbage most of the time. Sub-60 FPS on high unless you're playing on a top-of-the-line system (by 2011 standards).\nOh, and one time I switched to one of the radio stations and was given a 2 minute long lecture by the DJ about how I'm \"wasting my life pressing buttons in a murder simulator\" and how I should \"go out and get a girlfriend or something.\" Game just killed itself on anything immersion related for breaking the fourth wall and trying to antagonize me for playing a video game.

It's a reminder that there still exists impossible beauty in what sometimes feels like a bleak hopeless materialistic world.

      "Dandara is inspired by a legendary warrior who fought slavery in Brazil in the 17th Century. The similarities, however, seems to stop at the name and the fact that she is a black woman fighting a vague concept referred in the game as \"opression\". \nThe game mechanics are very unusual as you can`t really move back and forth and the art style is often charming, although sometimes it gets really generic with some enemies  inspired by Egyptian culture (I thought it was supposed to be about Brazil). The difficulty escalates quite suddenly at certain points in the game, and the fact that you have to be standing still at all times to attack your enemies is pretty frustrating. After you get used to the movement in the game, it is quite fun to jump around without the frustration of having to walk slowly through a huge map as you do in some games of the genre, especially before getting upgrades that allow you to teleport or move faster.\n The story and dialogues could also have been polished a little more. Everything is very vague making it feel a little bit like a waste of an interesting idea. Dandara is a little rough around the edges, but  pretty unique for a metroidvania style game.

This is because of the auto generated track system - unlike in the previous Dirt games, the AI never actually drives on the track, but stage times are auto-generated by how an AI *would* likely perform on a stage. \n- Lack of tracks / Boring tracks. As mentioned, there are no proper tracks for Rally events as they are auto-generated. While the tech behind it is quite impressive, this leaves most tracks feeling incredibly dull with no highlights or features whatsoever. Remember the cool cliff sides from Greece in Dirt Rally? None of these here. Essentially all tracks feel the same no matter what the location is. Couple that with the fact that there are only 5 locations and you'll find yourself bored quite quickly. Rallycross and Landrush tracks are not auto generated, but feel incredibly boring and forgettable. Baja or Malaysia in Dirt 2 were such a blast, but Dirt 4? Yawn.\n- Historical Rally. In its entirety. It's just normal Rally with older cars, but after a while I refused to continue this event type as the events are dragged out as hell. Near the middle you'll have to complete 12 events with each 5 stages. That's 60 stages in total. Consider my previous point about tracks feeling dull and I can't help but wonder who actually completed all these events. This seems to be a Codemasters thing though as I had the same issue with Grid Autosport.\n- Menuing. Why is it that I need to go out of the career every time I want to buy a car? Why is selecting sponsors (which you'll do often as they expire after awhile) in the same category where you can customize your car? Everything is a huge mess and finding the right things took me more time than it should every time.\n+ Lack of rewards. I actually found Joyride, which isn't part of the main career, to be the most fun thing to do in the game. Even though the events in Joyride repeat frequently but with different cars, it was a proper challenge compared to the career and is somehow quite addicting. The issue with it is that it's meaningless to complete. You don't get anything for getting a Gold medal on everything, not even new liveries or, heck, even an achievement. It's utterly pointless.\n\nAll in all this game is easily the weakest entry in the franchise (minus Dirt 1 maybe, but that one had a way smaller budget). To top it off it just feels like this game has no soul either. I vividly remember Dirt 2's gritty and colorful presentation, while this one lacks anything I could remember the game by. Really all this game made me want to do is play Dirt 2 or Dirt Rally again. Cheers and thanks for reading.",
      "Black Mesa is a fantastic remake of the Original Valve classic and one of the greatest of all time video games, Half-Life.  This sci-fi classic FPS has you take on what might seem like a hum-drum day in the life of an experimental physicist, but things go quite off rails when experimenting with a strange material sample from an even stranger dude in a suit. \n\nAfter a while (and shooting a lot of aliens and bashing their heads in with a crowbar) you'll save the world... but now Black Mesa lets you do this with dramatically updated graphics, 4K support and a plethora of visual tweaks so you can rest assured this will run great on any gaming rig. \n\nA must have for big fans of Half-Life or gamers who are new to the scene and never got to play the original.   When on sale, of course!",
      "Overall its a great hunting game. The base game is good enough on its own to give you an enjoyable experience hunting several varieties of animals. \n\nI feel that some of the best content is in the DLC's. I dont mind the price tag for maps are they are just a large and some of them have a truly diverse animal population. \n\nThe Weapon Packs have some items that really should have been available in the base game (.22 rifle).\nTripod stands, Tents and ATV's are also DLC items that i feel should have been included in the base game. \n\nThe cost for these packs are not huge, and I have bought them, but they really do impact your play in a meaningful way so it is hard not feel like they were left out on purpose. \n\nBeing a former hunter in real life I would say that the realism of it is pretty good. Lung shots and heart shots drop animals quickly and using the right ammo along with good aim greatly influences this. A poor shot will leave you tracking this wounded animal across the map till you sneak up on it again or just give up. \n\nThey have a system called Tru Racks (sumthn like that) that simulates different qualities of animals. So you end up with little bucks, average bucks, and monster bucks. Weight and coloration plays a part in this too. In short every animal has a trophy of some kind and they are varied by what must be some sort of RNG. \n\nAll that having been said, this game can devolve into a shooting gallery were you kill everything on sight as there in no real incentive not to. You get money and experience for every kill you claim and wiping out a heard of deer with your DLC M1 Garand on your DLC Tripod Stand becomes the quickest way to bypass the grind.\n\n It feels like the game starts as a \"hunting sim\" and becomes a \"poaching sim\" once you realize the progression system is going to take a long time to do...\"ethically?\".\n\n\nAgain, this is a game i would recommend, but it is just that, a game. \n\n",
      "One of the better RPG maker games i've seen and played, especially considering it was made on RPG Maker 2003. The beginning of the game was great and felt like there was a ton of potential, but a lot of the overworld mechanics were underutilized (jumping, swimming, orb flying). The writing was alright in the beginning, but started to turn into a bad fanfic in the middle/end of the game. The ending was... wholly unsatisfying and abrupt. It made very little sense, and did absolutely nothing to answer any questions asked at any point in the game, rather asking brand new questions and providing no resolution for any of the characters. You'll get about 10-14 hours of this game, which is kind of amazing for an RPG maker game, but honestly, steam has SOOOO many better titles available in this price range that unless you're into RPG maker, you should go elsewhere.",
      "Something I've been needing to get off my chest, despite how much maxis and EA go on about how much they care for the LGBTQ community, it's clear to me that they don't. First if they did they wouldn't be pushing the community the whey and as hard as they have. When things get pushed like they are, hateful people just harden there harts more, and just become infuriated. The sympathetic the become hatful towards it. The more something gets pushed, after awhile the more it gets hatted. A better approach would be, (if they really did care,) would be to put what they are talking about into a FREE pack, and get people whom make amazing custom content to contribute to it. If there is enough nice stuff in the pack people will download it, and talk people whom are on the fence to download it, and maybe to come over, and might start to get the people on the other side to at least get on the fence. That whey the LGBTQ community would get there representation, and acceptance would be pushed in a whey that won't burn people out.\n\n\nAnother resin why they should do it like this, and is part of why people are getting mad, is that they bought this game a certain whey, paid a lot for it and it's DLC, now they are changing, it and braking it to do so. Changing the experience against there will. Evan something you love like chocolate, or bacon, or anything will become something you hate if it's shoved down your throat ageist you will. If you want people to take it just offer it, most of the time people will take it. And if they don't just make it just make it more appealing. IE instead of braking the main game to add something even the LGBTQ community can't enjoy with a broken game. Make a free pack, and to tempt more people to get the pack, just add more nice CAS and build mode stuff. And maybe update the pack and add more stuff to it every once in awhile.\n\n\nI just had to say this for two resins, one companies being this careless or ignorant is just killing the public sentiment for LGBTQ and similar groups. And two, they are just killing interest in what they are selling, it will cut the Sims 4's life short, and will cut the Sims 5's life much, much sorter. \nIt's good to give options, as long as they are options. Or you are just like Hennery Ford, “The people can have the model T in any color! so long as it's black.”\n",
      "I am a Filthy Casual (tm) who plays games like Mass Effect and Fallout 4 on easy and still die over and over. I got my \"you died\" achievement in Dark Souls 2 before the tutorial and stopped playing after like forty minutes with zero qualms. I have rage quit every single platformer game I have ever touched, and just sort of despise brutally hard things that feel like chores.\n\nBasically, I am not exactly sure why I decided to buy Dead Cells in the first place. Sure, I love the look and one of the few platformers I've ever 100%'d was Super Metroid (with a LOT of swearing and rage quitting), so 'Metroidvania' is an appealing term to me, but it is still inherently marketed as a game that is not for me, or people like me.\n\nThis game is hard. I have 11 hours on it and I can't get past the third area on any given path. I die for stupid reasons and lose all my stuff and... I don't care. I haven't rage quit once; in fact, I have to force myself away from the game after a death so I can do things like eat. I find the combat engaging and entertaining, the progression satisfying and there's something really solid about being forced to start from square one (ish) every single time, in a way I've just never experienced.\n\nSo, sure, buy this if you love hard games/Dark Souls/no checkpoint kind of games. Absolutely, I'm pretty sure you've alreeady heard this is likely to be up your alley.\n\nBut even if you're a dirty rotten casual gamer who button smashes in any game approaching action, and panics when the screen flashes red around the edges... give it a try if you get the opportunity. It is seriously fun.",
      "For those of you still harbouring hesitations about \"walking simulators\"...here's one I'd definitely recommend you try.\n\n   So yes, it's quite linear, and no, it probably doesn't have an enormous amount of replayability. It's also quite short - about two to three hours - so I guess it's not that cheap at twenty buckaroonies. It is, however, one of the strongest examples of interactive storytelling you will ever enjoy, and an oddly varied experience given the bits of the game in which you briefly get to play the roles of cats, owls, and...well, I don't want to give too much away. Let's just say Tim Burton would be jealous (seeing what a boring old hack he's become these days).\n\n   For anyone who loves a good story in a game, with a willingness to sacrifice a bit of agency in order to have that superior narrative experience...it's a bit of a no-brainer. As for the rest of you, well: you only live once. And they do say variety is the spice of life. So if you only try one walking simulator before dismissing the entire genre, this could well be the one. Truly magical, wonderful stuff. And a bit of a tear-jerker at times, too.\n\nVerdict: 9.5/10.\n\n(PS Anyone claiming there is no \"gameplay\" in this title is either a drooling idiot, or hasn't played the game in its entirety. There's interaction and \"mini-games\" aplenty.)",

      "PC version doesn't have rebindable controls for controller for some reason\n\nupdate: i have finished the game, still no rebindable controls, i can give a real review now. i wouldn't rate it negative but i wouldn't rate it positive either. this is a \"eh\" review.\n\nthe game is two games at once and neither of them are great.\n\n the roguelike part is like 20% of the game and is very simple and shallow, there's like 5 weapons and they all play the same, its also super easy. its ok but its not as good as a real roguelike.\n\n the cult building part is 80% of the game and is a bit more fun but past the earlygame its a bit eh too. choosing what you get doesn't really matter since you'll unlock everything pretty fast, and the doctrines 90% of the time are a choice between 2 useless things and 10% of the time a choice between a busted thing and a useless thing. the randomly generated quests the followers give you are just chores like revisiting old dungeons you already completed and the reward is pretty much nothing. its ok but its not as good as a real colony builder.\n\nnone of the systems in either part of the game are particularly deep.\n\nas of the time of this review, the game is still quite glitchy, though being patched by the devs.\n\nthe game is about 15 hours with side content and 18 hours for a completionist run. no real replayability \n\ni'd just recommend you get a full on action roguelike if you want to play a roguelike, or a full on colony builder if you want to play a colony builder. this game does both but is not great at either of them. \n\n game is very cute tho and the soundtrack is great. like 5/10",
      "100%'ed the LUCT version of the game and I'm slowly working my way through this version now.\n\nOver all the game itself is solid. If you're reading this, its a brilliant tactics game that helped define the genre. However most of the changes they made in reborn, while innovative, ultimately feel constraining. \n\nFor example, they've limited spell slots to 4, so you can only ever take 4 different spells. One or two of which (missile + indirect) are taken by a damage spell of your choice, leaving you with even less spell customization than you'd think. And its unfortunately the same situation with skills, as one will always be taken up by your weapon skill. \n\nThe cards that drop in battle, while an interesting system on paper, just end up cluttering the field most of the time, often with auto-skill activation up, which most of your units won't even really want compared to the other options. \n\nRandom battles were also removed, limiting chances to recruit to a few key dungeons as well as removing some of the more amusing battle locations from the game. \n\nI've also seen some people complain about the level cap, but in my current play-though of the game, it isn't too much of a concern for me, but it may be for others. \n\nOver all, it just feels like they've taken a step back from what Tactics ogre: Let us cling together, gave us. Yes there's bloat in that version, but it also gave us a feeling of freedom when we were putting our teams together that this version lacks. I am grateful that we saw a remake of this game within my lifetime, but I wish they had improved on Luct, rather than take steps back from it. \n\nIf they ever increase the amount of spells and/or skills you can take, to like 6-8, then I'd probably switch my review to a yes. But until then, with a heavy heart I have to say that this version just isn't as good as Luct so far.",
      "The good:\n+ Great story with satisfying finale.\n+ Endearing main cast/characters.\n+ Great world building meets with 90s Indonesia culture.\n+ Pleasant pixel artstyle. The cutscenes visual is amazing, even though i notice few awkward animation.\n+ Nice soundtrack.\n+ Puzzle is mostly well balanced. Not too difficult and doesn't make you feel bored/annoyed either.\n\nThe bad: - \n\nThe ugly:\n* Some pacing problem. There are so many sidetrack a.k.a. \"To complete sub-task C you also must complete sub-sub-task X, Y and Z\" during chapter 2-4.\n* Sometimes you might have to going around in circles to solve certain task or accidentally skipped something.\n\nDespite few flaws, A Space for the Unbound is definitely best game developed by Mojiken Studio and best story-driven/adventure game among all games created by Indonesian developer. If you like side-scrolling/adventure game (such as GRIS, Unreal Life or Oneshot) or game made by Mojiken Studio/Toge production (such as Coffee Talk or When The Past Was Around), you should give this game a try.",
      "You know that feeling when you are hesitant to buy a game because you're worried you might waste your money on something that might be a crap game in the end, get boring, and not sure if you should believe all the ratings because you dont know if everyone has the same interests and likes as you? well this game is the bomb diggity, straight up. Made by the same people who made rollercoaster tycoon and man did they deliver on this. For me it's the small things in a game that matter and did they really take the time to make sure this was as polished as it could be. Not sure if anyone remembers when they announced another rollercoaster tycoon a while back, and everyone was super excyited to find out what it was, and it ended up being some dumbass phone app? Well imagine all that excyitment, but instead of them coming out with that stupid app they came out with this bad boy. This is exactly what everyone was wishing and hoping for (just different name). Do I reccomend you buy this game? hell yes. will it be exactly what you are wishing for when you fist clicked this game to see the game play and reviews? sure as cocks will. But will it be just as fun as the original?.... YOU BET YOUR MOMS TITS IT WILL BE. \n\nPROS:                                \nbeen one since 1990\n\nCons:\nYou'll never know how fun it is till you buy it.",
      "Ratchet & Clank is always fun. The older games are clearly better, as it feels like the more modern they get, the shallower and simpler they become. They now feel almost like a demo of a game - you just get to dip your toe into each of the systems, never really fully engaging with any of them. New abilities are just thrown at you with no fanfare, and then you only need them 3 times, and it never asks you to combine them in new ways. Everything feels underwhelming and tossed aside shortly after being introduced. That's almost the theme of the game - they even have Ratchet meeting a fellow Lombax for the first time ever, the thing he has been focused on since game 1, and it's pretty much just \"hi, let's go do the next thing.\" The series has been casualized, just as neutered as their formerly innuendo-laden titles. \n\nBut it's still fun to play, it's just lacking the magic it used to have.",
      "Gameplay is similar to Hades. The story isn't as rich as Hades, but it's still pretty good. More forgiving than Hades, that's for sure. You see where I'm going with this - Hades is 10/10, the roguelike to compare/to beat. On a scale of 10 hades, I'd give this game a 7.5/10 Hades.",

      "First steps:\n-set nioh.exe and nioh_launcher.exe to win7 compatibility (if you experience crashes).\n-first level (London) is poorly optimized, so better rush through it and judge the next.\n-experience this game as Nioh and not as a \"Souls\" game, tho I draw comparisons here\n\n\n[h1]Good[/h1]\n\nCombat\nBy far the best thing about the game. You get 7 weapon classes + 3 ranged weapons, and each of the 7 weapons has it's own unique skillset accompanied by 3 different stances. On the fly switching between 3 stances and 2 weapons, or even both at the same time allows for a ton of combinations to chain different attacks and combos. On top of all that you get magic, spirit guardians and ninjutsu. Sky is the limit if you're willing to experiment.\n\n\nBosses\nThe game comes with roughly over 30 unique bossfights, some of them will reappear or be demoted to regular enemies over the course of the game. There are only very few bosses I didn't like. Most of them are going to be human, but that doesn't mean they are boring. Most have sick movesets that make them very engaging and fun to fight, especially the DLC bosses. \n\n\nDifficulty\nJust like Dark Souls the game is as difficult as you want it to be. This means you get alot of tools that allow you to cheese the game. Like summons, or certain character builds centered around spirit guadians and op magic like sloth talisman which makes enemies move in slow motion. \nThe difficulty curve is a falling one, aka the game is more difficult in the begining when you're figuering things out, then it remains on a steady level with occasional spikes upwards. Disregarding bs like sloth talisman I would say the game is overall more difficult than Dark Souls. Combat is faster and mistakes are punished severly, even human fodder enemies can 1-shot you if you happen to take swings when they are in heavy stance.\n\n\nStory\nIt's decent, but nothing special. Nerds interested in the sengoku period to early edo period \nwill probably appreciate the characters and their interactions.\n\n\nWorld\nIt's not an interconnected world like DS1. It is mission based where you pick main or side missions from a map, personally I don't mind the \"arcade\" style. Main missions themself are big levels with multiple shortcuts that loop back to shrines (bonfires). Those levels are bigger than most designated areas in DS3, my guess is like 1.5x-2x the size. If I had to rank the level design... DS1 >>>> DS3 > Nioh >>>>>>> DS2 \n\n\nReplayability\nThe game offers 4 NG difficulties which spice things up by switching enemy placements or giving enemies (and bosses) status effects and new moves. Other than that you get Abyss mode which is most comparable to DMC's bloody palace. \n\n\nMultiplayer/Netcode + pseudo PvP\n3 ways to play mutiplayer: as summon/summoner, co-op missions where both players make progress at the same time and PvP (which is dead).  The Netcode worked quite well for me, even over wide distances like brazil-germany. I never had to adjust for delay and could parry attacks just like offline.  The netcode is quite good imo compared to DS3 where I did lots of co-op at Champion Gundyr and parrying was totally out of the question.\n\n\nThe other \"pvp mode\" is the faction/clan system. You get multiple clans that belong to 1 of the 2 factions. A clan gives you 2 passive buffs that can compliment your playstyle. You obtain glory by killing revenants, succesfull co-op or pvp for your clan. The more glory you obtain, the higher the rank of your faction, clan and yourself. Glory acts as another currency and can be used to buy npc skins, gestures or items.\n\n\nFashion Souls\nLike the look of a particular light armor set but hate getting insta killed by radroaches? No problem, at the blacksmith you can transform any weapon skin or piece of armor, and keep the stats of your preferred equipment. If you get tired of playing as William you can buy npc skins for glory at the teahouse (unlocks at roughly 33% of the game) which is the only way to play as a female as there is no character creation.\n\n[h1]Bad[/h1]\n\nEnemy Variaty\nThe games biggest weakness in my opinion.  Enemy \"species\" come in different flavours, e.g. humans can wield any of the 7 weapons, however this doesn't realy trigger the visual stimulation of seeing something new. Saving grace: the game throws you into different 1vsX situations, so the combination of enemies keeps things interesting, kinda like DMC4 which also has wack enemy variety. I think they could've done much more in terms of creativity when it comes to the yokai/oni realm given the huge amount of lore.\n\n\nRepetition\nSide missions take place in mostly the same batch of areas or in parts of main missions. \nThey try to keep things fresh by switching enemies and spawn points. But they still feel kinda tedious because skipping them isn't realy an option as you can't deny yourself the experience, rewards and loot.\n\n\nMusic\nGood but gets repetitive as only few themes are shared across bosses.\n\n\nFunky Optimization\nSelf explainatory. FPS tanks in London and I had random crashes. The later were solved by the tips mentioned at the top of the review.\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nI found the combat mechanics to be more than able to compensate for the games weaknesses (repetition, enemy variety). This means you've to take up responsibility and be creative yourself. If you're the type who doesn't like experimenting and spends 90% of his time with spear in mid stance, and plays like its DS (dodge > R1 > R1 > dodge > R1 > dodge...), then you're gonna get bored quickly. Although, I've seen those guys during co-op all the way up to NG3-4, so who knows... .",

      "Undoubtedly one of the best if not THE BEST modern video game remaster out there. I will summarize the pros and cons of this remaster into the following:\n\n[b]The Good:[/b]\n\n- Totally seamless transition into the new modern 4K visual from the old classic Win95 at a push of a key\n- Extremely faithful to the original titles (some might say that it is perhaps TOO faithful)\n- Game \"installation\" screen when you first boot up for both Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert is filled with God tier nostalgia \n- New UI with a complete revamp of the sidebar complete with higher quality artwork that totally feels in place\n- Plethora of never-before-seen bonus contents including exclusive missions and cinematic cutscenes for Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert that was only available on certain console platforms\n- You can queue multiple units while in production now\n- New multiplayer features and service is great. Finally you can now play 1v1 ranked and spectate any previous matches that was played including spectating ongoing games in the lobby\n- You can add, remove and create your very own custom music tracks in-game for both Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert however you want\n- All of Frank Klepacki's overly iconic classical and remixed tracks are here including various modern remixed that was composed solely for this remastered collection!!!\n\n[b]The Bad:[/b]\n\n- Minor bugs (though not a real dealbreaker)\n- The gameplay meta among factions/units remains as unbalanced as ever. Kinda of a tradeoff for being too faithful to the original titles\n- Multiplayer is still officially limited to a maximum of 4 players total per map in Tiberium Dawn, while in Red Alert the limit is a maximum of 8 players total\n- FMV cutscenes are all still heavily compressed in SD resolution extracted from the Playstation home console version and further artificially enhanced via AI upscaling due to the fact that the original master footage tapes for both Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert are still yet to be found\n\n[b]The Kinda Ugly:[/b]\n\n- Certain mission on hard difficulty are completely unbalanced. This is already another insult to injury as the AI blatantly cheats when it comes to resource procurement and unit build time. The fault of a clear lack of playtesting",
      "Full disclosure: I'm not a racing guy. I'm not a car guy, even. My extent of car knowledge begins and ends at \"vroom-vroom go that way.\"\n\nBut that's all you need to know for this game.

Not sure when to brake or start a turn? Easy, there's a friendly line. Follow the line, make less vroom-vrooms when it's red, everything's gravy. Don't have the reaction time to follow the line?

      "[h1]One of the few multiplayer games that reminds me that people can be amazing[/h1]\n\nI've been playing games for a long time, I've seen some sh*t. I've seen people crumble, I've lost friends, I've watched people eat each other even when they are winning. When people are supposed to be working together and yet they would rather treat their ally like trash because they refuse to take the blame for their own wrongdoing.\n\nSquad is a game in which I have seen true potential. A group of 40 individuals work together to plan, execute, and accomplish masterful plans to outsmart their enemy. I've seen teams rally from the depths of defeat and flip unwinable games into incredible victories. Heros emerging from the storm of mortars landing upon their bunker, to squad leaders risking their own lives to save those of their squad.\n\nSquad is not a game for the light hearted. To enjoy squad to the fulllest, you must communicate, work together, and form a bond with the soldiers at your side. You are a team, you are a unit, and you will never win alone. Be it a medic patching the wounds of your comrades, a logistics driver supplying your team with the supplies they need at the front line, or a squad leader putting the responsibility of 8 individuals on your shoulders, each person is a vital component of the team.\n\nFor this reason, Squad has now become my most played game on steam. The depth, the people, the comraderie, it's an amazing experience that no other game captures. I encourage you all to try it out on a free weekend as I originally did, I have been playing it ever since.\n\nI'll see you on the front line.",
      "As someone who has played the PS2 version roughly 3 years after release, I enjoyed myself. Then I saw that there was an HD remaster. Thought the game was possibly a bit overrated for a remaster, but got it and remembered why I enjoyed it after about halfway through the first level. I even enjoyed it a bit more than the first time around, since I appreciated the way the sound effects synced with the music a bit more the second time. Now Rez Infinite comes out, and the cycle repeats itself...\n\nBut this time, I'm wearing a f**king VR helmet. As someone who played many VR titles before this, and as someone who wanted this game, but put off playing it for full price... it lives up to the hype (it might help that this is the first time actually wearing headphones with it too...) Especially the Area X level. Holy crap especially that level. I only wish it were longer, and I see myself replaying that level alone many times in the future.\n\nThe gameplay may seem a bit dated to some, and it is short. But damn it, it earns it's classic status and it still holds up today. Decent gameplay that grows on you, cool sound track helped immensely by the cool way the sound effects play a part of the song, and great visuals all combine to explain how this game is pretty much the start of any cliche \"games are art\" speech. If you never played it and don't have VR, it's worth $15 (I'm sure. Haven't played this on the flatscreen, but I spent $15 on Rez HD I think, and I didn't regret it). If you have VR and any sort of nostalgia for this game, you probably wouldn't hate yourself buying it at full price, even if you're as cheap as me. If you only kind of liked the game before but didn't really see what the fuss was about, the ten or so minutes of Area X will probably show you why this game has such a cult following. \n\nAnd if you're a Rez fanatic? You'd spend $50 on Area X and still say you got your money's worth, short as it is.",
      "The latest S tier Deckbuilder Roguelike, joining the ranks of Slay the Spire and Monster Train for me. I think that's all that really needs to be said.\n\nIt leans heavily into kiss/curse type effects, if you like the ability to manipulate rng and do some busted stuff with your sequencing you will love it. It is more of a thinker on a turn to turn basis than other games of this genre, but if that isn't a turn off then it's a really solid game with some unique characters/mechanics that feel fresh.",

I've already invested a lot of time and energy into this game for little to no return. I'm not going to study guides and waste more time on this game just so I can dig the nuggets of fun out of this wasted youth simulator. I will say that it did a really good job of making me role-play an awkward alcoholic with no job prospects and zero understanding of how to talk to women, living out of a ****** hotel room. But I've already played the real life version of that, so I can't recommend it. If you want to play a fun game about programming, go with Human Resource Machine. If you want a good role-playing game about hackers, go with Shadowrun. If you want to pay money and spend your leisure time feeling really depressed about your 20's, then I can recommend Else Heart.Break(), but maybe you'd be better off talking to a friend about it instead.",
      "I had the privilege of playing a game that provided an immersive and emotional experience set during the Great Patriotic War. This game, which I highly recommend. From the moment you start playing, it's evident that the developers spared no effort in recreating the atmosphere of the era. \nOne aspect that truly impressed me was the game's narrative. The storylines, filled with genuine human drama.\nI also must commend the game's sound design.",
      "Great game for the most part.\nI do not like how they made a rpg with twitch aspects though.\nMy characters are supposed to be strong and agile not me on the keyboard.\nDo not expect to beat the island master(2nd ending) unless your very agile with your fingers.\nAt 50 years old it is impossible to get him down past 3/4 health.\nToo much twich and not enough character skill.\nGames like might and magic you never had to be agile with the keyboard.\nGuess this one goes under my \"Ending too hard category\"",
      "Edit 2 (9/24/22): The devs have made several updates now to address some of the UI problems. And right now, the in battle experience is greatly improved, especially when not using a mouse. It's good enough that I'm having fun playing it now, and am looking forward to seeing more of it so I'm reversing the thumb on this review. However, the experience remains decidedly clunky, especially with a mouse and especially out of combat. Overall, to anyone who is expecting a modern game with modern usability and controls, this game is not for you. But if you don't mind those things so much, this game has some real meat on its bones. It also has delightful music and sound. I'm leaving the original review here, as I hope the devs will continue to improve on the usability of the game so that everyone can enjoy it fully. If you're playing on keyboard and mouse, I'd recommend using the option that disables the mouse, the jank doesn't feel as bad when you're not clicking\n\nEdit: The devs have taken this feedback very seriously, I'm keeping a close eye on this game to see when things change so I can give this game another go.\n\nAgh... I really want to like this game. The customization and squad building seems like it will get really cool in the later parts of the game. But I don't think I'm going to make it to the later parts of the game. Why? Because the UI and controls are so frustrating. Camera movement is frustrating, selecting units is frustrating, distinguishing between your units is difficult, managing your squads is frustrating, promoting your characters is confusing, even attacking is a pain in the butt. Every time I go to do anything there's always some interface or controls issue in my way. And every time I finish a map and have to go do the in-between battles management, I know the UI will fight me every step of the way. \n\nMy thoughts on what should change:\n\nOut of battle:\n- On the \"Organize Army\" screen, I shouldn't need to click \"Squad Operations\" first to look at a squad. Simply clicking a squad should do that.\n- When returning to \"Organize Army\" from a squads view, \"Squad Operations\" is deselected, and has to be clicked again.\n- It is not possible to scroll the squad list without clicking \"Squad Operations\"\n- When I am in one mode on the squad screen (say \"Move Unit\") I can't switch to another mode by clicking the appropriate button, I have to cancel first.\n- When changing classes, there is not a clear enough indicator on the version of the unit I need to click that shows it has an upgrade available.\n- When changing classes, an extra click is required for no reason (and with no UI indication) before the upgrade options are viewable.\n- When changing classes, it should be easier to see what the next tier options will be for that class.\n- There should be a way to quickly view and either upgrade or sleep for a year all units who have class mastery between battles, so I don't have to check every squad.\n- From the Organize Army screen, there is no way to see a squad's capacity, so you have to click into every squad to see if you can add another unit.\n- When equipping an artifact, the first empty slot should be selected automatically.\n- When equipping an artifact, if I click the item first and then the slot, that should work. Drag and drop would be nice too.\n- On unit details screens (such as Unit Status or Change Class) there should be derived stats, that let me see how much damage the unit does / resists. As is, it's hard to tell what my stats are doing for me.\n- Unit traits should show a tooltip saying what they do when you hover or click the name or icon, I shouldn't need to go to another page for that.\n- Affinities should show a tooltip saying what they do when you hover or click them, I shouldn't have to go all the way to the game manual for that.\n- When using an item, I should be able to see my list of items before selecting which unit I want to use it on.\n- When using an item, an extra click is needed before you can select the item, for no reason.\n- There should be a better visual indicator on the squad screen of who the squad leader is.[strike]Right now Jules looks identical to the archers on either side of him.[/strike]\n- In the marketplace, if I've clicked on \"Recruit\", and want to switch to buying items, I should be able to click direclty on \"Trader\" and vice-versa, without needing to cancel first.\n- When recruiting units, there should be a way to lock a units stats in place so I can look at their traits without accidentally mousing over another units name and switching it.\n- There should be a way to see what the deploy limit for the upcoming battle is, so I can organize my squads appropriately, without needing to go back to the battle prep screen after seeing it.\n- The mouse scroll wheel doesn't work on the game manual / tutorial pages\n\nIn Battle:\n- There should be a way to move the camera with the keyboard without moving the targeting cursor (this is necessary if I want to move the camera while still having my hand on the mouse)\n- It should be possible to move the camera with the mouse by left-click dragging, instead of having to bring the mouse near the edge of the screen (this is especially vital in windowed mode)\n- There should be a toggle to turn off the need to select \"Move\" for moving units on capture points\n- There should be a toggle to allow the turn to end automatically when all squads have taken their turn.\n[strike]There should be a hotkey to end the turn.[/strike] (There isn't, but double-tapping space is close to good enough)\n- There should be a hotkey to display the mission info, and the mission info should appear automatically at the start of a map.\n[strike]There should be a hotkey to move to the next unit whose turn is still available, so I don't always have to scan the screen visually for this.[/strike]\n- There should be a way to see a units health (% of units alive, maybe?) and morale at a glance from the battle map. It takes so much time to dig out morale information for each unit by clicking all the way into their unit details.\n[strike]When you hover a unit, their morale needs to appear in the little mini-squad-view that pops up.[/strike]\n- There should be a way to see a tooltip explaining what a piece of terrain does.\n[strike]There should be a way to make an enemy unit's attack range stay visible on the screen so I can plan around it. Ideally, I'd be able to have multiple units selected for this at once, and be able to highlight them in different colors.[/strike]\n- There should be a way to quickly distinguish between squads led by the same unit type at a glance, especially when both squads are led by main characters. [strike]Right now Jules' squad and Narima's squad are identical visually.[/strike]\n- During combat, there should be a clear indicator of which unit is the squad leader.\n- After selecting an attack type, and a squad to target, on the screen that shows the two squads, there should be buttons I can use to change my attack type (such as switching to \"Force Surrender\" after seeing the enemy's morale is low).\n[strike]If I back out of an attack, I should be able to change attack type, or which action I do without the unit undoing their entire turn and deselecting themselves[/strike]\n- On the list of attack types, \"Force Surrender\" should have an indicator of what the surrender chance is, so I don't have to keep checking it.\n- It should be easier to tell at a glance if a unit has ranged attacks. Especially, some of the icons for cavalry ranged units are hard to identify.\n[strike]When moving units, it would be nice to have a visual indicator for units I can do a charge or ambush attack against[/strike]\n\nGeneral:\n- There need to be better resolution settings. Almost every piece of text in the game is difficult to read on a high resolution monitor.\n- The game needs rebindable controls, it's an accessibility issue.\n\nIf the game sees improvement in this area, I hope to be able to give it another chance and change my review.",
      "DLC and Bugs prove this company is Garbage.",
      "It's hard to review a game like this.\n\nAs a game in it's own right, if you've never played it before, it's a good game. Typical crazy Final Fantasy story (although it takes a bit to get into it), interesting characters, and simple but fun real-time turn-based combat. Final Fantasy games are known for their stories and characters, which are great in this member of the series.\n\nIf you've played the game before on PS1, then it's good for nostalgia. However, many people complain about it being a bad port. It has built-in cheats, in case you just want to be able to enjoy the story, characters, and side-quests. I played this years ago on PS1, and I really enjoyed my trip down memory lane with this game.\n\nIf you're an achievement hunter, this game is horrible. There are achievements that, unless you're literally following an online scripted step-by-step walkthrough, you will miss some random little thing, not know it, and then have to play the entire game over. Another achievement requires you to speed through the game in under 12 hours, which means you will grind through the game you already played, watching the same story you just watched, all over again, wasting six hours (that's how long it took me), just for the sake of one achievement... There's also another achievement to kill 10k enemies. when you can play the whole game and not even kill 1k enemies... You might think, \"oh they just want you to play the game through 10 times then\". No. It's 10k enemies in one playthrough. You run out of content, and have nothing to do, except grind battles, for literally dozens of hours. It's terrible.\n\nDespite my bitterness about the achievements, it's a really enjoyable game. Considering the FF series are mainly known for their stories, it lives up to its reputation. If you're an RPG fan, this is definitely on the list of \"must plays\".",

      "Incomphrehesible UI, sloppy controls.\n\n\nGranted I'm a day one player, but very steep learning curve. Couldn't figure out interstellar nav, for the life of me, and the touchy controls made the dogfighting a chore. Save your money. This isn't a jump in and play game.",
      "1 week before release i played the demo, it was a 20 minutes demo that was very underwhelming, but i still thought i should give the game a chance to see if it gets better later on.\n\nIt doesn't.\n\nSo the first thing i read about this game in the embed of the steam link was \"a fresh take on the jrpg genre\", and its probably the biggest problem of the game. It is really the most basic, mediocre turn base combat you can find.\n\nTurn base combat, rock paper scissor elemental types plus physical, materia base skills with few spots (i had only 4 skills activated),  no gear, no party. Does that sound like a fresh take to you?\n\nSo if the gameplay is so barebones it means is at least hard right? Well no, it is basic and easy. The start is easy, in the mid part they blow up the HP of enemies so you understand you should buy new skills, and once you do it the game is easy again. Mob enemies are generally harder than bosses because you are 1vs3 most of the time, while in bosses you can just debuff it and make it slow, while you have 2 turns to spam healings and hitting. There also some questionable decisions on the minor mechanics of the combat system but i don't think they matter (see some paragraphs below)\n\nNow here is what is really the \"fresh take\": the setting being cyberpunk. Everything is written with tech terminology. The mana is called data, block and delay turn is called cache, melee combat is called hack? some of the terms don't even make sense of what they actually do. Also because we obviously live in a technological society we have people called \"V-sync\" or \"Nullpointer\", expresions like \"Digits!\" or \"Oh my grind!\", you know, normal behaviour if you ask me.\n\nThe story is pretty standard for a futuristic setting, it wasn't bad but also it wasn't good, pretty normal.\n\nThe artstyle is cool, the music is generally cool, which i think its why most people would don't mind the boring gameplay and will just play for the story, which is also present in the game itself because you have options to either skip every random encounter (yeah we have those here) or to insta win every battle when you want it.\n\nSo if you want to try this game because of the \"fresh take in the jrpg genre\" you will be disappointed, if you have played jrpgs before there is nothing new in this game, you have already played it before.",
      "This is a passable if grindy 3D first person family friendly farming \"shooter\" with cartoony artwork.  You have a simple \"vacuum\" gun that you use to capture wild critters, throw them into pens, feed them, collect their stuff, sell it, rinse repeat.  \n\nThe implementation here is of high quality and works well on PC with a range of implementation options.  While the gameplay is somewhat repetitive and grindy, this is decent enough family friendly game that should be considered when on sale.  The retail price is too high, however, this game appears on sale and in bundles often enough.",
      "I like the game, but I'd recommend waiting for the full release.\nDon't get me wrong, the game is beautiful and it's got great potential. The problem with it is, mostly, the keybindings. They are incredibly uncomfortable to use and you cannot change them.\nPlus, the dialogues sometimes feel never ending and quite pointless.",
      "GIVE ME THE GODDAMN COPY/PASTE ROOM BUTTON!\n\n10/10 would play again.\n\n(Ttips to combat the somewhat broken system atm:\n\n1. Use patients list, manually send those patients to treatment or home: \na. Very high diagnosis but still queuing for GPs (even 100% patients will wait for GP till their death, it will waste most GP resources)\nb. Very low mood/health patient, if you can gurantee the patient getting their treatment soon w/o affecting others in the queue, use the room's queue function, or use click on the patient to change his position in the queue, otherwise send him home to avoid penalty\n\n2. Treatments are much more profitable than diagnosis, plus they leave after treatment no matter what, but if well treated, then you don't need much ghost hunting janitors\n\n3. If in need of money in the early game, don't bother with food/drink/bathroom/comfort, do the minium and focus on your diagnosis -> treatment, most patient will get treated before they rage quit, thus make you a lot of money. With staff, if they near rage quit, just raise their salary.\n\n4. In the early game, only put down the essential objects (e.g. only desk and file cabinet in GP's) to maximize your profit. They only room I recommend to decorate to lvl 5 is staff room to speed up their recovery.\n\n5. ALWAYS ensure there is a toilet right next to your staff room, and a cafe. If a tired staff need bathroom, he/she will walk all the way to the staff room and back to toilet and back to staff room, even if a toilet is right next to his/her office. Samething with Cafe, it provides a 'nice meal' bonus.\n\n6. Do not build more reception than you need, build less. It is a great way to control the patient flow, they don't wonder around while in a reception queue.\n\n7. For a large map, patients entering the hospital from mutiple gates. I don't recommend building reception other than one specific area (preferably right next to GP's office), reason as above.\n\n8. News agent can get long queue very easily, as long as you have one, patients in queue will travel all the way across the map for it. So be careful, either don't put any, or put one in every building (at least).\n\n9. With spare money, get your staff trained ASAP, especially staff providing treatment (to ensure high chance of successful treatment)\n\n10. Click on a room, goes to 'info' tab, the last sentence there will tell you what training the staff in the room should have.\n\n11. Keep track of your staff's skills, and assign them only ONE job in the staff -> job assignment menu, so AI won't mess your system up.)\n\nThings I'd really like to be changed:\n1. WAY too many patients.\nI think the new patients' growth(spawn) need to be slow down at certain point either automatically or mannually, I often found myself in need of double the amount of GP offices in the mid-game. Since GP offices are the choke points, it can get out of control in matter of seconds, which left no Human resources/money/time to train everyone. Besides, it is realistic, there are only so many people a town have.\nAnd because of the growth issue, I find myself have to build more and more, I'd like to slow down and taking care of every corner of my hospital, not just keep building. Quality takes time, nobody like be overly pushed by the game.\n\n2. Rooms merge\nJust like in real lives, Doctor's room are private, but pharmacy? I think other rooms should not be private - Allow us to put multiple machine and people in one room, make it shared. It is just bizzare to not make it shared, and vey wasteful of time/money/spaces. Besides, some room looks really empty.\n\n3. Wards\nWards are weird, I'm not sure why. Often than not, I have more than enough beds and nurses, but still 6+ wait outside, I'm not sure what triggers them to be 'called in'\n\n4. FOOD/DRINK/TOILET is broken\nI'm sorry, but I'm not gonna build cafe & bathroom every 3 inchs. IRL, most hospital have 1~3 cafes, a small~medium toilet on every floor. Space is valuable, I would rather leave it to medical facilities. I think the AI is a bit broken at this point, they constantly want drink/food/bathrooms while I have 6+ machines/2 toilets in every building. As if they can't walk 10m to the nearest one.\n\n5. Janitors are kind of dump.....I wish we can assign areas to janitors/assitances, so they won't always walk across the map back and forth.\n\n6. Man, this is 2018, we got central heating and air-conditioning...for real. Maybe make a seprate tunnel system? Like water, electricity, heat, air. Hospital's air exchange system is much more important than usual buildings I believe.\n\n7. Credit to Ibbi Wyxx in the commnet, I think it is great to set patient with certain percent of diagnosis straight to treatment rooms. It makes sense and later in the game, with doctors fully trained I imagine 100% diagnosis on most patients in the GP's shouldn't be a problem. And it is how real life works as well, dorctors are not always 100% sure whats wrong, they might start some harmless/urgent treatment first, myself actually is in this situation right now \n\n(sometimes I feel like I'm being treated in my own hospital because I just stayed at one IRL, so I have to make everything right as if trying to please myself...)\n\n8.  Some of those skills just look fancy since you can't replace them.\nThis one does not matter much, I'm very OCD when it comes to managment, so atm I have to wait for the right person w/o any skills I don't want on them so the training oppourtinity will not go wasted, but it is hard and annoying. Besides, it is a real problem since you can only learn 5 skills, so just choosing whoever is not effective and effecient in the long run. (for example a GP w/ Radiology skill)\n\nAlso, it makes some of the skill essentially useless, i.e. master class (speed up learning and teaching), it may seem useful, but it will eventually cost you a lot more than you gain. Down the line it will cost you one spot for other skill. If just hiring someone w/ this skill to teach then fire him, it is also costly and not making any real sense. \n\nThings I'd like to see (in DLCs?):\n1. Ambulances management. Ambulance are essential part of a hospital, ERs are even better! (Stayed at a ER bed not long ago watch the whole ER room working,man, ERs are cool af, but I do hope less people need to see it because it is...ER)\n2. Multifloor-hospital.\n3. ICU etc.?\n4. Medicin/drug development/management\n5. Specialists office?\n6. More background music/radio, its a bit repetitive at this point",
      "buy it on sale. campaign was decent, however The Last Tiger mission was a standout. Multiplayer experience is ok overall, the hackers make it the worst bit. 6.5/10, if Dice fixes their servers and clears out the hackers then maybe it's worthy of an 8/10.",
      "In 2013, after 10 years of waiting, the Sim City community of modders, fans, and aficionados rushed out to purchase the fifth installment of Sim City. Ten years is a long time to wait for a game, but people had a lot of faith in Maxis when they announced the title. Long story short, it was a massive dissapointment. Maxis and EA crippled Sim City 5 with DRM, Always On APM, tiny maps, forced origin installation, lacking mod support, no steam support, and a forced multiplayer aspect.  I decided to not purchase the title, so it may have been a decent game, but 2 years later a team of 12 people created a game that does everything maxis insisted was utterly and totaly impossible.  \n\nEverything the mod community did that kept Sim City 4 on the shelves in Wallmarts across America for an entire decade was ignored. Maxis (and to a lesser extent EA) ignored the fans, and gave the people who had kept them in business for twenty years a crippled subpar game.  And for that Maxis is now out of business. They will never make another game, and it is no one's fault but theirs.\n\nNow pretend none of that happened. It's 2013 again, and here it is people: Sim City 5. \n\nThe game balance is a bit on the easy side for veterans of the genre, but the potential map size is ENOURMOUS and customizing your city could fill up years of gameplay time.  The game runs so smoothly with so much going on, it really shows how lazy Maxis was with their approach.  The glass in buildings reflects the sun and the buildings near it, there are dynamic shadows, zoning is back, and it is not 'dumbed down'.  A single tile in this game is twice the size of the alloted map in Sim City, and you can purchase dozens of additional tiles to expand.  The map editor is awesome, the community is thriving, there are mods to do anything you want, and this is the city building game we've all been waiting for.  I can not possibly reccomend this more.",

      "1. What is \"Pyre\"?\nThe game \"Pyre\" was made by Supergiant Games and was released on the 25th of July in 2017. After \"Bastion\" and \"Transistor\" this is their third game. \"Pyre\" is an indie-action-rpg, which story is mostly told in form of a novel. The gameplay is very different to the experience you probably made in \"Bastion/Transistor\", which lead a few people to put a negative review on steam. Now you will no longer play as one single character like before, but you are responsible for a group of exiles. The gameplay at it´s heart can be declared as 3 parts:\n \npart 1 contains travelling/exploring the world\n\npart 2 contains social interactivity with your group (talking/trading/decision-making)\n\npart 3 contains to take part in the rites, that means a fast-paced action ball game (3 vs 3) without        a planning phase (like in \"Transistor\")\n\n\n2. Technical details\n-the game runs fine on my windows 10 64 bit machine and it needs about 8.2 gb space of your hard drive. Unfortunately the game runs bad on old machines, because you need about 4 gb ram to run it without an error (my other 3 gb ddr2-system couldn´t run it, I received a ram-error-message when starting the game).\n\n-controls with mouse+keyboard or gamepad are good and well implemented.\n\n\n3. What does the game do right?\n-great rpg-novel-mixture as a whole unique and emotional experience\n-despite the linear progression (mentioned \"phases/parts\" above) the game stays interesting enough to continue\n-a colourful and fantastic world to explore (no open-world)\n-great character-design and a good variety of different creatures, which affects the gameplay during the rites\n-beautiful artstyle with a lot of detail and smooth animations \n-believable and fleshed-out storyline (NOT \"black and white\") with a personalised ending! \n-wonderful soundtrack (mostly ambient)\n-the creatures of the world speak their own language, subtitle is displayed in old-fashioned English\n-rites: the thrilling-faced-paced-action-game has a lot of depth to it (skill tree/character selection/items/area of the rite)\n-selectable difficulty level (rites can be optionally restartet), which can be changed during the game (+ \"titan-mode\": advanced challenges you can add separately like in \"Bastion/Transistor\")\n-meaningful and emotional decisions to be made (I´m looking at you mass effect), thankfully there are no dead-ends but different endings (personalised!)\n-\"Pyre\" is \"2-3 times\" longer compared to \"Bastion\"/\"Transistor\" without getting boring\n-good mouse+keyboard and gamepad support\n-\"versus-mode\": you can play against friends together on your pc or alone against CPU (with all the characters in the game!)\n\n\n4. What does the game do wrong?\n-the fast-paced-gameplay during the rites can be very fast and too stressful at times (I experienced some unfair situations here and there)\n-controls are sometimes not precise enough, especially when the gameplay is getting hot\n-hardware requirements (like \"Transistor\") with 4 gb ddr-ram are over the top regarding old rigs with dual-core cpu´s \n-some minor bugs during the rites (ball gets stuck, switching between characters over distance, bad camera angles over distance)\n-\"versus mode\" can only be played as local multiplayer\n-no bonus material for fans at all \n\n\n5. tl;dr\nPyre offers a fantastic but linear action-rpg-experience with a great story, which is told in form of a novel with a personalised ending. The gameplay is a mixture of exploration, social interactivity and a 3 vs 3 ball-sports-game. The level of creativity considering world-building, character design, music and the way the story is being told is on an insanely high level. If you liked \"Bastion\" and \"Transistor\" you need to know that you don´t play just as one character anymore. But what you can expect is a game with a heart, just like their games before. Pyre is in my opinion a masterpiece and the best Supergiant game so far.\n\n\n6. Final thoughts\nAs a child of the 80´s I played a lot of pc games. Sometimes I look back and remember how I bought game boxes from a company called \"Lucas Arts\". There were times I didn´t even inform myself about the upcoming games, I just bought them because I loved their games I purchased before. For me Supergiant reached that status in the present time. \n\n\n\nUntil the stars align!\nIf you liked this review be sure to hit the like button to help other players with helpful reviews.

      "I wish there were a \"mixed\" option for recommending this game, as I think for a lot of people out there, this is a fantastic game, and it's definitely well made with a lot of love and attention to detail in many respects. I really like puzzles and problem solving, so part of my disappointment with The Witness is that I really thought I would enjoy the game. Myst was one of my favorite games growing up, and I was extremely excited to see a well-reviewed game in the Myst genre surface after far too long. \n\nThe problem for me was that The Witness is very much a game about the journey, and not the destination. It turns its head on the genre as it's less a game about solving puzzles within a set of rules, and more about discovering what those rules are. And for the most part, it does that well. Instead of the usual game conventions, rewards for solving hard puzzles weren't any kind of story unlock, more just to give you a harder puzzle. That approach was fun for awhile, but some story unlock would've been appreciated, especially because there is so much mystery and it's such an immersive world that was clearly built for a reason and has a fascinating backstory. \n\nSome of the mechanics also just seem arbitrary, or at the very least, not quite obvious enough. Sometimes perspective puzzles require you to either take a screenshot or jot down on pencil and paper the answer, then transfer it on screen. That seems like lazy game design and worst of all, takes you out of the immersive experience. It's possible I'm mostly tone deaf, as some of the sound puzzles seemed almost impossible to me, despite numerous listens. There's also just the repetitiveness of the \"pathfinding\" puzzles, which range from challenging (and satisfying) to punitive in their difficulty spikes. It's in these difficulty spikes where I think the core game mechanic of pathfinding lets you down, as it requires you to be much more of a planner than a \"hands on\" problem solver. In a game like this, I would think it would accommodate multiple approaches, but really there's a right way to approach this game, and a wrong way. Unfortunately for me, I think the way I approach puzzles (trial and error) is strongly discouraged, at times in punitive ways. \n\nThe philosophy from the audio/video portions will likely be appreciated by some, and for some come off as the worst kind of douchey-hipster nonsense. Had they been delivered in shorter pieces, I might've fallen into the former. But as rambling as some of them are, I found them more annoying than enjoyable unfortunately. \n\nI don't know, I'm really torn on this. It's a well made game, and while it seems so open and non-confined, I found the game to be far too linear in mechanics and how to approach problem solving. At times it actually made me feel like a lesser thinker because I have a different approach to puzzles than what the game designer prefers. What I'm sure is a really fun journey for some, left me disappointed with the destination. \n\nAm realizing this reads a lot like an apology for not liking this game, which I think it is. I really, really wanted to love The Witness, but in the end, not only was this game not for me, but I genuinely feel lesser for that fact because I feel like I should have loved it, and just didn't.",

      "This is the best Civilization up to this point, and the DLC just made it even better. I will grant that the with all the add ons it would feel a tad crowded to anyone who hadn't played it before, but you have a crazy amount of options. The game series tagline of \"one more turn\" could not be more applicable.\n\nYou can strive for one of several victories: diplomatic, cultural, technological or domination. Each has its unique challengers to overcome and create a lot of the fun of the game. They are also not necessarily mutually exclusive and after completing one victory, you can go for the others. Each AI opponent has their own personality, and are pretty predictable in how they behave. Any one who has started the game next to Neopoleon or Ghengis Kahn knows they immediately have to have a decent military to repel invasion, while Ghandi will to muscle you out with religion and culture.\n\nThere are some important changes between Civilization IV and V. One of the most notable is that wars are plausible again as you dont constantly lose health in enemy territory and cities are easier to conquer. Additionally, culture doesn't automatically take over neighbor's cities anymore. \n\nThis game is easily worth the money. I'm not entirely sure how it stacks up to Civilization VI, but any game that I log 200+ hours on over a period of years and still haven't come close to doing everything is doing something right. A great game from a great series.",
      "Damn, deeply devoted developer designed Death's Door.\nDiscover dungeons, divine drama, delightfully depicted Death [b]:D[/b]\nDark daw's daunting duels demand deft digits.\nDynamite deal definitely does deserve desire!",
      "It's horrible. It's annoying to play, it freaks you out, it insults you relentlessly. Yeah, of course I'm recommending it, why do you ask?\n\nWill You Snail is what it says it is. A platformer with traps popping on your predicted path with some meta plot and an evil AI commenting on your actions, mostly with clever insults. But it's also a little more than that, mainly due to the quality of its elements - so the game becomes more than the sum of its parts.\n\nYou're probably wondering about the difficulty. Well, good news: there are four settings, and by default they change depending on your performance. You struggle with the level too much? It's lowered. You beat it on the first few tries? It goes up. All with a (not) nice comment from Squid, the antagonist. I personally found the design annoying rather than actually challenging, but I'm quite sure that's intentional. The game's got it all: conveyor belts (that randomly change direction), underwater currents, perfectly timed spikes falling on your head, blocks that cave in on you after you break them. PhD in twatologist design. Due to the ever-shifting nature of the levels, I wouldn't even call this game a precision platformer - it's not about learning the level, but about adaptation. Luckily, the platforming segments are only one part of the game and there's some downtime between them, with optional (but fun) puzzles.\n\nOh, and for reference: I played mostly on difficulty 3 out of 4, sometimes dropping to 2 and rose to 4 towards the end. I found it roughly as difficult as Ori and the Blind Forest's latter sections, harder than Celeste ignoring strawberries, and easier than Garlic.\n\nLet's talk about Squid, the antagonist. The misanthropic, fatalistic, super-intelligent AI trope is pretty old at this point - but Squid is a very good refinement of that trope. It feels like he's really insulting you - the player - not the player character, like GLaDOS did. Mainly because he really reacts to the exact things that you do. You died just before the end? He'll point that out. You keep dying in one spot? He'll let you have it. You died to a spike? Comments about hitting your head incoming. Ran into a bomb? He'll tell you not to collect them. And so on. There so many lines, I never, ever, not once ran into a duplicate. That really makes him feel like a living, breathing person, not an NPC. I mean, he's not living and breathing... you know what I mean.\n\nOn that topic: if you've watched the trailer, you've probably noticed that Squid speaks with a non-native accent. That's because he's voiced by the dev, who's German; and indeed the general writing has this sardonic, matter-of-fact yet earnest quality that will be familiar to you if you know the German style of communication. No, no angry screaming, that's not how Germans talk. Stop watching WW2 speeches and watch some Staplerfahrer Klaus instead.\n\nAnd finally, there's the story. It's a bit meta, no surprises there. I won't write too much about it because I don't want to spoil it. Let's just say that it leaves many things out, but gives you just enough info to fill in the blanks. It's rather suspenseful; more importantly, it slowly builds up to... cosmic horror? Existential terror? Perhaps both. Also, it has a very clear message, delivered quite convincingly. Up to you to decide what to do with it.\n\nOverall, Will You Snail is pretty good. I don't think it's as flawless as many reviews make it out to be; the annoying design is still annoying in the end, even if it's thematically correct. Also, the music relies a little too much on the central leitmotif of the game, and it simply doesn't have the grace and variety to pull it off like Toby Fox did with UNDERTALE's soundtrack. Still; those little things aren't enough to wear down the emotional feast presented by this game. I'd say \"Guten appetit\" to this fine escargot meal, but in this case, we are the snails. Enjoy!\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42922988]Curator page[/url]",
      "I played the demo and instantly became enamored. The mix of Slay the Spire-style deck-building with elements of the ship combat from FTL: Faster Than Light is an absolutely fascinating mix, and the \"single-axis\" movement system adds a whole extra layer that I've never seen in anything except the Mega Man: Battle Network series.\n\nI bought the full game within the first hour of being available. After having played for nearly 4 hours at the time of writing, my opinion hasn't changed in the slightest. I already love what's available and so far I feel like I've barely scratched the surface.\n\nI can't wait to see what awaits in the future for this awesome title.\n\nEDIT: As a small addition, I will say: I beat my very first run, which is set to the lowest difficulty (Normal). I jumped up to Hard to try to unlock a new ship, and I haven't been able to beat a run since then. It's probably just that I'm bad, all things considered, but be aware that the changes made with difficulty increases are probably more impactful than they may seem.\n\nAlso I wanna say to the devs: thank you for launching the game with mod support and working on making it easier! But also please look into getting Steam Workshop support if you can!",
      "The EOS stands for End of Service. I am sure someone has fun with this or there wouldn't be a reason to keep bringing it back. Right? The usual Tab Target MMO. I do like that you can teleport to quest givers and mobs instead of the usual auto or manual run. Aside from that there isn't anything modern here.",
      "First of all, thanks for the UltraWide support. Me and my Ultrawide companions out there do appreciate that very much. Folks who are familiar with Point and Click games know that UltraWide support is not self evident and a seldom pleasure. Black bars are not the end of the world but still. ;)\n\nAs for the game, Im not gonna bore you with a personal reference of my youth, because we all have a similar background story. They dont call us the nostalgic community for nothing. ^^\nPoint and Click adventures are \"feel-good\"-games, as Im not getting tired to mention it.  They are like books or a good movie, where you just take a load off and enjoy yourself for a couple of hours, You can always get back to them and they dont fail to make you feel better, wherever you feel bad/sad or not even feel like gaming at all. I mean, is there something better than a PnC adventure, a cup of hot chocolate while its raining/snowing outside ?\n\nAnd this one here is the mother of all P'n'C adventures. LucasArts and the Monkey Island franchise are as good as it gets. This is where everything began and where this genre got famous and hundreds and hundreds of titles have been inspired from.\nYou can hardly find any P'n'C adventure out there without a quote or a reference to the mother of Point and Click adventures.\nAnd the nostalgia hits you right between the you know what. Revisiting all those places where we spent hours and hours of our youth, meeting the lovely characters again and hearing the good old familiar soundtrack and some new interpretations of old songs makes you almost tear up and reminisce of old times.\nBetter times, as most of us would agree......\n\nHowever, the nostalgia makes you also ignore and forget about the art style which is sometimes a pain in the you know what, especially on hard mode without the clue-option and looking for a specific item without knowing if its a part of the background ore interactable. But youll eventually get over it because the atmosphere&jokes are on point and I had to burst out laughing several times, especially while reading the diary of LeChuck.\nThe difficulty is a tad too easy, even on hard mode when compared to the original games, but that doesn't affect the overall quality of the game.\n\nLets not forget that Return to Monkey Island is a fan-service to all us grownups, manchilds and youngsters at heart out there, who were raised playing this game or who have been raised seeing someone playing this game. There is no way around the Monkey Island franchise if were speaking legit video game history and Im more than thankful for this little journey throughout the past, especially if you keep in mind, that this genre is not a cashcow. We are a dying community and I hope that some of you guys got inspired again, to play all those wonderful Indie PnC games (and some of them remastered and new ones like the Leisure Suit Larry-games from Assemble), to keep this community and platform for PnC developers alive.\n\nedit:\nLove you all, guys.\n\nDo not forget, to......\"Never pay more than 20 bucks for a computer game.\" \n[except this one] ;)",
      "Someone has to be the first, I guess.\n\nI don't know, I just didn't really feel too hooked on the game's premise. I feel less like I'm solving a puzzle and more like I'm hitting a pinata for all the clues. Every replay, I'm just going to have to do something whacky in order to get a new clue as to what might further my cause. And that doesn't really make me feel like I'm a part of a story, as much as a I feel like I'm going through an eternally looping monday, getting increasingly distanced to the world around me as I finally end up throwing myself overboard, because 'why not?'.\n\nI won't refund it, because I think the devs have poured a lot of heart into this game and I do think they deserve the money, but I couldn't really find too much entertainment in the game.",
      "Do you like baseball?\n\nI didn't. I really didn't. I liked a lot of different sports but I always thought baseball was boring, archaic and more an excuse to sit outside, drink beer and gawk at the occasional on-field event.\n\nBut then, for whatever reason -- I didn't have much else going on -- I started to watch baseball, because it was always on, pretty much every day, and it started to wrap itself around my brain in a pleasing way. Baseball is low-intensity matched with extreme peaks and valleys of emotion. \n\nMore importantly -- Baseball is a long continuous set of calculations based on the manipulation of variables in series after series of problems. Every at-bat, every pitch, every inning, every game is a test of odds and outcomes based on the pitcher, the batter, the fielders, the field, the weather, past results obscuring present values... Baseball is a worthwhile flux.\n\nSo - OOTP 17. This is the most advanced and ridiculously satisfying way to run your own personal baseball simulations. So maybe I should rephrase - Do you like Baseball as a concept? Because you will love OOTP.\n\n(Also this year they added little moving pawns to the broadcast view, so it's starting to get satisfyingly similar to half-watching an actual baseball game.)\n\nFor those already owning OOTP 16 and mulling an upgrade I would say - the engine runs much faster this year on x64, some under the hood stuff has been nicely tweaked, bells and whistles (the pawns) aren't nothing, and of course, I feel pretty good about supporting this developer, given their track record.",
      "Hello Charlotte is not a game; it is a confessional.\nIf you're here you've probably already realized, but I wish to place massive emphasis that Hello Charlotte, and Hello Charlotte 3 especially, has very little gameplay, and what is present is very standard RPGMaker fare. If you are the kind to balk at visual novels, HC3 will not be your cup of tea. Watch a playthrough or something if you're interested, but don't expect any kind of engaging play.\nWith that said: Hello Charlotte 3 (and its DLC, Heaven's Gate) has been one of the most emotional, impactful pieces of art I've ever engaged with. It is horrifically honest, incorrigibly vulnerable, and, as previously stated-- more a confessional than a game. With everything I know how to say and with everything I have to say about it, I cannot find a way to truly articulate what Hello Charlotte made me feel (still makes me feel) and how it has affected me.\n\nHello Charlotte: Childhood's End is from the perspective not of the Charlotte of the previous two games, but a new, blank slate PC. While not necessary to play the previous two games, I strongly recommend it. It develops on the themes of the previous two games, and in doing so, completely recontextualizes them. C and Anri of HC2 return, as does Scarlett, though not in the forms we are accustomed to. We are finally given a full understanding on the nature of Charlotte and the False Realm, and what we are in relation to it.\netherane's art has markedly improved since the second game, with impressive sprite and background artwork, though their style is still recognizable. The music (some composed by etherane, others outsourced) is varied and distinctive. Most prominent about etherane's work, however, are the themes and writing, which have matured considerably since the release of HC2. Though often garish and on the nose, HC3 is a poignant commentary on the nature of art and fiction, the impact we have on one another, and our understanding of realness itself.\nYou will experience confusion. You will experience whiplash. The game intends to make you unsure and uncomfortable in its consumption, <i>deliberately</i> so. In the process it becomes a jarring, distinctive work of art unique to its creator and an important representation of the Millenial psyche. It's a psychological horror game and by God will it force you to experience psychological horror.",
      "I would describe this game as a 'befriending sim' with a very shallow veneer of farming/resource gathering/'witchy' activities. The farming/mining/fishing is nowhere near as fun or sophisticated as other games e.g. Stardew Valley. And there are no customisation options - even very shallow ones - to make the game experience your own, e.g. the layout of your farm and buildings can't be changed or decorated, there's no home decoration, no character customisation or clothing options. So the game feels very linear and daily tasks are repetitive and grind-y. There's also a dearth of special/seasonal occasions which adds to the repetition.\n\nAnd even though this game majors on the social/befriending angle, which is largely ok, it still doesn't feel quite right. You can get to be 'good friends' with a character and they still repeat dialogue asking if you've met their family members (of course you have) and/or your character asks them really basic getting-to-know-you type questions that previous cutscenes have already answered. The voice acting is great though.\n\nI think this game would have been a lot better had it been done as an all-out graphic novel/choices matter game, and dropped the farming etc. As it is, it's a jack of all trades and master of none.",
      "Playing this game for the first time six years after its initial release proved to be a delight in disguise. With all the memes and jokes established, I was finally able to understand what the fuss was all about back in 2011. Despite not having the best gameplay, story or graphics out there, something about this title just made me want to finish every quest I deemed worth completing. \n\n9/10 - mods recommended",
      "First, let me state that the 3 hours shown as my time played is majorly inaccurate. I spend most of my time playing games in offline mode due to living in a VERY rural area with no internet available aside from satellite or mobile hotspot (both of which have extremely stingy monthly data caps). I started playing this game less than 24 hours ago and am currently on day 22 in game.\n\nAs has been said by others, if you are a fan of Animal Crossing, Harvest Moon, Stardew Valley, Staxel, etc, this game is something you will want to seriously consider. There is already a significant amount of content available with more being planned in the developer's roadmap. What is here is well designed and feels like second nature if you've ever played any of the aforementioned games.\n\n\nWhat Dinkum Does Right\n\nGraphics - Excellent. Graphics are exactly what I would expect for this style of game, Characters, buildings, animals, and environments look absolutely great.\n\nMusic - While the music is definitely understated, it fits the setting and gameplay perfectly.\n\nSound Effects - Another area the game absolutely nails. The sound effects are spot on from the rainfall, pick on stone, bees buzzing, fish splashing, and even the gibberish language voice effects are exactly what I expected.\n\nDay/Night Cycle - The day/night cycle is dialed in to the point that it strikes a near perfect balance of giving me enough time in the day to make progress on my projects while also not giving me so much time that I can make so much progress that the day/night cycle is meaningless.\n\nTool Durability - While tool durability is still something that annoys me in video games, it is something I have grown to accept and Dinkum manages to make the system feel like less of a hindrance than most other games in the genre.\n\n\nThe Missteps\n\nThe Sky - As I said earlier, the game's overall graphics are great. The one place I've noticed that falls a bit flat is the sky. While during the night, it looks pretty decent, during the day and evening, is a bit lackluster. Not a dealbreaker, but it is a bit disappointing considering how great the rest of the game looks.\n\nUpgrading Tools - The fact that I have to buy a basic axe, pickaxe, etc and then use a couple of ingots to upgrade it rather than being able to just make a new, higher tier tool from scratch is a bit annoying. ESPECIALLY on Sundays.\n\nBland NPCs - Now this is something that I was initially hesitant to include given the game is an Early Access release and is one of the easiest things to polish up in a final release. That said, the game is being presented in a FOR SALE manner, so I feel that what is currently in the game should be considered indicative of what to expect in a full release and decided to include it. That said, the game's NPCs (with the exception of Fletch) do feel incredibly bland and lacking in personality when compared to those of Stardew Valley, Animal Crossing, Harvest Moon, and the like. As stated, though, this is a simple fix as the game nears a final release.\n\n\nOverall\n\nGiven how minor my few complaints with the game are, this is a game that I would absolutely recommend to anyone who is a fan of the genre and I consider it an absolute steal at a $20 price point.\n\nAs someone who has grown disenfranchised with Nintendo, having a game that takes the Animal Crossing community building gameplay and merges it with the farming, hunting, and survival gameplay of Stardew Valley is something I had been hoping to see for quite a while and Dinkum does a fantastic job of capturing that. This is a game I am very excited to see completed and I would love to see more games like this on PC.",
      "As much as I adore this game's visuals, soundtrack, story, and... THE MEMES... I unfortunately can't recommend actually playing it.\n\nI can parry bosses in Dark Souls or Elden Ring with less frustration than in this game. The parry system requires you to execute a light attack towards an enemy right before they go in for a hit against you, which is usually telegraphed with a red glare in their eye. Unfortunately, even while using the lock-on camera (and by the way, you are never directly informed of its existence), half of the time my opponent was partially, or even completely off-screen. This is a problem, not only because it makes seeing an incoming attack difficult, but also because movement is tied directly to the parry system. You must execute an attack TOWARDS the enemy. With the camera having a seizure every five seconds, this makes it even more irritatingly difficult to aim your parries. I died to Blade Wolf repeatedly, not because of my own skill, but because midway through an incoming attack, the camera would decide to turn 90 degrees to the left, causing my movement to also shift to the left, nullifying my parry. \nIt's consistently inconsistent.\n\nIf there is some system in place that actually does help explain a lot of these game mechanics, fantastic. However, I find it inexcusable that whatever I might be missing would be so out of the way that I'd never encounter it unless I went out of my way to do so.",

      "I vividly remember the moment when I gave up on Fallout 3: I was the ruins of some city, with a grey sky looming over the shredded grey concrete shells of buildings, and vast chunks of broken grey highway was wrapped up against, around, over and under huge chunks of grey concrete. My companion had gotten stuck somewhere in the grey sea of rubble for the umpteenth time, and it just suddenly struck me: This game isn't fun. It's just depressing.\n\nA few years later, I recalled this experience to a friend of mine, and he assured me: \"Fallout 4 isn't grey. It's got colors. And it's good.\" Having banked 1410 hours in game, I would have to say he was right.\n\nIs Fallout 4 good RPG? Nope. The story is rubbish, the characters extremely shallow, and the skill tree is very meh. If you hate VATS, like I do, the skill tree is complete rubbish. Is it good because it is bug free and has good DLC's? Nope. Is it good because it's the best shooter ever? Nope. Fallout 4 is good game because it's fun, and it's fun because it's a decent shooter, with an OK open world, good atmosphere and a sense a humor. Slap some of the 1000's of existing mods on that, and there's a decent chance that the next time you emerge from the elevator of Vault 111, switching to the catchy tunes of Diamond City Radio as you ready your gun and take in the not-grey landscape, you'll be smiling, just like I do.\n\nUpdate: Due to the recent Skyrim \"update\", breaking mods and introducing paid mods, and a similar downgrade being reported as coming for Fallout 4, I can no longer recommend this game, or any other Bethesda product.",
      "This game is amazing! Truly the Dark Souls of little girl simulators.\n\nI’m glad that Dark Souls taught me how to dodge in literally every video game, it unknowingly prepared me for this. Ender Lilies is a Soulslike with JoJo Stand combat. That’s an instant win for me.\n\nThe world is depressing, suffocating and overwhelmingly beautiful. Each stories of the main spirits are well written and realistically human. The endings are top notch too.\n\nIf you’re even considering playing it… play it… I promise you won’t regret it. I was much more emotionally invested in this game than I was on Hollow Knight. Lilly is an amazing protagonist… and she never even utters a word. She doesn’t have to.\n\nIt's a beautiful game with fun combat, awesome art and amazing music. My only real complaint was a bit of exploration fatigue having to go around finding all the collectibles. \n\nI think the easiest way to sum up Ender Lilies is \"It's Momodora, but better.\" It has the same gameplay loop of \"slash slash roll behind the enemy slash slash repeat\" and fairly challenging bosses, in a much bigger and more non-linear world with nearly every single room having some sort of collectible. It's also aesthetically atmospheric and pleasing, and the soundtrack is great.\n\nI can safely say that this game is a creative masterpiece. And in the end… Like Lilly, don’t we all have a little girl inside of us, telling us to stop all this silliness and go back to being the proper good boys our Mother wanted us to be?\n\n10/10",
      "In life, failure is as inevitable as success – this is the underlying principle of great puzzle games. You're equipped with all the tools you need to succeed and it's your responsibility to utilize them effectively to achieve the goals set before you.\n\nHUMANITY places you in control of a luminous Shiba Inu, tasked with guiding hordes of people towards a light that transports them into the unknown. The game unfolds like a series of puzzle boxes, each with a fundamental set of rules: shepherd your humans to the light, prevent them from falling from great heights, and use the provided tools to avert their untimely demise. If navigating the crowds from point A to point B wasn't challenging enough, the game rewards your efforts to collect Goldys – the epitome of human accomplishment – which in turn unlock progress and assistive tools for easier puzzle-solving.\n\nInitially, the toolset is simple, with arrows for direction and commands to jump. These rudimentary tools soon amalgamate into a complex web of commands, making the gameplay increasingly intricate. It would be easy to liken HUMANITY to Lemmings, but doing so would disregard the platform challenges that uniquely define this game. As a player, you'll find yourself questioning how to access certain areas of a level to place commands and realizing that the stream of people you're guiding are also instrumental in your own journey.\n\nThe tranquil aesthetics of HUMANITY are a signature of the team behind Tetris Effect, Child of Eden, Lumines, and REZ. Coupled with the pseudo-futuristic techno music, these visuals create an immersive and cohesive experience, reminiscent of an interactive design studio’s portfolio. The game's sleek aesthetics provide a calming backdrop for the perplexing trials that await you.\n\nThe crafting of a good puzzle game demands talented designers capable of devising some of the most challenging levels. HUMANITY embraces this notion by enabling anyone to create and share their levels, ensuring a constant influx of new challenges from the community.\n\nFans of games like Portal, Baba is You, The Witness, or The Talos Principle will find HUMANITY an easy recommendation. As with those games, failure is not a dead end; instead, it forms part of the learning process propelling you towards success.\n\nHUMANITY is a true Goldy of puzzle games. Underneath its engaging gameplay, it communicates a deeper message – one that resonates with its players, and, much like its puzzles, equips you with enough tools to reach your own conclusions.\n",
      "[h1]THIS GAME HAS COMMUNITY SERVERS WITHOUT HACKERS.[/h1]\n\nI've been seeing a lot of reviews talking about this game being [i]\"infested with hackers, can't go a single game without hackers, hackers ruining everything\"[/i] etc. but I have yet to see a single hacker in any of my games because I play in community servers.

The only reason I didn't go back to this game any sooner was because of this one misconception, but to reiterate, [b]THERE ARE COMMUNITY SERVERS,[/b] just like Battlefield 4, which is the primary reason why BF4 is still alive to this day.\n\n[u]Completely ditch the matchmaking/official servers and just use the server browser,[/u] [b]I HAVE YET TO RUN INTO A SINGLE HACKER BECAUSE OF THIS.[/b] Anyone leaving a negative review because of \"hackers\" are probably still playing on official servers and are most likely just garbage at the game.

      "Ni no kuni II: Revenant Kingdom is a great RPG that, while a little dissapointing in some aspects, makes up for it with it's positives.\n\nLet's start talking about the negatives: \n\n- the characters are a little bland, most of them barely get anything added to their backstories nor are there any specific sidequests for them (yet). They're not bad, and Evan/Roland are good characters, but the rest falls a bit short.\n\n- The soundtrack is a little forgetable, even if it does have a few good gems in there\n\nNow the \"neutral\" points:\n\n- The main gameplay is simple, with only a few attack buttons and barely any combos, so if you're looking for a deep combat you're going to be a little dissapointed.\n\n- The story is simple; i personally enjoy it and how it ends but i could see someone who's looking for some deep story to be left unsatisfied.\n\nNow for the good aspects:\n\n- The graphics are beautiful, it's basically a playable Ghibli Studio movie\n- The gameplay (both combat and army based) is fun, fast and rewarding to do, especially when you unlock more spells\n- The kingdom management is simple to do and it gives you a sense of pride and accomplishment (unlike EA) when you expand it with new building and bigger borders\n- The sidequests are for the most time fun with cool citizens to meet and recruit\n- The random dungeons are cool to explore\n\nI played 85 hours of this game and i enjoyed every second.

      "Overall, there's just too many things about this game that rub me the wrong way.\n\nFirst of all, I definitely like the art, visuals, music, voice acting, and writing. They don't hold your hand when it comes to explaining the story and it forces you to pay attention and also encourages you to try lots of different function combinations so you can learn more about the characters, if you care to.\n\nOther than that, though, there's not much I like. The most important aspect of games to me is whether the gameplay is fun, and honestly transistor's gameplay isn't that much fun for me. Like others have said, not being able to do anything after you pause time and plan out a sequence of moves just sucks. They don't even give you enough mobility to dodge shots. All you can really do is try to get to cover and hide out until your meter replenishes. And if you opt to instead play without using turn (or using turn to pause and think and then unpausing and simply executing your actions manually), you'll probably disappointed by that experience when comparing it to the action oriented gameplay of bastion. One of the worst things, in my opinion, is that you lose access to functions when you lose all your health. Honestly I'd rather just die and restart from checkpoint. I can see that they're trying to encourage you to try different combinations of things, but it still just frustrates me losing the build that I was in the process of learning. And when your options are limited the gameplay just gets more and more boring because you might have to resort to gimmicky tactics depending on what functions you are left with. Overall, it's certainly a unique idea to blend the turn-based with real-time combat, but, in practice, it ends up just not being all that fun to me. I'd rather play a turn based game or an action game. My brain doesn't like switching between the two so rapidly.\n\nI would say get this heavily discounted and play it for the uniqueness and aesthetics. Don't come here expecting something very heavy or that you're going to really want to sink countless hours into or replay. My first playthrough was done in 6 hours and I was glad to be done with it. I have to complement them for not dragging it out or having some frustratingly long and tedious boss fight at the end. If the story went on even an hour longer I might've just gotten sick of it and given up.\n\nIf you're into experience games more along the lines of how you experience art or other aesthetic experiences (and not necesarilly for the thrill of challenge and victory), you should definitely consider this game. There's a lot there to process. I personally don't care much about that sort of thing when it comes to games, though.",
      "Seriously, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. \n\nLike many, I heard the stories of performance issues on PC. I have a decent rig so I thought I would take a chance. And hey! Things worked out at first. A few microstutters but overall not bad. I loved the first game, and really wanted to enjoy this one.\n\nHowever, after the most recent (June '23) patch, the game CONSTANTLY crashes. Over and over. Cutscene? Crash. Go down the wrong hall? Crash. Jump at the wrong time? Crash. THE GAME IS UNPLAYABLE. \n\nI never write reviews, but I can't let this one go. If I can prevent just one other person from purchasing this trash fire, it will be worth it. Again: DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A SIGN AS TO WHETHER TO BUY THIS GAME OR NOT, HERE IT IS. DO NOT.",
      "Basically Wizard of Legend, but from a different viewpoint. Same composer, both pixel art, similarly fast paced boss fights with good telegraphs, combos are a little less deliberate, though. Very satisfying build making, with solid build variety. Has couch co-op which is very nice. It has some beautiful pixel art, truly. This game is a feast for the eyes and ears with cutscenes, voice acting, and more. Ok, I just love this game. It's so damn good.",
      "[b]What was added:[/b]\n- Roguelike mode\n- New campaigns\n- 5 new units\n- Groove/Super groove\n- 4 new commanders\n- New OST, including Commanders'\n\n[b]What did it cost:[/b]\n- No more Arcade and Puzzles\n- A lot of maps removed from Multiplayer\n- Can't randomize weather anymore (????)\n- Can't use previous OST\n- No more Co-op campaign\n- Nothing to unlock with stars. All characters are already unlocked, so there is no point completing the campaign with more than 1 star per mission.\n\n[b]With that being said, here are some issues:[/b]\n- Balancing may need some work. Won't get into details, but it doesn't feel right, as it wasn't right in Wargroove\n- AI is still bad. Even worse than before. They just didn't touch it. They will use their Groove on cooldown most of the time, without bothering about the Supergroove. Commanders will run into you only to get surrounded and killed.\n- Once a player lose, all of his team lose, putting the game to an end. Though there is a toggle in map editor to disable it, but doesn't seem to work\n- A lot of tooltips missing for settings. We don't know what most settings are doing...\n- Tried to make a map where Commanders can respawn after 2 turns, to prevent AI to lose instantly, and let them play more agressive. But when you increment counters or set flags booleans, they get changed for both teams, making it impossible to script... Can't debug efficiently either.\n- The new Commanders' themes are glitchy when looping\n- The Codex didn't get updated properly. When selecting a Commander, we can only see a short text for the Groove, without any details.\n- In Map Editors, there are two entries for Wulfar, but using different names.\n\nI'd say if you liked Wargroove 1, you'd just like that one too. But it feels really disappointing right now. I don't know why they removed features instead of just adding new ones... In 2020, they said they were working on AI. But they did absolutely nothing.",

Nothing mind-blowing, but good nonetheless.\n\nI've completed the game with a couple of sidequests (there are more for me) in about 13 hours, and there are two story DLC + the Expeditions mode, so I anticipate at least another 10+ hours of gameplay. Which is great for the price.\n\nUpdate: I've put in ~10 more hours to complete the Foundation DLC. It is a good DLC, and brings a few more hours of joy living in this world. It also has some sick areas (like that dark cave with the TV). The overall design is a bit more dull, but I enjoyed the story.",

Really a shame.\n\nNot to mention the performance is pretty terrible and inconsistent. Not to mention the lack of full keyboard bindings and support.

      "[h1]Strategy at its finest[/h1]\n\nInto the Breach is Subset Game’s latest title, following on from their massive hit, FTL. I put off trying Into the Breach for a long while, but I finally got it when it dropped down to $10 on HB a couple of months ago and I’m so glad I did. This game isn’t for everyone, it’s kind of rogue-like mech chess, but if it clicks for you then it’ll be one of the best strategy games you’ll ever play.\n\n[h1]Positives:[/h1]\n[list][*]First up, the game looks fantastic. The pixel art here is great, from the backgrounds to the mechs and even the pilot portraits. The animations here area also really good. There’s nothing too complicated here but it’s all well executed. On the topic of appearances, I also really like the way the maps are laid out, the 8x8 grids on a plain background work really well here and it reminds me of simple boardgames. I think it works well for the game.\n\n[*]As with any good strategy game, it’s easy to pick up, but hard to master. You have a squad of three mechs (there are a few different mech groups to unlock with gold coins (?) and you can also create custom groups from the mechs you’ve unlocked). Each group has a unique element, but they all follow the basic structure of one close-range mech, one long-range mech and one support mech. Each mech has a different ability/weapon and they’re all well varied. The mech teams are really well designed here so that no one mech is super powerful and they all work really well as a unit. \n\n[*]The combat is excellent. It’s really simple but it works so well. You’ll quickly learn the different roles your mechs have and figure out the best strategies to use them. There are two ways to kill most enemies. Getting rid of all of their HP or pushing them into water/lava (with the exception of boss enemies or flying enemies). However, a lot of the time you probably won’t even be trying to kill your enemies in a given turn. You can always see what the enemies will do on their next turn and so you always want to be playing to react to/prevent their next move. Typically, enemies target civilian buildings or buildings related to your objective, so it’s usually better to focus on moving them away from these buildings rather than focusing on killing them. If you’re really smart/lucky you can also push enemies so that they attack each other, as friendly fire is a major part of this game. It’s really satisfying when you line it up right so the enemies are killing each other rather than attacking you or the buildings you defend. You can even block them from spawning by moving something on top of them!\n\n[*]Unlocks in this game are handled better than in FTL in my opinion. There are six actions that you can complete with each mech squad to earn those gold coins I mentioned in order to unlock new mech squads. The first three are the three possible victories: two, three and four island (more on that in a second) and then the other three achievements are unique to each mech squad. They’re centred around the unique aspect of each squad, tasking you to get a bit creative with the way that you’re playing. I know some players didn’t like the way that unlocks worked but I think it’s a really good way to handle it and encourages you to try new strategies. \n\n[*]The game has five islands, with one of those being the final boss fight. Each island is basically a different biome with different enemies and environmental hazards. They aren’t necessarily easier or harder than each other to start with, but the difficulty does increase as you move from island to island. There is some crossover with the enemies you’ll see, but they at the very least have a different appearance and most of them behave differently. There are also enemies unique to each island. \n\n[*]On each island, you’ll need to complete several missions before facing off against the island’s mini-boss. The missions all have different objectives for you to complete, though the win condition is always just to survive all of the turns (typically 5 turns). The different objectives vary but there are usual two, with some easier missions only having one and harder missions having three. Completing these objectives gets you certain rewards. You can either get stars, which are used upon completing an island to purchase new pilots, abilities or weapons. There is grid power which restores or increases the grid power you start with (grid power is lost when buildings are destroyed, losing all grid power results in a loss). Lastly, some of the missions award power cores (usually you only see this as the third reward for a hard mission) which allow you to upgrade your mech’s weapons or abilities (super handy). The mission variety is fairly good.\n\n[*]There are a range of different pilots in the game. You always start with one ‘special’ pilot and two regular pilots but more can be found in cryo-pods or bought at the end-of-island store. All pilots earn xp at the end of missions and when they level up they get some kind of upgrade, like more mech health or an extra movement per turn. The ‘special’ pilots all have some kind of special ability, such as being able to attack twice if you don’t move or the ability for the piloted mech to fly. Some of these require a power core, but they’re definitely worth it.  [/list]\n\n[h1]Negatives: [/h1]\n[list][*]Honestly, I’m clutching at straws here for negatives. One thing I would mention is that I don’t think this game will have as much replay value as FTL does for most people (completionists have an awful lot to do here) which shouldn’t put you off from getting it, but is something to base your expectations on. I also felt like Chris Avellone was a bit wasted on this game, his writing is fantastic but there just isn’t much of it. [/list]\n\n[h1]Verdict: [/h1]\n\nInto the Breach is as close to a perfect strategy game as I’ve ever played and it’s an excellent follow-up to FTL. This game is easy to pick up, hard to master and it looks beautiful the whole time you’re playing this weird mech chess. I can’t recommend this enough and at $15 it’s an absolute steal. This was easily one of my favourite releases of 2018 and anyone who likes strategy absolutely needs this in their library. \n\nIf you found this review helpful, please check out my other reviews over at [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33633486/]Kemo's Corner.[/url]",
      "I've played a fair amount of games during my time using Steam.\n\nI've never felt as emotionally moved by one as I have with OneShot.\n\nI don't know if anyone reading this has played Transistor, but if you are familiar with and enjoyed that game, continue reading for a little context. (I'm going to put it in spoilers because it contains an integral part of how the game functions, which is likely better for you to experience on your own, rather than learn about it from a third party. Be warned!)\n[spoiler]\nTransistor and OneShot are very different games, but both of them share a similarity in that they have been the most emotionally moving games I've played in my entire life. They both have a huge emphasis on characters, both the one you play as and the ones you interact with or are around you. They also both have brilliantly-developed environments, The combination of these two things is one of the major factors in why I've gotten so immersed in them previously.\n\nHowever, OneShot affected me notably more strongly and for much longer than Transistor, and that is for a very discernable reason. In Transistor, you experience the stories of the characters. When it all ends, you're still a third party, experiencing things through the \"eyes\" of the protagonist.\n\nOneShot, on the other hand, features *you* as basically an integral part of the story. Because of this slight difference (which may seem negligible or gimmicky at first), OneShot basically destroyed me emotionally by the end - not necessarily because of how it ended, but that it ended at all. It wasn't just story of some other charismatic protagonists that came to a close.\n\nIt was mine, and with it, my connection to everything that happened in the game.\n\nIt's really hard to put into words... but I really wanted to put this somewhere, in hopes that someone understands and agrees. :D\n[/spoiler]\n\nAnyways, random game comparison tangent over. It's a phenomenal game - easily one of tmy favorite games of all time, my only complaint being that it ended. Extremely solid 10/10.\n\nIf you enjoy story-driven adventures like Transistor, Undertale, Night in the Woods, etc., this is basically a must-buy.\n",
      "Based on the generic, cartoonish-sounding name and (at first glance) Hearthstone-looking graphics, I initially ignored Monster Train. But I later read some praise for it that made me think it might be worth a look. Especially since it turned out that I already owned it from a bundle or something. \n\nAnd what I discovered was a compelling mix of the best elements of Slay the Spire and My Life as a Darklord. A run generally takes less than an hour, and with so many possible combinations there's always something new to explore and try to exploit.",
      "The British Forces give the Allies a bit of the German defensive capacities. It has the problem of adding too many buildings to a game that is, in its core, dynamic and based on movement and aggressiveness instead of turtling. The British units are diverse and interesting, bringing much to the table. \n\nThe DLC lacks a proper campaign for the Brits, unfortunately, even though Caen, Goodwood, Arnhem and Walcheren could have been done in some interesting missions.

      "I keep seeing all these negative reviews comparing the game to Dark souls, so i'd like to set this straight:\n\nThis. Game. Isn't. Dark. Souls.\n\nIf you play this game like you would a dark souls game you would not have any fun, I know this because I spent the first 30 hours playing it like a Dark souls game and wasn't enjoying it.\nIn order to play this game how it is supposed to be played you need to start investing more in learning combos for your character, different techniques and items to use.  Each weapon has a unique set of combos you can invest in.  When you learn how to use these combos, you'll find that enemies who were infuriating to fight against being defeated much easier and the game becomes more challenging and fun over frustrating.\n\nSummery: This game isn't Dark Souls, So stop playing it like it is Dark souls!\nHighly recommend! \n\n\n",
      "This is a game that I have been looking forward to for at least 2 and a half years. I have wanted to have a game on the PC that had the elements of harvest moon (for the little bit I played of it), Animal crossing (<3) and Rune factory. I was super excited when I was approached by Leth (publishing manager at Chucklefish) at the beginning of December to help him and ConcernedApe (developer of the game) with bug testing and QA. 400+ hours later (off steam and on steam), I still love the game. \n\n[b]Farming.[/b] The farming is fantastic. It is to me one of the main elements of the game, and it's just a joy. Being able to design your farm any way you want it... yes please. Planning out what to buy every season, where to plant them, on top of the thrill of when you can harvest and reap on the gold... it's so enjoyable and addictive. \n\n[b]Fishing.[/b] The fishing is outstanding. From playing WoW and Runescape.. or any game with fishing, the fishing in Stardew Valley is so much fun. At first, the fishing is challenging, but as you progress your skill, you become a pro in no time.\n\n[b]Mining and combat.[/b] Mining and combat is incredible. Going deeper into the mines can be tough, but if you're prepared with your food and weapon in hand, you can fend off the creatures and get your sweet ore/minerals/gems that you want to bring back to your house and possibly hoard. (Hi, I'm Bexy, and i'm a hoarder.) \n\n[b]Social.[/b] Social interactions are great. Being able to become friends with the people in the town,  and eventually being able to get into relationships with people and having a family with them.. what's not to like about that? And what's great is that it gives great replayability because you can have different saves with different spouses! The backstory for each of the characters too is so in depth and well thought out, you will be silly if you don't shed a tear maybe once or twice. \n\n[b]Main story.[/b] The actual main story is well rewarding, and once you \"complete\" it, you can still continue on your adventures and farming life with no problems, hell you might even discover new things afterwards, I sure as hell did! \n\nYes, I was a tester for the game. Yes, I have played for ridiculous amounts of hours. It may feel like i'm being a bit overzealous with this. However you have to remember, I was a tester. I tested the crap out of every aspect with this game, even though there were massive game breaking bugs, errors, glitches, crashes. I still love this game. I reported many a bug, and ConcernedApe was quick to fix them. \n\nAnd that's the thing, not only is the game amazing, the developer is too. ConcernedApe works around the clock to make sure that bugs are fixed in quick time in order for us to have an amazing experience with this game. And that's true. The experience that you have with this game IS amazing. \n\nMinutes playing turn into hours. Hours turn into \"oh no it's time to sleep\".\nYou will forget about time. You will forget about sleep. You will forget that dinner was about 5 hours ago but you couldn't' remember because you were too busy trying to fight off 12 bats that were clobbering you inside the mines while trying to gather that 1 diamond waaaaay in the back. \n\nSo yes, I without a shadow of a doubt 150% recommend this game to anyone that wants to \"escape\" for days on end with what I am classifying as my #1 Game of 2016.",
      "[h1]Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Save scumming is a game-play mechanic and the game is balanced around the player being able to quick-save and reload whenever they want.\n[*] The game seems highly objective oriented, and I wish there was more optional treasures to collect, as I am a pirate.\n[*] While many guard situations appear to have a clear solution,  you can always just brute-force your way through or take another less contrived route, so the game doesn't devolve into a stealth puzzle game.\n[*] Post-game summary shows your route and enemy eliminations at hyper speed, and is always a fun watch at the end of a level.\n[/list]\nI really enjoy finally having a top-down style stealth game.

Yes, it may be a bit hard for some people but that's what makes it fun. \n\nHyper Light Drifter is a shining example of what a great game is and what an \"Indie\" game can be. Stirpped down graphics can still be beautiful, no cutscenes and dialogue force the use of imagination (God forbid), both for player and desginer, in both telling the story and weaving it into gameplay, and the ambient music is both mysterious and foreboding; setting an atmosphere that makes the game's world feel all the more vast and unknown.\n\nOne of the best games this year, I'm calling it. One of the best gaming experiences I've had since Shovel Knight. There's no going wrong in picking up this title. It makes me all the more bummed that I missed out on pitching in to the Kickstarter; I would've more than gladly given it money for development AND paying the full price for it when it was released. \n\nReally, it's that good.",

Very tedious with doubletap movement to dodge/counter (keyboard)\n\nAlso not very optimized for steam link or the steam controller. In general the worst parts of this game are directly attributed to the fact that this is a port. One of the worst port jobs i've seen to be honest.  Definitely play with a good controller. \n\nThe game also does a poor job of introducing the \"extended\" story, I nearly missed what i would consider the best part of the game just because I stopped after the first round of credits.

      "ORIGINAL REVIEW Posted: Nov 27, 2016:\nExtremely fun and addictive game! That IS if you practice and learn the way the game is supposed to be played.\n\nActually requires a lot of patience, aim control, learning of map locations, etc.\n\nEdit Dec 7, 2018: Stupid crazy full with hackers, now that it's F2P i feel like it's gonna get taken over by even more hackers... RIP 2012 CSGO.\n\nEDIT 2021/09/03: Some of you are morons here... Clearly a huge \"fan\" base of CSGO. I've gathered around 9,000+ hours in total (in my other account as well) No. I wasn't a \"Noob\" or had no skill. I was GE for a very long time.\n\nThis review is from 2018. After all the new updates came into place. I LOVED the game, It was my addiction. After those updates, everything went down hill. MORE toxicity, MORE blatant hackers, and I for one wasn't a big fan of the newest updates. So I decided to leave, updated this review with my most recent experience.\nReviews are meant to talk about your experience, Not to kiss ass and make things look good when they aren't.",

I've had to stop playing this game until they patch it because right now you're just managing bugs and glitches and you will have to design hospitals to get around these bugs, so that means extra wide corridors and spacing items out so people don't get stuck. Which sucks.\n\nNeeded much more playtesting before being released.\n\n*This is from v1.01.*",
      "I reviewed the original Mark of the Ninja more than 4 years ago. I liked its stealth-based gameplay approach and praised the learning curve experienced throughout the story. I bought the [i]Special Edition[/i] which practically meant an add-on with some more levels, a custom and the option to replay the entire game in commentary mode. \n\nYou know some games get re-released due to the availability of a new console generation. This [i]Remastered[/i] edition is what was made available for PS4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch users not long ago. We, PC gamers (who already own the original Mark of the Ninja), can get this version free-of-charge in our library.\n\nThere's not much to say, really. I do not have a 4K display so this higher resolution I cannot enjoy. Compressed in-game art or not the original already looked very good. But the creators confirmed this will give us an enhanced experience even under 1080p resolution. \n\nWell, I did complete the game once again as this is how much I love MoN. I recommend that you do the same.\n\nPS: It may be possible that you are required to have the special edition of the original version to get the remastered version.",
      "[h1]SMOOTH RIDING WITH A FEW BUMPY ROADS[/h1]\n\nFirst off, I am going to get this out of the way. If you are planning to buy this game and wondering which version to get, ask yourself this. If you are a minimalist, standard is fine. If you want the expansions, get ultimate. Deluxe on the other hand I think is worth skipping entirely. If $99.99 is too much for you for Ultimate, just wait for a sale. Ultimate is definitely my choice for recommendation. The amount of content you get is impressive and worth the price of admission. \n\nForza Horizon 4 is a car collector's dream, with a roster of over 700 cars (with Ultimate). And also a racing enthusiasts dream playground with a decently sized map with tons of racing variety and events to play around with. I have tons of racing games on Steam personally, and none have held my interest as much as Forza Horizon 4. It's a shame though that this came so late to Steam. But even still, I got my money's worth with over 120 hours of playtime at the time of writing this. \n\nIs Forza Horizon 4 perfect though? Sadly, it is not. The Steam version is hampered with some unfortunate bugs. People may experience random crashes, which while not happening often after the last few updates, still do happen, as this game is a few versions behind the Microsoft store's own version. Something I don't know if will ever be fully fixed. Also online racing can be hit or miss with issues. Those issues usually lie in the wait times sadly, so it might be offputting for those looking to race with others. Luckily there is more than enough content without having to do online races to keep most people happy. \n\n I'm still giving this a recommend regardless of that issue, just because more often than not, the game does run smoothly. \n\nIf you happen to just get the standard version of the game you get access to the main map which is a caricatured version of Great Britain, which includes many race events ranging from your standard street races, dirt tracks and even full blown off road events. There are also other events which include speed traps, drifting, massive jumps, promotional events (like racing the Halo Warthog, racing against trains, and more), and some cool little story events like racing for Top Gear, or even opening your own businesses. There's plenty of content for sure. If you decide to get the expansions, you get other maps, including Fortune Island, which is, well, an Island, complete with both low and high altitude locations, lots of off roading, some impressive night time visuals (Aurora Borealis anyone?), and more. You also get the Lego Speed Champions map which is a fun and impressively designed map based on the Lego toys which features it's own variety of fun and unique settings, including a beach riddled with pirate ships, a haunted lighthouse, a stunt arena, and more. Also it gets it's own radio station that plays just 1 song on loop. If you guessed that song is \"Everything is Awesome\", you'd be right, Both expansions also come with a unique way of progression and their own vehicles to collect. Fortune Island will have you progress to unlock a variety of treasure hunts, that each unlock 1 million credits, and the Lego expansion has you doing different tasks to collect studs which can be used to build your house and also collect new cars. Both expansions will also include a majority of the types of events you will be used to in the base game, with their own unique flair. \n\nWith 700 cars luckily there is enough variety for anyone. But for those looking for more, you can custom tune each vehicle to your own liking, with a variety of parts and overhauls, including full blown engine swaps. For those who are not gear heads, the community has you covered and you can even download custom tunes from others. Forza Horizon 4 is one of the most generous racing games I have ever played with the sheer amount of cars they dump on you. You can win cars from events. You can win cars from wheelspins. you can win cars from leveling up. You can win cars from performing certain tasks. You can win cars from barn finds, which are like little treasure hunts. You can also buy cars from both an auto show, or take your chances at an in game auction house, which is also a great way to make money, to well, buy more cars. Basically, Horizon does not let you down with the cars. It's like Pokemon for car lovers. And once you have that dream car, don't forget to give it that unique look. Most cars can have some visual parts swapped out, ranging from spoilers to bumpers and more, and you can add custom designs to the paint jobs too. Want to race around in Jurassic Park Jeep? Want to race around in the Bandit 1 from Smokey and the Bandit? Forza has you covered. And if you just want to look at the cars in all their glory, Forza also has a nice little feature called Forzavista which allows to do things with your car like opening and closing doors, and for some vehicles you can open up trunks and hoods and look inside at the engines. If you get the James Bond pack, you can even look at those nifty little gadgets like the machine guns mounted to some of the Bond vehicles. Pretty neat stuff. \n\nAt the end of the day, is Forza Horizon 4 worth it? I'd say yes.",

      "Absolutely amazing. PLEASE don't judge this game based on how it looks. You must try it yourself! I thought it would be terrible but a friend convinced me to try it, and I'm glad he did. I haven't had so much fun in a game in a long time.",
      "Why did i get this game???\n\nWell.. Mainly because i've always liked seeing those big trucks driving by me, So i wondered what it would feel like driving a big tractor trailer, And so i got this!\n\nHonestly, I can't say if it's anything like a real truck, But this game does get very very complicating when it comes to parking with your 53' container, And it makes me wonder, Wow! Those guys must really have some good practice! Because if i can't do it here, I for sure wont be able to do it in real life! xD\n\nMultiplayer is super fun as well, Driving next to other truck drivers and then honking at them, or meeting new friends, SOME actually truck drivers, and then traveling with them, Stopping to weight your freight, getting gas and such, It's a very fun experience.\n\nHonest Rating: 10/10 As of right now, Because I feel like i haven't played enough to experience any problems or bugs, But the game is very fun!! ***ONLY IF YOU LOVE SIMULATOR GAMES, If you don't, Then maybe think twice, But I enjoy simulator games.*** And if you want to give this game a try as your first Simulator game, Then i would recommend it!\n\nRecommendable? Yes, I recommend it to people who want to give Simulator games a try, This is a perfect one. (Or Euro Truck Simulator) Although if you're from the USA i recommend this one, Because Euro Truck Simulator has different driving rules than US, So you might get tickets for some things you don't know lol..",

You can sweat if you want or if you want just races you can stay in the day.\n- Visual customization with community decals, let's go!\n- Online entirely optional, is kind of the same as nfs2015 instead of payback having the singleplayer map but instead allowing free roam drivers which is pretty cool\n- Car profiles like we have in forza, no more taking a racing car into the offroad!

Yes it's the difficulty players wanted but also too much rubberbanding, \"rhino incoming\" taking half your screen not actually letting you see the rhino, game basically requiring you to abuse ramps because there's no proper way to actually deal with cops, etc.\n- Story is short and shitty. Payback as mid as it was did the \"corrupt cop\" storyline better\n- Progression system is taken back by the included powerful starter cars which came from the deluxe edition.

I like the neon style, but the overall teenager stuff and spanish characters (which are here because of the la casa de papel trend) just don't click with me.

      "i don't think i liked it :(\n\na richly illustrated nightmare fairy tale which warns of paranoid infighting and reaching for an unattainable ideal, broken apart by tedious and artificially difficult survival horror segments. i meet each hazard as intended and am often punished with unforgiving damage or by being taken to an instant game over, and while i fully accept that this very well might just be a skill issue on my part, it remains a significant hurdle that's barring me from engaging properly with the unfolding narrative.\n\ni'm not unfamiliar with the death-laden rpgmaker horror-esque titles which preceded LGTS and those it draws its inspirations from, its how it contextualises such flaws that becomes an issue. there are no \"skip seen dialogue\" options, with the fast forward made available to us after Elise's delayed inputs just slow enough to be annoying. on that note, bosses with instant death attacks have unskippable cutscenes prior making repeat attempts patronising. two core survival systems are made redundant within one of the in-game days. perhaps most tragically, the distinct visual style which once pleased the eye beings to blend into monotony and goes unappreciated after some hours.\n\nand like i'm sad about it! i wanted to like it! i really enjoyed how the story progressed and how my bond with my favourite lady bloomed and i liked the endings i've managed to get, but all these hiccups had me nearly just uninstalling early. it's a beautiful poetic horror title, but so many little things simply ended up overwhelming me.",
      "[b] Target Audience: [/b] [I] Anyone with a Soul[/i]\n\n[b] Summary: [/b]  \n\nIt's a damn shame that this game isn't topping people's game of the year list this year, because Wandersong is one of the best story based experiences that I've played on Steam. A game that is beautiful woven from start to end, every element works together in harmony to make what will be a cult classic in my mind: and only a cult classic due to the fact that it should be a blockbuster, but won't get the recognition. The 3 man team took an upbeat story of a young bard on a whismical journey and \nmade someone who usually gravitates toward more depressing/out there stories and fall in love with the Bard, Miriam, and the vast cast of characters here. \n\nThe funny thing is, it's hard to quantify what makes Wandersong such a complete package, because everything works in harmony so well with everything else. Take the music for example: I actually struggled to specifically remember any individual track at first, and that's because the games tracks are so tied to the emotions that you feel during scenes. You are the music in how you play through your game, you experience this game how you want, and it's singing mechanic that alters the world aroudn you allows you to be the player you want to be while still staying in a relatively linear story line. The color and presentation is fantastic, the gameplay mechanics stay just long enough before changing up, it's hard to really think of anything that the game did wrong.\n\nLook, even those who may hate games with less “gameplay” will most likely be charmed by Wandersong's spell. It's a siren of sorts: except it'll make you crash into jagged rocks of love and happiness. Story elements feel earned. Everything has very specific detail. It's clear this was a labor of love, and it shows even in the scene select: where the splooshes by the team just make you smile. You will sit and wonder about your own life after playing certain sections, and the club scene is one of the best set pieces I've seen in character development. Honestly, I really struggle to think of negatives for the game: each thing has a purpose and is there for a specific reason, and executes it beautifully. \n\nIf you're reading this review, it's because you're considering buying the game.

      "I am a day one player who quit the game within a few days. After coming back after almost 2 years, I am shocked and surprised. The overall improvement is great, quests are not bothering you. Story and atmosphere is hooking you up and the overall experience is good. Leveling up is easy and also you are not struggling as in most MMOs.\n\nDespite the past of the game, I think it is worth trying.",
      "Really overrated. Sure the graphics are fancy schmancy, but in the end it feels more like a dumbed-down Left 4 Dead.\n\nPurely from a gameplay perspective, the class specializations are excessively numerous with not that many differences between many of them (and notably, every class can use the same weapons anyway), and the solo mode sucks (no bots, are you kidding me?).\n\nOn other aspects of the game, there is that XP and (cosmetic) items grinding that seems to be the current trend/cash cow. And the fucking ridiculous buying of weapons and ammo within missions because, you know, killing monsters gives you money and in a world completely wrecked by zombies there are automated weapon stores at every corner - seems legit. Feels like that CSGO crap: it's not an FPS as much as a trading \"game\", where you buy stuff ingame and you buy or sell stuff on the Steam marketplace.",
      "I fucking love this game (and the original Guacamelee as well). It's excellent, challenging platforming with a hilarious sense of humor. I'm an archaeologist who works in Mexico and this game is littered with funny and well-researched nods to Mexican history and pre-history. I imagine that matters less to the non-archaeologists out there, but the fact that they took the time to research all their jokes speaks to the care that went into this game.",
      "My god.. Capcom did it. They saved the franchise. I'm honestly shocked. \n\nWhen the first teaser dropped I thought for sure this would just be a P.T. copy which I was sort of okay with. Turns out I was wrong. This is a classic Resident Evil game. Like, RE1 classic. Complete with puzzle solving, INVENTORY MANAGEMENT, and tense stressful boss encounters. The game brings back the storage box system even! I can't stress enough how amazing this game is as a long time RE fan. If you're one too, do yourself a favor and pull the trigger on this one. Best game since RE4.... May even be better.",
      "I thought I could overcome the Chinese Language barrier since I read chinese webnovels, but as it turns out trying to decipher game content is a different ballgame from novels. \nSo far, what I can make of the story is making me cringe and I can't quite figure out the combat mechanics, but I'm hoping that English translation will make it better (optimistic). Probably 5.5/10 for now and I'll revise when i get the English experience?",

      "[h1] Overview [/h1]\nThis is going to be a really long review, so I'm just going to start off with an overview of the whole game. For, one I really enjoyed playing it because of its unique playstyle and interesting storyline. This game kept me engaged the whole time and even though I finished the main storyline, I feel like there is sitll more for me to do. And one last thing, I won't be reviewing Multiplayer here, since I haven't played multiplayer yet.\n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\nThe storyline is definitely a strong point of this game. Rather than giving you evrything from the start, you get thrown into an unknown world with little known about the end of the game and the path that leads to it. You find out more progressively as you search and discover ruins to find ancient relics that give more clues about the past. However, you don't have to explore each area to its fullest potential the first time you enter the game, you can also come back to areas with fast travel (except for at the very end towards the conclusion of the game). The tombs you can raid are also kind of like side quests and the relics that you can find, both inside the tombs and around the map give you insight into the area and the main story. There are also several cut scenes that add onto the story and I thought the experience was a lot more directed than a game such as Skyrim, but it still provides a large amount of freedom.\n\n[h1]Level Design/Graphics [/h1]\nSpeaking of freedom and your ability to enjoy the world around you, I feel like this feeds perfectly into another aspect of the game. One of the most important parts of the modern game is the graphics engine with which it runs, as well as how it is exploited to provide the best experience. Though this Tomb Raider is undoubtedly older than what one would consider modern, I still find that it does a good job with shaders and keeping the world immersive. And though the textures, normals maps, and hair physics may not be the best I have ever seen, they are still very good. The cinematic cutscenes feel actually cinematic and everything seems to be smoothed out with animations which makes the experience itself a lot more enjoyable. I also really enjoyed how this game had well worked out levels, beautiful scenery, and a in fact a partially open world experience. Though some levels will collapse, break, and change once you go through them, other parts of the island are simply very enjoyable slow-paced worlds than can be explored once the game is over, which brings to my next point.\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\nLast, but not least I want to talk about gameplay (please keep in mind this review is directed at those interested in Tomb Raider for the single player experience). The gameplay was fluid and interseting. You have the parkour notion which is one of the biggest parts of the Tomb Raider series. This part doesn't seem to be too difficult in this game, but it certainly isn't easy either. Another portion is the shooter portion where a bunch of guys try to murder you and you protect yourself (because you don't want to die). However, the main part about this game in particular that I like, is that there isn't just one way to go about all this. Somtimes you can be sneaky and try and get around without being seen, or take out any guards before the sound an alarm. Another way is to just run into battle (which I wouldn't recommend). There are so many ways to make your way through the levels. And even though combat was for the most part repetetive, there were some new enemies introduced as the game proceeded, which made the game a bit harder, though not that much harder. The game also introduced new elements to the game as it proceeded which made the experience a bit more dynamic. However, every now and again, the game struggeled a bit with finding where to place the camera, and it gave me some confusing moments. Other times Lara (the main character) would not grab on to the zip line (and thus fall to her death). But other than that I don't really have any complaints.\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\nShould you buy this game? Yes, it will provide you with a great deal of fun, and you will definitely enjoy the experience.",
      "WARNING. This game is pure drug. Don't buy unless You have no kids, no wife and You have a lot free time. I mean thousands of hours.\n\nYour brain will turn into a machine calculating the optimal use of all available resources on the map, there are hundreds of them and each discovery brings new threats from the beautiful mother nature. At some point You may experience unexpected dreams about high tech and well tuned factories.\n\nEarly Access in this case means something similar to never ending story. When You think \"I have done everything\" new update shows up and You're starting doing mess again.\n\nI can only have reservations about the multiplayer mode, where there are funny glitches, disappearing objects, self-propelled vehicles, lack of character synchronization, etc. However, this does not prevent having continuous fun in the co-op mode.\n\nI hope You like it so much as I did.\n\nEDIT: Still thinking of buying it? Don't think, just do it. U8 changed a lot, it's now Unreal Engine 5 with Lumen effects, devs are pushing forward to get final product release. Join the party!",
      "Just finished it. Having trouble putting words together.\n\nI went on a road trip around the US last year, and on my way down the west coast was surprised by how many giant factories passed by, puffing smoke into the air. One even had Google reviews, where it became clear that the town residents who worked there posted good reviews, and everyone else wanted the factory gone.\n\nThose did not compare to the oil refineries in Louisiana, one of which I had to pull off of the highway to properly behold. Certainly I'd seen images of them, but in real life their scale is hard to believe. And they're so bright, both because of innumerable light bulbs and the infamous refinery flame spouts. Even going through the pictures I took while worried the refinery security was going to attack, the size of these things accurately portrayed in none of them. I'd already played the NORCO demo by this point, and had it in my mind throughout my time in the area. There was even an encounter with an old man working at a convenience store somewhere around 1-2am who asked me if I believed in God with a crazed look in his eye, something I would not know was reality foreshadowing this game until the past week.\n\nSo my impression here, forming as I type this, is as follows: \n\nThe surreal imagery and sublime writing in NORCO combine to seem more accurate to my brief experience in the places resembling the real life Norco than any photo or video I've seen.\n\nA lot more can be said about this game, but I'm currently trying to untie my thoughts. So maybe later. For now, just know that I'd thoroughly recommend this game.",
      "What starts as a simple game of jumping over some spikes quickly becomes something so much more. Geometry dash is like Minecraft. No matter how many times you quit, you always come back to it (as you can see by my 700 hours of playtime). For $3.99 you get such an amazing and memorable experience. This game tests your patience and persistence. It tests your emotions. It encourages you to push yourself, overcoming challenges you once thought impossible.\n\n(SHORT ANSWER)\nGet this game.",
      "Minesweeper influenced design feels like a fresh take on the Slay-the-Spire-like genre.  Now that I've won with all six classes, and done some of the unlockable difficulty levels, I feel that I've gotten my money's worth with the game, and I have enjoyed the time I've spent so far, but I don't expect great longevity beyond this point.\n\nI do have some minor gripes:\n\n* The pacing on unlocking new classes feels too slow.  It would be nice if the approach was the fairly standard one of unlocking a new class when you win with the previous one, but here there is a currency which is acquired throughout runs, and I found that I usually had to have two winning runs with the previous class to earn enough currency to unlock a new one.\n* Optimal play with some classes requires memorizing tiles which are revealed, and then on later turns these tiles are hidden.  Taking damage because I misremembered what was hidden behind a tile feels unfun and at-odds with what the game otherwise wants to be.\n* I would prefer if the harder difficulty settings were unlocked from the get-go, rather than grinding through easier difficulty settings to find the challenge.\n\nOtherwise, though, it's a fun game with an adorable art style, and not just a clone of the other Spire-likes around.  Recommended if your expectation is to get ten hours or so of strategic puzzling.",
      "Very calm game with heartwarming moments. Better played with friends. Really brilliant gameplay idea. I just hope it gets a final ending really soon!\n\nEdit: After reaching the ultimate end, I felt bit disappointed. The progress was just straight up boring and uninteresting after years of restarting again and again.\nVery fun game anyways",
      "I'm severely disappointed whenever a game points at the stands and intends to hit a home run, and then instead smashes the pitcher out after the bat flies out of their hands.\n\nIt looks wonderful, it's relentlessly and uncompromisingly unique, and it plays like complete hell.\n\nUnreasonable difficulty, bordering on sadism, a unique idea let down by just-so-imprecise hitboxes and the feeling of being far too weak to take on anything.\n\nI haven't enjoyed this game, I can't recommend it to anyone else, if you buy it and find favour with it then bully for you, but I'll never understand how.",

      "Such a neat concept!  Clear the table under so many \"strokes\".  Where it really shines, however, is all of the surreal bits you can add into your game like giant balls, conveyor belts, or balls that split when hit.  The game always has many challenges to complete that will require you to use the indicated table/ball/modifier and meet its requirements on your run (like make 3 long shots in a single run or pot multiple balls in a single shot).  Complete enough of these challenges and you'll unlock the next feature, but the game gives you a lot of freedom in which modifers you'll use in your run to increase your odds of completing the given challenge.",
      "Very addictive and challenging\nAlthough the whole game is happening on the same map, with the same enemy and the same weapons, it has a lot of replayability trying and testing new builds and characters.\nMusic is good.

Well, here I go anyway.\n\n\"Where do I start?\" This is the question asked by anyone playing Gmod for their first time. It's also my question that I ask about this review I am writing. Hmm...\n\n_The gameplay...the gameplay...hmm... Well, there's singleplayer sandbox. You can do...uh, whatever you want really. Just addon a few addons, and you can be entertained for hours. Battle NPCs, make cool scenes for cool screenshots, explore maps, be a superhero (spiderman addon!), and much, much, much, much- you get my point, right? Almost all content is user-generated. Make your own content! Multiplayer. In Multiplayer Gmod you can roleplay. I'm talking normal RP (DarkRP), Military RP, Star Wars RP, etc, etc. In multiplayer Gmod, you can battle, prophunt (yay), hide 'n seek, and much, much, more.\n\n_Graphics? I'll rate the graphics...drumroll please... 7/10. This game is and older game. Came out in 2006. I guess the graphics are good for 2006, and people enjoy the game and don't complain much about the graphics, but I'm not gonna lie, they are outdated and look old. It's not 2006 anymore.\n\n_Hear the bullets flying. The zombies growling. The people chatting. The boxes jumping... The sound in this game is great! Every sound is loud and clear, and there are a varitey of sounds.\n\n_Play this game. Play it again. Play it some more. Play some now, and play some later. Play it over and over. Play it as long as you want.\n\n_My Personal opinion. Get this game. Now. Get Gmod on sale or not. I'm not gonna stop playing it for a while and I'm already at 50+ hours of playtime. I love this game! WAIT! Before you go and buy this, then you wonder why there are all the missing maps and errors in most games, get Counter Strike: Source, so ALL the textures are supported.

      "Not what the developers promised.\nFeels like a graphics mod for Chivalry.\n\nI'm not a fan of Chivalry either. I had some fun with it, but couldn't bear the clunkiness and wished for intuitive controls and realistic fights. Mordhau promised exactly that. \nAlthough it's equally clunky und even more buggy.\n\nAlso it doesn't offer the option to play in private rooms with your friends (duel mode) or only on paid servers. Inviting a friend to a local match should be a standard feature.\n\nAll the new content and features don't really matter - it's a PvP fighting game.

      "Let's get this out of the way: If you're into Chris Avellone/Obsidian/Black Isle kind of games and know what that even means, you know what you're getting. Another clunky game with writing so good you'll forgive any of its flaws. It's another one of those games: a Baldur's Gate, NWN2, Kotor 2, Fallout: New Vegas, Alpha Protocol kinda game.\n\nIf that paragraph didn't make any sense, the rest of this review is for you. Planescape: Torment tends to be less hack-and-slash than it looks, playing according to a system roughly based on second edition Dungeons & Dragons. But in a big departure from both, you can solve a huge amount of your problems with minimal combat and the real meat of the game comes in your decision making, mystery solving, and dealing with people around you. True to the Planescape setting, Torment is a game about the power of belief and the battlefield of ideas.\n\nI don't want to oversell that because you *will* be attacked by random thugs, some combats are downright mandatory, and there is a very real difficulty spike about three quarters through the game. But the allies you keep and the knowledge you gain can help you bypass some encounters or at least trivalize them under mountains of xp gained from unraveling cosmic questions. \n\nIt's a grim, often macabre journey back and forth across the boundaries of life and death where even the happiest endings are pretty heavy, but it's also a brilliantly written, thought-provoking experience that's well worth the time and money. Just make sure to go deep on wisdom, okay, berk? Don't need some dusty penning you in the deadbook because you couldn't see the dark of things, cutter.",

      "This game may actually be my favorite 2D Zelda game of all time.\n\nI knew going into it that the music by Lena Rain (who did Celeste's music) would be great. It is. I knew the game would be wholesome and adorable since it's by the designer from Wandersong. And it is. What I didn't expect was just how fun and interesting the paint-based gameplay would be. The puzzles constantly make you feel super smart, and the abilities you gain are all super fun to play with. When I first heard about the idea, I didn't think there would be all that many interesting puzzles and mechanics based on painting, but wow was I wrong. The puzzles and mechanics never get old, and there are an absolute ton of creative ideas being introduced all the way to the end of the game.\n\nAnd I certainly didn't predict how incredibly deep and personal the story and overall theme would be. The characters, writing, and plot of this game are astoundingly well done, and they turn a fantastic cozy 2D Zelda game into a truly unique and wonderful experience.\n\nI guess what I'm saying is, Chicory does for 2D Zelda games what Celeste did for platformers. It takes the base concept, turns the gameplay, music, and charm up to 11, and interweaves incredibly deep and emotional threads into every aspect of the game.\n\nI cannot recommend Chicory enough. I did back it on Kickstarter, which is how I got an advanced copy, but the game is better than I ever dreamed it could be. If you like cozy games about discussing feelings and helping people, or you like 2D Zelda games with innovative puzzles and hundreds of collectibles, or you just want to draw butts on everyone you meet, you need to get Chicory.",
      "I'm gonna give this a thumbs up but with like, idk, a cautionary sideways thumb for maybe. \n\nif I read credits right, it looks like this game had all its programming, art, music, and writing done by one guy, so I have to give respect to that. For a real indie game like this, it's very very good. \n\nBut it's still really flawed. If you're looking for a 2D Metroid game, and you've played EVERY other 2D metroid game, I suppose yeah, go for this one, and I think you'll enjoy it. If you're not a fan of metroid, I would not bother, sadly. This game suffers from a lot of problems from metroid games, and does not fix any, and at times exagerates those problems. \n\nThe art style is very interesting and cool, but the way the levels and map design are, leaves most areas feeling like a mess of unmemorable places. \n\nThe combat is INCREDIBLY simplistic, yet somehow bogged down by WAY too many useless weapons and just kind of badly designed controls. I found there were about 5 weapons that were actually useful in the game out of what seems like more than 10. Most enemies you either cheese, or be cheesed. There's no charge up shots, there's not really much nuance to the enemies or bosses. They have about two attacks and repeat while you dodge the same one bullet pattern and just kind of shoot in their general direction. (I played it on hard by the way. Not a particularly difficult game, but even the slightly challenging stuff felt kind of dull and uninteresting.) \n\nThe music was cool again. nothing quite mind blowing, but it was nice. The world itself seems like a mess, but there are cool ideas. The giant robot people were really cool to see. \n\nOne little idea i really liked is that the LOW HEALTH beep sound is actually in sync with every song in the game. I thought that was really cute, and it's not something I've seen any game do. Sounds dumb, but I give a lotta props to that, it was cool. \n\nWriting is okay. I feel it left more to be desired. There seemed to be an interesting world here that wasn't explored enough. It wasn't bad, I suppose, but not really that great. \n\nThat is kind of this game. It's not bad by any means, but not the best game on the planet. Play it if you're in need of a Metroid game, and I'm certain you will be pleased enough despite the flaws. Even if you're just having a hankering for a platformer and have already played Hollow Knight and some other great ones first, I think you should enjoy this, but don't expect a 10/10 game. \n\nGive it a try if you feel it looks interesting.",
      "After almost 300 hours in-game, I might be qualified to review this. I'll start by saying that Larian has really got something special here. I'm glad that the work is ongoing, but the progress is palpable. I've broken down my review into a couple sections to hopefully give you a better idea of what you can expect.\n\n1. Graphics\nBG3 has the best graphics in any CRPG I've played up until this point. The animations still need work, as there are a number of cutscenes where things and characters are misplaced. However, environments, spell effects, equipment, characters, etc., are all meticulously designed and you can rest assured that Larian has painstakingly made even the most inconsequential NPC stand out.\n\n2. Sound\nThe sound design is fantastic. Each spell and weapon attack has a unique sound. The ambient sounds are distinct with each area you are located in, as well as the soundtrack. The soundtrack, in general, is well composed. I could sit on the title screen and just listen to the opening song for a long time. The voice acting is fantastic, especially the narrator. The only issue that I've found with the sound is similar to that of graphical bugs: cutscenes need polish. Sometimes characters don't properly voice their lines when cued. If there is a large fight going on with many different effects at once, some new effects may not properly play either.\n\n3. Story\nNot a whole lot of tied up loose ends story-wise as of yet. However, the intro scene is phenomenal. Probably the best intro cutscene in just about any game I've played. From there, the story picks up on a grand scale, then drops you off in the  starting area. You then begin to pick up the pieces to figure out what is going on and how to best solve your little problem. The storyline so far as what's available in EA isn't overly complex, but the particularly enticing part about it is the number of other smaller plots and characters which lend to the main. Over the course of my playthrough, I've picked up several potential paths which could ultimately be taken probably closer to the midpoint of the finished game. \n\n4. Characters\nI'll keep this one brief, but I just want to take a second to say that all of the characters are very well fleshed out and distinct. Even simple NPC's have personalities which, for the most part, don't strike me as cookie cutter in any way. Care has been taken into writing seemingly each and every character, even many animals and corpses. Many actions you take have an effect on your party's opinion of you, but each character has different preferences. Some party members, however, are a tough to nail down as to what makes them happy, even after almost 300 hours. The personality differences between what is expressed through character dialogue and what changes their opinion of your character can feel a bit inconsistent.\n\n5. Combat\nThe combat is fun and rewarding. Each action you take feels as if it has a distinct impact on the battle. This is partially due to the aforementioned animation and sound effects, very punchy and flashy, lots of pretty colors. This is also thanks, in part, to the combat system adopted from 5th ed. D&D. The die rolls, while not visible during combat, add quite a bit of tension and strategy to a fight. You can't just fling cantrips and spells willy-nilly at random enemies and expect to come out on top (for the most part). The balancing is done well enough to allow for a fair fight, but one that doesn't hold your hand throughout and is rewarding when you win. The world design is also done so well that, anywhere a fight could possibly break out (you can attack/kill anyone), the environment lends a lot of variation and strategy to the fight. The enemies are also very smart, to the point where they will flank and take the high ground on you. Stay frosty!\n\n6. Exploration\nExpanding on the final point of the Combat section, the world design makes Faerun feel alive. There is usually something to find around every corner; exploration is very rewarding. Exploration is rewarded in a few different ways. You can get unique loot (while not necessarily as distinct as titles such as Elden Ring, there is a good variety of equipment to find), find interesting social encounters, or battles. Furthermore, battles can be turned to social encounters or vice versa. The versatility in how the player overcomes different situations is very well thought out. My main grip with the exploration is a personal one, but it's the map. It can get sort of tedious trying to navigate the world using the map. But, the exploration area is not particularly sprawling, so you won't be caught wandering around looking for a particular area for too long. A few important items for side quests also come to mind as being particularly hard to find, as they don't really stand out from the background. But, holding Left ALT will bring up titles for items lying around the area if you want to go that route.\n\n7. Races/Classes\nThe current races available are as follows: drow, human, githyanki, dwarf, elf, half elf, halfling, gnome, and tiefling. The classes are fighter, wizard, rogue, ranger, cleric, warlock, druid, sorcerer, warlock, and bard. Larian has done a good job distinguishing each race and class from one another, whether the customization options or progression. The only issue that I have is that the full PHB selection is not yet available. There are subraces available for each race, each with differing characteristics from another. The subclasses are all very self explanatory, if you are familiar with the 5th edition Player's Handbook. A few names had to be changed for certain things within classes, probably due to licensing issues. Also no multiclassing as of just yet. Curious to see if they decide to patch that one in.\n\n8. Character Creation (Visual)\nKind of simplistic at this point. There are no sliders which allow to you to sculpt the face or body, although there are a fair number of preset faces. A good number of hairstyles and facial hair options, as well as colors to apply. And yes, you can apply beards to female dwarves (lookin' at you, Rings of Power).\n\n9. Progression\nSimilar progression to 5e, except that there are several events which grant XP other than just slaying your enemies. Now comes the main problem I have with EA, the level cap. The world is very well designed and very dense, each action you take for the most part feels well rewarded with XP. But, a full playthrough of all the content could see you sitting at 4th level for several hours before completing. This is especially frustrating because 5th level is when you get your second attack and 3rd level spells. But the loot in the game still allows for a little more variety as it does continue to progress in power/utility even up until the end.\n\n10. Optimization\nI run this on a pretty mid-system (Ryzen 5, 1660ti, 16gb RAM) and I can hold between 50-60 fps when exploring on high settings. When in a busier fight, my fps ranges from 35-45 ish. There are a few bugs which impact functionality (dialogue not displaying during conversation, getting stuck on a character's turn during combat, random crashes, etc.). Luckily, these have all vastly reduced in frequency. While the gameplay is by no means flawless, it has reduced frequency enough to where it's not so bothersome as to ruin the game for me. Just depends on your bug tolerance. If you're a Bethesda fan, you'll be just fine.\n\nJust a final thought before I end this thing. If you just want to experience something different and don't mind playing a work in progress, this game is for you. Larian is fantastic at listening to user feedback for optimization to things as small as simple tooltips. If you want a full experience (and I 100% would not blame you if that were the case), just wait until it comes out. Hoping for early-mid '23.",

      "Techland sold out to Tencent. Let this be a reminder to gamers that no matter how beloved your favorite game studio is, sooner or later they'll have a downfall. \n\nI've been a fan of Dying Light since the first game released in 2015. So it pains me to see one of my favorite series' fall like that with the introduction of microtransactions and garbage live service elements. \n\nThe story in DL2 is somehow worse than the original. While DL1's story was pretty generic, at least it wasn't crap. DL2's story is more generic and all of its characters are absolutely obnoxious (except for Hakon). I don't know why western devs and movie makers think writing obnoxious characters is good. Don't get me wrong, you can write an entertaining character who's obnoxious, but in DL2 they characters are just obnoxious, not entertaining. \n\nThe combat gameplay in DL2 feels off. When you swing your melee weapons sometimes they don't connect with zombies right in front of you when they should. And the gore seems broken. Even with the Gut Feeling update. The gore might look good but it doesn't feel like its actually tied to the combat. For example, you could drop kick a human enemy and somehow all of their hands and legs would rip off after hitting a wall which makes no sense. Somehow DL1's gore is more realistic. With DL2 being a Chinese game now I think the gore might get downgraded later on. \n\nI might be a minority on this one but I never really had any complaints about the parkour. I thought it was a definite improvement over the first game and with the Good Night, Good Luck update they improved it even further. I also don't mind the lack of guns in the game. DL was always focused on melee combat and the lack of guns makes the game more challenging whereas in DL1 nighttime became a joke as soon as you got a powerful shotgun where you could also buy ammo for very cheap instead of it being scarce like in Resident Evil. But being OP and shooting volatiles was still fun in its own way NGL. \n\nSpeaking of night, it's laughable how initially Techland completely nerfed the night time experience just to appeal to casuals. Instead of making the night scarier and more complex in DL2 for the millions of fans of DL1 they thought it was a good idea to appeal to people who dropped the game because they were scared of playing a HORROR game. I'm sure the devs had fun wasting their time reworking a core mechanic of the game months after the game was already out when they could've avoided this altogether if they didn't have the bright idea to remove roaming volatiles. But at least they added them back in and made it similar to how it worked in DL1 though it's not perfect yet. It's BS that volatiles NEED to be hit a certain amount of time before they die now. It feels like artificial difficulty. \n\nTo Techland's credit, they did add a community map creation feature which I think more devs should do for their games. Even if DLC2 sucks and Elyseum is never included in the game, fans can now make their own maps and modes and have fun. I hope they keep expanding on this feature. It's also nice that Techland actually listens to feedback and include requested features as soon as they can. They promised at least 5 years of support and before the buyout it really did seem possible. \n\nI really wanted to love Dying Light 2. And I still do to some extent. But the game fails to live up to the first game even over a year after its release. And after the buyout, I don't think this game will ever do. My hype for DLC2 is almost zero. But that's only because I know almost nothing about the DLC except leaks and rumors as Techland didn't announce anything. I really hope this won't affect the updates Techland makes to change the game for the better but at this point I'm not sure anymore.",

Not really.\n\nEdit: Upon completing this game, here's something I'll have to claim in advance: while still recommending this great game with an 8 out of 10 and it has quite a solid story, I'll have to admit  that apart from Dorothy's hidden scenario, this game did not dig very deep into its cyberpunk/dystopian background, which is really a pity - and it's becoming the reason to expect another game (more specifically, A [b]SEQUEL[/b]!!!!! or prequel) from them :)\n\nVA-11 Hall-A - or Valhalla for convenience - while seemingly was a Waifu Bartending Simulation game, is actually somewhat [i]Papers, Please[/i] with excellent characters, vivid graphics, elaborated dialogues and not-so-mind-fucking gaming mechanics.\n\nDon't get me wrong: I love [i]Papers, Please[/i] and of course would rather NOT say that one is superior to another; they are both one of their unique kind, but with the very same root - under the daily life of dystopia denizens, truth and conspiracies weave with vague notices in advance; and just before you could think twice things are going really, really out of track.\n\nThat being said, I mean these two games are very similiar in story-telling: as long as you enjoy taking in all the random, weird stories as a bystander, just to find out that all these fragments come together and form a bigger picture, this game is definitely for you. And you get cyberpunk waifus, a Joshikousei hologram, a pretty cool onêchan as protagonist - and more!\n\nLast but not least, the developers of this game are nothing but truly [b]RESPECTABLE[/b]. We have crybabies on Kickstarter and Steam Early Access every focking day blaming everything for their faulty products, while this army of two whined [b]NOTHING[/b] about all the fuck-ups in Venezuela unless asked. Game dalayed? Only apologies, no excuses. That deserves a huge fricking medal and Developer of The Year.\n\nGrab the game if you want some real relax and good story before they grab Dorothy. And support the developers! They deserve this, Dorothy deserves this.",

      "I technically got this game for free, as it was bought for me from a friend. And honestly, I didn't really like it. She got it for me, as a means to help with some of my mental health issues I suppose? But it just was very big miss for me, and kinda made me feel worse.

      "A decent fps, good gore, some awful levels, some good ones, some great ones. Pretty okay overall, I'd give it a 6.5/10, which reflect the current steam review score. \n\nWhy the thumb down then? Because It's a massive step down from both TNO and Old Blood. Level design has taken a turn for the worst, it managed to be even more linear than the first one, there is less weapon, setpieces aren't as grand or fun as the previous games. Dialogue is frankly awful, in my opinion, some of them reaching parody level (the father segments are a joke). Thankfully some characters still shine throughout the game.\n\nI'd still recommend it at the price point of around of around 20$ to 30$. You'll get a decentely fun fps with good gunplay and ok levels. However this is not the direction I was hoping a sequel to TNO would take. This game is a big step back from it. \n\nOne last detail that is highly suggestive, but the head bobbing is awful and mods can't seem to fix it without breaking the game itself. \n",
      "Steins;Gate Elite is a great Visual Novel when looked at in isolation. The main problem is that Steins;Gate (the original) exists. I don't mind the difference in art styles, that is a matter of personal preference anyway. Graphics in Elite are a lot more animated, images in the original are more static but also more detailed. What I have an issue with is the missing parts in the story.\n\nThere are a few situations where Elite eliminates choices when compared to the original. I won't spoil details, but in one of the early chapters you can choose to ignore or answer a phone call, leading to alternate branches in the story (they join again soon after, but each branch still contains unique content). Well, you can choose in the original. In Elite, you automatically answer the phone, the other branch is no longer in the game.\n\nAt a later point in the game, I noticed that quite a sizeable chunk of a previously linear story progression (not even an alternate branch) concerning Faris was completely cut out. Again, I won't spoil details in case you just want to decide which version of the game to get and don't know the story yet. It has been some time since I played the original, so I might have missed more instances of missing story parts, but at least this one part was really obvious.\n\nThe missing branches and parts are not really relevant to the overall story, but you probably want them if you want to know more about the characters. Elite is more streamlined, but at least all of the alternate endings are still here. So while there is missing stuff compared to the original, there is quite a bit more when compared to the anime. Then again, the anime added more story after the true ending of the original game. I was hoping that Elite added (and maybe fleshed out) this extra content as well, but no luck here, Elite ends at the same point as the original.\n\nIf you don't mind the art style of the original, play that one instead. The second game (Steins;Gate 0) only exists in it's original form anyway. Elite might still be worth it if heavily discounted since it is the only way to get the \"free\" Linear Bounded Phenogram. You can justify it as buying LBP and getting Elite as a free extra.",

      "[h1] Floppy Knights is just boat loads of fun. If you like tactics games, this is right up your alley. [/h1]\n[b]The Good:[/b] \nThe art style. It is just so fun and creative. From the different faces that Carlton, your AI arm and best friend makes, to the enemies, even including the fully drawn cutscenes.\nThe dialogue. Everything that is said between Phoebe, Carlton, and others is tons of fun and gives plenty of plot to be invested in it. Plenty of jokes.\nThe combat, units, and general gameplay. You build a deck of up to 30 cards with a mixture of effects ranging from straight up buffing your units (or dealing damage to them with positive side effects!), to creating lots of card draw. Every turn, you draw 5 cards and your commander generates it's own card every turn. These feel unique, while not being too many of them to create bloat. You can even swap between sets of decks that you have built before you start a level, allowing you different options to quickly switch up your play style. \nThe music. There is enough of a variation of music that has a quick beat to it, that it keeps you wanting more. The songs along, ESPECIALLY the boss music, had me tapping my foot alongside it the whole time.\n[b]The Bad[/b]\nYes, every game isn't perfect. However the singular real flaw I have found is one singular bug that the devs state is rare, and it really didn't affect my gameplay at all. I wasn't able to interact with something on a map, however I was still able to clear the level. The fix was just a simple reboot, and after that I literally haven't encountered it once, at all. They are aware of it and are working on it!\n[b]The Subjective[/b]\nI'm not super great at tactics games, sometimes really taking my time or making stupid decisions. The game's difficulty to myself is fairly difficult later on, however after sitting back, thinking, and playing tactically (hah go figure!), I'm able to overcome the objective by planning around different units and synergies with the cards. There is always a factor of RNG within games that have deck building, but you can always squish the size of your deck if you so choose to.\n[b]Overall[/b]\nI would EXTREMELY recommend this game to pretty much anyone who likes turn based games that require thinking. If you aren't sure if you like tactics style games, I would HIGHLY recommend picking this up and trying it out. You won't regret it!",

      "[h1]First of all, NISA... the elephant in the room needs addressing.[/h1]\nIf you're going to use D3D11 and try to do stuff multi-threaded, use a 64-bit executable.\n\nMemory allocation and thread pooling work much better in a 64-bit environment. 32-bit doesn't really expand your market share any but causes several compatibility headaches (including memory fragmentation in your resource manager). Please, NISA, stop fooling around with legacy APIs (i.e. WinMM for gamepad input and OpenGL 1.x as you did in Disgaea) and outdated ABIs.

      "Mysterious, claustrophobic, and psychedelic --- this is undoubtedly the most unorthodox game in The Legend of Heroes series. This game is basically what you get when you put The Legend of Heroes, Shin Megami Tensei and a certain Silent Hill title [i](which I won't specify for a good reason)[/i] into a blender machine. Nonetheless, it is still very much an LoH game at its core, though its semi-fandisc nature holds it back from being as coherent of an overall package as its two predecessors.\n\nI cannot stress this enough: [b][u]If you were a big fan of the previous two games, you will not necessarily like this game; on the other hand, if you didn't hold them in high regard, this game is still worth trying out due to its stark contrast in tone and structure from its predecessors.[/u][/b] There is a good reason this game is named [u][b]\"the 3rd\"[/b][/u] instead of \"Third Chapter\", because it is definitely not a direct continuation of SC (i.e. Trails in the Sky Second Chapter).\n\nIf you want more of the upbeat, kingdom-trotting adventure of the previous two games, you're not going to find it here.\n\nIf you want towns full of vibrant NPCs, you're not going to find it here (at least not in the main story).\n\nIf you want a protagonist who wears their heart on their sleeves and acts like your typical spunky JRPG hero, you're not going to find it here.\n\nThis game is first and foremost [u][b]a gameplay-heavy dungeon crawler[/b][/u], one that is light on (main) story but carries some very heavy themes. The most interesting aspect of the game to me is that [i][b]the protagonist Kevin Graham is not a hero[/b][/i] (which is ironic considering the name of this series). This game is his harrowing personal journey, one in which he doesn't set out to save the world, his homeland, or anyone for that matter.\n\nThere are initially only two playable characters, but more and more join your party at a steady pace throughout the game [b](16 in total)[/b]. Be sure to talk to these characters when you swap them out of your party; they are ironically the only source of \"NPC dialogue\" for the majority of the game, and their dialogue updates after every plot point like in most other Falcom games. You know Falcom has done their NPCs justice in FC&SC when their complete absence here creates an uneasy sense of isolation.\n\nThere are visual-novel-like sidequests (called Memory Doors) which serve to further flesh out the characters and setting of this series, giving all the playable (and some non-playable) characters their own spotlight to shine in. To this day the cast of Trails in the Sky still remains my favorite cast of any RPG, and I have to give a good chunk of the credit to this game's characterization of them.\n\nThese sidequests take up a sizeable chunk of the game, which one might argue distract from the dungeon-crawling main game. Fortunately, they don't expire like in FC&SC and can be accessed at any point in the game before the final dungeon (with convenient fast-travel to boot), effectively enabling the player to pace the game themselves. \n\nWord of warning though, some of these sidequests take on a much darker tone than one would expect: there's a very good reason why the console versions of this game was censored [i](don't worry, the Steam version isn't)[/i]. Please be mentally prepared for the final sidequest you come across in the game, i.e. [spoiler]Star Door 15[/spoiler].\n\nThere is also plenty of foreshadowing for the rest of the series littered throughout the game, some obvious and some very subtle [i](I'm looking at you Mr. N)[/i]. Needless to say, this game gives you lots to think about if you are into the lore of this series, especially if you have played some of the later Trails games.\n\nOh, and did I mention that the soundtrack is widely regarded as the best in the trilogy?\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nTo end on a more critical note, I'd like to elucidate the \"semi-fandisc\" nature of this game:\n\nThere is severe disconnect between the main story and side content, with the latter adding nothing to the former for the most part; the sidequests are more of an anthology of supplementary material for the entire Trails series and are only tenuously tied to the main campaign, which by itself is sparse in story.\n\nThere is also an egregious amount of asset recycling from the previous two games. Although this is mostly justified within the context of the story, it's still vexing and makes the devs look lazy. They had the opportunity to add a lot of interesting new locales, especially those pertaining to Kevin and the church, but they chose not to for the majority of the game. Get ready to traverse through lots of familiar looking areas and dungeons...\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nP.S. Advice for 1st playthrough: If you are here mostly to enjoy the story, don't play on Hard; if you value your sanity as a gamer, don't play on Nightmare. Seriously, don't.\n\nP.S.2 When you first open up the game, don't skip the \"Falcom\" logo animation; just sit back and watch. There's a bit more after that.\n\nP.S.3 If you're really curious as to which Silent Hill title I was comparing this game to, potential spoilers if you are familiar with the SH franchise: [spoiler]Silent Hill 2[/spoiler]. Just how deep the similarities run between these two games, I'll let you find out for yourself.\n\nP.S.4 A bit more on the censorship of this game: Falcom cut out large chunks of the aforementioned final sidequest when porting the 3rd from PC to the Sony consoles (PSP, PS3, and PSVita). They did this in order to keep the age rating consistent across the Sky trilogy; the PC version of the 3rd would undoubtedly have been rated \"M\" had it gone through ESRB.

Fuck you Rockstar.",
      "An okay game that wastes your time.\n\n\nI played on the hardest difficulty. For me there was a pretty big difficulty spike somewhere in chapter 6 or 7. Apparently I had been skipping on the battles earlier on and was a bit too low level. No problem, I had just unlocked skill trees for the characters, so some XP spending made things manageable. I had to try the map a few times, but once I downed a few mobs and gained some levels, all was going well. The objective was to kill all the enemies by certain time, and that's what I aimed to do. Except, once I'd killed all the enemies, the objective changed and I would've needed to trudge to the other side of the map and kill the boss as well. Yeah, fuck that.\n\n\nThe combat works round-by-round in speed order. If your characters go faster than the enemies, you can simply spam AoE attacks and kill droves of them before they go. If enemies are faster, you're kind of screwed because they hit hard, you're on the defensive, have to spend turns healing and cannot attack that much. And levels seem to make a huge difference here. Combat seems sort of poorly balanced in this respect; maps are hard at the beginning, but by the end just a joke because you gained a few points of speed and are now overall faster and can spam AoE attack and kill enemies in droves.\n\nThe user interface and usability is pretty archaic. For example, to get out of a menu you have to explicitly click on the button that says \"back\" instead of just clicking a right mouse button or Esc or whatever.\n\nThe writing was quite funny at times. It also seemed of a mixed quality. A lot of times it seemed clearly aimed at 13-year olds.  (Especially cringey are the first pair of \"combat helpers\" you get.) I also did play the game for a lot longer at once than I usually do. I think there's some kind of magical simplicity about it, and it's fun to play.\n\nIt's just, in general, the one thing I dislike the most is doing again the exact same thing that I just did. That's the developers' way of saying \"fuck you\" to me, and so I don't want to play this game anymore. If you don't mind that, and the game looks like something you'd like, then I don't doubt you'll like it. Don't get it for 20 moneys though. 15, perhaps... 10 yeah, sure. Because reading the reviews, the one thing many agree on is the later you get the more garbage the combat gets. So, in essence, you only have the visual novel aspect. And if you're not 13 anymore, I don't know. Play something else perhaps.",
      "If Animus would have ever spent a night of passion with GlaDOS, then this would be their child :) Influenced by Portal series and early Assassin's Creed games, among others, this game is a mind-blowing combination of puzzle-solving tasks with a story which builds a philosophical bridge between religion and science in a way that can only be called a stroke of genius.\n\nI can't say that Talos Principle is better than Portal. It's beyond Portal.\n\nIt takes Portal's approach to first person environmental puzzle solving and, standing on its shoulders, reaches higher, offering you much more sophisticated puzzles of various kinds that sometimes have several layers and sometimes even inter-operate. The reality you are operating in is filled with messages and secrets, not unlike the world of Animus from Assassin's Creed, telling you a story and fuelling your brain. And just like in AC, you get some secondary things to do when you get tired of the \"main\" puzzles.\n\nThe graphics are fantastic. Landscapes are gorgeous. Controls are perfect. Music is superb. Voice acting is impeccable. Length is ideal. Puzzles are mind-bending. Progression is non-linear. This game might be officially \"indie\", but its quality is triple A. Or quad A. To call it non-trivial is like to say that a rocket is non-slow. And what's most valuable, is that you don't feel that profits were the top priority for the makers. The game was.\n\nThe things I love about it the most:\n• Assisted jumping. Just brilliant. If only Quantum Conundrum had it.\n• No fake puzzles based on arcade elements.\n• Weather effects.\n• I can get as close as I can to a wall and still see no blurred textures.\n• Wherever I go, I never get stuck in terrain.\n• Skippable intro movie and sensible menus.\n• Runs on my Macbook Pro.\n• Has a free demo.\n• It's so clever, it feels alive.\n\nThe things I dislike:\n• Loud \"Death\" sequence can give one a pretty good scare when comes unexpected.\n• It ends.\n\nIf you like puzzles - buy it. If you like first person games - buy it. If you like philosophy - buy it. If you like lasers - buy it. If you like finding secrets - buy it. If you like clever writing - buy it.

      "When I first played Battlefield 1 it literally sent me to the hospital, cause you’re supposed to seek immediate medical attention if your erection lasts longer than 4 hours.\n\nThis is easily one of the most badass games  in history. The music, the landscape, the gunplay, the hit register and the satisfying kill effect, EVERYTHING is just amazing. The last true Battlefield game. I enjoyed every second of this amazing game.  \n\nBF1 isn’t fully historically accurate but it is historically immersive. The war stories in this game genuinely made me emotional sometimes and I’m not ashamed to admit that. \n\nAs someone who is more on the “historical accuracy” side of games, I can say without a doubt that Battlefield 1 did an incredible job. Hell, they were even able to be diverse without pandering to anybody! The 1st Russian Women’s Battalion of Death, the Harlem Hellfighters, people from French-occupied northwestern Africa, the list goes on. What sets this game’s inclusivity of a variety of people and groups from other games is that it does so when it has a reason to and is still accurate to the time and setting. \n\nThat’s one of the main reasons why Battlefield 5 pissed me off so much. Instead of a British woman with a prosthetic arm wielding a cricket bat in WW2, why not include Lyudmila Pavlichenko, aka Lady Death, a female Russian sniper who had 309 confirmed kills? What about the French women who fought? They were in extremely small numbers, but they were a thing. Historically accurate inclusion is fucking awesome, and I love when games do it. But inclusivity for its own sake is terrible and it cheapens said character’s presence in the game’s setting. \n\nEven the DLC are fantastic. I remember how amazing I felt when the “for the Tsar” DLC came out and I first played it. I have never seen people fight so hard to the death in a video game without a whole lot of rage. It was amazing. I felt like I was part of the Russian revolution. Please do yourself a favor and buy this game.\n\n9/10\n\nOnly gave it a 9 ‘cause the 1 is already there…",

Your choices matter, dialogue options matter, the order in which you do things matter, even such small things such as the items you hold in your hand matter. Every build is viable, go heavy in Physical stats and you'll have difficulty solving things Logically, but maybe you can brute force your way through something. Go heavy in Logic and you'll be weak in a one-to-one fight, but maybe you'll be so fast to figure things out that it'll never come to that. You'll see things that the dim-witted brute with high Physical didn't. Failure is encouraged, there are many routes in the game you cannot open without failing something else first.\n\nA true combat system does not exist. At all. Physical altercations are decided through dice rolls based on how you've built your character. And virtually all of them are optional. I like this decision a lot. I've always found it immersion-breaking in RPGs when you're just running around the countryside, killing every bandit or animal that comes your way. This one keeps fights realistic with REAL consequences depending how things go.\n\nBarring having to restart my game once due to a bug (quicksave often, autosaves are few), the game had no major technical issues. There was a single point in the game where a vital skill check required a specific skill to be built, and I'm not sure if there were any alternate routes. I couldn't find any, just had to savescum the check. Aside from that, you have options as to how to approach everything. I'm not sure if that was an oversight or if I just missed something.\n\nCan't go into the story much without spoilers (and you DON'T want it spoiled, it's great.) But it's very well-written and even hilarious at some points. But don't be fooled, it's not a comedy game. It tackles very serious topics such as Fascism, Communism, Mental Illness, Addiction, and many other things.\n\nOverall an amazing RPG experience that I cannot recommend enough. Will definitely play through this several times to see how things go with different builds. Highly suggest you purchase this if you have any interest.",
      "This game vs. HOI3:\n---------------------\n\nAdvantages:\n\n1.) The production system is more interesting and engaging, and far more balanced than the old IC system of HOI3. \n2.) The unit creation system is far more in depth and interesting, featuring many different brigade types and support companies, allowing you to change your divisions however you would like. \n3.) This game is far more stable than HOI3.\n4.) This game is updated regularly and has bugfixes regularly too, with content being added free along with every DLC. \n5.) The modding community of HOI4 is far larger with excellent mods such as Kaiserreich, Millenium Dawn, Red World, and Endseig.\n6.) HOI4 muliplayer is actually playable without making you want to shoot yourself.\n7.) China is no longer something Japan can take within 2 months.\n8.) An actual peace conference system and ideologies that actually impact the game.\n9.) Far easier to get into than HOI3.\n10.) Less railroading and the AI wont spaz if you do something ahistorical.\n11.) Planes are no longer as cancer as they used to be.\n12.) Far less micromanagement if you choose not to want to micro.\n13.) A better tutorial (still not a great one though.)\n\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n1.) The research system is bare bones in comparison to HOI3.\n2.) The War in the Pacific is basically nonexistant and naval warfare is awful (to be improved with next patch, being released eventually:tm:)\n3.) People dont really join the war in HOI4 unless theyre directly attacked, making continents like South America completely useless due to the fact that none of the countries there ever do anything but still build up their military, contributing lag.\n4.) Due to the game's engine, it can only use a single one of your processing cores, meaning regardless of your computer quality the game will run kinda slowly.\n5.) Speaking of slowly, the game is poorly optimized and frame loss is extremely common, especially 1942 onwards, when majors can have upwards of 300+ divisions. \n6.) The AI is often braindead, doing hilariously incompetent things such as charging endlessly into your lines, removing all its troops from your front, leaving major areas completely undefended, and completely ignoring the aerial aspect of the war.\n7.) Specific AI are even more braindead than the rest, specifically island nations, or nations that otherwise need to use navies and airforces more. Yes, the Japanese, American, and British AI are some of the worst in the game. In a WW2 game. \n8.) Your allies are completely useless and often you will find yourself doing all the fighting yourself, or even being hindered by your own allies. Playing as Germany the Italians likely wont place a single division in North Africa. In D-Day, you will either be the only one contributing anything or your allies will contribute so much that the supply is ruined and your troops all die of attrition. As the USSR you will recieve 0 lend lease, and as China you will get absolutely no support from the west. \n9.) HOI3 is a lot cheaper than HOI4\n\n\nOther things which I feel are worth mentioning but arent really advantages or disadvantages:\n\n1.) HOI4 contains a lot more alt-history options, which while not for everyone, are fun to try out. \n2.) The focus-tree system is something completely different from anything in HOI3.\n3.) The game has a less in-depth OOB(Order of Battle), which while to some people is nice because theyre bad with OOB, others dislike. Specifically this game lacks corps. \n4.) The battle-planning system of HOI4, while easier to use than the one in HOI3, is still flawwed. In HOI3 it did absolutely nothing, but in this game it is a core part of playing. Unless you want to mircomanage every single division, like you did in HOI3, you will use this system. \n5.) While simpler, the game still possesses a learning curve.\n\n------------------------\n\nOverall: \n\nHOI4 is a far less grounded and historical experience than HOI3. Is this a good or bad thing? That depends on your perspective. HOI4 obviously has significant advantages over HOI3 in certain areas but many consider HOI3 to be an overall better game. Personally I recommend HOI3 if you want a more micro-intensive, historical experience, and HOI4 if you want to just sit back and relax for a couple hours murdering millions of people. \n\nPersonally I would suggest either game, but thats just me."

      "Someone has to be the first, I guess.\n\nI don't know, I just didn't really feel too hooked on the game's premise. I feel less like I'm solving a puzzle and more like I'm hitting a pinata for all the clues. Every replay, I'm just going to have to do something whacky in order to get a new clue as to what might further my cause. And that doesn't really make me feel like I'm a part of a story, as much as a I feel like I'm going through an eternally looping monday, getting increasingly distanced to the world around me as I finally end up throwing myself overboard, because 'why not?'.\n\nI won't refund it, because I think the devs have poured a lot of heart into this game and I do think they deserve the money, but I couldn't really find too much entertainment in the game.",
      "12 years have passed and you decide to update the game by increasing the price, removing multiplayer, radio stations, and adding your shitty launcher, yet you haven't fixed those frame drop issues that have been sticking with us since release and make the game completely unplayable no matter what computer you're running it on.\n\n12 years for this. Fuck you Rockstar.",
      "Volition ups the silly, and adds super powers, but loses a little something along the way.\n\nI loved Saint's Row: the Third, and by all rights should have loved IV as well, but I mostly just liked it. The set up was fun, and seemed to up the ante again, but then you get the presidency ripped away from you almost immediately (without even seeing the consequences of your first pushed legislation!). Placing the game in a virtual city for the most part with the only real characters being on your space ship, really kinda seemed to gut the game. Even when [spoiler]the world gets destroyed[/spoiler], a detached, \"meh\" was all I could muster. The humor is there, but it's mostly better in the DLC. The radio stations feel kind of underwhelming without DJs.\n\nFinally all the fun of collecting and customizing various interesting cars, and finding ways to climb or fall to interesting places with a stolen plane/parachute are gutted with the inclusion of super powers. Also, the super powers make gunplay, leveling any of your other stuff, and pretty much every mechanic carried over from Saints Row: the Third obsolete.\n\nIf you get this game, do yourself a favor and make sure you get all the DLC where most of the real fun is. Is it as good as the previous Saints Row? I don't think so, but I still recommend getting it and playing through it. It is a lot of fun, and I love the 50's break out scenario at the beginning.\n\nStacey's thoughts:\nStill awaiting DLC with Jane Austin and the D*ldo Bat.

The gun play and AI alone is enough for me to justify a refund, I mean shit cops hear the sounds of gunshots right next to them and act like nothing is happening. Immersion 0/10 sorry. I must admit I really enjoyed this game on console, but I am gonna have to take the money and run. Notice how almost all of the reviews just say All YOU haD to do Was FoLlow The DAmn Train cj or Ill HAve TWo NumBER 9s. I cant say I didn't expect this game to be a little shit judging by how old it is, but I will NOT suck it off and say buy it, the actual game play is PATHETIC. In all honesty I think this game remastered with gta v's physics and polish would be SOOO much better than gta v. They really captured the hood life in this one, damn shame it fucking sucks. This game's age sadly isn't up to par and sadly, it's getting a fat thumbs down from this boomer.",
      "I do think the Mixed review rating is justified, but for the wrong reasons.\nHere are a few pro's and con's from someone who's been a long-time fan and played every Dirt game except the first one.\n\nPRO:\n+ Handling and physics are alright on both \"Gamer\" and \"Simulation\" settings\n+ Decent soundtrack\n+ Building and leveling up your staff and garage gives the game more depth\n\nCON:\n- Horrendously inconsistent AI. In roughly 15 years of playing racing games I've never seen AI as inconsistent as in this game. I played on \"Tough\" and could complete some races with a 10+ second gap, while others were quite literally impossible. This is because of the auto generated track system - unlike in the previous Dirt games, the AI never actually drives on the track, but stage times are auto-generated by how an AI *would* likely perform on a stage. \n- Lack of tracks / Boring tracks. As mentioned, there are no proper tracks for Rally events as they are auto-generated. While the tech behind it is quite impressive, this leaves most tracks feeling incredibly dull with no highlights or features whatsoever. Remember the cool cliff sides from Greece in Dirt Rally? None of these here. Essentially all tracks feel the same no matter what the location is. Couple that with the fact that there are only 5 locations and you'll find yourself bored quite quickly. Rallycross and Landrush tracks are not auto generated, but feel incredibly boring and forgettable. Baja or Malaysia in Dirt 2 were such a blast, but Dirt 4? Yawn.\n- Historical Rally. In its entirety. It's just normal Rally with older cars, but after a while I refused to continue this event type as the events are dragged out as hell. Near the middle you'll have to complete 12 events with each 5 stages. That's 60 stages in total. Consider my previous point about tracks feeling dull and I can't help but wonder who actually completed all these events. This seems to be a Codemasters thing though as I had the same issue with Grid Autosport.\n- Menuing. Why is it that I need to go out of the career every time I want to buy a car? Why is selecting sponsors (which you'll do often as they expire after awhile) in the same category where you can customize your car? Everything is a huge mess and finding the right things took me more time than it should every time.\n+ Lack of rewards. I actually found Joyride, which isn't part of the main career, to be the most fun thing to do in the game. Even though the events in Joyride repeat frequently but with different cars, it was a proper challenge compared to the career and is somehow quite addicting. The issue with it is that it's meaningless to complete. You don't get anything for getting a Gold medal on everything, not even new liveries or, heck, even an achievement. It's utterly pointless.\n\nAll in all this game is easily the weakest entry in the franchise (minus Dirt 1 maybe, but that one had a way smaller budget). To top it off it just feels like this game has no soul either. I vividly remember Dirt 2's gritty and colorful presentation, while this one lacks anything I could remember the game by. Really all this game made me want to do is play Dirt 2 or Dirt Rally again. Cheers and thanks for reading.",
      "UGH! The scariest thing about this game is that someone at Steam okayed it for being released. Absolute garbage! Frustrating as heck and not fun in the least bit. If you want a scare, you might accidentally get one through a jumpscare, but don't count on it. Avoid this game at all costs, even if its free, I would be hesitant to recommend downloading this pile of crap. You'll spend the entire time just trying to find things to click on, and when you do, you're rewarded with? some of the worst animations ever to be found in gaming",
      "*Sigh* This game was just tiring. I wouldn't come to say it was a complete rip off of Paper's Please, but it was a very similar game but just worse. Mainly to the point that I played, at most, 10 minutes, I saw multiple repeats of the same messages, and the only updates were legislation, unlike in Papers, Please where you got new rules and new tools almost every day. I won't completely judge the game since I haven't played it the entire way through, but it's just not very good. Plain and simple.",

      "So, I hated this game at first...\n\n I've never been into a MMO before, and I went into it with a mindset of \"FUCK YEAH! MULTIPLAYER SKYRIM LETS GO\" - In short don't do that. This isn't going to be like playing Skyrim, Oblivion, Morrowind. \n\nIt is when it all comes down to the core an MMO, it's set in Tamriel, it sounds like Tamriel and the storylines feel like an Elder Scrolls game. However being an MMO, it has a lot of grindy MMO style quests. And don't get me wrong, it's bewildering at first, all these mechanics, all these places to go....and before the 'One Tamriel' update if you chose the wrong faction, you were screwed, in a place all on your own surrounded by all these people who are WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY higher level than you. But thankfully they changed all of that. The game scales now, so you can rock up to a dungeon with your level V300 mate, and still have some fun slicing up enemies.\n\nSo I saw a friend playing the other day, and spent a few hours installing this to join him (By the way its like 70 Gig...If you have slow internet prepare for a few days of download), I got back on it after not playing for 14 months, but this time I was playing with a friend who was already Veteran Level 250, So I was in luck, he introduced me to everything and I got used to all the deconstructing of equipment to get my blacksmithing up, showed me about dungeons and bascially got me to enjoy the grind. I think my previous time was a bit lackluster because I got dropped in the middle of the Aldmeri Dominion on my own, without any of my friends. So I left.\n\nNow I know what I'm doing, and keep in mind I usually hate MMO's never played WoW or anything like that, this is the first one. I'm enjoying myself, I'm triple digits into this game time-wise and I don't see it stopping now. We've made a guild for noobies. To help them out, and get them to enjoy the game also. Because the community is nice...but you still get the elitist fucks from any competitive game kicking you out of dungeons because you're only level 14. But you won't get that when you're in a guild, having people to play with and explain all the mechanics did help, a lot. I've even gone as far as to buy this AGAIN on steam just to collect my hours and so on.\n\nAdd-ons are awesome being able to mod basic features of the game to help with information and quality of life improvements is a must. I'll provide an essential mods pack if any of you wish to know.\n\nFor those of you who actually got this far into this, well done. I didn't think I'd keep you captivated long enough to get to the end.\n\nIf any of you are new to the game, on EU server and would like to join a guild to show you the way, add me or visit our [url=www.godsofsalt.com]website[/url] and join us on teamspeak, or just message us in game @diseasedcrow.\n\nBut all in all if you like Elder Scrolls and you think you want to try this, just do, I'm glad I gave it a second chance.",
      "\"The good things, the happy things, all of it changes. Nothing can stay the same forever. Still...can you find it in your heart to still love this place?\" (paraphrase)\n\nClannad . . .\n\nOH Clannad . . .\n\nI remember watching the anime in high school, and absolutely falling in love with it. Upon realizing the REAL story was told in a visual novel...I HAD to get my hands on it. I almost died of a joy-induced heart attack when a legitimate English version of the game was released on Steam.\n\nThis game bro. This f***** game. When I was a senior in high school back in the day, this game was my refuge. I was mostly friends with older kids back then, so by the time I was a senior I didn't really have anybody to chill with cuz all my friends already graduated. Its kinda hard for me to make new friends, then and now if I'm being honest. I related to Nagisa a lot for that reason. \n\nI mostly related to Tomoya and Sunohara tho. One of my best friends growing up really reminded me of Sunohara no cap lol. Type of dude who was the comic relief/brunt of everyone's s*** talking but w/ a mutual understanding its done in jest and love. And when things ever got serious we always had each others' backs, and even tho he's a goofball and kind of a meme, he's seriously loyal and a true ride or die.\n\nMany times when Tomoya was expressing himself in this game, I had to almost pinch my face and remind myself I'm not the one thinking these thoughts: I'm playing a VN lol. That's how much I seriously related to Tomoya. In so many aspects and ways that would make my review even longer than it is now if I were to attempt to explain why I relate to Tomoya so much. Yeah, sure that could just be shrewd character design from Maeda Jun's part, but it was almost uncanny how many of the things Tomoya went thru when he was younger/issues with his father/intimacy issues he develops later on in adulthood etc. almost perfectly mirrored what I was struggling with irl. It gave me something to relate to. It expressed emotions I was having trouble even admitting were present in my own self. Maybe that's the real reason I love Clannad so much, and maybe because of that I sit here biased with rose-colored nostalgia goggles. But even if I type this review with a tinge of rose-coloring obstructing my critical eyes, I can say with confidence that Clannad is more than a game. More than an anime. \n\nClannad is an experience. An experience I wish I could forget all about...just so I could experience it anew all over again. Whether you experience Clannad thru the anime, VN, movie, whatever...Clannad is an experience in a league of its own in my book. And the best way to have your Clannad experience is by playing this masterpiece of a Visual Novel. Hands down. \n\nHonestly, I'd ideally have all Clannad virgins go straight to the VN and play it to completion but that's just not a realistic request as this game takes the average player 80+ hours to complete just the main story apart from optional achievements haha. If you're a fan of the anime...why haven't you played the VN yet!? Lol. If you've never seen the anime or movie I'd STILL recommend playing this game. Just keep in mind to use a guide (just trust me on that. please) and be willing for it to be a bit boring at first. If you stick with it, believe me...it's not gonna stay boring for long.\n\nIf you liked the anime but hated the anime ending, PLAY THE VN. No spoilers, but trust me when I say the VN ending is the true conclusion of the Clannad experience. You'll find out what I mean if you stick with the VISUAL NOVEL to the end.\n\nI didn't go to my senior prom. I spent it playing this game. And I don't regret that decision one bit to this day. I experienced this game, standing in similar shoes as Tomoya at that time irl: rebellious kid about to graduate high school with no real goals or aspirations, struggling to find it hard to \"love this place\" or truly find something passionate to live for. I didn't want to go to college. There was nothing I wanted to do there. Most of the people in my grade back then thought I was quiet and lonely freshman-sophomore, then bad news junior-senior when I started acting out. I was just, lost. \n\nExperiencing Clannad helped me find what I was truly passionate about in life. Family. Friendship (as corny as that may sound). Being able to step up for what only YOU can protect when life is calling you to maturity.\n\nClannad helped me see that even though things can get dark... even though tragedies will happen regardless of our efforts to keep them from happening... even though things can never, and will never, ever stay the same in this life...and even if you lose your way eventually... and sadly reach such a lost and depressed state in life, that you mistakenly conclude for a short while you'd rather sever all your connections and ties with the world and everybody in it... in an effort to try to prevent experiencing even more pain... \n\nThat \"loving this place,\" loving this world, loving people, and forming deep, lifelong and lasting connections with this world and its people, NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS, is ALWAYS, ALWAYS, worth it in the end. Especially when it matters the most.\n\nNow I'm not gonna front: Clannad isn't for everybody. Some people just can't get into the moe art style. Some people may find it a bit too melodramatic at times. Some people may find some of the comedy or bits of the story weird, or just not their cup of tea. Some people may find it hard to relate to all of the characters, and for some people it won't have a Cindarella's slipper level of relatability like it did for me. For those people who are kinda feelin \"ehh idk if i'll really like this game\" I'd say it'd be smart to watch the anime first. But if you're feeling good about it and wanna experience Clannad the BEST way: cop this VN. Just wait for the good bits to slowly boil. Patience is a virtue :) And save yourself hours of rage by using a guide from the beginning until the after-story credits roll. With Clannad I'd say its almost always recommended to use a guide.\n\nAnd if you love the anime and haven't played the VN... you're weirdo number 1, 2, 3, 4 and even 5. Haha I'm playin but srsly get the VN already you owe it to yourself to experience the VN. Knowing what happens in the story and getting some events \"spoiled\" doesn't detract from the VN experience. That I promise you. As someone who watched the anime before playing the VN, who's now such an obvious fanboy of the Clannad VN as demonstrated by my wall of text of a review (lol), trust me: I'd bet money you'll love this game just as much as I do.  \n\nTo Maeda Jun, and all of the brilliant writers of this quintessential, modern classic of a story: thank you. Thank you for gifting all of us the experience that is Clannad. Because of your labours, you've helped a wayward knucklehead like me finally be able to declare this in spirit and in truth:\n\n\"I love this place.\"\n\nLong live Kazamatsuri!",

      "I bought the game and the mechanics are fun! The battle system is super impactful and just FEELS fun. It really gives you a sense of satisfaction. And it has interesting elements that really every game should have... but the UI sucks, the classes are genderlocked, and there are so many systems going on at once it's annoying. Like something as simple as a constant notification in the middle of the screen of some other person or random guild you know nothing about doing quests or getting skill points. It's a fun game, but has WAAAY too many minor (except genderlocked classes. Genderlock is never a minor thing) problems that just add up making it annoying to play",
      "Mysterious, claustrophobic, and psychedelic --- this is undoubtedly the most unorthodox game in The Legend of Heroes series. This game is basically what you get when you put The Legend of Heroes, Shin Megami Tensei and a certain Silent Hill title [i](which I won't specify for a good reason)[/i] into a blender machine. Nonetheless, it is still very much an LoH game at its core, though its semi-fandisc nature holds it back from being as coherent of an overall package as its two predecessors.\n\nI cannot stress this enough: [b][u]If you were a big fan of the previous two games, you will not necessarily like this game; on the other hand, if you didn't hold them in high regard, this game is still worth trying out due to its stark contrast in tone and structure from its predecessors.[/u][/b] There is a good reason this game is named [u][b]\"the 3rd\"[/b][/u] instead of \"Third Chapter\", because it is definitely not a direct continuation of SC (i.e. Trails in the Sky Second Chapter).\n\nIf you want more of the upbeat, kingdom-trotting adventure of the previous two games, you're not going to find it here.\n\nIf you want towns full of vibrant NPCs, you're not going to find it here (at least not in the main story).\n\nIf you want a protagonist who wears their heart on their sleeves and acts like your typical spunky JRPG hero, you're not going to find it here.\n\nThis game is first and foremost [u][b]a gameplay-heavy dungeon crawler[/b][/u], one that is light on (main) story but carries some very heavy themes. The most interesting aspect of the game to me is that [i][b]the protagonist Kevin Graham is not a hero[/b][/i] (which is ironic considering the name of this series). This game is his harrowing personal journey, one in which he doesn't set out to save the world, his homeland, or anyone for that matter.\n\nThere are initially only two playable characters, but more and more join your party at a steady pace throughout the game [b](16 in total)[/b]. Be sure to talk to these characters when you swap them out of your party; they are ironically the only source of \"NPC dialogue\" for the majority of the game, and their dialogue updates after every plot point like in most other Falcom games. You know Falcom has done their NPCs justice in FC&SC when their complete absence here creates an uneasy sense of isolation.\n\nThere are visual-novel-like sidequests (called Memory Doors) which serve to further flesh out the characters and setting of this series, giving all the playable (and some non-playable) characters their own spotlight to shine in. To this day the cast of Trails in the Sky still remains my favorite cast of any RPG, and I have to give a good chunk of the credit to this game's characterization of them.\n\nThese sidequests take up a sizeable chunk of the game, which one might argue distract from the dungeon-crawling main game. Fortunately, they don't expire like in FC&SC and can be accessed at any point in the game before the final dungeon (with convenient fast-travel to boot), effectively enabling the player to pace the game themselves. \n\nWord of warning though, some of these sidequests take on a much darker tone than one would expect: there's a very good reason why the console versions of this game was censored [i](don't worry, the Steam version isn't)[/i]. Please be mentally prepared for the final sidequest you come across in the game, i.e. [spoiler]Star Door 15[/spoiler].\n\nThere is also plenty of foreshadowing for the rest of the series littered throughout the game, some obvious and some very subtle [i](I'm looking at you Mr. N)[/i]. Needless to say, this game gives you lots to think about if you are into the lore of this series, especially if you have played some of the later Trails games.\n\nOh, and did I mention that the soundtrack is widely regarded as the best in the trilogy?\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nTo end on a more critical note, I'd like to elucidate the \"semi-fandisc\" nature of this game:\n\nThere is severe disconnect between the main story and side content, with the latter adding nothing to the former for the most part; the sidequests are more of an anthology of supplementary material for the entire Trails series and are only tenuously tied to the main campaign, which by itself is sparse in story.\n\nThere is also an egregious amount of asset recycling from the previous two games. Although this is mostly justified within the context of the story, it's still vexing and makes the devs look lazy. They had the opportunity to add a lot of interesting new locales, especially those pertaining to Kevin and the church, but they chose not to for the majority of the game. Get ready to traverse through lots of familiar looking areas and dungeons...\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nP.S. Advice for 1st playthrough: If you are here mostly to enjoy the story, don't play on Hard; if you value your sanity as a gamer, don't play on Nightmare. Seriously, don't.\n\nP.S.2 When you first open up the game, don't skip the \"Falcom\" logo animation; just sit back and watch. There's a bit more after that.\n\nP.S.3 If you're really curious as to which Silent Hill title I was comparing this game to, potential spoilers if you are familiar with the SH franchise: [spoiler]Silent Hill 2[/spoiler]. Just how deep the similarities run between these two games, I'll let you find out for yourself.\n\nP.S.4 A bit more on the censorship of this game: Falcom cut out large chunks of the aforementioned final sidequest when porting the 3rd from PC to the Sony consoles (PSP, PS3, and PSVita). They did this in order to keep the age rating consistent across the Sky trilogy; the PC version of the 3rd would undoubtedly have been rated \"M\" had it gone through ESRB.

      "I really liked the concept of this game of navigating through orbits to collect crates and then successfully landing on the exit.  However, there just isn't enough content to justify it being sold as a complete product, especially at its current price of $6.99.  You see everything there is in the first couple of levels.  No new mechanics are added to the game as you progress.  The developer admits that the game is too simple and the fix was to add artificial difficulty to make the game longer.  For instance, rather than have intuitive controls using toggles, it requires the player to activate thrusters with one hand and turn them off with another.  The level design stops adding anything new and just adds more tedious narrow paths that must be navigated rather than an actual challenge or puzzles.  Finally, the DLC appears to be “pay to win” rather than getting any new content, it just gives the player access to aircraft that should be included already in the game.  By level 9 it is near impossible to progress any further with the default ship as it cannot accelerate fast enough to get through the small orbit and requires purchasing the DLC to advance the level.",

After all, it has to be ready for take-off in order for children everywhere to receive their presents on schedule. But a wicked troll blasts us out of the sky just as the test drive is about to end. He went over the line and wants to ruin Christmas for everyone on Earth. It is up to us to bring the troll to his senses and save Christmas for everyone.\n\nTLoS brings players to one world and six levels of great platforming that are reminiscent of Super Mario World (SNES) but simplified. There are only six levels total, one of which is a castle, before the final battle with the troll. The only difference is that we will be collecting chocolate cookies rather than the traditional yellow coins. We also lose part of our cloak when we are injured, so it's not uncommon for you to find yourself jumping through the levels wearing nothing but red boxer shorts. For instance, red blocks can give you a new coat, which means extra life, or Santa socks and hats, which give a power-up or simply chocolate cookies. The power-up allows you to throw stones as if you had collected the Fire Flower from Super Mario, and that's about it. TLoS also offers a 2-4 co-op player mode, in which players will be able to work together to complete this short and family-friendly adventure.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3009359595\n\nSimilar to Super Mario World, you walk to a level to choose them in the Overworld. Once we reach a certain level, we are allowed to walk, leap, and even sprint. Additionally, there are other indications on the screen that show you how many cookies you have already gathered and how much time is remaining to finish the level. We get an extra life when 100 cookies are collected. We can activate a checkpoint about halfway through the level to pick up exactly where the checkpoint was reached, instead of having to do the entire level all over again. The game also features side-scrolling and underwater levels. The only problem is that if you quit at level three, close the game and start again, you have to start from level one, so you have to play the game in one go. This means that there are no save points or \"save states\". Considering the length of the game, this is not a big deal, but it's still \"annoying\".\n\n[h3] My Specs [/h3]\n\n[code]CPU: i9 9900k\nGPU: RTX 2080 Ti\nRAM: DDR4 32 GB RAM\nOS: Win10\nResolution: 1440p @144hz\n[/code]\n\n[h3] Conclusion [/h3]\n\nWe are all hoping that Nintendo will release their IPs on Steam so that we can play with them one more time. We may all agree, based on experience, that this is probably never going to happen, but Indie developers are there to make it happen. To avoid the tedious teachings at school, you used to be able to play these types of games in class on the usual Flash Player websites, and now you can play them on Steam. Though it's not a masterpiece, it's extremely minimalistic, and it's unquestionably too short, the 20 minutes I spent playing it were nevertheless a lot of fun, especially because the platforming is accurate and not wonky at all. Just remember, it's very minimalistic and may be too minimalistic for some, but if that doesn't bother you, feel free to go ahead and try it out.\n\nIt would be my personal highlight if there were additional levels, more secret exits, more power-up alternatives, and more hours of overall playtime.\n\n[h2] Final Verdict: 8/10 A typical gas station snack that turns out to be a surprisingly good one.🎅 [/h2]",
      "Disclaimer: This is review from player who prefer story-rich game and haven't played any game by Arkhouse Telegraph.\n\nThe good:\n+ Outstanding 80's-esque visual pixel artstyle. It reminds me of few SNES/Atari/Gameboy games.\n+ Fairly good soundtrack.\n+ Some cutscene/area have fascinating atmosphere.\n+ Run well with Steam proton, so it's likely this game is playable for Linux/Steam Deck user. Although the platformer area might show too many small detail for 7\" display.\n+ Game OST/artbook is available for free on Arkhouse website.\n\nThe bad:\n- While i understand nature of this game require player to find out most thing and go through trial-and-error, some parts definitely need to be explained better. I refer to lack of autosave (for most part of the game), not letting player know about manual save (you can do it by head left after exit for cylinder elevator until you see display/sign \"< S\" and suggestion to visit block H (where you get some guidance).\n- While the manual say i can play R. U. N. E. 3000 first, i have hard time understanding the story and lore/world building. Conversation such as \"DO? DORODO!\" is mostly gibberish and i only can make vague guess based on few specific term (\"V2\", \"50/50\", etc.) and area i've visited. Short recap of previous games (even it's on the manual) could be really helpful for newcomers.\n\nThe ugly:\n* I experience a bug where i fight boss i'm not supposed to fight yet. In detail, [spoiler] after i exit from P block to get symbol cracking code, i was thrown to G block where i fight G-Cat/10th boss. The worst part is the boss HP bar started with red color and auto 3-60 cannon never perform attack. Fortunately the bug doesn't occur again after i load from manual save.  [/spoiler].\n* The gameplay variation/idea is very interesting, but the execution is mixed bags (more explanation on below paragraph)\n\nSaturn Quest: R. U. N. E. 3000 has lots of gameplay variant/modes (Adventure, Shoot'em up, Platformer and many more) to keep the game fresh. While each area/boss have different reason why it's challenging/difficult, many of those is very unbalanced. For example, [spoiler] Bioplatus M-3D/6th boss [/spoiler] require you to have extraordinary eye-hand coordination and multitasking skill. Among all enemy that resemble boss fight, i only managed to beat 6-7 boss without using cheat.\n\nThis game also has very few checkpoint on each area/boss. On adventure/platformer area, you could restart from beginning after spending 10-20 minutes where you have to avoid same trap or collect same item again. On boss fight, that means you'll need to repeat whole fight most of the time. It's could be annoying because since you're forced to find out boss behavior the hard way or repeating tedious part of the fight.\n\n3 HP and lack of difficulty option could be irritating for most modern player. There are time when i found out i only lose 3-10 HP when i use cheat and beat the boss. If there's easier difficulty where i have 6-10 HP, i could beat more boss by myself. But don't get me wrong, i feel really satisfied each time i beat boss (which i deemed can be beaten with practical amount of effort) without cheat. If the developer bother add easy difficulty which has higher player HP, give more Nana and slightly lower boss HP, far more people could enjoy this unique piece of artwork.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nWhile i have some rant, it's really unique experience even though i've played few hundred games. In overall, i have more positive sentiment than negative sentiment of this game. But even though i choose \"Yes\" when Steam ask \"Do you recommend this game?\", i'd rather choose \"Neutral\" or \"Information\" instead. If you're fan of 80's game or really like difficult game, you might come to like this game. But for most people, i'd recommend you to seek other game. Although if you really insist to play this game, you could use Cheat Engine and modify HP/Nana using value type Double (also called float64 or 8-byte float).\n\nP.S. I definitely will play the sequel (Episode IV-VI: White Meteor Saga according to the artbook) [b]IF[/b] the developer bother add easy difficulty option and more checkpoint during boss fight/exploration.",

      "A fun game for drinking parties, take a shot every time you feel like you just wasted 19 cents.",
      "It's a puzzle game about placing toppings onto donuts and delivering them to different areas on the boar. Great vibe and the first few hours are fun, but it gets incredibly repetitive even with the frequent introduction of new mechanics, especially so if you don't click with said mechanics particularly well. If it's on sale, give it a go - you very well might like it much more than I did.",
      "I have it on the Epic store but the amount of stuttering it has made it unplayable so I gave up. I got the Humble choice for $6 to get a steam key and try it on here because I have a few games on steam that run well but run poorly on other platforms like the awful Windows store or the below average Epic launcher, but it's unfortunately the same deal on here for this game. It has done it on two entirely different computer setups for me so that tells me that they didn't bother to spend enough time testing enough different pc setup combinations when it was in development, and my pc setup isn't rare by any means. The look and functioning of the UI and menu's shows that it is a obvious direct console port which would explain their lack of attention to the pc version.\n\nEven giving it a fair shot based on content, it's pretty much just a modified version of Borderlands 2. The amount of dialogue is unbearable. No one in the game EVER shuts up, and every single last word they say is cringe. It's like a kid in fifth grade who laughs at fart jokes wrote the entire script. In addition to everyone never shutting up, the main boss randomly has page-long speeches over the radio just to make sure you get the message that they want you to feel entirely uncomfortable at this game's bottomless amount of cringe.\n\nThe gameplay is identical to BL2, with the only real new noticeable features being that some guns have two functions that you can toggle on and off with the C key and of course the new playable characters. However even without the stuttering ruining the game for me, it's my opinion that BL3's negatives, mainly the insane amount of neverending dialogue and how unbelievably cringe it is, overshadow its positives.",
      "Heard joke once: Man goes to doctor. Says he's depressed. Says life seems harsh and cruel. Says he feels all alone in a threatening world where what lies ahead is vague and uncertain. Doctor says, \"Treatment is simple. Steam is having a sale tonight. Go buy a game. That should pick you up.\" Man siles. Says to Doctor, \"good idea, Doc! A nice relaxing distraction!\" Man goes home. Man buys DF.\n\nGood joke. Everybody laugh.\n\n\n\nBut seriously, I built a working moat with a remote drainage system control tower and a 4 storey above ground fort, becoming a thriving 200-strong hold of what was once a moribund empire of less than 10 dwarves. 100/10 game that is definitely worth the learning curve.",
      "The good:\n+ Great story with satisfying finale.\n+ Endearing main cast/characters.\n+ Great world building meets with 90s Indonesia culture.\n+ Pleasant pixel artstyle. The cutscenes visual is amazing, even though i notice few awkward animation.\n+ Nice soundtrack.\n+ Puzzle is mostly well balanced. Not too difficult and doesn't make you feel bored/annoyed either.\n\nThe bad: - \n\nThe ugly:\n* Some pacing problem. There are so many sidetrack a.k.a. \"To complete sub-task C you also must complete sub-sub-task X, Y and Z\" during chapter 2-4.\n* Sometimes you might have to going around in circles to solve certain task or accidentally skipped something.\n\nDespite few flaws, A Space for the Unbound is definitely best game developed by Mojiken Studio and best story-driven/adventure game among all games created by Indonesian developer. If you like side-scrolling/adventure game (such as GRIS, Unreal Life or Oneshot) or game made by Mojiken Studio/Toge production (such as Coffee Talk or When The Past Was Around), you should give this game a try.",
      "I like to think of this game as what a Telltale game should have been.\nReal decisions that have real consequences. Allies who leave you due to the actions you take, betrayal due to dumb decisions. All of which only happen due to the choices you can make.\nBut instead of quicktime events, you play some games of Gwent.\nSome really difficult decisions as well, ones that i had to seriously stop and think about. A couple of stupidly easy ones as well, but i can forgive that.\nAlso some fantastic tongue in cheek references to other games/pop culture that i had some laugh out loud moments.\n\nYou also get to upgrade and customise your deck as you earn new cards along the way and they do that well. Save a <random character so as no spoiler> and convince him to journey with you? You know have access to his cool card (and trust me, there are some really cool cards). \nBut piss him off so he leaves, well his card is no longer available to you. I'm actually convinced ive missed a possible card or two due to some story decisions.\n\nIf there was one thing i think the game lacks, its risk.\nSome people have complained that its too easy, even on the hardest difficulty, which i think has some truth to it, but even that i dont think is the real problem.\nThe real problem is that if you lose a fight, it doesnt let you continue, you just retry till you win.\nSo if the game asks you, do you engage in a risky fight to save some of your trapped soldiers or do you leave them to their fate, you obviously would always choose the risky fight, as there is no punishment to losing the fight. You just keep retrying till you win.\nIt does take the weight away from a bunch of decisions and i also think it takes away that feeling if triumph you should get when you win the difficult fight and save the troops. You literally risked nothing.\nHowever, There are more than enough difficult decisions that have nothing to do with combat that you will still love this game.\nNot sure how they could fix this at this point, since the story is already fairly detailed with branching decisions.\nMaybe something to keep in mind for the next game. Give us fights that if we lose affect the story badly. Make it feel riskier for us to always choose the better path, so we are tempted to choose the easier one and therefore feel good when we succeed the  hard one, or feel the consequences when we fail the harder path.\n\nIs it worth the cost? I honestly think so, I haven't regret the money ive spent so far. Some people complaining its too short for what it costs (based on the 30 hour estimate, not them having actually played it), but for me its a really good quality 30 hours and i wish more games would take note.\nPeople complaining about 30 dollars for 30 hours are the reason Dragon Age Inquisition had 60 hours of useless grindy soul destroying fetch quests instead of being a streamlined, awesome game.",
      "First of all, i'd like to mention that i found this game by chance. But it's surprisingly better than some RPGMaker game i've tried and it's not your typical RPGMaker which is surprising since it's developed by one person.\n\n[h2]Story/character[/h2]\nOverall the story is good enough to keep myself immersed with the game. However the story and characters aren't really memorable. For lack of better comparison, it's similar with movie which entertain you but you won't remember it for long time. Although it's probably because i've played many top-rated RPGMaker game which have more budget/resource.\n\n[h2]Gameplay[/h2]\nWhile the developer emphasize this game is story-focused game, i would also describe this game as puzzle-focused RPGMaker game. Store page mention 3 hours, but it took me 9.5 hours to beat this game. Although if i never experience bug (mentioned below) and stuck at one puzzle (where i asked help on Steam discussion), i expect i would spend 7.5 hours.\n\nThe amount and variety of puzzle presented on this game is surprisingly very diverse. Some of them are the best puzzle I've experienced even though I've played fair amount of RPGMaker game. Although few others feels repetitive, difficult due to lack of hint or force you to walk around if you miss/skip something. Lack of option to run/always run is also mildly annoying for me.\n\nAnd since the puzzle of this game is rather challenging/tricky for RPGMaker game, here are few general hints from me in case you're stuck,\n[list]\n    [*]Check for hidden/invisible wall.\n    [*]Try to use items on your inventory.\n    [*]Some interactive object have no impact to solve the puzzle.\n    [*]The game show some hint, usually by highlight/flicker certain object.\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Graphic/music[/h2]\nNothing much to say here. There's few usage of stock RPGMaker asset which used accordingly. The music is nice. While the artstyle/visual is on good side, personally i feel it doesn't match very well with space/sci-fi theme. The cutscene CG also looks good.\n\n[h2]Misc.[/h2]\nThis game runs well on Linux with only minor problem. I experienced one bug which makes me unable to continue the game (not caused by Linux, since it also happen on device which use Windows OS), but the developer fixed it after some time. The game only offer single save file which is annoying to me since i experienced a bug and few puzzle are very tricky.\n\n[h2]Conclusion[/h2]\nOverall Mihirha's Legacy is nice RPGMaker despite few hiccups I've mentioned above. The developer is also responsive to my query which is also plus point. If you're RPGMaker enthusiast, you might want to try this game.",

      "8 years of free updates and counting\nCheap price of $9.99 and frequent sales\nHundreds of hours of gameplay\nA crap load of customization options\nAmazing mod support\nTold Epic Games to go away when they tried to buy them out\n\nHow based can a developer get???",
      "\nWell, after almost a year of not playing this game, I must say, the devs did fix most of my issues. *Most*. Creative mode is fun, but you still need to collect stuff to make things, which is incredibly tedious. On top of that, the character dialogue is still really annoying and you need a NASA computer to play at a stable framerate, but hey, you can actually play without getting your ass beat. I'd like to up my ranking to an 8/10. Very fun, but I highly recommend playing with others. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOG REVIEW (outdated):\nThis game has potential, but unfortunately having fun with it is impossible if you aren't a hardcore survivalist.\n\nCritical Issue #1:\nThe main characters won't stop talking. Everytime you eat or hold the torch they say an unfunny one-liner that makes me want to gouge my eyes out with forks. Even Robin Ayou from Subnautica: Below Zero talked less, and the original game had a silent protaganist. Having characters that have constant dialogue that always repeats is just so annoying to the point where I had to turn off the volume. If the main characters were silent but atleast talked with each other, then I could see potential in that. But they just talk and talk and talk and none of it means anything.\n\nCritical Issue #2:\nThe enemies are way too hard to battle. To make better gear, you need to take on enemies that are so difficult to battle. Maybe you could say I'm just not good at battling enemies in survival games, but I was able to easily battle monsters in Terraria, Minecraft, Subnautica and Raft just fine. When your in-game monsters are too hard to defeat without gear that requires you to battle even MORE monsters, it is not fun, repetitive, and frustrating.\n\nCritical Issue #3:\nThe story is in the background. The fact that the story doesn't impact the game as much as it should is probably the worst aspect of any piece of media out there. The game sends you an a goose chase to find the  main story and it is infuriating. The story itself is all over the place. First it just seems like you need to make yourself grow bigger, but then it goes completely off the rails and into this scientist bunker with a robot that gives you quests, but you can ignore him and continue playing. I don't know if they finished the story, but so far it is not good.\n\nSomewhat Critical Issue:\nThere is no setting to dial back the graphics without lowering the resolution to look like Terraria. I can't see, and it is dumb and brings the whole beautiful vibe of being small down, ironically.\n\nMinor Issues:\nThe music is bland, and although I love electronic/synth music, this is just not it. The fact that you can't have bugs as pets or mounts, or even herd them is extremely upsetting. The farming sucks ass, it gives you 4 items of what you grew every 2 in-game days, when you can just find that item in more abundance at the place where it is located. Under the pond... JESUS CHRIST, the graphics are so bad. The wavy filter looks so bad, and you can see the entire underwater area crystal f**king clear, even though other smaller bodies of water have some kind of murkiness to it. Minor issues like this hold back the game.\n\nAlthough this is still in early access, it feels as if they wasted a lot of potential already. For such a unique world and concept, it never really exploits the amazing and obvious things that it can accomplish. Why not grow your own personal army of ants? Oh sorry, you can pick up eggs but they hatch and they aren't friendly. Why not create a raft made of weed stems and lilypads? Oh sorry, you can just build a base that looks like a boat. Although there are much worse steam games out there, and ones that I have hated more than this, this was sort of a slap to the face. It's not god-awful, and there are a lot of good things about it like the cartoony bug designs and the beautiful graphics, but honestly, it's a 6/10 bordering on a 7, and although many others have enjoyed this, being the super critical demogorgon that I am, this didn't exactly \"ground\" me.",
      "This game is basically awesome, under 3 conditions:\n\n1- You get rid of all on-screen icons (i.e. incoming attacks, ennemy spotting)\n2- Do not care about secondary missions only here to further lenghten the game's lifespan\n3- Play the game as you would if  YOU were in charge\n\nBasically, nevermind the Ubisoft micro transactions' system and other abhorrent company induced  greed-leaned system to get stuff faster and more easily by robbing you out of your hard-earned cash...you can finish the game without spending a single dime in the store, it's all pay to win...\nThe open-world aspect is very satisfying and rewarding, in terms of progression, don't fall for the micro transaction system\nCombat is easy even in the highest difficulty setting, but makes you think you are badass when you slash through waves of ennemies, whose AI is rather basic, with your arsenal of rockets, LMGs and explosives but it is satisfying as fuck!\n\nImagine strapping C4 to your plane, jump out of it, have it crashing down an ennemy outpost meanwhile you are parachuting down and throwing hand grenades their way, land on a roof and eliminate the remaining ennemies with fire ammo shotgun and a motherfucking M60 with armor-piercing bullets while throwing dynamites and there you have it...FarCry5 in a nutshell\n\nOh and don't forget about the flame-thrower lol, who doesn't love a flame-thrower scorching ennemies to their own demise eh?\n\nFarCry5 got it all, extreme freedom of how you wanna handle a situation (stealthily or all guns blazing) while being challenging enough in the highest difficulty setting!\nP.S. don't forget to turn off all the on-screen icons, really ruins it for hardcore FPS fans by making it extremely easy, please hear me out, you don't need these!",

This could easily fall flat if it were poorly written, but I found the writing to be fantastic.  Obviouslly humour is subjective so if you aren't onboard with it's humour you proably won't get much out of it.  For everyone else you are due for a hell of a ride as the game is an absolute hoot.\n\nThe game takes place in a kind of openinsh world with your character setting out from a location on their horse. You can either select to \"Wander\" in which case you will make a broad loop out and around, potentially unovering new map locations or encountering a random encounter.  You can also direct travel to locations you have found and will also be told about map locations from NPC's or as the outcomes of various quests.    The world is feels quite expansive with a lot of interesting locations to explore.  There are a couple of central plot quests to pursue and a bunch of side quests as well.  In my 20 hour playthrough I managed to complete the main story but still had a few side things Id managed to miss all the clues for.\n\nCombat in the game takes place in a turn based format that should feel familiar to anyone has played a JRPG before.  You stand on one side, your foes tand on the other and you select your various attacks and abilities from a list specific to each characters class.  As you gain XP  you can choose what skills you buy so you can tailor your character to your play style, with higher skill levels costing increasing amounts of XP.  You can further personalise your character with a swathe of various equiment, almost all of which is humorous and absurd.  The combat is not particularly complex but its good enough and the humour is so good that it really does the heavy lifting for keeping you engaged.\n\nAs you can see from the screenshots the graphics portray everything in stick figures, but everything is surpisingly detailed and the great animation and the little touches really add to the charm of world.  A still screenshot doesn't really do justice to how much fun this game is to see in motion.\n\nThe music and sound are suprisingly good too, with twangy guitars and banjos mixed with good old time whistling and other wild west sounding stuffness.  Once again is better than you have any right to expect from such an overtly daft title and between the lively graphics and relelentless humour It's just another layer of polish to draw you into the games odd version of the wild west.\n\nLook I flat out loved this game. It was a delight. As I said, your milage may vary if the humour doesn't tickle your funny bone but I can tell you now, never have I laughed so hard at a game as I did digging through the spitoons in West of Loathing.\n\nGold.\n\n9 out of 10",

      "I bought this game in order to review it, seeing as there were no current reviews for it. \nI thought I'd help the game out by maybe giving it that tiny bit of publicity it needed to get off the ground.\nIn doing so I have failed. As this game isn't worth reviewing, there is nothing to review. Well, I should say there is stuff to review but I feel as though the dev's didn't even attempt to make this a game that anyone would enjoy. Well actually I'll let them off of the target of \"enjoy\", I'd go further to say it doesn't even feel like they tried to make a game that someone who had nothing to do and was bored out of their mind would say maybe I'll play this for a bit\nI jumped straight in, ignored the help in menu and started playing. It took me at least 4-5 mins before I even had the slightest concept of what was going on and what I had to achieve. Once I did get the hang of it I still thought \"I must be missing something, I'm not really doing anything\" so I ventured to the help menu to find that nope, thats it buddy.\nThe controls are lacking, the soundtrack and the sound effects (which happen to be a melody playing) do not blend at all, (they play completely out of time on top of the soundtrack).\nYou can buy it and prove me wrong, go ahead. This is just my opinion.",
      "EDIT: I nominated this game for game of the year (2023)\n\nLong ago I had heard about this game and how detailed and intricate it could be, and how you could spend hours upon hours building the massive empire of dwarves only for it to all come crashing down in some spectacular but unforeseen way.  Then I got into Rimworld briefly and thought it was ok, but it tended toward chaos a bit too much for my liking.  THEN I heard this game was coming to steam and I eagerly awaited it.\n\nIt's not necessarily that I was too good to play a game with mostly ascii/character graphics (I used to play them a lot back in the 1980s).  I was more intimidated by the depth of the game and not knowing if there was a wiki for it (there is) or how I'd find help if I needed it (I'm sure there's a ton of communities JUST for this game).  I expected that when it came to Steam, it'd be beefed up and worth the wait.\n\nWell it finally arrived and I think I'm STILL a bit intimidated by the sheer amount of options you have... mostly because it's not just me that I have to worry about, but a whole community of dwarves.  In the case of something like minecraft, I could dig a whole intricate tunnel and if stuff starts to go bad, I just high-tail it out of there and recover until I can go back and finish it.  In Dwarf Fortress though, if stuff starts to go bad, you can't just leave.  You are encouraged to deal with the adversity and push onward in the name of greatness... or something.\n\nIn a way it's like role playing, except you don't have to roll character sheets and you don't really control any of the characters directly.  You make decisions about where to mine, what trees to chop down, what to build, what to trade, what to plant, and for every thing there is a season (turn turn turn).  You're forced to deal with death, birth, attacks, sickness, madness, and a ton of other things that I have no idea are coming.  \n\nI keep thinking \"I could do better\" and I start a new game, but then I start to realize that no matter what I do, I'm never gonna have a perfect game, or a game where everything goes exactly according to plan.  I am eventually going to have to buckle down and stick to one game save to see it through.\n\nIf you're like me and starting something new holds a lot more interest than continuing an existing project (ADHD?) you may have difficulty with this game.  At the same time you may become so engrossed in it that you lose track of time and suddenly it's 6am and you wonder why you stayed up all night digging holes.  I'm starting to feel a bit of the madness myself.  (it's almost 4:30am as I write this)\n\nIn any case, it's probably not for everyone, but I'd say if you're unsure, find the non-steam version and try that, and if you can grok what's going on and it interests you, definitely buy this and support the developers... OR buy this and try to stay under the 2 hour refund  limit while you learn the basics (Good luck with that, it'll be 6 hours before you know what happened).  I believe this game is worth the money though (full price).  If you were going to wait for a sale you'd be waiting a long time anyway.  \n\nTL;DR If this looks interesting to you, don't wait! Buy now.  If you aren't sure, do a bit of research and come back and buy it.",

      "Disclaimer: This is review from player who prefer story-rich game and haven't played any game by Arkhouse Telegraph.\n\nThe good:\n+ Outstanding 80's-esque visual pixel artstyle. It reminds me of few SNES/Atari/Gameboy games.\n+ Fairly good soundtrack.\n+ Some cutscene/area have fascinating atmosphere.\n+ Run well with Steam proton, so it's likely this game is playable for Linux/Steam Deck user. Although the platformer area might show too many small detail for 7\" display.\n+ Game OST/artbook is available for free on Arkhouse website.\n\nThe bad:\n- While i understand nature of this game require player to find out most thing and go through trial-and-error, some parts definitely need to be explained better. I refer to lack of autosave (for most part of the game), not letting player know about manual save (you can do it by head left after exit for cylinder elevator until you see display/sign \"< S\" and suggestion to visit block H (where you get some guidance).\n- While the manual say i can play R. U. N. E. 3000 first, i have hard time understanding the story and lore/world building. Conversation such as \"DO? DORODO!\" is mostly gibberish and i only can make vague guess based on few specific term (\"V2\", \"50/50\", etc.) and area i've visited. Short recap of previous games (even it's on the manual) could be really helpful for newcomers.\n\nThe ugly:\n* I experience a bug where i fight boss i'm not supposed to fight yet. In detail, [spoiler] after i exit from P block to get symbol cracking code, i was thrown to G block where i fight G-Cat/10th boss. The worst part is the boss HP bar started with red color and auto 3-60 cannon never perform attack. Fortunately the bug doesn't occur again after i load from manual save.  [/spoiler].\n* The gameplay variation/idea is very interesting, but the execution is mixed bags (more explanation on below paragraph)\n\nSaturn Quest: R. U. N. E. 3000 has lots of gameplay variant/modes (Adventure, Shoot'em up, Platformer and many more) to keep the game fresh. While each area/boss have different reason why it's challenging/difficult, many of those is very unbalanced. For example, [spoiler] Bioplatus M-3D/6th boss [/spoiler] require you to have extraordinary eye-hand coordination and multitasking skill. Among all enemy that resemble boss fight, i only managed to beat 6-7 boss without using cheat.\n\nThis game also has very few checkpoint on each area/boss. On adventure/platformer area, you could restart from beginning after spending 10-20 minutes where you have to avoid same trap or collect same item again. On boss fight, that means you'll need to repeat whole fight most of the time. It's could be annoying because since you're forced to find out boss behavior the hard way or repeating tedious part of the fight.\n\n3 HP and lack of difficulty option could be irritating for most modern player. There are time when i found out i only lose 3-10 HP when i use cheat and beat the boss. If there's easier difficulty where i have 6-10 HP, i could beat more boss by myself. But don't get me wrong, i feel really satisfied each time i beat boss (which i deemed can be beaten with practical amount of effort) without cheat. If the developer bother add easy difficulty which has higher player HP, give more Nana and slightly lower boss HP, far more people could enjoy this unique piece of artwork.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nWhile i have some rant, it's really unique experience even though i've played few hundred games. In overall, i have more positive sentiment than negative sentiment of this game. But even though i choose \"Yes\" when Steam ask \"Do you recommend this game?\", i'd rather choose \"Neutral\" or \"Information\" instead. If you're fan of 80's game or really like difficult game, you might come to like this game. But for most people, i'd recommend you to seek other game. Although if you really insist to play this game, you could use Cheat Engine and modify HP/Nana using value type Double (also called float64 or 8-byte float).\n\nP.S. I definitely will play the sequel (Episode IV-VI: White Meteor Saga according to the artbook) [b]IF[/b] the developer bother add easy difficulty option and more checkpoint during boss fight/exploration.",
      "[I received this product for free from a giveaway]. Only played for a short time, but sheesh, it's a bit of a mess both visually and gameplay wise. There's not much I can really say that would differ from what's shown in the trailer (rather crude MS-paint looking drawings with a few short looping backgrounds). You jump when moving right or left, flappy-bird esque, you dodge stuff going across the screen and from the top, which is a bit boring to me, but some may enjoy it more. You also have to go out of the screen to dodge sometimes, but also if you go too far out (who knows how far) you'll die as well. It might be an okay time waster for free (like old flash games), but I wouldn't recommend spending your money on this.",
      "Holy fuck. I wish I could recommend this game. I really, really wish I could. But there's just so much frustration with the core experience that kills me, to the point that I cannot see myself going through to the end.\n\nOkay. The graphics, story, music, world design and even some of the small design features are incredible. I don't need to tell anyone that. I love Studio Ghibli, and as a fellow composer, Joe Hisaishi's music. However, the core aspect you probably noticed I left out is the gameplay. Yeah.\n\nThe amount of grind in this game feels unreal, which as a JRPG I wouldn't care about, but the combat system is so utterly meaningless. I saw a review that said something to the effect of - the game works on \"if you find a difficult section, you can't outsmart it, just have to grind until it's not difficult anymore\" and that is the most accurate sentence I've heard about any game. A third of my playtime is grind. The sacrifice of static turn-based combat is the game has a major lack of input from the player, but also a lack of responsiveness when the player actually needs to make quick and smart decisions. For reference, I got up to when the game gives you a dragon and essentially sets you off on a quest for 3 magic macguffin items, where it should open up, but that's when the majority of grind kick in.\n\nImagine you were playing Pokemon, but every evolution resets your level. No hyperbole, it resets the level to 1, and you have to grind it up all again, spending about an hour to get back the stats you lost, which itself is dependant on the evolution actually being worth it (it usually isn't). Not only that. but all the Pokemon you catch also only come at level 1. That is this game. What I find incredibly difficult about this is you have to willingly handicap yourself to progress for an hour, and if you try to evolve your familiars in bulk, you end up with a useless party. This whole system of catching creatures they directly took from Pokemon, meaning they saw how leveling up worked and thought this needed to be changed. It was a very deliberate design decision. Not to mention you often get multiple evolution paths that drastically change play-styles with little to no indicator to what you're actually choosing from.\n\nAs a kid, this game would be too complex with too many systems and options to handle at once. As an adult, I don't have the time to pour hours into a game that so frequently disrespects your time. If this game wasn't animated by Studio Ghibli, it would've been forgotten about quickly. Change my mind.",

      "(If you're past a certain age, I can just say that this is Take Two Interactive's \"Bureau 13\" game, except actually done WELL. If not, keep reading.)\n\nTechnobabylon was one of the best games I played in 2017 (yeah I know it came out in 2015, shh). Wadjet Eye has done it again with Unavowed, one of the best games I played in 2018 and an amazing capstone to all of their work so far. You can play this game without having played the Blackwell series, but you'll get a little more out of it if you have.\n\nIt's also a rather dark piece of work, with a tone somewhere between Sleepy Hollow (the TV show) and something like Buffy. Your character (whose gender and former profession are chosen by you) gets possessed and goes on a year-long murderfestival rampage across New York City. Eventually the Unavowed, a brave supernatural-evil-fighting duo show up, and with the body back in your own control you sign up to fight evil with them. \n\nAs the game goes on, you recruit more characters in Bioware style, solve mysteries (all of which center around that year of hell your character went through), make Tough Choices and work to make the city a better place. All in absolutely gorgeous 640x480 resolution pixel art. \n\nThere were a couple of puzzles that slowed me down (the word \"LEGS\" is going to cause me to make faces for weeks) but this mostly flowed very smoothly. If you're at all a fan of past Wadjet Eye creations, this game needs to be in your life. If you're not, it's a good starting place, maybe the best starting place except that its quality might spoil you for the rough patches of past games.\n\nThis game contains some gore, some body/existential horror that might be jarring to some, and a lot of swearing.",
      "Would I recommend DBD? ...It's complicated.\n\nDead By Daylight is an unique experience of asymmetric hide and seek/tag with shifting rules. \nIs the game fun? Yes. Is it creative? Yes.\nIs it fair and enjoyable? Well, it depends.\nGames get very intense, and playing as killer is some of the most intense gaming experience I've ever accumulated...\nWhich is where things often go wrong. The survivors seem to have decided that the killers have to honor strict code of rules. Don't use these items, these abilities, or these strategies. If you do, you'll be insulted after the game.\nIf you follow these rules, the odds are that you will spend the game running in literal circles, the survivors will win, t-bag you at the gate and then insult you after the game. I don't know about you, but that kind of ruins the game for me. It is actually kind of amazing how helpless one can feel in this game.\n\nSo to conclude my thoughts; I really like the game, but I also really hate it. I can't recommend it, as every time I fire it up, there is about 50% chance I feel more harassed, than entertained.\nI play a lot of online games, from League of Legends to Tekken, but this is the only one that makes me frequently think: \n\"I should really uninstall this\"\n\nEdit: \nI returned after a long break, and I still kinda like the game. \nHowever, same pattern repeats whenever I return. Eventually, I get teabagged one time too many and uninstall the game. The game is fun, the community could not be much worse. And sadly, that often ruins the experience.",
      "I really liked the concept of this game of navigating through orbits to collect crates and then successfully landing on the exit.  However, there just isn't enough content to justify it being sold as a complete product, especially at its current price of $6.99.  You see everything there is in the first couple of levels.  No new mechanics are added to the game as you progress.  The developer admits that the game is too simple and the fix was to add artificial difficulty to make the game longer.  For instance, rather than have intuitive controls using toggles, it requires the player to activate thrusters with one hand and turn them off with another.  The level design stops adding anything new and just adds more tedious narrow paths that must be navigated rather than an actual challenge or puzzles.  Finally, the DLC appears to be “pay to win” rather than getting any new content, it just gives the player access to aircraft that should be included already in the game.  By level 9 it is near impossible to progress any further with the default ship as it cannot accelerate fast enough to get through the small orbit and requires purchasing the DLC to advance the level.",
      "Is Duskers a fun game? Yes. Would I recommend it? No, because of one simple reason:\n\nA lack of content with no mod support.\n\nDuskers is a little like No Man's Sky in the sense that the first few hours are filled with fun and wonder, but everything afterwards becomes a disappointment because the game turns out to be far more shallow than it initially seemed. As a player, I yearned to explore more of the randomly generated galaxy in Duskers because I wanted to see what other horrors, mods, and derelict types I would encounter in the empty universe - but in the end, it turned out that there was really very little else to see besides what you find in the first couple of hours. \n\nHere's a quick rundown of where the content was most lacking:\n\n--Enemy types: there's only 4 different enemies. FOUR. They also behave pretty much identically with the exception of the last one.  This was definitely the biggest interest-killer for me. \n\n--Derelict types end up mattering very little. Government A? Salvage C? Military B? It really doesn't change the layout in a particularly noticeable fashion, with the only differences being 1-2 extra ship defense turrets or something like that. \n\nI really, really wanted to give Duskers a thumbs up - I loved the aesthetic, I loved the atmosphere, and I loved the unique command line interface - but unfortunately, after a few hours, I came to realize that there's really just not enough actual content here, and that's heartbreaking for fans of this niche genre like myself.\n\n",

      "It's more of a mixed recommendation but the positives outweigh the negatives if you're a returning fan.\n\nEverything in the game that's an adaptation of the original FF7, I love.  It gave me major nostalgia vibes to walk through a gorgeously rendered versions of FF7's environments.  The combat is much more engaging - no more watching a tv show on the side while I button-mash another random encounter.  Many of the big story moments still hit and I found even more to love in the characters based on their performances going beyond text boxes and blocky animations.  Even the music is just top-notch.  The OST will be a mainstay in my playlist for years.  It feels like I'm seeing the old game with fresh eyes and remembering why it made such an impact.\n\nThat said, the new content feels like a filler arc in a beloved anime.  Your character falls into a random hole like 3-4 times, spends 2 hours fighting random baddies, and then walks out like \"right, so back to that thing I was doing.\"  I don't even know if a new player could understand wtf is happening with Sephiroth because he's never really introduced and certain essential events are never explained.  It tries to take some clever left-turns on the plot so returning players have new surprises to enjoy but it often feels pretentious and pointless.  The ending gave me flashbacks to Peter Jackson's Hobbit trilogy because of how unnecessarily forced it was and the sudden cartoon levels of action.\n\nI'm tentatively enthusiastic for the sequel but there's a few troubling signs I hope don't become a trend.",
      "In 2013, after 10 years of waiting, the Sim City community of modders, fans, and aficionados rushed out to purchase the fifth installment of Sim City. Ten years is a long time to wait for a game, but people had a lot of faith in Maxis when they announced the title. Long story short, it was a massive dissapointment. Maxis and EA crippled Sim City 5 with DRM, Always On APM, tiny maps, forced origin installation, lacking mod support, no steam support, and a forced multiplayer aspect.  I decided to not purchase the title, so it may have been a decent game, but 2 years later a team of 12 people created a game that does everything maxis insisted was utterly and totaly impossible.  \n\nEverything the mod community did that kept Sim City 4 on the shelves in Wallmarts across America for an entire decade was ignored. Maxis (and to a lesser extent EA) ignored the fans, and gave the people who had kept them in business for twenty years a crippled subpar game.  And for that Maxis is now out of business. They will never make another game, and it is no one's fault but theirs.\n\nNow pretend none of that happened. It's 2013 again, and here it is people: Sim City 5. \n\nThe game balance is a bit on the easy side for veterans of the genre, but the potential map size is ENOURMOUS and customizing your city could fill up years of gameplay time.  The game runs so smoothly with so much going on, it really shows how lazy Maxis was with their approach.  The glass in buildings reflects the sun and the buildings near it, there are dynamic shadows, zoning is back, and it is not 'dumbed down'.  A single tile in this game is twice the size of the alloted map in Sim City, and you can purchase dozens of additional tiles to expand.  The map editor is awesome, the community is thriving, there are mods to do anything you want, and this is the city building game we've all been waiting for.  I can not possibly reccomend this more.",
      "The Witch's House has been my most favorite RPG Maker horror game for years and now I have the remaster which I can buy to directly support the developer. Needless to say how good it is so I will only talk about what is changed and what still remains.\nThe game is still suspenseful and very atmospheric. Some people may worry that the updated graphic and engine may take that away but trust me it is still there and not going anywhere.\nSome sound effects/dialogues have been changed beside the graphic which I am not against it at all. Still very like the remaster.\nThe control is still the same which is as clunky as before when you are not used to. I think the developers know that and decided to not change it so I won't complain. Just say it out for you to know because the game is very old so the control is still there in the past with many other RPG maker games.\nI very like the new graphic and I think they deserve much more compliments for this. However, I like the weird-big-eye Viola model and her less hair skinny portrait more. It look weird and funny at the same time. The new model makes her more beautiful but the portrait makes her kinda fat (at least to me).\nThe new hard mode is.... hard that all I can say without spoiler.\nI don't know whether or not I should calll this a remake but at least it is done better than DSR. And Small indie developers should be supported more. May be \"Ib\" will be remastered some days too if this game is success\nThump Up!",

      "Armored Souls Prepare to sigh....\nIf you are a long running fan of this game it's a mixed bag, if you are new to the series you might like it.\n\nFor the new comers this is robots on roller skates, also screw the natural laws of physics because it makes a cool game.  The key to this game is overwhelming fire power and maneuverability. Here's the rub for me I have AC1 and a PS2 to play it on, I have every US release of this game since AC1 to AC4A, I never finished Nine breaker as it was boring. Below are my gripes, my praise, then my mixed bag in order of paragraphs.\n\nFirst the bad: this game is infested with mechanics that are from Dark Souls and have no place in an AC game.  In no order here they are: status effects, stunning other players,  firing hand weapons cause you to stop moving and leave yourself vulnerable,  repair kits (the flasks from souls), being stunned due to poise (or whatever new dumb name they called it), resupply before a boss fight, and 360 shields.  Stats effects build up like they do in dark souls, this is new to the franchise and really has no place in it, I could see heat weapons causing things to over heat more quickly and maybe some other things, the way this is done is so odd, it feels like a multiplayer add on.  Although its fun to stun bosses and other opponents, this is new to the game and feels like it doesn't belong, I can only assume its been added for competitive multi again.  There's always been this idea that traumatic impacts don't hit the pilots in this game, it's just always been like that and considering the tech it make sense. The latter is true for your AC being stunned too.  AC as a series has gone back and fourth on making you stop to fire a BACK mounted weapon unless you had quad legs or a tank base, this game is the first where a hand weapon makes you stop to fire it.  This is an utter anathema to the game in general, maneuverability and quickly timed dodges were always key.  It ruins your ability to stay moving and fight effectively, which also limits the fun in building and designing your AC.  I don't think there is an AC game in the US with \"repair kits\" yet.  I'm not saying get gud we don't need repair kits, but they are just a distraction to me with no added value.  Giving a player a very high health value is not bad, but I makes each engagement more meaningful, I need to keep my HP high, their are may fights I had where I didn't need to bother with them.  Adding to this mess is the boost before a boss fight, they were never announced like this before; whatever HP you had going in was all you got.  This sticks with me, because the most memorable boss in the whole series was the only one I cannot beat: I took too much damage before the boss fight every time, no magic box to helped me out.  For those of you who are curious it was Zinaida in last Ravens, the suicide drones took too much out of me before the battle.  In AC4A and AC4 there were 360 shields, I'm only guessing, but the shields seemed to mitigate damage.  I don't know because don't get hit or kill them fast has always been my basic plan.  In this new one, its just another health bar that exists for reasons... I don't mind the old shield system give up a defensive advantage for things like assault armor blasts.\n\nThe good stuff.  I like the mix of common enemies being easily dispatched, but still being a threat if you are too slow.  Adding to this is the more dangerous commons like the quad leg MT's.  There is a good combat balance here with crazy mini bosses mixed in like the stealth sniper bots. The bosses are big and badass, with some conventions thrown out the window like the bull charging boss not being weak after a charge. I did hate all the boss fights that involved a 360 shield. The world looks great, yup just darn purdy.  The new super fast tank base inspired by a wheel chair is dumbly fun.  The odd addition of quad legs letting you basically hover is novel and adds some depth to the outfitting of an AC.  Keeping reverse joint legs making you jump faster/higher is classic. The more effective AOE weapons on groups feels more strategic or a the very least feels damn cool when you nail three targets with one shot. Finally letting your AC back mount hand weapons and switch to them at the price of a second or two is a massive evolution, I love it, it should have always been there.\n\nSo there some other things that have changed, which I have mixed thoughts about.  There's now a thing with chips that make you more resilient to damage and other RPGesq things, cool I guess, its another reason to do the arena.  I still will kill them all until I am #1. Hidden objects are now in the game, I don't like them, but whatever, first time I have had to google anything on AC game other then where to buy it.  The plot is oddly boring for me, I think that's just me, last game being AC4A. The game announces when you are making a plot altering decision, its ok, but I would like it if the world just reacted to my decisions naturally no banners.  Weak spots on bosses,  ok its a thing, but firing an AT or plasma weapon at something (that isn't a soft spot) does nothing...not matter how many impacts, ehhh fine. \n\nI'm not done with the game, but over all fun.  Quit making armored souls and make Armored Core.  I was here before demon souls and I will be here after whatever souls, but only if you just keep making ARMORED CORE.  Is there a Japanese word for purity of purpose or ideal? I could use it to try and get my point across. \n\n\nP.S. the fan community paint jobs uploaded on line are gold.\n",
      "Very calm game with heartwarming moments. Better played with friends. Really brilliant gameplay idea. I just hope it gets a final ending really soon!\n\nEdit: After reaching the ultimate end, I felt bit disappointed. The progress was just straight up boring and uninteresting after years of restarting again and again.\nVery fun game anyways",
      "Steam version Review (For veterans coming from the mobile version):\n\nHi everyone! I've been a long time fan, playing the game on mobile since 1.5 (Theory of everything)\nThe Steam version is great, because, PC versions are always better, so if you have the mobile version and you're looking to \"Upgrade\" your game, this is your ticket. I highly disagree with people who try to crack the game. Come on, what are 4 dollars just to support the person who made us this amazing game? With that said, I will list all the pros and cons, comparing to the mobile version:\nPros:\n-Obviously better graphics, the backgrounds look beautiful and the blocks are more detailed, you can also adjust graphics to your prefference, varying from quiality, windowed mode resolution, as well as some other adjustments.\n-The level editor interface is VERY comfortable, there's a shortcut key for EVERYTHING. Nothing compared to Bluestacks. Using the new layers mode, you can classify your objects of the level in groups, for example, you can use one layer for solid blocks, one for decor, one for effects, etc... Incredibly helpful, as this will prevent you from constantly fighting with the game, in order to select an object which is placed in the same location as others.\n-Gameplay is great. Multiple ways to jump, and keys to place and remove checkpoints on practice. Really looking foward to being able to make your own controls scheme on 2.1!\n-2 exclusive icons. 'Cause why not, exclusives are always good.\n-Incredibly faster online performance. On mobile, it' almost impossible to save your progress. On PC it's done quick, songs are downloaded fast, as well as levels.\n-Tired of your phone/tablet running out of battery but you want to keep playing? No longer a problem! Unless you don't pay your electricity service (Higly unlikely) or have laptop (Just play while plugged in).\n\nCons:\n\n-Obviously, this great version cannot be taken on the go, so... Back to mobile GD.\n\nAlas, I'm done. This version is amazing. Recommended 100% to every Geometry Dash mobile player and newcomer as well. Thanks for reading, hope this makes you decide to buy the game!\n10/10 -IGN",
      "This game surprised me in how good it was. I had heard about it, like everyone, and also like a lot of people I had dismissed it as a watered-down Dark Souls clone with a Star Wars skin, and let it collect dust in my Steam collection.\n\nI was wrong. The game's combat is tight and polished, just the right difficulty on Normal. The movement, the general game feel, is superb. The game has a competent story with excellent characterizations, character arcs, dialogue, exposition, world-building, and pacing.  The music feels like top-shelf Star Wars without being a lazy copypasta of John Williams's score (though you'll hear sprinklings of familiar motifs throughout, of course). \n\nThere are collectibles (they are all cosmetics), but it's a tasteful, reasonable amount of them, and they are distributed in a way that feels fun instead of like a chore, and you're never pressured into collecting them with menus or reminders; they are entirely optional in both a technical and a psychological sense. I actually found it fun to collect new appearances in order to play dress-up \"Fashion Souls\". \n\nThere are bosses, and they are challenging but not frustrating. Definitely easier than Dark Souls's harder bosses like Ornstein or Artorias, but still tricky enough that it feels rewarding to overcome them.\n\nIf I had to describe this game in two words, it would be \"just right\". There is just the right amount of each little element that it feels fun, never tedious, never like a grind. I'm a jaded old man who has seen it all and who is not easy to entertain, and I found this game extremely refreshing. If you read this review during the sale where it's only 3.99 USD, get it immediately.",
      "[h1]After over 600 hours (played a few months extra via gamepass), im ready to drop a 'goodbye' review[/h1]\n\n\nI've bought this game knowing what im getting myself into, as i was playing FH4 for roughly 500 hours, being in a discord community that is very engaging with the game and players and is in an overall high quality, it made me want to keep playing both Forzas for way more time than initially intended, so im really grateful to these discord groups and their staff and members for this reason.\nWith that being being said, playing on your own will make your experience way quicker to be burnt out than with a community (and i aint talking about co-op convoys, but just getting more content by other players you can befriend with and talk to online). Community-wise, the game feels kinda the same like GTA V online, where you're dropped into an unnamed massive server with random players around you, yet arent given enough tools to properly communicate with them. Add to that, the horrendous platform that is called MS store / Xbox console companion that feels so damn clunky that even befriending and chatting with other friends is a gauntlet on its own, and makes you feel like you really need to find an actual community on a 3rd party platform (discord is generally ideal for this), or else you're being left to play alone even if the game is in online mode. These hurdles can be felt regardless if playing the Steam version or MS version, as making a MS account is necessary for this game to work and be connected online.\n\n[b]Ok, enough chatter about friends. . . .[/b]\n\n\nThe game itself is great and welcoming for the car newbs and car nuts alike, and no matter where you are on the car spectrum IRL and in the gaming world, you will feel the fun of this game especially if this is your first or 2nd Forza Horizon experience (i.e - you havent played FH 1-3). FH4 was quite similar to this one but had a lot more passion put into it, while FH5 has been given lots of QoL updates over its predecessors. Things like increased amount of props and the ability to put props in route creation so now you can design your own tracks with props involved, turning this game into a gmod-like experience if you're so inclined, alongside adding 'rules' to the driving experience, turning any typical race into a minigame of its own, with different objectives than just 'finish first'.\n[b]Important side note - [/b]This game is mostly for arcade fun and not designed for sim racing in mind, meaning that any gripes you have about its physics, sound, lack of competitiveness, etc, are quite redundant as there is always a fragile balance between fun and realism. Also, this game will not fulfill your mid 2000's NFS vibes, at all. This game is its own sub-genre of sorts and is less about weeb car upgrades (tho there are plentiful overall) and nitro, and more about car veriety and making new builds.\n\nThe game is structured with a playlist system - Each month is divided into 4 seasons (4 seasons per month - one per week). The months are called 'series' which the game devs are pushing into the game, and you have a month-long content to enjoy, with a weekly 'reset' time for each season (happening every thursday afternoon). Each month has its own theme, e.g - japanese cars, offroad racing, classic cars,  high performance track cars, etc. Each week (season) you get a new playlist of objectives to do (this is generally referred to as 'the weekly grind') like certain tournaments and other stuff. Playing with no pause would take you about 5-10 hours to finish an entire weekly playlist, in a typical non tryhardy playstyle.\n\n[b]Other content in this game[/b]\n\n* Over 700 cars in total, and more are being added every month with new (free) updates.\n* A spacious open world map of Mexico where you can drive freely with other players, (randoms or friends), either as freeroam or as a grouped convoy.\n* Co-op mode with random lobbies or friends you invite ahead of time.\n* Online racing, when you're playing against upto 11 other players (no bots) in typical fashion racing for xp and money (in game currency, called cr for short).\n* Community-made tracks - This is where the real fun begins especially if you're a member of a group that delivers high quality custom tracks. These tracks can have any theme in them like high/low performance cars, any road type, etc.\n* Auction house - You can buy and sell cars in an auction with other players.\n* Forza-official radio stations with genres like EDM, pop music, hip hop, rock, and lots of latina-based music.\n* Community livery and tunes - You can create and share your own car tunes and liveries and take others' from the community database.\n* Countless other minigames like capture the flag, zombies, super7 (custom objective-based challenges), and even a full scale battle royale mode.\n\n\n[b]My GamerTag is Avees128, so check out my custom tracks / tunes if you feel like it![/b]\n\n\n\n[b]Game versions and DLC expansions - Which to buy?[/b]\n\nThis game has 3 versions - Standard, Deluxe, and Premium. In general, you should only be thinking to buy either the standard or the premium version, as the deluxe only gives the (base game and) car pass, which is a free access to a bunch of some other cars you could eventually get in game anyway, without paying for that game version. The premium version of the game also adds some other meaningless car packs and (more importantly) 2 expansion maps.\nNow, you could see the fairly negative reviews these 2 expansions (Hot Wheels and Rally Adventure) have on steam, and this is because the reviewers have compared these DLC's to the DLC's from the past FH games, which were objectively superior to these current ones in most ways. Do you care about Hot Wheels at all? If no, skip it. Are you a rally fanatic? If no, then skip this one as well.\nImo, these 2 DLC's dont give an enjoyable content (and im not even a fan of HW nor Rally), especially when being compared to the past DLC's from FH4 (personally played and loved every inch of it) and FH3 (have not played at all but i only hear positive things about it and its DLC's - which ironically, one of them was HW).\n\n\n[b]Performance - [/b]I have a Ryzen 9 5900x + AMD RX 5700xt. When testing the built-in benchmark a year ago, i was getting the following results:\n\n1080p high - 113 FPS\n1080p ultra - 79 FPS\n1440p high - 99 FPS\n1440p ultra - 69 FPS (nice)\n\nUpscaling (FSR/DLSS) in this game is really bad, both for AMD and nVidia tech, so avoid these if you can. I cant comment on Ray Tracing since i cant run any RT features with my GPU, but from what i can tell, its minimal RT at best (which also means minimal performance drops). The game really loves Smart Access Memory / reBAR, so make sure you have it enabled if you can for a great fps boost of about 20% !.\n\n\n[b]In conclusion - [/b]The game itself is great and is a legit time sink (for better and for worse), but if you're not engaged in a welcoming community, it will be a relatively short amount of time (50-100ish hours till you'll feel exhausted from the endless grind of everything, so bare that in mind). If you're unsure if this game fits your flavor of racing game, i would either opt for the standard version or just try it out via gamepass and see how it feels like (just note that there are NO cross saves between the MS store platform and steam, so you will need to start over if you're switching between versions!).",
      "After almost 300 hours in-game, I might be qualified to review this. I'll start by saying that Larian has really got something special here. I'm glad that the work is ongoing, but the progress is palpable. I've broken down my review into a couple sections to hopefully give you a better idea of what you can expect.\n\n1. Graphics\nBG3 has the best graphics in any CRPG I've played up until this point. The animations still need work, as there are a number of cutscenes where things and characters are misplaced. However, environments, spell effects, equipment, characters, etc., are all meticulously designed and you can rest assured that Larian has painstakingly made even the most inconsequential NPC stand out.\n\n2. Sound\nThe sound design is fantastic. Each spell and weapon attack has a unique sound. The ambient sounds are distinct with each area you are located in, as well as the soundtrack. The soundtrack, in general, is well composed. I could sit on the title screen and just listen to the opening song for a long time. The voice acting is fantastic, especially the narrator. The only issue that I've found with the sound is similar to that of graphical bugs: cutscenes need polish. Sometimes characters don't properly voice their lines when cued. If there is a large fight going on with many different effects at once, some new effects may not properly play either.\n\n3. Story\nNot a whole lot of tied up loose ends story-wise as of yet. However, the intro scene is phenomenal. Probably the best intro cutscene in just about any game I've played. From there, the story picks up on a grand scale, then drops you off in the  starting area. You then begin to pick up the pieces to figure out what is going on and how to best solve your little problem. The storyline so far as what's available in EA isn't overly complex, but the particularly enticing part about it is the number of other smaller plots and characters which lend to the main. Over the course of my playthrough, I've picked up several potential paths which could ultimately be taken probably closer to the midpoint of the finished game. \n\n4. Characters\nI'll keep this one brief, but I just want to take a second to say that all of the characters are very well fleshed out and distinct. Even simple NPC's have personalities which, for the most part, don't strike me as cookie cutter in any way. Care has been taken into writing seemingly each and every character, even many animals and corpses. Many actions you take have an effect on your party's opinion of you, but each character has different preferences. Some party members, however, are a tough to nail down as to what makes them happy, even after almost 300 hours. The personality differences between what is expressed through character dialogue and what changes their opinion of your character can feel a bit inconsistent.\n\n5. Combat\nThe combat is fun and rewarding. Each action you take feels as if it has a distinct impact on the battle. This is partially due to the aforementioned animation and sound effects, very punchy and flashy, lots of pretty colors. This is also thanks, in part, to the combat system adopted from 5th ed. D&D. The die rolls, while not visible during combat, add quite a bit of tension and strategy to a fight. You can't just fling cantrips and spells willy-nilly at random enemies and expect to come out on top (for the most part). The balancing is done well enough to allow for a fair fight, but one that doesn't hold your hand throughout and is rewarding when you win. The world design is also done so well that, anywhere a fight could possibly break out (you can attack/kill anyone), the environment lends a lot of variation and strategy to the fight. The enemies are also very smart, to the point where they will flank and take the high ground on you. Stay frosty!\n\n6. Exploration\nExpanding on the final point of the Combat section, the world design makes Faerun feel alive. There is usually something to find around every corner; exploration is very rewarding. Exploration is rewarded in a few different ways. You can get unique loot (while not necessarily as distinct as titles such as Elden Ring, there is a good variety of equipment to find), find interesting social encounters, or battles. Furthermore, battles can be turned to social encounters or vice versa. The versatility in how the player overcomes different situations is very well thought out. My main grip with the exploration is a personal one, but it's the map. It can get sort of tedious trying to navigate the world using the map. But, the exploration area is not particularly sprawling, so you won't be caught wandering around looking for a particular area for too long. A few important items for side quests also come to mind as being particularly hard to find, as they don't really stand out from the background. But, holding Left ALT will bring up titles for items lying around the area if you want to go that route.\n\n7. Races/Classes\nThe current races available are as follows: drow, human, githyanki, dwarf, elf, half elf, halfling, gnome, and tiefling. The classes are fighter, wizard, rogue, ranger, cleric, warlock, druid, sorcerer, warlock, and bard. Larian has done a good job distinguishing each race and class from one another, whether the customization options or progression. The only issue that I have is that the full PHB selection is not yet available. There are subraces available for each race, each with differing characteristics from another. The subclasses are all very self explanatory, if you are familiar with the 5th edition Player's Handbook. A few names had to be changed for certain things within classes, probably due to licensing issues. Also no multiclassing as of just yet. Curious to see if they decide to patch that one in.\n\n8. Character Creation (Visual)\nKind of simplistic at this point. There are no sliders which allow to you to sculpt the face or body, although there are a fair number of preset faces. A good number of hairstyles and facial hair options, as well as colors to apply. And yes, you can apply beards to female dwarves (lookin' at you, Rings of Power).\n\n9. Progression\nSimilar progression to 5e, except that there are several events which grant XP other than just slaying your enemies. Now comes the main problem I have with EA, the level cap. The world is very well designed and very dense, each action you take for the most part feels well rewarded with XP. But, a full playthrough of all the content could see you sitting at 4th level for several hours before completing. This is especially frustrating because 5th level is when you get your second attack and 3rd level spells. But the loot in the game still allows for a little more variety as it does continue to progress in power/utility even up until the end.\n\n10. Optimization\nI run this on a pretty mid-system (Ryzen 5, 1660ti, 16gb RAM) and I can hold between 50-60 fps when exploring on high settings. When in a busier fight, my fps ranges from 35-45 ish. There are a few bugs which impact functionality (dialogue not displaying during conversation, getting stuck on a character's turn during combat, random crashes, etc.). Luckily, these have all vastly reduced in frequency. While the gameplay is by no means flawless, it has reduced frequency enough to where it's not so bothersome as to ruin the game for me. Just depends on your bug tolerance. If you're a Bethesda fan, you'll be just fine.\n\nJust a final thought before I end this thing. If you just want to experience something different and don't mind playing a work in progress, this game is for you. Larian is fantastic at listening to user feedback for optimization to things as small as simple tooltips. If you want a full experience (and I 100% would not blame you if that were the case), just wait until it comes out. Hoping for early-mid '23.",
      "[b][i]AMID EVIL[/i] is very much [i]Quake[/i] 1 level design in a [i]Hexen[/i]/[i]Heretic[/i] universe.[/b] It's well done. We're a bit spoiled this year with outstanding '90s FPS shooters. Personally, I prefer both [i]Ion Maiden[/i] and [i]DUSK[/i] over this title for the following reasons:\n\n1) I find [i]AMID EVIL[/i] to be a bit generic in terms of theme; the fantasy setting could use a bit more to set it apart.\n\n2) I prefer real or low fantasy weapons/guns over wands and totally high fantasy weapons. Now, don't get it twisted - I appreciate that these high fantasy weapons exist, but yeah, they leave something to be desired. I miss reloading and all of that. \n\n3) The level design in [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is much more 'sprawling' (for lack of a better term) just like the original [i]Quake[/i]. Most levels are indoors in what feels like an underground compound (at the time of writing this review). I personally like the backwoods feel of [i]DUSK[/i], or the dystopian cityscape of [i]Ion Maiden[/i] far more. I want to look up at the sky in most levels.\n\n4) The enemy design is different than the other two games I mention, which is good - but they all mostly have a 'same' kind of feel. The enemies are all super fast, so most of your efforts are focused on running backwards while fending them off. It's fun, but gunplay isn't quite as fun as the other two games for this particular reason.\n\n5) The font and overall menu system definitely feels 'Early Access'. I know the font is being worked on, which is desperately needed. \n\n6) My favorite way to play the game is Endless mode - and I feel like that's a flaw in itself. It's the opposite for me with [i]DUSK[/i]. I want to fall in love with the campaign, but eh, there isn't really any story or anything all that interesting to suck me in. The secrets are super easy to find compared to the other two games, too.\n\n7) No multiplayer. Now, I really don't care about this - but who designs a game in this genre without building this in from the ground up? You know the community is going to whine about this. Questionable design decision to say the least.\n\n[b]Well, it sounds like I just dumped all over the game.[/b] Please don't get me wrong. [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is a welcome addition to the genre. The *great news* is that this is not just some reskin of [i]DUSK[/i] - it certainly is it's own thing. And that's really important. \n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+Fairly polished game for Early Access\n+It's the most modern version of the original [i]Quake[/i] we've seen this year\n+Well optimized\n+Lots of content right now\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-The universe is generic\n-No multiplayer\n-The font is too hard to read\n-Music is nothing to write home about\n-The secrets are easy, and there really aren't all that many of them\n-Weapons could use more 'oomph' to them; also we should be able to use the special ability when we want to as opposed to it autotriggering\n\n[b]I was psyched out of my mind for [i]AMID EVIL[/i] - and while it is certainly good - I think I'll be focused more on [i]DUSK[/i] and [i]Ion Maiden[/i].[/b] Because, let's face it, gaming time is valuable and we can't play everything.",
      "Overall its a great hunting game. The base game is good enough on its own to give you an enjoyable experience hunting several varieties of animals. \n\nI feel that some of the best content is in the DLC's. I dont mind the price tag for maps are they are just a large and some of them have a truly diverse animal population. \n\nThe Weapon Packs have some items that really should have been available in the base game (.22 rifle).\nTripod stands, Tents and ATV's are also DLC items that i feel should have been included in the base game. \n\nThe cost for these packs are not huge, and I have bought them, but they really do impact your play in a meaningful way so it is hard not feel like they were left out on purpose. \n\nBeing a former hunter in real life I would say that the realism of it is pretty good. Lung shots and heart shots drop animals quickly and using the right ammo along with good aim greatly influences this. A poor shot will leave you tracking this wounded animal across the map till you sneak up on it again or just give up. \n\nThey have a system called Tru Racks (sumthn like that) that simulates different qualities of animals. So you end up with little bucks, average bucks, and monster bucks. Weight and coloration plays a part in this too. In short every animal has a trophy of some kind and they are varied by what must be some sort of RNG. \n\nAll that having been said, this game can devolve into a shooting gallery were you kill everything on sight as there in no real incentive not to. You get money and experience for every kill you claim and wiping out a heard of deer with your DLC M1 Garand on your DLC Tripod Stand becomes the quickest way to bypass the grind.\n\n It feels like the game starts as a \"hunting sim\" and becomes a \"poaching sim\" once you realize the progression system is going to take a long time to do...\"ethically?\".\n\n\nAgain, this is a game i would recommend, but it is just that, a game. \n\n",
      "Melatonin is a simple rhythm game, with a focus on ease of gameplay and calmer sounds.\nIf you're expecting something on the tougher or more upbeat side, this ain't it.  Ironically, I had more fun as I stopped focusing on scoring well, and more fun when I was just feeling the music and half-asleep.  The sounds and songs are quite relaxing lol.\n\nOn the shorter side of games, it still delivers an enjoyable experience in what it offers. The timing is a *little* on the forgiving side, and there are even accessibility options if you need a little more help, such as timing circles, metronome, and a bigger Perfect window.  If you'd rather go for a challenge, a Perfect only option is also available.\n\nControls are quite simple, using [strike]4[/strike] 3 directional keys and an action key (Space by default). In each tutorial, you're told whether you'll need to hit directional keys or the action key, and whether they're held or not, as well as general timing.  For some stages, the instructions don't give you as good an idea as the tutorial itself/timing circles do (Work and Time levels for me).  All good, but in some levels you get tempo changes in the middle of the song that can throw you a bit off, especially if you're just grooving to the audio cues... when you can hear and distinguish them.  Unfortunately, there are a few levels where the audio cues are either far too similar to each other, or happen too quickly to react to.  This can be a bit of a bummer, as I prefer working off audio for rhythm games, as their focus should be lol.  \n\nWhile Melatonin doesn't bring a whole lot to the table, it doesn't need to.  Less is more here, and the art and sound direction definitely hit their target.\nRelax.",
      "Good lord, do we have a Game of the Year 2017 candidate here or WHAT?\n\nA million twin stick shooters have come and gone over the years since Robotron.  Many have compared themselves and failed.\n\nEugene Jarvis is the creative consultant on this title - so if anything has some \"spirit of Robotron\" in it - this is the game.\n\nThe game is Robotron + Gauntlet with a bunch of secrets rolled in.  As will all good twich arcade games, greed plays a central part in the game.  If you just want to mindlessly blast your way through the worlds - you can.  But you will not be rewarded for it.\n\nScoring high in this game is all about the multiplier - and the multiplier is all about saving humans (which can be harder than it sounds).  You have to chain your pickups of humans to get the highest multiplier.\n\nYou'll bring some great weaponry along the way; Rocket Launchers, Laser beams, smart bombs - even a melee sword.  Powershot is my fav :)\n\nAlong with the regular crew of bad guys,  you'll have special things to find and destroy too.\n\nCROSS PLATFORM leaderboards and local co-op play seal the deal.  Throw in a much of mini-achivements (feats) and you'll be so damn hooked on this game.\n\nIf you love twin stick twich arcade games?  Don't even think about it - BUY NOW.",
      "It's a pretty game, but there's no option for manual saves, and autosaves only happen once in a great while instead of immediately after solving each puzzle or progressing through conversations. I also felt like the walking was extremely clunky with the mouse and keyboard, and I'd prefer click-to-walk.",
      "When I show new games to one of my friends she always asks if it is possible to pee in the game and sadly I usually must tell her that it isnt possible because there is so few games where this special detail is being paid attention to. But this here my dude! I tried to show her the game yesterday so I got her setup on the valve index and start the game all good, but we couldn’t move at all... We tried everything! We tried physically move in our vr room to see the boards that had text written on them because we spawned behind them which I found a little weird as well. On the board it said eat the hamburger to start the game or eat the poo to guit. I saw a box on the street and I remembered by seeing the trailer there was a box where inside there was a burger so immediately we worked hard to try and reach the burger so we could start the game. It was too far away for us to try and actually in real life walk to it so we had to just accept defeat. She didn’t get to see her first vr game where it would be possible to urinate. I saw a update post a few minutes ago where you were saying something about movemnet in the game that you have to grip and throw arms around or something? This I guess we didn’t try since usually moving is one of the triggers to teleport or just the stick like in any controller. Today we will try again and hopefully succeed in our task to urinate in a vr game! You could be making history today my friend. And for all the bad reviews for this game I want to just say a couple things: cmon dude. Its one guy whos making this game! It is cheap and early access... those already tell you a lot about the game and you should not expect a triple a title and the experience of the century. I went through a video game making school or whatever which took 3 years so it was not 2 weeks online course I just quit after the first week so I actually know a lot what it takes to make games and with this I can tell there has been some hours used to it, but again it’s only one dude. My game didn’t work either, but it might have been because we didn’t know how to play. I’m not complaining for 4 dollars, I’m not a hobo ;)\n\nEDIT: And there it is! A day after my review and a 170mb update with new features and a fix for not been able to play at all :) I wasn't able to walk earlier either, but I suppose yo may not be able to in the \"mainmenu\". Gotta go try the update once my friend visits again!",
      "The story of this game is interesting and well written, but it doesn't fully make up for the game's flaws. Here are the problems I saw with the game.\n\n1. There are a wide variety of guns available, but very few combinations of those guns are viable. The shotguns are rarely viable for combat with gun wielding enemies, since advancing far enough forward to make shotgun damage effective inevitably puts you in the line of fire of enough of your enemies to prove lethal. Other weapons like sniper rifles and pistols have critically low DPS and a low maximum ammo cap, making them almost universally not viable. Additionally this game likes to spring ambushes on the player in a way that takes away any advantage gained from long range optics. The special pneumatic weapons in the game also suffer from a low ammo cap. This leaves you with assault rifles, which the game seems to have been made for.\n\n2. In encounters with bestial enemies it is frequently impossible to avoid taking damage. The enemies sprint at you in packs which even sustained automatic shotgun fire cannot fully stop. Some of the boss enemies are even worse in this department. In normal mode with the larger health pool and regeneration over time this wouldn't be such a problem. But in ranger mode this makes certain obstacles unbeatable. You might have a boss which takes your entire ammo pool from both guns to kill, and which gets a guaranteed hit on you once every thirty seconds. If you go into that boss fight hurt and with no healing items, then you'll be met with mathematically guaranteed failure. The simple fix for this is to give the player a dodge function to avoid taking an instance of damage.\n\n3. This story has a few decisions to make, but mostly it is on rails. This isn't always a problem in a game, but it is when your character gets repeatedly taken unawares by things you as the player have already figured out. You as the player may sense that Artyom is being tricked, is about to be ambushed, or is going to let the bad guy get away through poor decision making. You just have to frustratedly walk into the cut scene and let it happen anyways. Its fine for this to happen at least once. But by the fourth or fifth instance it becomes infuriating to play as the character who just gets tricked and captured all the time.",
      "As much as I was hyped for a different twist on farming sims, this just falls flat. The whole generation system [i]sounds[/i] good on paper but is just unused. You would almost be more hard pressed to actually age enough to need a second generation than not. Sure you can just opt in to moving along, but I just feel wrong killing off my character like that. As such the whole selling point is just, not a part of the game unless you really seek it out. \n\nSo this just leaves the normal farming sim aspects. Which uh... dont work too well either in my opinion. This game is focused less on skill, leveling, or tool quality despite having far more rpg aspects than most other games of this type. You have entire stat systems behind each charecter, buffs, multiple tool levels and materials. Yet none of it is used. What is used is weird cryptic proverbs that dictate item quality. \n\nWhat I mean is, did you catch that fish normally? Just walking along the river and thought to cast your line? Shame. Dont you know trout can only be caught well on the fourth day of the spring during rain while accompanied by a pet and under the influence of a charm buff? Im not exaggerating too much here either. Crops, fish, fruits, plants, and ore all have up to [b]four[/b] requirements. One per star. Some can be easy, like be skilled in said action, fishing/harvesting etc. But most will be odd things like harvest on the sixth day. Only fish during these hours. Be under a certain buff. Have a certain animal following you. Its all just... odd. \n\nWhats worse is its punishing. You want to just, idk, play the game your way? You want to enjoy this sandbox game at your leisure? Well I hope you are ready to be punished for it. You have to either memorise each and every requirement for hundreds of items. Or, just have a wiki page open at all times. Which just takes away the fun. Cant go fishing today, its not foggy. Cant harvest your grown crops right now, its not druida day. This game has you jumping through hoops, playing on [i]its[/i] time rather than your own. Its a relaxing farming sim, but played like an accountant looking at spreadsheets. \n\nIn essence, if you enjoy micromanaging each moment of your day down to the minute detail, go for it. You will love this game. But if you are looking for a laid back, head empty sim game, look anywhere else. This game will open palm slap you for wanting to play it laid back and to your own beat. I just feel this [u]FARMING SIM[/u] is not at all tailored for the crowd of people who play farming sims.",
      "After completing every ending, completing the map, and 98%-ing my save file (I'm not going to hunt down whatever miniscule thing is left), I can sum up all my thoughts on the game with one word: Disappointing.\n\nTo go more indepth, as a standalone game, Blasphemous 2 was alright at most. But compared to the first it feels bland and boring in a number of ways. The few NPCs you see are forgettable, the bosses are forgettable, every enemy feels the exact same. \n\nThe executions, which felt like such a large part of the charm of Blasphemous 1's combat, are practically gone- not only do they happen much less often but there's almost no uniqueness to them, with nearly every enemy having the same animation. While in B1 there were 16 different executions (18/19 if you count certain bosses), B2 has.. 4 or 5 different executions? \n\nIt feels like they give no depth to anyone you meet, friend or foe, nearly all of them being left a complete mystery with not even a single sentence talking about who or what they are. Even the Penitent One feels bland, having gone from a brutal, unstoppable force hell-bent on reaching his goal no matter what, to some unremarkable silent protagonist who kills some things.\n\nThe world and its areas felt boring, less like an actual world and more like a jumble of random locations stacked like tetris blocks. The way the enemies were tossed into them makes them feel like they were all pre-made assets and they had to think of where they fit best, and the result was almost none of them fitting in with where you see them.\n\nEverything felt far too easy, far beyond the point of getting used to the gameplay and learning from the first game. Bosses especially were disappointing, all having too little health, and it felt like only a single boss in the entire game had more than three attacks. \n\nThe rewards for quests and secrets were unfulfilling and unsatisfying, whether it was giving a character an item that was obviously meant for them or slowly searching across every little corner of the whole map for tiny secrets you missed. \n\nThe endings especially were a huge disappointment, and they made it feel like everything leading up to them was entirely a waste of time and effort and took away what little enjoyment was left.\n\nEverything about Blasphemous 1 that made it unique- the worldbuilding, the gameplay, the artstyle and animations- feels like it's all been stripped away and we were left with this generic metroidvania that only vaguely resembles its predecessor.\n\nI [b]loved[/b] Blasphemous, it was and still is one of my all time favourite games, but I really can't say I liked Blasphemous 2. If you loved Blasphemous 1 I would honestly advise against playing this, the whole experience is such a letdown that it's hard to not have the first game spoiled simply by what comes after it. If you don't care, or you haven't played the first yet, then at the very least wait until there's a good sale before trying.",
      "i would recomend it because the physics are great, the game has 8 or 9 level packs (i dont know if there will be a 9th because there are 7 at the time of this review) the units are diverse, there are a lot of secret units to find and i dont know for the final boss because the most expensive unit artimis isnt a good final boss like the dark pesant in the alphas but i hope that the games final boss unit is actually hard to kill and requires more than 7 archers because that wasnt hard or anything hopefully they will make the most expensive unit actually overpowered and unballanced because that would be a great final boss, the sandbox mode is great i like the custom campains , the custom units arent out yet so i cant say anything about that over all this game is worth the money and if its near a sale time like a few days away from a sale then get it on sale if not then just get it you wont regret it and if it lage turn off all the graphics settings",
      "please stop resetting my setting",

      "\"The good things, the happy things, all of it changes. Nothing can stay the same forever. Still...can you find it in your heart to still love this place?\" (paraphrase)\n\nClannad . . .\n\nOH Clannad . . .\n\nI remember watching the anime in high school, and absolutely falling in love with it. Upon realizing the REAL story was told in a visual novel...I HAD to get my hands on it. I almost died of a joy-induced heart attack when a legitimate English version of the game was released on Steam.\n\nThis game bro. This f***** game. When I was a senior in high school back in the day, this game was my refuge. I was mostly friends with older kids back then, so by the time I was a senior I didn't really have anybody to chill with cuz all my friends already graduated. Its kinda hard for me to make new friends, then and now if I'm being honest. I related to Nagisa a lot for that reason. \n\nI mostly related to Tomoya and Sunohara tho. One of my best friends growing up really reminded me of Sunohara no cap lol. Type of dude who was the comic relief/brunt of everyone's s*** talking but w/ a mutual understanding its done in jest and love. And when things ever got serious we always had each others' backs, and even tho he's a goofball and kind of a meme, he's seriously loyal and a true ride or die.\n\nMany times when Tomoya was expressing himself in this game, I had to almost pinch my face and remind myself I'm not the one thinking these thoughts: I'm playing a VN lol. That's how much I seriously related to Tomoya. In so many aspects and ways that would make my review even longer than it is now if I were to attempt to explain why I relate to Tomoya so much. Yeah, sure that could just be shrewd character design from Maeda Jun's part, but it was almost uncanny how many of the things Tomoya went thru when he was younger/issues with his father/intimacy issues he develops later on in adulthood etc. almost perfectly mirrored what I was struggling with irl. It gave me something to relate to. It expressed emotions I was having trouble even admitting were present in my own self. Maybe that's the real reason I love Clannad so much, and maybe because of that I sit here biased with rose-colored nostalgia goggles. But even if I type this review with a tinge of rose-coloring obstructing my critical eyes, I can say with confidence that Clannad is more than a game. More than an anime. \n\nClannad is an experience. An experience I wish I could forget all about...just so I could experience it anew all over again. Whether you experience Clannad thru the anime, VN, movie, whatever...Clannad is an experience in a league of its own in my book. And the best way to have your Clannad experience is by playing this masterpiece of a Visual Novel. Hands down. \n\nHonestly, I'd ideally have all Clannad virgins go straight to the VN and play it to completion but that's just not a realistic request as this game takes the average player 80+ hours to complete just the main story apart from optional achievements haha. If you're a fan of the anime...why haven't you played the VN yet!? Lol. If you've never seen the anime or movie I'd STILL recommend playing this game. Just keep in mind to use a guide (just trust me on that. please) and be willing for it to be a bit boring at first. If you stick with it, believe me...it's not gonna stay boring for long.\n\nIf you liked the anime but hated the anime ending, PLAY THE VN. No spoilers, but trust me when I say the VN ending is the true conclusion of the Clannad experience. You'll find out what I mean if you stick with the VISUAL NOVEL to the end.\n\nI didn't go to my senior prom. I spent it playing this game. And I don't regret that decision one bit to this day. I experienced this game, standing in similar shoes as Tomoya at that time irl: rebellious kid about to graduate high school with no real goals or aspirations, struggling to find it hard to \"love this place\" or truly find something passionate to live for. I didn't want to go to college. There was nothing I wanted to do there. Most of the people in my grade back then thought I was quiet and lonely freshman-sophomore, then bad news junior-senior when I started acting out. I was just, lost. \n\nExperiencing Clannad helped me find what I was truly passionate about in life. Family. Friendship (as corny as that may sound). Being able to step up for what only YOU can protect when life is calling you to maturity.\n\nClannad helped me see that even though things can get dark... even though tragedies will happen regardless of our efforts to keep them from happening... even though things can never, and will never, ever stay the same in this life...and even if you lose your way eventually... and sadly reach such a lost and depressed state in life, that you mistakenly conclude for a short while you'd rather sever all your connections and ties with the world and everybody in it... in an effort to try to prevent experiencing even more pain... \n\nThat \"loving this place,\" loving this world, loving people, and forming deep, lifelong and lasting connections with this world and its people, NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS, is ALWAYS, ALWAYS, worth it in the end. Especially when it matters the most.\n\nNow I'm not gonna front: Clannad isn't for everybody. Some people just can't get into the moe art style. Some people may find it a bit too melodramatic at times. Some people may find some of the comedy or bits of the story weird, or just not their cup of tea. Some people may find it hard to relate to all of the characters, and for some people it won't have a Cindarella's slipper level of relatability like it did for me. For those people who are kinda feelin \"ehh idk if i'll really like this game\" I'd say it'd be smart to watch the anime first. But if you're feeling good about it and wanna experience Clannad the BEST way: cop this VN. Just wait for the good bits to slowly boil. Patience is a virtue :) And save yourself hours of rage by using a guide from the beginning until the after-story credits roll. With Clannad I'd say its almost always recommended to use a guide.\n\nAnd if you love the anime and haven't played the VN... you're weirdo number 1, 2, 3, 4 and even 5. Haha I'm playin but srsly get the VN already you owe it to yourself to experience the VN. Knowing what happens in the story and getting some events \"spoiled\" doesn't detract from the VN experience. That I promise you. As someone who watched the anime before playing the VN, who's now such an obvious fanboy of the Clannad VN as demonstrated by my wall of text of a review (lol), trust me: I'd bet money you'll love this game just as much as I do.  \n\nTo Maeda Jun, and all of the brilliant writers of this quintessential, modern classic of a story: thank you. Thank you for gifting all of us the experience that is Clannad. Because of your labours, you've helped a wayward knucklehead like me finally be able to declare this in spirit and in truth:\n\n\"I love this place.\"\n\nLong live Kazamatsuri!",
      "It's a pretty game, but there's no option for manual saves, and autosaves only happen once in a great while instead of immediately after solving each puzzle or progressing through conversations. I also felt like the walking was extremely clunky with the mouse and keyboard, and I'd prefer click-to-walk.",
      "With approximately 55,000 reviews -- 96% of them positive -- at the time of my posting this, it is hard to know what more I can add to [i]It Take Two[/i]'s well-deserved acclaim.  As others have said, it is an excellent cooperative multiplayer game with very satisfying controls, varied levels, and superb production values in art and audio.\n\nAside from these things, what stood out to me was the game's decency.  It is *anti*-exploitative, quite deliberately excluding features like collectibles (let alone microtransactions) or character advancement that are predicated on Skinner box treatment of the player.  Rather than finding ways to [i]take[/i] more from the player (money, time, etc.), the developers have found ways to [i]give[/i] more to the player, with many small delights to be found.  In addition to not exploiting the player, the game doesn't exploit its characters -- only very occasionally playing the cheap tropes that the game's set-up would tend to invite.  The game's narrative may lack subtlety and surprise, but its straightforward positive message never feels preachy, perhaps because the scenario is so ridiculous.\n\nIt is rare to play a big-budget game (the credits go on FOREVER!) that seems to have as its goal that players will find a fun, full, satisfying experience and go away better than they came.",
      "I hate to do this, because the devs clearly put a lot of love into it, but I just can't give it the thumbs up.\n\nThe controls are mostly on point (slide jumping is a little weird), but the generated levels are what kills it for me. I've come to realize that getting through the hand-crafted levels is a good portion of what makes Mega Man so fun. This procedural generation simply isn't up to snuff. You just go right, occasionally going up or down to go right again. There's no nuance or thought required to go right, because most enemies can be ignored, and there are no real obstacles. \n\nIf you've got that itch, just replay a Mega Man game (Classic/X/Zero). You'll go through proper, hand-crafted levels.",
      "Let's get this out of the way: If you're into Chris Avellone/Obsidian/Black Isle kind of games and know what that even means, you know what you're getting. Another clunky game with writing so good you'll forgive any of its flaws. It's another one of those games: a Baldur's Gate, NWN2, Kotor 2, Fallout: New Vegas, Alpha Protocol kinda game.\n\nIf that paragraph didn't make any sense, the rest of this review is for you. Planescape: Torment tends to be less hack-and-slash than it looks, playing according to a system roughly based on second edition Dungeons & Dragons. But in a big departure from both, you can solve a huge amount of your problems with minimal combat and the real meat of the game comes in your decision making, mystery solving, and dealing with people around you. True to the Planescape setting, Torment is a game about the power of belief and the battlefield of ideas.\n\nI don't want to oversell that because you *will* be attacked by random thugs, some combats are downright mandatory, and there is a very real difficulty spike about three quarters through the game. But the allies you keep and the knowledge you gain can help you bypass some encounters or at least trivalize them under mountains of xp gained from unraveling cosmic questions. \n\nIt's a grim, often macabre journey back and forth across the boundaries of life and death where even the happiest endings are pretty heavy, but it's also a brilliantly written, thought-provoking experience that's well worth the time and money. Just make sure to go deep on wisdom, okay, berk? Don't need some dusty penning you in the deadbook because you couldn't see the dark of things, cutter.",
      "Loved the original, and this updated version is just as good.\n\nThe additions along the way are very nice, and the improved graphics are noticeable. \nBeing able to converse with your partners whenever you want is also amazing.\n\nHowever...\n\nWas disappointed to have a few areas and puzzles removed. Since those were the more difficult parts of the original game, I assume this was done for a more streamlined experience. \nInstead of your flower wilting to represent your life, it is now replaced by more accurate \"points\". Although this makes it easier to tell exactly how many hits you can take, I miss the more original old design.\nAn iconic music track was also changed, likely due to licensing issues...\n \nCan't completely replace the original for me, but it's still a very worthwhile experience! \nStill wishing for a sequel a decade later.",

      "Coming up to 5000 hours playing this game, and im still learning new things in multiplayer.  \n\nThe devs are by far the best ive ever seen.  FFF (Friday Fun Facts) is a blog post they write up every Friday.  Every. Single. Friday. For the last ... 4 years?  look at them on their website, its not a 2 min blurb, its a full review of what they've done that week, and where they're headed, what their plans are, current iterations they're going over, complete with pictures and sometimes *chuckle* hand drawn graphs.  \n\nTheir IRC channel (there is a link on their website) has someone on the dev team there pretty much 24/7.  Not just \"community manager\" nitwits (Trangar, te he), but guys like Rseding91 (their C++ guru) that are programming the actual updates.  \n\nOh.  There are updates.\n\nAre there sometimes bugs in the patches?  Sure.  Which is why you sometimes see 2 patches in the same day.  Bugs get quashed immediately whenever possible.  \n\nWhile this review doesnt speak much about the game, the team behind it deserves the recognition - its amazing, thoughtul, and incredibly well done because of them.\n\nIn a nutshell, its similar to RTS games like starcraft, where you build up and gather resources.  But instead of spending 20 minutes to build up a base to have the game end in 2, you keep building.\n\nBuilding Bigger.\n\nMaking things more efficient.\n\nTearing down and rebuidling.\n\nIm almost 5000 hours in and sticking with vanilla until I can personally say Ive mastered it.  Once I stop learning new things almost every time I play, ill start fooling around with mods.  And there are lots of them.  \n\nIs this game worth $20?  It absolutely was for me.  This single $20 purchase brought me thousands of hours of entertaintment, frustration - when things didnt work planned, and absolute delight - when things get fixed, and I can reflect on my orchestra of 500 machines working in harmony.  \n\nWhether or not it is worth it for you is up to you.

      "While still a work very much in progress, Nuclear Throne is currently one of my favorite games. It's a roguelike dungeon crawler with heavy \"bullet-hell\" elements and a little RPG sprinkled on top. When you begin a session of Nuclear Throne, you choose from one of several well-designed & freakish \"mutants\", each with their own special attributes which, in itself, does much to add variety (there's also a random-select option which is a fun idea in this particular case). The goal of each stage is to exterminate all of the enemies. After doing so, a portal opens which takes your mutant freak to the next level. There are a great many weapons with which to inflict meyhem on your adversaries. As you gain experience points, in the form of green goo earned by killing enemies & also found in cache jars, you'll be able to choose new persistent perks for your character (such as more HP or certain weapons doing more damage). Every so-often, you'll encounter a boss. The bosses tend to pop in during the height of an already-in-progress battle which makes beating them all-the-more difficult & hectic.\n\nOriginally, this game did not have controller support which was a great disappointment (though I had been ejoying it anyway, using the keyboard and mouse). However, a recent update rectified this and the gameplay using a dual-analog controller (such as that of the Xbox 360) is just fantastic. Like Ultratron before it (another very similar game which is also worth a look; I also wrote a review for it, if you're interested in checking it out), Nuclear Throne throws you straight back to the arcades of yore and plops you in front of a Smash TV cabinet.\n\nAs a roguelike dungeon-crawler, the replay value is extremely high (due to the fact that the level and enemy layout is totally different from one session to the next). The rather extreme difficulty doesn't hurt either, as playing entails dying and thus restarting... a lot. Fortunately, said difficulty isn't of the variety that compels you to smash your controller/keyboard in frustration. Every death feels like the fault lay squarely on *your* shoulders (if only you had moved to dodge a little faster or conserved ammo a little better!), as opposed to the game feeling like it's cheating. Another stand-out feature which I think I need to bring up is the soundtrack. ...Just wow! Nuclear Throne's score is totally original and extremely surreal. It goes *miles* in lending its own atmosphere to the game. \n\nSome might consider the current price of $12.99 to be just a *little* steep for a game in this class, but considering how well it's made overall and the fun I've gotten from it (especially being in its currently pre-release/beta state), I consider it to be well worth the price. As of the time of this writing, the developer(s) is very active and updates are coming quite frequently.\n\nUPDATE 01/12/16: I hadn't played this game in quite a while (at least 6+ months) and I wanted to check out the progress that the devs have made, etc. Well... The game starts but as soon as I select a character, it totally locks up. I can't play it at all. To make matters worse, I've heard that the devs have since \"abandoned\" development of this game (so it's not likely that whatever is causing the crashes for me is going to be fixed any time soon - or ever). Bummer man. I loved this game...",

      "This is one of the most beautiful games I played since Shadow of the Colossus. And much like SOTC This game is a visual delight not all the visual feel pointless or feel to in your face no all of it is PURE atmosphere and really enhances the experience when exploring the many levels in the game. The game's ability to tell a very deep story visually without any dialog or exposition to undermine the player is absolutely brilliant. the game be very diffult the first time playing but feels rewarding after you level up Ori as you continue to fight bad guys.\n\n My rating is 10/10\n A stunning game with a compelling storyline that worth every penny",
      "If you notice that Kagami voice sounds different, that’s because the guy who voiced him in the first game, Brad Venable, died at the beginning of last year. This time, Kagami is voiced by Austin Lee Mathews, who voiced Roche (Final Fantasy VII Remake) and Ash Carbide (Cold Steel III and IV). \n\nRest In Peace, Brad. We may forget Kaniza’s name, but we won’t forget yours. And thank you for being one of the funniest character in the game.",
      "It's criminal that a team of 5 people can build such an amazing game like this and sell it for $20.\n\nI continue to be amazed at the thought that went into this game and all the little details. From the changing weather, the waves in the ocean, the ebb and flow of the water along shorelines, the smoke from the campfire as it fills the room, the ease and simplicity when it comes to building, the way the trees fall, the music that feels seamless and relaxing, and so on.\n\nI truly appreciate that they didn't make an \"open world simulation that simulates things for no other reason than to simulate them\". Made a mistake while building that house? No worries, just remove it and get all your materials back. Ran out of food while busy building or crafting? No worries, you're not going to die from hunger. Broke your axe? No worries, just repair it. Troll smashed your cart full of ore? No worries, just put down a workbench and rebuild the cart and put everything back in the cart.",
      "[H1]At this price point it's hard not to recommend it, but there's a lot -better- bullet hell games out there...[/H1]\n\nDanmaku unlimited as a series is great. Don't get me wrong. It really is. But it suffers the curse of being put in with a field on Steam that is made up of even greater company. Bug Princess by Cave has the brutal difficulty angle sewn up, Ikaruga has the absolute classic angle nailed, Jamestown has the glorious pixel-art sorted. In order to stand out in this genre, you absolutely have to bring something new to the table.\n\nAs good as Danmaku Unlimited is, it does not bring anything new to the table. It brings a lot of -good-, but nothing -new-. The greatest sin here is that if you've played a lot of bullet hells, this is going to feel immensely familiar, and you're going to blast through it fast, nothing is prone to catch you out. At all. Now that may be a plus point, if that's what you're after, but if you're seeking something to change up the formula? Yeeeeee-no.\n\n[H1]So it's the Bullet Hell version of Destiny?[/H1]\n\nMechanically, it works great. You have a ship with a teeny tiny hitbox, same as most \"Eastern\" BHell games, you have anywhere between \"Mildly offensive\" and \"Absolutely terrifying\" levels of hostile fire coming toward you, and you pump out similarly scary levels of fire back, with your only choice generally being \"Do I spam the screen with lots of little beams or do I fire ONE BIG BEAM at something that needs cracking open like a walnut.\"\n\nIt has good Bullet Hell music, albeit not outstanding music, it has good graphics, albeit not outstanding graphics, you see a pattern here? If a game could ever nail what I'd define as the absolute essence of an \"8 out of 10\", this would be it. The problem is there's games out there such as Revolver360 Re:Actor that do -better-.\n\nThe problem is that for all the good it does, it's been beaten to it by other games, maybe not in every field, but in each area I can name at least two or three games that stand above it. The one area it does win out on is bang for the buck. It's kinda hard to argue with this kind of quality at this kind of price point. It's a very, very solid return on investment, particularly if you're a bullet hell fan.\n\n[H1]Closing Thoughts[/H1]\n\nDoes that make this a \"Do not buy\"? Far from it. If you're a fan of bullet hells, chances are you already own it. If you don't, eventually you should, but I'd genuinely suggest you look around first, there's a decent market now on Steam for this genre, and there's more innovative and interesting options around. If however you've already consumed them and you need a fix of something fairly solid and fairly entertaining, then sure, this works, it will scratch the itch quite nicely.\n\nVerdict : [b]Buy, definitely worth grabbing on a sale, if only to put in the \"To do\" list,[/b]",
      "What can I say that hasn't been said and that you don't know.\nThis game is IN-SANE.\nThe attention to detail is mind-boggling, the missions, from the smallest to all the main missions are worthy of oscars.\nThe single player campaign is one of the best adventures I ever went on in my life. This is why I love games.\nThe beauty of this game in indescribable.

      "This is less of a review and more of me gushing about how much im enjoying myself, but you can still get a idea of what the game is from it. I am not usually a puzzle game player, or even a \"chill\" game player. im usually all about quick shooters, fighters, and platformers, but i decided to give this game a shot and i am very glad i did. with a mechanic as simple as pushing trees i thought that it would be simple enough for me to have a good time, the last time i played a puzzle game was BaBa is You and i put 14 hours into it and never got past word 3, it was just too much for me. but this game manages to still be challenging even with it laying all the pieces out in front of me, it introduces new features not by putting one in a level and saying good luck, it makes you do something you have done before but gives a new outcome, because you never got to do that thing in that exact way before, and when puzzles start requiring you to do those things you wonder how you ever got that far without doing one of those things before. all of the mechanics and solutions also are based in logic, all your doing is pushing things, so you dont have to suspend your current understanding of things to learn a new mechanic. The world of the game is also very relaxing and sucks me right in, its a museum of the \"past\" of humans that takes place in the far future from the perspective of monsters who dont really understand human culture, and it is hilarious! the music is very chill and moves with your actions, when you push something in a specific way the music also does a specific things, and its part of the reason this game is so relaxing. most other puzzle games i have played frustrate me when i get stuck on a puzzle for a long time, but seeing the monster relax helps me relax and keep a level head to get to the next museum exhibit. i dont know how to end this review but if you read it i hope you dont feel like i wasted your time!",

      "After the past few years of broken, buggy AAA games I've started to lose the passion I once had for the industry. This masterpiece came out of no where and completely reignited my love for gaming. PLEASE do not sleep on this game, it's such a breath of fresh air from the garbage you'd normally expect from modern day companies. Definitely taking a spot in my top 5 favorites and I haven't even scratched the surface of the game yet, it's just that good. Beautiful art style, crisp animations, a unique concept, FUN gameplay, its everything I've been wanting and more. Kudos to the devs for making this absolute banger <3",
      "I have an awfully hard love/hate relationship with this game. On one hand it's beautiful, has tons of awesome cars and can be really fun if played with friends. But it comes at a huge price - quite literally in Europe as it costs 69.99 € in contrast to 59.99 $ in the US. The correct price according to current exchange rates would be around 50 €, this is ridiculous. It's even worse if you remember that this game came out over 2 years ago and they still demand the same 99.99 € for the Ultimate Edition without any discount. \n\nApart from the pricing the game also has the worst support I ever encountered. My first ticket for a crashing game after release was answered 8 months later, my two more recent tickets about a translation error and a problem with the Forza Hub were both answered with \"yeah we know about this and are [i]investigating[/i]\" and were closed without fixing anything.\n\nLast but not least not offering the possibility to transfer a savegame after investing 300+ hours on the Microsoft Store version even if you use the same Microsoft account is such a bad move for veterans who were actually willing to pay the price again. \n\nAll in all I'm happy that MS made the move to Steam and I'm looking forward to the next Forza Motorsport release, but I'll skip this for now and I wouldn't recommend anyone to spend the full price on this game since you basically need to buy the Ultimate Edition for access to all available cars.\n\nBonus for those who are curious: It doesn't work on Linux with Steam Play right now and probably never will as it still completely relies on the Xbox infrastructure.",
      "This is everything a remaster is supposed to be. You remember playing this game over a decade ago, and the graphics weren't \"that bad\". But nostalgia is a cruel mistress. You play the original again, and you can barely stand it.\n\nThe comes the HD version, which was alright, playable. But then, the real remaster, the Definitive Edition, you start playing the game and it FEELS like it used to feel. Like it is supposed to look. It is quite obviously way better than it used to be, but it FEELS the same.\n\nIf you ever liked playing this game, and want to play it again, this won't disappoint you. Especially with the distinct lack of RTS games in the last decade or so, this still holds true as one of the best ones.",
      "Events that took place:\n\nDid not want to sell player,\nGot an offer for said player,\nRejected the offer,\nPlayer demaned to be allowed to speak to the club,\nGot a second offer from said club,\nEssentially forced to accept the offer,\nPlayer reached an agreement with the club,\nWished player the \"best of luck\" in his future endeavours,\nPlayer is angry that he is leaving,\nPlayer considerers his new club a \"step down\" in his career,\nReminder: Player demanded to go to said club,\nMe finding solice in the fact that FM19 although lacking in the football department, delivers a brilliant experience in dealings with manic and psychotic people.\n\nAllow me to grant you an insight into SI's employee knowledge on the subject their games are about. I once engaged in a conversation with a developer at SI about FM, and football in general. After some talking about premier league, and me slightly confused, I eventually understood that this developer thought that Tottenham Hotspurs were located in Liverpool. So I posed him the following question: \"Then why do they call any matches between Tottenham and Arsenal the 'North London Derby'?\" to which he responded that he did not know, but he assured me that Tottenham F.C was located in Liverpool. I had to resort to showing him the borough of Tottenham in London for him to understand that Tottenham Hotspurs is not lovated in Liverpool, but in fact in London.\n\nThis will be the last edition of this game series I will ever purchase. In a football management simulator such as this, letting SI and their employees (including the one that responded to this review) tell you various aspects of football, is like having a pervert preach to you about the virtues of sexual absitence. They know nothing, and since the core game has not progressed the slightest in 10 years, it would be a fair assumption that they do not care neither.\n\nFuck SI, Fuck their beloved \"devs\" and fuck Charlton Heston while you're at it.",
      "If Animus would have ever spent a night of passion with GlaDOS, then this would be their child :) Influenced by Portal series and early Assassin's Creed games, among others, this game is a mind-blowing combination of puzzle-solving tasks with a story which builds a philosophical bridge between religion and science in a way that can only be called a stroke of genius.\n\nI can't say that Talos Principle is better than Portal. It's beyond Portal.\n\nIt takes Portal's approach to first person environmental puzzle solving and, standing on its shoulders, reaches higher, offering you much more sophisticated puzzles of various kinds that sometimes have several layers and sometimes even inter-operate. The reality you are operating in is filled with messages and secrets, not unlike the world of Animus from Assassin's Creed, telling you a story and fuelling your brain. And just like in AC, you get some secondary things to do when you get tired of the \"main\" puzzles.\n\nThe graphics are fantastic. Landscapes are gorgeous. Controls are perfect. Music is superb. Voice acting is impeccable. Length is ideal. Puzzles are mind-bending. Progression is non-linear. This game might be officially \"indie\", but its quality is triple A. Or quad A. To call it non-trivial is like to say that a rocket is non-slow. And what's most valuable, is that you don't feel that profits were the top priority for the makers. The game was.\n\nThe things I love about it the most:\n• Assisted jumping. Just brilliant. If only Quantum Conundrum had it.\n• No fake puzzles based on arcade elements.\n• Weather effects.\n• I can get as close as I can to a wall and still see no blurred textures.\n• Wherever I go, I never get stuck in terrain.\n• Skippable intro movie and sensible menus.\n• Runs on my Macbook Pro.\n• Has a free demo.\n• It's so clever, it feels alive.\n\nThe things I dislike:\n• Loud \"Death\" sequence can give one a pretty good scare when comes unexpected.\n• It ends.\n\nIf you like puzzles - buy it. If you like first person games - buy it. If you like philosophy - buy it. If you like lasers - buy it. If you like finding secrets - buy it. If you like clever writing - buy it.

      "Hard to recommend. I enjoyed F1 2020, and this is just that game with the latest cars, slightly updated graphics (ray tracing etc) and a story mode that I found fun, but its about 5 hours of entertainment max. The coop career mode is nice, I enjoy racing with friends. The racing is fun and close when difficulty is tunes, and I enjoy the act of just driving around in this (though some of the kerbs can get knotted).\n\nBig issue is the VIP pass thing, and the attitude it shows. It's even more egregious than F1 2020 - it's front and centre, with some more categories of items to dilute your experience further. By default there are very limited customisation options (even compared with F1 2020), so you might be even more tempted to part with an extra £9 or so just to get the VIP pass. On top of the £55 already spent, with EAs regional pricing making it far more expensive in some areas. That's just grubby. I'm fine with XP based unlocks, but paying for additional cosmetic items in a game like this is predatory and exploitative.\n\nDon't reward them for this. \n\nGet the game if you feel the price is worth it for the story mode and the coop career mode, and you are fortunate enough to have the disposable income. I am, and I did, but it doesn't feel like I got my money's worth this year, to be honest.",

      "Beware as you are just looking at the best 4X game that is.\n\nDon't look at my played time here, this game was available for years already from a very unheard of distributor BUT now is available on Steam at last for the people to see it already.\n\nMaybe you are wondering why it costs so much. Well it has 4 expansions build in it already so that's why. But believe me IT'S WORTH IT. If you like 4X games, this is just a must have.\n\nThe cons:\n\n1. The game is not turn based. Everything is done in real time. You can pause the game and speed it up or slow down at your own liking. This may be a + for someone though... \n2. It's not as shiny as some other 4X games so if pretty graphics are what you prefer you may be disappointed.\n3. The game can be demanding even on high end PC's if you run really large galaxy.\n4. Unfriendly UI. If you run huge resolution you will have problems to read the text.\n5. The learning curve... you will spend hours getting into the game. But don't be afraid, huge automation can be set up to help you.\n6. No multiplayer. I don't mind it but maybe you do?\n\nThe Pros:\n\nEverything else. It's the most complex, never ending fun 4X game I have played. Just the way how the AI is done hooked me up. But to make it fair here are some picks for you.\n\n1. Huge amount of races that actually play in character. It's not like in other games where every AI plays the same way but has different stats. Here the AI behaves in the ways how they are described. They play in character like in RPG game.\n2. HUGE galaxies. Trust me you never saw something like this before in other 4x games. Each game can last for dozens of hours if you want.\n3. Set up your game to the last possible thing you can imagine. The start up set up is just incredible.\n4. Automation ... don't like research, or ship design, or diplomacy, or anything else you can imagine? You can automate it. You can focus only on the one thing you like the most!\n5. Pirates ... you can even play as one.\n6. Mods ... do you want 10 more races or to play Star trek 4x? ... You can have it. \n7. Micromanagement ... it can be endless.\n8. The complexity, you can spend hours in design tables that make sense in comparison to Moo3 for example.\n9. Battles, there is very few games that can simulate such large scale engagements over the whole galaxy.\n10. Play it your own way. You can win the game without any battle if you want. On the other side waging wars is FUN.\n\nDo you need to know more? Watch some videos on YouTube from Das24680.

      "RPGMaker games are renowned for their hit-or-miss quality, with misses far outweighing the hits, at least in the Steam community. That risk said, I love going through the RPGMaker tags and picking out hidden gems. Do I miss a lot and get duds? Sure. But then I find a game like Ara Fell and realize why I enjoy taking my chances. \n\nNow to be fair, most people are playing the Unity version of this game now rather than the original RPGMaker version. While the Unity version is definitely the definitive and better version - I have played both - and it's original RPGMaker version was a very fun experience, too. \n\nThe presentation of this game is top notch. Never before  have a I seen an RPGMaker title that used many of the default assets, and yet made the design of the game their own to the point I had to remind myself of that fact. A lot of these Indie developed RPGMaker games use default assets, and that's fine - it's all about using them in unique and interesting ways, which is where a great many games fail, but not Ara Fell. \n\nSo the game manages to be a visual treat despite itself, but what about the music? Also top notch. Rarely do you play a game of this style and immediately get treated to unique and pleasant music right out of the gate, and it never ceases to be an auditory treat. Usually there is always those one or two tracks that you just don't care for, and it causes you to either mute the sound or to try to get through a section as quickly as possible, but not so in Ara Fell. \n\nGame play is probably the most unique asset this game has to offer. The battles are much more tactical than your traditional turn-based affair because MP is not a finite source - it regens over time. You are encouraged to not simply \"Mash A\" your way to victory. You need to use your skills to the fullest in battle. No really, you have to or this game will beat you to a pulp. While certainly not the most difficult game in the world, and can be cheesed with knowledge, it's no cakewalk either. You have to be smart and a bit strategic to get far in this game.\n\nAnyway, I could gush and gush about this game forever and not get bored. The point is, Ara Fell is an amazing RPGMaker (more so inspired now that it runs on Unity) title that is certainly a diamond among the pile of dirt and rocks. I would go as far to say it is my favorite game of it's caliber, and I have played a great many RPGMaker titles, some also very good. I can think of no higher praise to give this game.",
      "Honestly this game feels like it was made for me.\nQuoting iron pineapple:\"this guy (the dev) just gets it\". And he really does! The level design is great and the areas are cool and unique and a real joy to explore! A really slick zelda-like souls-like-ish game. \nBut that's not all.\nThe gimmick of this game, and the thing that really sets it apart and makes it go above the rest, is the manual. The whole gimmick is that the game is written, mostly, in an unknown runic language, forcing the player to figure out game mechanics, progression and puzzles on their own. You have only one thing to help you: as you progress you collect pages of a manual, in the style of those old console games, which gives you again pseudo-cryptic hints, because it's also mostly in the other language.\nThe way the manual and the knowledge based progression flow into the design of the game is nothing short of genius. It's hard to gosh about just how amazing it is, because that would be spoiling it, but it's completely genius. \nGame's a masterpiece for me, a strange mesh of Hollow Knight  meets  Outer Wilds-based knowledge progression. \nDefinitely a must-buy, don't even worry about it going on a sale, it's an easy indie GOTY for me",

      "NPC's flying around like they are planes.\nNPC's driving around on invisible go-karts.\nBugged faces that are hideous and hilarious.\nArno likes sky diving through solid ground.\nACU.exe has stopped responding.\n\n11/10 Would buy again.",
      "I hated Undertale.\n\nIt was, pretty clearly, a game about sexy skeletons. I did not care about sexy skeletons. I refused to play a game about sexy skeletons.\n\nThen my friend made me listen to the soundtrack, and I decided I could deal with a few hours of sexy skeletons if I got to listen to the best video game music I had ever heard while doing it. \n\nI played Undertale. It's not a game about sexy skeletons. It's a game about choices, maybe, or morality, or curiosity. It's a game about pushing the limits. It's a game about experiences, about \"what would happen if I did this?\", about storytelling so intricate and complex and raw that it shouldn't be able to fit into seven hours of bullet hell and pixel graphics. But, somehow, it does. Every choice you make has an impact. Every object you check has a story. The soundtrack, the witty yet profound writing, the simple pixel graphics, and even the menu screens and bullet patterns themselves all intertwine in order to tell a story that only you decide the ending of.\n\nAlso, the skeletons aren't even sexy.\n\nMy advice to you: Go in as blind as you can. Don't read walkthroughs. Don't watch playthroughs. Don't prepare yourself. Don't even look at overviews. Hell, don't even read the Steam page description. Just buy the game (and give some well-earned money to a little white dog), and, as it were, climb the mountain yourself. Don't let anyone backseat. Don't listen to people who tell you there's a right way to play.\n\nAnd when you think you've reached the end, just think--what other choices could you have made?\n\nSo, yes. I hated Undertale.\n\nAnd then I played it.",
      "Oh boy. This is a beautiful game. There's unlockable items, a hidden boss, lots of enemies, and characters that change your play styles. Numerous ways to make the game accessible for you!\n\nBut is the game fun? I'd say no, the game was just ok. I wasn't really solving puzzles so much dealing with a RNG generator. Ironically the bosses felt slower and more boring than the levels, they are a battle of patience, wait until the potions fall - hit them 3 or 4 times - repeat.\n\nWould I revisit this game after some patches or dlc? No, probably not. Unfortunately I think this game has some base design problems and not content or quality problems.",
      "Saw a few youtube videos on this and decided to check it out.  Only played 30 min but here's my review from that. \n\nCustomization options are disappointing and boring. All of the character skins were white guys (and a possible vanilla Mexican). The option not to add other races at least to the Allied side is weird. As a gamer, when given the option for customization I expect to be able to create a character I at least somewhat feel represents me so I can get immersed (and don't even talk about 'historical accuracy'). They're also level locked for some reason. The uniforms are basic as they should be and you have a very limited weapon selection depending on the class you choose which is standard for these kinds of games. The character customization is very lacking and the only real reason I see it being there is to create DLC uniforms to buy. \n\nThe game itself seems like it's going in slow motion and maybe it's something people get used to after a while but I couldn't deal with it. The run is more like a speed walk and it feels like the soldier is considering being a conscientious objector with the amount of hesitation in aiming. Also everyone was kind just playing the game like Battlefield anyway.\n\nThis is probably a game that's more fun to play in a serious MilSim community.",
      "The game vaguely reminds me of Yume Nikki and Strange Telephone due to thematic similarities, but in the end, I think it managed to be something completely different - I don't want to compare it directly to Undertale, but I got those narrative vibes as well. Unlike its exploration-based relatives, UNREAL LIFE is somewhat of a linear game, but the areas tend to loop around into the hub when using waypoints, occasionally involving some backtracking and optional achievements (including a game within a game). It took me about 6 hours to get 2 bad endings on the same playthrough, that said I am missing more than half of the achievements and probably other endings as well. Despite its modest art style, I think the locations and the world design were very good, granted the game settings are very limited for the price. The writing and characters were the highlight of the experience for me, I would say I enjoyed about 95% of the dialogue and world-building, despite being a very text-heavy game. The game tells a story in a unique way where the character can extract memories from the objects that she touched, unlocking potential hints that you will need to solve puzzles.\n\nYour room works as a hub area to which you can return for manual saves or the minigame, additionally to connecting all areas with a waypoint system, but you don't have to worry too much about those as the checkpoints are very frequent. Generally, the gameplay is just exploring 2D levels, picking up items, and occasionally solving creative sequence puzzles. The character keeps track of 3 different memories that may contain clues if you managed to miss them - it's hard to do because the important text is color-coded. I want to give the devs credit for actually putting some originality into puzzle mechanics, they were fun and not difficult enough to drag the game down. However, when the character learns about a hidden item from the memory, you have to click in the correct spot with no indication, which is perfectly fine, I only wish I realized it sooner. For any Yume fans out there, the game works as a psychedelic visual candy, with many dream-like environments and themes to navigate. \n\n[i]In a way, playing through this game reminded me of the first time I finished watching Spirited Away, the journey so immersive it left me in a state of melancholy. Do you ever get a feeling that you changed as a person after finishing a game? [/i]\n\n[h1] Pros: [/h1]\n\n+ fun characters, enjoyable narrative \n+ multiple endings and optional achievements \n+ creative puzzle based on memory mechanics \n+ nice variety of locations\n+ awesome soundtrack \n\n[h1] Feedback: [/h1]\n\n[u] Some Nitpicks [/u] - I ended up playing on a controller, but if you are using a mouse you have to drag the character around, it would be nice to have the clicking option instead - if it has one I don't know how to activate it. I was slightly confused by the main menu controls when using a controller, but if you can't figure out the buttons you can select the options with the mouse. I wish you just had the visual Q like \"new game\", \"load game\" and so on. Sometimes to progress you may have to talk to characters multiple times, so just make sure that you exhaust all dialogue before moving on. On a side note, you can softlock the game if the water turtle pushes you against the platform (not a big deal, reload 10 second checkpoint). Overall, I don't have any real issues with the game, mostly the story felt like sliding on a big stick of butter.  \n\n[b] Overall Thoughts: 9/10 [/b]\n\nIs it worth $20? Well, it's a really good game for this niche genre if you like those types of ambient/psychedelic games like Dreaming Sarah - it feels bigger and more ambitious than most. There is no question that devs put so much love into the project, but it's still a niche game at the end of the day. My skepticism slowly faded away as the game kept being compelling in the storytelling and enjoyable locations. As someone that plays many games that occupy the same space, I can't really imagine a game that offers much more than that. For me, it was a special game, and by 'special' I mean like it hit a nerve, got pretty personal. \n\n[code]Review By: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/31294838-Hidden-Gem-Discovery/ [/code]",
      "So this is a fairly new pixel horror adventure game that I am indeed looking forward to, and i must say it is really good and its worth checking out. \n\nWell since the prologue is very short and sweet i won't spoil the story, there seems to be a super mysterious vibe to it. I just loved how polished the artwork is. Its a fairly new modernized pixel game and you can tell that instantly. Loved the alternative endings so far, strong occult and supernatural vibes, but i didnt feel that much scared playing the prologue except reading the ritual instructions. Not only there are alternative endings but alternative actions too which is quite unexpected, so the game is heading on the right direction. \n\nThis game is worth being voice acted, it's super great and the CG character art isnt bad either. Characterization of the main protagonist is pretty good of what i saw, she is a skeptic and this is a horror game, so far so good. To the devs, all i can say is that the game is going in the right direction and I am expecting more interesting things. \n\nCant wait for the full version to come out!!",
      "There is no skill requirement to play this game; everything seems pretty randomized including when and where the demon attacks you. Its rather difficult to play alone or just with two players. So if your looking for a game to play alone for a fright or just with one other buddy of yours. Make sure your ready to lose, This game has a great concept I just hope it will get more refined with the attacks. It seems like you get killed before you can even attempt to complete the objective.",
      "I was excited to play this after playing Persona 5 and Persona 5 Royal (my introductions to the series) to death.  This game was raved about and I thought, if it's more of the same then this should be great...\n\nThe major problem I have with this game is that it's so painfully obvious that it's a game made 13 years ago.  It's not a bad game, the look and feel of the Persona series is there and the characters are interesting etc.  But at the same time whenever I played this game, I just wanted to go back and play P5R instead.  Everything is just better in P5R.  The dungeons for example, the difference is night and day.  P5R's dungeons have so much more life to them, and look so much better.  Most of the environments in this game look like dull coloured LEGO sets put together.  It looks like it was originally on a handheld console (despite the remaster).  The other major example is the voice acting.  My god, some of the voice acting in 4G is on par with some of the worst Square Enix efforts.  Audio balancing is terrible as well.  And then there's the subjective stuff.  I personally much prefer P5R's soundtrack over this one, aside from maybe a couple of songs that were cool.  The setting of Tokyo is much more interesting and dynamic than this hokey town in the middle of nowhere.  The characters themselves I found much more engaging in 5R.  This was particularly helped by the quality of voice acting.  I think \n\nI'm glad that people are able to experience this game again on a more available platform.  I think potentially if I had played this back when it was released, I would probably have a different opinion of this game.  If you like Persona games and can look beyond what's dated badly, then the core game is very much the same.  If you were a fan already, this is a quality refresh to the game.  However, if you're like me and experienced the future of this series before playing this, I dont recommend it.  P5R provides the same gameplay but adds so much more.  It's a shame we cannot get that game on Steam instead.",

      "[H1] GUIDE TO THE PURCHASE OPTIONS [/H1]\nso heres how you can tell the difference between what your buying, because you don't wanna be like me, who often bought packs that did the same thing. \n\nHitman 3 standard edition - Just Hitman 3, so no Hitman 2 or 1. You get access to the newly added levels, as well as elusive targets and most of the escalations. This does not give you access to the 7 deadly sins levels.\n\nHitman 3 Deluxe edition - a bit scammy, not quite worth the money, but it comes with some music, 3 new skins and a couple of extra escalations. This won't give you any new levels. This does not give you access to the 7 deadly sins levels.\n\nHitman trilogy - Comes with nearly everything. If you want to buy hitman and access most of the levels, this is the one to go for. I believe the only things you do not get access to are the sniper edition levels, the patient zero campaign, the deluxe stuff, the 7 deadly sins levels and any extra skins. This is like the core of the game without any extra things.\n\nHitman trilogy premium add-ons - literally just hitman trilogy except it includes the features that aren't in hitman trilogy. You have to own the original Hitman trilogy in order to buy this one. The only thing it doesn't include is the 7 deadly sins. If you are stupid and can't comprehend what I just said; it doesn't include the base levels. Only the extra stuff\n\nHitman - 7 deadly sins pack - the new 7 deadly sins pack. It includes the 7 new levels that are a bit simular to escalations. Basically, there are still 3 stages in each sin, (they are sorted as targets, so every time you eliminate a target, its like a checkpoint. So you can really count it as just 1 stage with 3 targets.)  Its basically escalations but with a lot of effort put into them.\n\nHitman 3 access passes - these are basically dlc's that were put in hitman 2 and 1. If you already own these, you should automatically gain access to them during the carryover. There is one called 'hitman 3 access pass: hitman 2 gold', this basically means 'if you are new to the hitman trilogy, you can have access to the dlc in hitman 2 here'. \n\n\nhere are what the access passes do:\n\nHitman 2 gold edition - it gives you access to all hitman 2 levels, which is why its so expensive. It comes with all levels, including the sniper editions, the expansion pack (2 places, Maldives and New York) as well as some extra skins. Its pretty big if you ask me\n\nHitman 2 standard - gives you access to standard hitman 2 locations. This is basically the gold edition but without sniper edition, the expansion pack or extra skins. It gives you access to the base levels. Which is miami, columbia, mumbai, whittleton creek and the isle of sgail\n\nHitman 1 GOTY edition - gives you access to every level from hitman 1 but without campaigns\n\nHitman 1 GOTY upgrade - gives access to the hitman 1 campaigns, does not include the base levels.\n\n\nMost of these packs are worth the money. But most of them are on sale quite often. So if you think some of them aren't worth the money, you can always wait a month or two and get a massive sale on it.\n\nthank me later\n",

      "So, I hated this game at first...\n\n I've never been into a MMO before, and I went into it with a mindset of \"FUCK YEAH! MULTIPLAYER SKYRIM LETS GO\" - In short don't do that. This isn't going to be like playing Skyrim, Oblivion, Morrowind. \n\nIt is when it all comes down to the core an MMO, it's set in Tamriel, it sounds like Tamriel and the storylines feel like an Elder Scrolls game. However being an MMO, it has a lot of grindy MMO style quests. And don't get me wrong, it's bewildering at first, all these mechanics, all these places to go....and before the 'One Tamriel' update if you chose the wrong faction, you were screwed, in a place all on your own surrounded by all these people who are WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY higher level than you. But thankfully they changed all of that. The game scales now, so you can rock up to a dungeon with your level V300 mate, and still have some fun slicing up enemies.\n\nSo I saw a friend playing the other day, and spent a few hours installing this to join him (By the way its like 70 Gig...If you have slow internet prepare for a few days of download), I got back on it after not playing for 14 months, but this time I was playing with a friend who was already Veteran Level 250, So I was in luck, he introduced me to everything and I got used to all the deconstructing of equipment to get my blacksmithing up, showed me about dungeons and bascially got me to enjoy the grind. I think my previous time was a bit lackluster because I got dropped in the middle of the Aldmeri Dominion on my own, without any of my friends. So I left.\n\nNow I know what I'm doing, and keep in mind I usually hate MMO's never played WoW or anything like that, this is the first one. I'm enjoying myself, I'm triple digits into this game time-wise and I don't see it stopping now. We've made a guild for noobies. To help them out, and get them to enjoy the game also. Because the community is nice...but you still get the elitist fucks from any competitive game kicking you out of dungeons because you're only level 14. But you won't get that when you're in a guild, having people to play with and explain all the mechanics did help, a lot. I've even gone as far as to buy this AGAIN on steam just to collect my hours and so on.\n\nAdd-ons are awesome being able to mod basic features of the game to help with information and quality of life improvements is a must. I'll provide an essential mods pack if any of you wish to know.\n\nFor those of you who actually got this far into this, well done. I didn't think I'd keep you captivated long enough to get to the end.\n\nIf any of you are new to the game, on EU server and would like to join a guild to show you the way, add me or visit our [url=www.godsofsalt.com]website[/url] and join us on teamspeak, or just message us in game @diseasedcrow.\n\nBut all in all if you like Elder Scrolls and you think you want to try this, just do, I'm glad I gave it a second chance.",

      "Something I've been needing to get off my chest, despite how much maxis and EA go on about how much they care for the LGBTQ community, it's clear to me that they don't. First if they did they wouldn't be pushing the community the whey and as hard as they have. When things get pushed like they are, hateful people just harden there harts more, and just become infuriated. The sympathetic the become hatful towards it. The more something gets pushed, after awhile the more it gets hatted. A better approach would be, (if they really did care,) would be to put what they are talking about into a FREE pack, and get people whom make amazing custom content to contribute to it. If there is enough nice stuff in the pack people will download it, and talk people whom are on the fence to download it, and maybe to come over, and might start to get the people on the other side to at least get on the fence. That whey the LGBTQ community would get there representation, and acceptance would be pushed in a whey that won't burn people out.\n\n\nAnother resin why they should do it like this, and is part of why people are getting mad, is that they bought this game a certain whey, paid a lot for it and it's DLC, now they are changing, it and braking it to do so. Changing the experience against there will. Evan something you love like chocolate, or bacon, or anything will become something you hate if it's shoved down your throat ageist you will. If you want people to take it just offer it, most of the time people will take it. And if they don't just make it just make it more appealing. IE instead of braking the main game to add something even the LGBTQ community can't enjoy with a broken game. Make a free pack, and to tempt more people to get the pack, just add more nice CAS and build mode stuff. And maybe update the pack and add more stuff to it every once in awhile.\n\n\nI just had to say this for two resins, one companies being this careless or ignorant is just killing the public sentiment for LGBTQ and similar groups. And two, they are just killing interest in what they are selling, it will cut the Sims 4's life short, and will cut the Sims 5's life much, much sorter. \nIt's good to give options, as long as they are options. Or you are just like Hennery Ford, “The people can have the model T in any color! so long as it's black.”\n",
      "Pretty alright for being free \nThe visuals are just so yucky tho.\nAlso I don’t understand why a match has to be 20 minutes long, that’s pretty insane and I wasn’t able to check out all the characters and their special abilities because it would take way too long. Take brawl stars for example their battle are like 5-8 minutes if that.\nAlso it isn’t really clear if I’m supposed to attack the other team or the creatures to get points toward the final score. And I think I was supposed to steal some loot but I don’t know how to do that either\nSo overall I feel I need a tutorial and some better graphics maybe closer to real life and not a blob of unruly colors.",

      "This is half of a very good game. You might be impressed in the first 10 hours, but after that it becomes evident you are playing the skeleton of what could be a generational game. Here is some of the good and some of the bad.\n\nThe Good:\n-Graphics look great, even on lower settings\n-Decently varied battle maps\n-Sound design makes killing blows feel amazing\n-Decent variety of weapons\n\nThe Bad:\n-Extremely shallow \"campaign\"\n-Almost zero role playing elements. Every character behaves identically towards you. Even your own wife will try to introduce herself. Kill someone's father/brother/entire clan? They will never mention it and will behave towards you just like anyone else.\n-\"Realistic mode\" means all your enemies will be absolute tank meat sponges while you are made of glass.\n-After you get your first settlement the game becomes extremely tedious. You will play whack a mole with enemy armies who take almost no time to recuperate. Wipe out 3 enemy armies in a massive, \"war changing battle\"? Oops, looks like all of those armies are back to full strength in a matter of days.\n-Almost zero variation of playstyles. Sure you can be a trader or a rogue mercenary for the early game, but you will always end up cheesing the smithing economy mechanics to support the larger armies you need in the mid game\n\nThis is simply an unfinished game. The fact they have been selling it for $50 successfully for years is wild.\nWould have much rather paid $100 for a fully finished product.\n\nUnless they have a massive overhaul on the \"Official Release\" October 25th, I cannot recommend this game.

      "Everyone complained about the bugs and glitches but the real problems are that the game's systems are terribly outdated. People were promised a next-gen experience. I've played games from a decade ago that have better open worlds then this. \n\n- Police appear out of nowhere.\n- Police are amazingly easy to escape. You can walk a block away and lose them.\n- Civilian NPC's appear and disappear when you're not looking.\n- The A.I. is alot my artificial then intelligent. The only reaction they ever have is to duck or completely disappear in thin air. \n- The A.I. is basically on rails; they will not drive or walk around anything you put in front of them, they'll just stop and sit there for eternity.\n- The world doesn't actually feel alive (no random encounters). NPC enemies spawn in the exact same place every single time without fail.\n- Bars and food are exactly the same vendor with a different coat of paint. No matter where you go you can't sit down and eat something, or sit and enjoy a virtual drink (unless it's a talking-scene tied to a quest).\n- You can't interact with shop keepers beyond buying something or receiving maybe two lines of chit-chat. You can't rob them. You can't kill them. You can't get quests from them. They won't even react if you lob a grenade at them.\n- The \"car chases\" are on rails and there's only 3-4 prescripted car chases in the game.\n- Only 2% of \"choices\" your character makes in dialogue has any effect on the story. The rest are just alternate dialogue to give the appearance of choice and replayability. \n- Character starting paths (Street kid, Nomad, Corpo) have little to no affect beyond the first 20 minutes of the game and simple dialogue changes.\n- Player characters have no reflection unless you use the specific mirror located in your apartment. \n- You can't alter the look of your character after the initial character creation. Not even a haircut.\n- Can't customize your apartment in any way, shape, or form.\n- There's almost no reason to ever go back to your apartment after being there the first time.\n- Vehicles can't be customized; no new paints, liveries, or body-pieces.\n- There are 4 mini-games total: Hacking, shooting-range, boxing, and car racing. There are only two shooting-range quests, only 6 boxing matches, and only 4 races.

We were always discussing & trying to understand the ins-&-outs of the game and how to get a specific ending depending on what you did. Playing this brought me back to those good times in that library.\n\nThe OSTs are nostalgic, the gameplay is about the same and the artwork is amazing as ever(actually the graphics are much better with this remake).\nThe only complaint I have is that it lags at random times(though usually in the menu). The original IB on RPGMaker never did that.\nOverall I'm glad I bought this so I could support the Dev and thank them for all those years of entertainment-\nI just wish there wasn't so much lag over an RPGMaker game.",
      "Steins;Gate Elite is a great Visual Novel when looked at in isolation. The main problem is that Steins;Gate (the original) exists. I don't mind the difference in art styles, that is a matter of personal preference anyway. Graphics in Elite are a lot more animated, images in the original are more static but also more detailed. What I have an issue with is the missing parts in the story.\n\nThere are a few situations where Elite eliminates choices when compared to the original. I won't spoil details, but in one of the early chapters you can choose to ignore or answer a phone call, leading to alternate branches in the story (they join again soon after, but each branch still contains unique content). Well, you can choose in the original. In Elite, you automatically answer the phone, the other branch is no longer in the game.\n\nAt a later point in the game, I noticed that quite a sizeable chunk of a previously linear story progression (not even an alternate branch) concerning Faris was completely cut out. Again, I won't spoil details in case you just want to decide which version of the game to get and don't know the story yet. It has been some time since I played the original, so I might have missed more instances of missing story parts, but at least this one part was really obvious.\n\nThe missing branches and parts are not really relevant to the overall story, but you probably want them if you want to know more about the characters. Elite is more streamlined, but at least all of the alternate endings are still here. So while there is missing stuff compared to the original, there is quite a bit more when compared to the anime. Then again, the anime added more story after the true ending of the original game. I was hoping that Elite added (and maybe fleshed out) this extra content as well, but no luck here, Elite ends at the same point as the original.\n\nIf you don't mind the art style of the original, play that one instead. The second game (Steins;Gate 0) only exists in it's original form anyway. Elite might still be worth it if heavily discounted since it is the only way to get the \"free\" Linear Bounded Phenogram. You can justify it as buying LBP and getting Elite as a free extra.",
      "Why do people think they are funny and rating something in the opposite direction to what is obviously their true opinion?  There should be a rule against that.  Oh ya, and the \"game\" is cringe-worthy.  Get it for $0.01 and mine it for $0.04 worth of cards.",
      "GIVE ME THE GODDAMN COPY/PASTE ROOM BUTTON!\n\n10/10 would play again.\n\n(Ttips to combat the somewhat broken system atm:\n\n1. Use patients list, manually send those patients to treatment or home: \na. Very high diagnosis but still queuing for GPs (even 100% patients will wait for GP till their death, it will waste most GP resources)\nb. Very low mood/health patient, if you can gurantee the patient getting their treatment soon w/o affecting others in the queue, use the room's queue function, or use click on the patient to change his position in the queue, otherwise send him home to avoid penalty\n\n2. Treatments are much more profitable than diagnosis, plus they leave after treatment no matter what, but if well treated, then you don't need much ghost hunting janitors\n\n3. If in need of money in the early game, don't bother with food/drink/bathroom/comfort, do the minium and focus on your diagnosis -> treatment, most patient will get treated before they rage quit, thus make you a lot of money. With staff, if they near rage quit, just raise their salary.\n\n4. In the early game, only put down the essential objects (e.g. only desk and file cabinet in GP's) to maximize your profit. They only room I recommend to decorate to lvl 5 is staff room to speed up their recovery.\n\n5. ALWAYS ensure there is a toilet right next to your staff room, and a cafe. If a tired staff need bathroom, he/she will walk all the way to the staff room and back to toilet and back to staff room, even if a toilet is right next to his/her office. Samething with Cafe, it provides a 'nice meal' bonus.\n\n6. Do not build more reception than you need, build less. It is a great way to control the patient flow, they don't wonder around while in a reception queue.\n\n7. For a large map, patients entering the hospital from mutiple gates. I don't recommend building reception other than one specific area (preferably right next to GP's office), reason as above.\n\n8. News agent can get long queue very easily, as long as you have one, patients in queue will travel all the way across the map for it. So be careful, either don't put any, or put one in every building (at least).\n\n9. With spare money, get your staff trained ASAP, especially staff providing treatment (to ensure high chance of successful treatment)\n\n10. Click on a room, goes to 'info' tab, the last sentence there will tell you what training the staff in the room should have.\n\n11. Keep track of your staff's skills, and assign them only ONE job in the staff -> job assignment menu, so AI won't mess your system up.)\n\nThings I'd really like to be changed:\n1. WAY too many patients.\nI think the new patients' growth(spawn) need to be slow down at certain point either automatically or mannually, I often found myself in need of double the amount of GP offices in the mid-game. Since GP offices are the choke points, it can get out of control in matter of seconds, which left no Human resources/money/time to train everyone. Besides, it is realistic, there are only so many people a town have.\nAnd because of the growth issue, I find myself have to build more and more, I'd like to slow down and taking care of every corner of my hospital, not just keep building. Quality takes time, nobody like be overly pushed by the game.\n\n2. Rooms merge\nJust like in real lives, Doctor's room are private, but pharmacy? I think other rooms should not be private - Allow us to put multiple machine and people in one room, make it shared. It is just bizzare to not make it shared, and vey wasteful of time/money/spaces. Besides, some room looks really empty.\n\n3. Wards\nWards are weird, I'm not sure why. Often than not, I have more than enough beds and nurses, but still 6+ wait outside, I'm not sure what triggers them to be 'called in'\n\n4. FOOD/DRINK/TOILET is broken\nI'm sorry, but I'm not gonna build cafe & bathroom every 3 inchs. IRL, most hospital have 1~3 cafes, a small~medium toilet on every floor. Space is valuable, I would rather leave it to medical facilities. I think the AI is a bit broken at this point, they constantly want drink/food/bathrooms while I have 6+ machines/2 toilets in every building. As if they can't walk 10m to the nearest one.\n\n5. Janitors are kind of dump.....I wish we can assign areas to janitors/assitances, so they won't always walk across the map back and forth.\n\n6. Man, this is 2018, we got central heating and air-conditioning...for real. Maybe make a seprate tunnel system? Like water, electricity, heat, air. Hospital's air exchange system is much more important than usual buildings I believe.\n\n7. Credit to Ibbi Wyxx in the commnet, I think it is great to set patient with certain percent of diagnosis straight to treatment rooms. It makes sense and later in the game, with doctors fully trained I imagine 100% diagnosis on most patients in the GP's shouldn't be a problem. And it is how real life works as well, dorctors are not always 100% sure whats wrong, they might start some harmless/urgent treatment first, myself actually is in this situation right now \n\n(sometimes I feel like I'm being treated in my own hospital because I just stayed at one IRL, so I have to make everything right as if trying to please myself...)\n\n8.  Some of those skills just look fancy since you can't replace them.\nThis one does not matter much, I'm very OCD when it comes to managment, so atm I have to wait for the right person w/o any skills I don't want on them so the training oppourtinity will not go wasted, but it is hard and annoying. Besides, it is a real problem since you can only learn 5 skills, so just choosing whoever is not effective and effecient in the long run. (for example a GP w/ Radiology skill)\n\nAlso, it makes some of the skill essentially useless, i.e. master class (speed up learning and teaching), it may seem useful, but it will eventually cost you a lot more than you gain. Down the line it will cost you one spot for other skill. If just hiring someone w/ this skill to teach then fire him, it is also costly and not making any real sense. \n\nThings I'd like to see (in DLCs?):\n1. Ambulances management. Ambulance are essential part of a hospital, ERs are even better! (Stayed at a ER bed not long ago watch the whole ER room working,man, ERs are cool af, but I do hope less people need to see it because it is...ER)\n2. Multifloor-hospital.\n3. ICU etc.?\n4. Medicin/drug development/management\n5. Specialists office?\n6. More background music/radio, its a bit repetitive at this point",
      "I bought this game in order to review it, seeing as there were no current reviews for it. \nI thought I'd help the game out by maybe giving it that tiny bit of publicity it needed to get off the ground.\nIn doing so I have failed. As this game isn't worth reviewing, there is nothing to review. Well, I should say there is stuff to review but I feel as though the dev's didn't even attempt to make this a game that anyone would enjoy. Well actually I'll let them off of the target of \"enjoy\", I'd go further to say it doesn't even feel like they tried to make a game that someone who had nothing to do and was bored out of their mind would say maybe I'll play this for a bit\nI jumped straight in, ignored the help in menu and started playing. It took me at least 4-5 mins before I even had the slightest concept of what was going on and what I had to achieve. Once I did get the hang of it I still thought \"I must be missing something, I'm not really doing anything\" so I ventured to the help menu to find that nope, thats it buddy.\nThe controls are lacking, the soundtrack and the sound effects (which happen to be a melody playing) do not blend at all, (they play completely out of time on top of the soundtrack).\nYou can buy it and prove me wrong, go ahead. This is just my opinion.",
      "So the game can be played I believe in flat screen and VR, I played in VR. You play the game in a third person prospective controlling a spirit dog. The concept is easy, get the people to the light beam, but that's easier said than done. It was very nearly a short game play video as i become really stuck to the point i nearly quit but I tried, tried and tried again until i did it. It very much reminded of a game i use to play as a kid called lemmings only in this one it doesn't matter if the people fall of the edge. Its a very challenging game, one where you can just sit and try to figure it all out. I thought it would get repetitive but each level is very different from the last. I have a game play video in which i get a bit frustrated lol if you wanted to check out some game play. https://youtu.be/7VPsLnDDDlQ",
      "[I received this product for free from a giveaway]. Only played for a short time, but sheesh, it's a bit of a mess both visually and gameplay wise. There's not much I can really say that would differ from what's shown in the trailer (rather crude MS-paint looking drawings with a few short looping backgrounds). You jump when moving right or left, flappy-bird esque, you dodge stuff going across the screen and from the top, which is a bit boring to me, but some may enjoy it more. You also have to go out of the screen to dodge sometimes, but also if you go too far out (who knows how far) you'll die as well. It might be an okay time waster for free (like old flash games), but I wouldn't recommend spending your money on this.",
      "First, let me state that the 3 hours shown as my time played is majorly inaccurate. I spend most of my time playing games in offline mode due to living in a VERY rural area with no internet available aside from satellite or mobile hotspot (both of which have extremely stingy monthly data caps). I started playing this game less than 24 hours ago and am currently on day 22 in game.\n\nAs has been said by others, if you are a fan of Animal Crossing, Harvest Moon, Stardew Valley, Staxel, etc, this game is something you will want to seriously consider. There is already a significant amount of content available with more being planned in the developer's roadmap. What is here is well designed and feels like second nature if you've ever played any of the aforementioned games.\n\n\nWhat Dinkum Does Right\n\nGraphics - Excellent. Graphics are exactly what I would expect for this style of game, Characters, buildings, animals, and environments look absolutely great.\n\nMusic - While the music is definitely understated, it fits the setting and gameplay perfectly.\n\nSound Effects - Another area the game absolutely nails. The sound effects are spot on from the rainfall, pick on stone, bees buzzing, fish splashing, and even the gibberish language voice effects are exactly what I expected.\n\nDay/Night Cycle - The day/night cycle is dialed in to the point that it strikes a near perfect balance of giving me enough time in the day to make progress on my projects while also not giving me so much time that I can make so much progress that the day/night cycle is meaningless.\n\nTool Durability - While tool durability is still something that annoys me in video games, it is something I have grown to accept and Dinkum manages to make the system feel like less of a hindrance than most other games in the genre.\n\n\nThe Missteps\n\nThe Sky - As I said earlier, the game's overall graphics are great. The one place I've noticed that falls a bit flat is the sky. While during the night, it looks pretty decent, during the day and evening, is a bit lackluster. Not a dealbreaker, but it is a bit disappointing considering how great the rest of the game looks.\n\nUpgrading Tools - The fact that I have to buy a basic axe, pickaxe, etc and then use a couple of ingots to upgrade it rather than being able to just make a new, higher tier tool from scratch is a bit annoying. ESPECIALLY on Sundays.\n\nBland NPCs - Now this is something that I was initially hesitant to include given the game is an Early Access release and is one of the easiest things to polish up in a final release. That said, the game is being presented in a FOR SALE manner, so I feel that what is currently in the game should be considered indicative of what to expect in a full release and decided to include it. That said, the game's NPCs (with the exception of Fletch) do feel incredibly bland and lacking in personality when compared to those of Stardew Valley, Animal Crossing, Harvest Moon, and the like. As stated, though, this is a simple fix as the game nears a final release.\n\n\nOverall\n\nGiven how minor my few complaints with the game are, this is a game that I would absolutely recommend to anyone who is a fan of the genre and I consider it an absolute steal at a $20 price point.\n\nAs someone who has grown disenfranchised with Nintendo, having a game that takes the Animal Crossing community building gameplay and merges it with the farming, hunting, and survival gameplay of Stardew Valley is something I had been hoping to see for quite a while and Dinkum does a fantastic job of capturing that. This is a game I am very excited to see completed and I would love to see more games like this on PC.",
      "I like furry art, but first and foremost im a RPG gamer, and as such I will rend judgment impartially. \n\nThe story is not bad, but still falls in the average category and it is predictable, gameplay is the same as the first Fuga (I have no problems there) but there are few new enemies,  so the strategy to beat the regular battles is very repetitive. My biggest complain remains the same since Tail Concerto and it is the dificulty... which is way too easy, there is no hard / nightmare mode for veteran players, Im not asking to die repeatedly like in dark souls but Cyberconnect2 needs to understand some players like a challenge in their games.\n\nMusic is ok and Hack is the best character of the lot (Tah tah tah tah  taaah!!!!!)

      "Big improvement over the first game. \n\nCombat is much more enjoyable and the boss fights actually have some interesting patterns and design.

      "Imagine releasing an \"update\" that breaks peoples games/ mods, JUST SO YOU CAN PUT A BANNER AD IN THE MENU FOR BL3. Just WOW.",
      "EDIT:\n\nWhile I have played Squad quite a bit for a few years, the large update named \"V6.0 Infantry Combat Overhaul\" unfortunately did not sit well with me.\n\nThe goals for the update:\n\n- Increase length of fights.\n- Reduce the impact of lone wolfs (solo players).\n- Increase emphasis on teamwork mechanics, which mainly meant supression.\n- Increase gunplay diversity, to create choices between optics, since the old meta meant that the magnified optics were greatly outperforming iron sights and holo sights.\n\nWhile I do not disagree with some of the goals, the implementation of them left a lot to be desired.\n\nAfter the update most gunfights became a mess of supression, without either side being able to effetively kill each other beyond 200m.\nGunhandling was also drastically nerfed, creating the sense that your character has never held a rifle before, or even used an optic for that matter.\n\nI can unfortunately no longer recommend this game, since I myself no longer feel drawn to play it.\n\nIf enough changes are made, I may revisit the game and this review, but for now there are better options out there.\n\n\n** OLD REVIEW ** \n\nCan the game be amazing and fun - yes! Do I recommend this for everyone? - No.\n\nThe experience of the game largely depends on what servers / communities you play with. If you play the core game with no moderation (no rules or admins), the game will become a race to make the first unit and lock others out and a race to get armor, then proceed to rush the enemy and end up spawnkilling them near their main spawn.\n\nIf you play on moderated servers with established rules and active admins, then you may experience a great sense of teamplay - other times not so much.\n\nBefore you buy it though...\n\n- Microphone and willingness to use it is REQUIRED for a good experience (People will quickly kick or become hostile towards you, if you do not communicate)\n- This is not battlefield or call of duty, running of solo to pull off 360 noscopes will probably get you kicked/ killed.\n- You will die without knowing from where and you will get into situations in which you have no option to survive, especially if you're new to tactical shooters.\n- You will end up running... A lot..\n- Armor is not like battlefield or call of duty, you need a driver, gunner, commander and possibly a loader (has a machinegun). Where you hit the enemy matters as much as what you hit him with (Armor piercing on his front turret will likely bounce, but even a high explosive may hurt if you can hit him up the rear)\n\nStill here... ?\n\nIf I haven't scared you off, here are my personal tips:\n- Play. The. Tutorial.  Like really...\n- Try different graphic settings, shadows especially makes a big difference in enemy visibility (game looks better with them though)\n- Start as infantry and pick rifleman, but remember to join a squad.\n- Find a server that seems to have active admins and have a ruleset you agree with.\n- Try NOT to give up when you die, generally it isn't worth throwing away a ticket to respawn if you have friendlies within 100m. Sometimes it is the right choice, but before you know which is which, it's a good idea to hold on for a medic.\n- Not all squad leaders know what they're doing, do not be afraid to join another squad if it turns out your squad leader is a fool.\n- Defending is often as important (if not more), than attacking... But you may end up waiting 30 minutes without getting shot at or shooting anyone.\n\n\nAs you can probably tell... Squad is a community based game, with in-depth enough mechanics, while also being easily accessable.\nIf you want a good sense of what the game is, check out some lesser known streamer playing it (bigger streamers will often give you the wrong sense of what a game is like)\n\nHope this helped you make an informed decision.\n\nbut for now there are better options out there.",

      "Ib manages to do for me what so few horror games manage to accomplish, and that is to actually give a sense of unease and dread. Without going into spoilers, it's only a few minutes into the game that things start to tread the path of uncomfortable surrealism, with the art growing considerably more disturbing in how Ib interacts with it, and how the art interacts with her.\n\nWith all due respect to more conventional horror titles, say, Dead Space or The Evil Within, Ib maintains a feeling of dread and discomfort. Enemies can be evaded, yes, but there's a feeling of being stalked while trapped in a world you can't possibly fully understand. \n\nContrast Dead Space remake, where soon enough the horror gives way to cutting off an abomination's arm, then using telekinesis to impale it or another horror with said arm, then simply setting fire to the more mobile enemies.\n\nThis is not, I repeat, not to disrespect games in which reducing enemies to a smoldering heap of charred body parts is an acceptable tactic- there is a time and a place for the cathartic destruction of the nightmares that haunted our closets and lurked under our beds. Ib, however, leans firmly towards the horror and self-preservation of being in a hostile and unknown environment, where the only feasible option is to run, hide, and hope whatever nameless horror eventually loses track of you.\n\nAnd let's face it- some modern art galleries are creepy enough already, even in the daylight.\n",

      "Ni no kuni II: Revenant Kingdom is a great RPG that, while a little dissapointing in some aspects, makes up for it with it's positives.\n\nLet's start talking about the negatives: \n\n- the characters are a little bland, most of them barely get anything added to their backstories nor are there any specific sidequests for them (yet). They're not bad, and Evan/Roland are good characters, but the rest falls a bit short.\n\n- The soundtrack is a little forgetable, even if it does have a few good gems in there\n\nNow the \"neutral\" points:\n\n- The main gameplay is simple, with only a few attack buttons and barely any combos, so if you're looking for a deep combat you're going to be a little dissapointed.\n\n- The story is simple; i personally enjoy it and how it ends but i could see someone who's looking for some deep story to be left unsatisfied.\n\nNow for the good aspects:\n\n- The graphics are beautiful, it's basically a playable Ghibli Studio movie\n- The gameplay (both combat and army based) is fun, fast and rewarding to do, especially when you unlock more spells\n- The kingdom management is simple to do and it gives you a sense of pride and accomplishment (unlike EA) when you expand it with new building and bigger borders\n- The sidequests are for the most time fun with cool citizens to meet and recruit\n- The random dungeons are cool to explore\n\nI played 85 hours of this game and i enjoyed every second.

As you move along the story and investigations grow more complex, which could be a bit fatiguing, especially by the end of the DLC. Though everything here is great, don't mishear me. The art is disgusting. It's visuals and music complete the necessary deranged curious mood to undergird the transmutating tone of a murder-filled horror story into one that equally unnerving as it is subtly hilarious.\n\nThis is a game made by some Latvians from Latvia, and maybe, buster, you should just pay them some money and attention.",
      "I do think the Mixed review rating is justified, but for the wrong reasons.\nHere are a few pro's and con's from someone who's been a long-time fan and played every Dirt game except the first one.\n\nPRO:\n+ Handling and physics are alright on both \"Gamer\" and \"Simulation\" settings\n+ Decent soundtrack\n+ Building and leveling up your staff and garage gives the game more depth\n\nCON:\n- Horrendously inconsistent AI. In roughly 15 years of playing racing games I've never seen AI as inconsistent as in this game. I played on \"Tough\" and could complete some races with a 10+ second gap, while others were quite literally impossible. This is because of the auto generated track system - unlike in the previous Dirt games, the AI never actually drives on the track, but stage times are auto-generated by how an AI *would* likely perform on a stage. \n- Lack of tracks / Boring tracks. As mentioned, there are no proper tracks for Rally events as they are auto-generated. While the tech behind it is quite impressive, this leaves most tracks feeling incredibly dull with no highlights or features whatsoever. Remember the cool cliff sides from Greece in Dirt Rally? None of these here. Essentially all tracks feel the same no matter what the location is. Couple that with the fact that there are only 5 locations and you'll find yourself bored quite quickly. Rallycross and Landrush tracks are not auto generated, but feel incredibly boring and forgettable. Baja or Malaysia in Dirt 2 were such a blast, but Dirt 4? Yawn.\n- Historical Rally. In its entirety. It's just normal Rally with older cars, but after a while I refused to continue this event type as the events are dragged out as hell. Near the middle you'll have to complete 12 events with each 5 stages. That's 60 stages in total. Consider my previous point about tracks feeling dull and I can't help but wonder who actually completed all these events. This seems to be a Codemasters thing though as I had the same issue with Grid Autosport.\n- Menuing. Why is it that I need to go out of the career every time I want to buy a car? Why is selecting sponsors (which you'll do often as they expire after awhile) in the same category where you can customize your car? Everything is a huge mess and finding the right things took me more time than it should every time.\n+ Lack of rewards. I actually found Joyride, which isn't part of the main career, to be the most fun thing to do in the game. Even though the events in Joyride repeat frequently but with different cars, it was a proper challenge compared to the career and is somehow quite addicting. The issue with it is that it's meaningless to complete. You don't get anything for getting a Gold medal on everything, not even new liveries or, heck, even an achievement. It's utterly pointless.\n\nAll in all this game is easily the weakest entry in the franchise (minus Dirt 1 maybe, but that one had a way smaller budget). To top it off it just feels like this game has no soul either. I vividly remember Dirt 2's gritty and colorful presentation, while this one lacks anything I could remember the game by. Really all this game made me want to do is play Dirt 2 or Dirt Rally again. Cheers and thanks for reading.",
      "This review only relates to the single player campaign. At 50 years old I have zero interest in multiplayer.\n\nAfter playing Gears of War 4, I was looking forward to this title. I wasn't disappointed. I found the new upgrade system with Jack enjoyable. The campaign was fun to play with minor exceptions. Graphics, sound, and voice acting were amazing. Campaign took me about 11 hours to beat. I consider that well worth the $60 I paid for the game.\n\nMy only real gripe about the single player campaign:  As a father of 3 girls, I'm all for strong female leading characters. Kait just isn't it, though. I didn't care for her in 4 and that didn't change in 5. For me she seems out of her league and just isn't believable as a team member. She's like Elizabeth Swan, the governor's daughter in Pirates of the Caribbean. She's a kidnapped damsel in distress in one movie, and the Pirate King in the next. It just doesn't work, for me anyway.",
      "if you love trpgs but are getting tired of all the great indie devs emulating ogre tactics and ff tactics while wondering where the fire emblem/langrisser love is at then this is your game. It is hands down THE best non-fire emblem game that falls under the latter category of styles and punches so far above its weight class that at one point while playing i idly wondered if they poached an intelligent systems game designer or something (they didnt).",
      "In all honesty, I became a little bored in the middle of playing it. It wasn't until I was almost through with the story that I realized why it had gotten such high ratings. You have no idea how hard it hit me when I realized why he was at the hospital [him being at the hospital is not a spoiler btw], and how relieved I was when he had at last found peace. It was in that moment that I had no regrets in purchasing it and how it was worth my time. Despite how brief the game was, I'm gonna remember it for a while. \n\n",

      "Tomb Raider is a fun game that is really well made. It has outsdandingly fluid, cinematic, and rewarding third-person cover-based combat, and is set in a cool, mysterious environment that makes it feel like a sexier version of an Indiana Jones movie. \n\nIn the end, the question of whether or not you should buy this game comes down to a few items:\n\n+ Do you care about the Tomb Raider IP in general? If so, then that’s a pretty obvious point in this game’s favor!\n\n+ Are you interested in gender politics in videogames? If yes, then this is a title you should probably play at some point, to form your own opinions on how Crystal Dynamics dealt with the Lara Croft reboot in a contemporary context.\n\n+ Do you like cinematic games with quicktime events? If yes, you’ll really like this one, but if no it’ll probably kinda piss you off.\n\n+ Do you love platforming and puzzle solving? If you do, then you may or may not be disappointed here. Tomb Raider's platforming is so cinematic yet automated that playing it is kinda like watching someone else play a puzzle platformer that looks like it’d be a lot of fun if they’d quit hogging the controller.\n\n+ Are you a fan of third-person cover-based combat with a touch of stealth? If yes, then you probably don’t want to miss this one. If not, then do not buy this game!\n\n+ Is it worth the money? Tomb Raider is fun, but will only take you about a weekend to beat, and it has little replay value. Buy it used if you have a console, wait for a sale on Steam if you have a PC.\n\nFor a much more in-depth critique, please check out the full version of this review:\nhttp://www.protagonistcomplex.com/tomb-raider-2013-review/\nIt talks about the Lara Croft Reboot, Character Empowerment, Ludonarrative Dissonance, Design, Platforming, and Quick Time Events.\nIf you like what you see, join our Steam group for updates!",
      "How is this game so damned good?\nAnd for 3 bucks.\n\nVampire Survivors is setting a new bar for value in gaming. $70 for a new AAA game? Pfft. I think not. Not when games like Vampire Survivors are available.\n\nIt is fully functional on the Steam Deck.\n\nThis is an RPG Auto-battler enemy hell (bullet hell). You control the progression and pathing of your character, the game handles the actual combat, making for a near perfect synergy between game and gamer.\n\nThere are currently four main maps and then a bunch of specialty maps, one of which was almost definitely designed specifically to help you expedite your unlocks. Each has its own unique theme.\n\nUnlocks are the progression system in this one, and it works. Accomplishing almost any unique task or reaching certain levels will unlock the next things in line. However, character unlocks have an additional cost in gold (acquired in game). Similarly, permanent character boosts can be unlocked and all characters receive the benefits of all unlocks. There are even more things to unlock veyond those, and everything not only feels practical, but have a noticeable affect on gameplay.\n\nYou'd think that it being an enemy (read: bullet) hell, and with an array of abilities at your disposal, the screen would fill up quickly, and it does, but somehow, the devs managed to make your avatar noticeable and trackable no matter how high the screen chaos gets.\n\nSpeaking of which, for lofi graphics, these are just flat out cool. Again, it just works. The soundtrack mirrors this, and you'll be able to switch between tracks as you please. Additionally, I find this is a great game to play while jamming your own tunes.\n\nIn my opinion, the value at 3 bucks and the huge amount of gameplay variety make this a no brainer. You get far less from any number of full priced AAA titles. AND...the game hasn't even concluded development yet. What other surprises do the devs have in store, I wonder?\n\n[code]If you found this review helpful and would be interested in supporting my Curator group, it would be appreciated.

      "Old-school Zelda + Dark Souls + Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind = Brilliance.\n\nThere's not much else to say about that. This game is great. Yes, it may be a bit hard for some people but that's what makes it fun. \n\nHyper Light Drifter is a shining example of what a great game is and what an \"Indie\" game can be. Stirpped down graphics can still be beautiful, no cutscenes and dialogue force the use of imagination (God forbid), both for player and desginer, in both telling the story and weaving it into gameplay, and the ambient music is both mysterious and foreboding; setting an atmosphere that makes the game's world feel all the more vast and unknown.\n\nOne of the best games this year, I'm calling it. One of the best gaming experiences I've had since Shovel Knight. There's no going wrong in picking up this title. It makes me all the more bummed that I missed out on pitching in to the Kickstarter; I would've more than gladly given it money for development AND paying the full price for it when it was released. \n\nReally, it's that good.",
      "Great addition to the series. Adds just enough on to the original game's mechanics to justify itself. The length is a good bit shorter than the first but the price is reduced to completely make up for it. All around great buy if you enjoyed the first.",
      "***NEWBIES*** At least 50%, if not more, of this game is map knowledge. So don't beat yourself up if you're  super lost and everyone is yelling at you over game chat. Just mute the salty people and report them if they TK. Trust me there are a lot of people in the game that will back you up and want to help, so don't let one bad experience make you quit the game for good.\n\nThere are a LOT of maps to learn and a lot of small details in every one. It's going to take the average person until your siege level is at LEAST 50 before you really start recognizing map layouts and details on all maps - including room orientation, call outs, soft wall, hard wall, what should be reinforced in each site, common paths of travel, etc..  And then probably until 75 until you're actually comfortable with most maps and operators. I'll give 15% to your own gun skills, 20% to team work and communication (call outs call outs call outs, people. Don't be that guy that just looks at memes after dying. Unless it's casual.), and 15% to your knowledge of the operators and ability to utilize their gadgets. \n\nMore tips:\n-There are a lot of Diamond/Plat smurfs in newcomer that like to make new accounts and s*** on actual new players because it makes them feel good for some reason, so you're better off playing quick match. \n-To learn maps faster, make your own custom games and run around in them. \n-When you die, make sure you watch the replay so you know what cheeky angle the enemy was holding and then don't do what you did next time, or use it to your advantage when you switch sides. \n-If you're not on cams, watch teammates. Look at the places they check as they sweep rooms. Watch the paths they take. Look at how they engage in gun fights and how they rotate around the map. \n-Spend the extra few dollars to buy a version with some operators - it'll make game play more fun for you and you'll have an easier time finding operators that work best with your play style. \n-Squad up with friends - being able to communicate and laugh in a discord can really improve the game experience, even if it's just one other person.\n-Best way to really understand an operator is to play them, so take advantage when there are siege events that allow you to play whoever you want. Use this information to purchase your next operator with the game currency. \n\n",
      "Earlier this week I did the impossible - I came out to a family member. One of my two sisters, in specific.\n\nI was nervous but relieved to know she accepted and supported me - and thought, you know, perhaps we should call and talk about some things. We had that call this Wednesday and I expressed a lot of my resentment towards my family - being stuck at home with some of my family, more specifically my [spoiler]mom[/spoiler], has completely wrecked my mental health. I'm still closeted from them and I live with each passing day, worried [spoiler]she'd[/spoiler] reject me - for being non-binary, for dating a trans person, for disappointing [spoiler]her[/spoiler].\n\nMy sister told me that [spoiler] my mom [/spoiler] only hears what [spoiler]she[/spoiler] wants to hear, that [spoiler]she[/spoiler] only thinks about what [spoiler]she[/spoiler] wants to see in [spoiler]her[/spoiler] kids despite often saying otherwise. From her experience, [spoiler]mom[/spoiler] seemed to be a very not open and is often a close-minded individual. \nComing into If Found..., I had only broke down early Thursday morning as my many months of frustrations and anxieties finally given the voice it needed.\n\nIf you've played the game it'd make sense if I told you that Kasio's experience with her parents in If Found... hurt reading for me - it genuinely hurt. Seeing her mom's first letter and annotating it with \"She's trying. But she has all these ideas of how I should be.\" and \"She didn't even consider she might need to apologize too.\" was something I sat at for a long time, probably longer than any other part of her journal that I was erasing through at a normal pace.\n\nMoments like that made me realize that this game is something I never knew I needed - a realization that hey, think about the move out you're doing in a month as rebuilding - as leaving the past behind. That there isn't anything wrong with that, and that you can really be yourself once we're out there, together. That family doesn't have to be bound by blood and it's really about the people who's there for you, even at your absolute worst. That I don't need to seek acceptance through others - but rather be more accepting of myself.\n\n[spoiler]\"I find I care less and less what other people think of me, and more for my own opinion. And these days I'm so much more comfortable in my own skin.\"[/spoiler]\n\nThere's people I can think of who need to read and see this.\n\nIf Found... left me with hope - and it's leaving me with a lot to think about. Thank you so much for this game, DREAMFEEL. I wish I could articulate this game better like other people have - but it's been a lot lately and I need to rest - if you're coming across this review/text you should without a doubt play it, especially if you've felt similarly trapped like both me and Kasio did.\n\nP.S. - If you find the eraser mechanic to be a little strenuous you can increase the size of the eraser in the options!",
      "A lot of people's main complaint's seem to be about microtransactions. The game is perfectly playable without spending a dollar other than what you spent on the base game.

It is rather annoying when in a 4v4 and the host gets tilt and breaks the match by leaving, losing all the exp earned.\n\nTL;DR people are mad about spending extra money but want dedicated servers for free? =/\n\n*EDIT* after spending a few hours practicing, I now get told to kill myself on a regular basis in duels.\n\n11/10 Git Gud",

      "This is easily one of the funniest games I played in 2017.  In the 20 hours it took me to solve it the first time, I pretty much did nothing else until I had finished it, despite the fact that I was supposed to be studying.\n\nThe game is set in absurd western themed world where humour is so baked into the fabric of everything that there is virtually nothing that isn't some kind of joke.  This could easily fall flat if it were poorly written, but I found the writing to be fantastic.  Obviouslly humour is subjective so if you aren't onboard with it's humour you proably won't get much out of it.  For everyone else you are due for a hell of a ride as the game is an absolute hoot.\n\nThe game takes place in a kind of openinsh world with your character setting out from a location on their horse. You can either select to \"Wander\" in which case you will make a broad loop out and around, potentially unovering new map locations or encountering a random encounter.  You can also direct travel to locations you have found and will also be told about map locations from NPC's or as the outcomes of various quests.    The world is feels quite expansive with a lot of interesting locations to explore.  There are a couple of central plot quests to pursue and a bunch of side quests as well.  In my 20 hour playthrough I managed to complete the main story but still had a few side things Id managed to miss all the clues for.\n\nCombat in the game takes place in a turn based format that should feel familiar to anyone has played a JRPG before.  You stand on one side, your foes tand on the other and you select your various attacks and abilities from a list specific to each characters class.  As you gain XP  you can choose what skills you buy so you can tailor your character to your play style, with higher skill levels costing increasing amounts of XP.  You can further personalise your character with a swathe of various equiment, almost all of which is humorous and absurd.  The combat is not particularly complex but its good enough and the humour is so good that it really does the heavy lifting for keeping you engaged.\n\nAs you can see from the screenshots the graphics portray everything in stick figures, but everything is surpisingly detailed and the great animation and the little touches really add to the charm of world.  A still screenshot doesn't really do justice to how much fun this game is to see in motion.\n\nThe music and sound are suprisingly good too, with twangy guitars and banjos mixed with good old time whistling and other wild west sounding stuffness.  Once again is better than you have any right to expect from such an overtly daft title and between the lively graphics and relelentless humour It's just another layer of polish to draw you into the games odd version of the wild west.\n\nLook I flat out loved this game. It was a delight. As I said, your milage may vary if the humour doesn't tickle your funny bone but I can tell you now, never have I laughed so hard at a game as I did digging through the spitoons in West of Loathing.\n\nGold.\n\n9 out of 10",

      "Wow. Just wow. This is BY FAR the best visual novel i have played. the old school forums and cameras feel very detailed as whenever anything happens in a video chat, no matter how small, the characters react to it. the story was very enthralling and every time i slipped up and made a wrong move, my heart would feel as though it was gonna beat out of my chest. talking to violet felt very real and made the ending that i got so much more satisfying. the only bad things i can even say about this absolute masterpiece is just the fact that most of the really impact full options were locked because \"Emmett isn't cocky enough\" or  \"Emmett isn't compassionate enough\" which felt very vague and confining.\n\noverall the game is absolutely amazing and i wish the devs would come out with a game similar to this because of how good it was.\n9/10",
      "Ah yes, the infamous Saturn Quest, the only 3 game series that has 3 fans and maybe 30 sold copies put together (I imagine it's not exact but very close). Part bullet hell, part space shooter, part boss rush, some platforming here and there, and even some puzzles with exploration - so take that intuitive game design. Once again I feel like I have to thank the developer for this rather personal gift, I take it personally because only a few of us still follow these games, and I imagine the dev is well aware of its lack of appeal. As with other Arkhouse games, I don't play them because they are good games, I am playing them for the experience, strange art, unique soundtrack, and just the world that I can't truly explain. \n\nI was just about to say that Arkhouse finally made a game with fair difficulty and learned from his mistakes - yep spoke too soon, it's a nightmare, a test of patience like it always is, 5 games back to back, shoving a hot ____ __ __ ___, absolute torture, no mercy, only illusion of hope and a false sense of security. I can just see myself from 3 years ago, yea Beetle, we have been through this before you know, stop acting like you're surprised. It started so relaxing though, almost self-aware of his mistakes in a way, even kinda playful which is not something that I usually get from these games, but yea, eventually the game ramps up the difficulty to what I consider a \"let me play something else\" tier. Actually, I will say the difficulty in this game is kinda more reasonable, but at the same time,  it's not any easier than the previous 2 just because some of the boss fights are so time-consuming, plus some of the space stages are just BS, they always are with this dev. \n\nYea, if you did not like Arkhouse games before, this probably won't change your mind, I just think the first half of this game is a lot more accessible, not as intense as some of the other entries, and I actually really like some of the interactions in the narrative (if you want to call it narrative, there is a little twist this time), it seems the developer is more aware of his tropes now, implementing them in a more enjoyable way. Overall, whenever this game changes the genre I feel like it has a better sense of direction and purpose, whereas in previous Saturn games it was done just for the \"hey, look at my artsy game\".\n\nI will say that there are individual parts of this game that are well above other games from this developer in terms of being mesmerizing with beautiful pixel art, plus the music this time is absolutely stellar which is a huge upgrade from the second game. The only nitpick I have is that a lot of bosses look similar now, I actually kinda liked the design in the first game a little more. There is a pretty cool twist on the combat system, you do not just dodge bullets and hump the bosses now, but you can also build turrets and other support structures, it's kind of a cool idea, but it also makes it more confusing at first.\n\n[h1] Pros: [/h1]\n\n(+) I think there are moments in this game that would make it the best Arkhouse game in terms of visuals, music, atmosphere, and even how the game interacts with you, I actually think the world is a lot more playful this time around. It feels like the developer is a bit more self-aware, I always ***** about his game design, but it seems there is an \"attempt\" to use it to the game's advantage.\n\n(+) As with any game from this developer, you do get something a little different from your typical video game, and this game is no exception. It seems the developer believes he was at the height of his creative power, and I can see that. It's probably the most realized game in his collection, although it's probably not the most compelling story (I think Cube Gothic beats it slightly), there is a better sense of creative direction, and aside from a few unfair difficulty spikes, I think the game almost feels like a crazy art museum, more so than just another game.\n\n(+) I actually like how you handled the narrative this time, kinda committed to that Saturn Language joke, which worked for me personally, and I will tell you, I 100% understand those conversations and exactly what is being told - not really. I like all of the dev-to-player interactions with the hints, didn't expect much humor in this game after the first 2.\n\n(+) You know, I think that turret thing was a really cool idea and it builds upon the previous game, it just does not work that well in all situations, often making the boss fights very long, but I do like the added layer of complexity. \n\n[h1] Feedback: [/h1]\n\nHere let me copy/paste my feedback from the last 5 games. You know what, I am not doing it again, it is what it is, it will never change, stay toasty Arkhouse, you might be crazy ******, but I still can't live without you. Okay you know what, put a jump on a dedicated button, one day right, not today, and probably not next game. It's a joke I know you won't do it.\n\n[b] Overall Thoughts: 8/10 (this is a diehard fan score okay, I am aware of my biased here, I like it personally, and I am sure most people will hate this game with a passion) [/b]\n\nIn the spirit of this game I will put my final thoughts in the only language this dev understands.

The story of the two Homeworld campaigns is very nice, the aesthetic of the game is excellent in my opinion, but when it comes to the multiplayer, in vanilla 2.1 Homeworld, the current version, you will face severe balancing issues between the races.\nFortunately, the community has come up with a solution, one that took a lot of time and effort to be. Thanks to them, the multiplayer is now playable with the patch that they made -- the 2.3 players patch. It's still being updated and is worked on by people who understand the overall concept of the game and the genre it belongs to.\nIt's available to everyone in the workshop and is in my opinion (and a lot of others's) the best way to experience both multiplayer and the game itself.",
      "I'm gonna give this a thumbs up but with like, idk, a cautionary sideways thumb for maybe. \n\nif I read credits right, it looks like this game had all its programming, art, music, and writing done by one guy, so I have to give respect to that. For a real indie game like this, it's very very good. \n\nBut it's still really flawed. If you're looking for a 2D Metroid game, and you've played EVERY other 2D metroid game, I suppose yeah, go for this one, and I think you'll enjoy it. If you're not a fan of metroid, I would not bother, sadly. This game suffers from a lot of problems from metroid games, and does not fix any, and at times exagerates those problems. \n\nThe art style is very interesting and cool, but the way the levels and map design are, leaves most areas feeling like a mess of unmemorable places. \n\nThe combat is INCREDIBLY simplistic, yet somehow bogged down by WAY too many useless weapons and just kind of badly designed controls. I found there were about 5 weapons that were actually useful in the game out of what seems like more than 10. Most enemies you either cheese, or be cheesed. There's no charge up shots, there's not really much nuance to the enemies or bosses. They have about two attacks and repeat while you dodge the same one bullet pattern and just kind of shoot in their general direction. (I played it on hard by the way. Not a particularly difficult game, but even the slightly challenging stuff felt kind of dull and uninteresting.) \n\nThe music was cool again. nothing quite mind blowing, but it was nice. The world itself seems like a mess, but there are cool ideas. The giant robot people were really cool to see. \n\nOne little idea i really liked is that the LOW HEALTH beep sound is actually in sync with every song in the game. I thought that was really cute, and it's not something I've seen any game do. Sounds dumb, but I give a lotta props to that, it was cool. \n\nWriting is okay. I feel it left more to be desired. There seemed to be an interesting world here that wasn't explored enough. It wasn't bad, I suppose, but not really that great. \n\nThat is kind of this game. It's not bad by any means, but not the best game on the planet. Play it if you're in need of a Metroid game, and I'm certain you will be pleased enough despite the flaws. Even if you're just having a hankering for a platformer and have already played Hollow Knight and some other great ones first, I think you should enjoy this, but don't expect a 10/10 game. \n\nGive it a try if you feel it looks interesting.",
      "As a current spec op who has seen conflict in China, North Korea and Dust II, it's clear to me this game is barely mil-sim YET much more than another arcade type shooter ala COD. Within the weapon systems selection, well I'd say its pretty sparse as are the clothing options but where this game shines is in the finite number of deaths one can suddenly have, somewhat similar to the amount of coronary artery blockages the average American can withstand before succumbing to a cheeto dust infused death ride to St. Michaels gate.\n\nGraphically it is fine, runs well on my beastly PC (which is to be expected given the salary i earn putting my life on the line daily), seems to have very few glitches/bugs.\n\nThe sounds are way off though and needs a revamp on what actually body dismemberment should actually be like.\n\nUltimately what makes this game worth it is the player based, often I find myself among enthusiastic Aussies calling me the roo rider and exclaiming how fast my fast twitch reflexes are.\n\n8.3/10",

      "Usually when writing a review, I like to make comparisons between the title being reviewed & other games I've played through recently. However that's not an option in this case, as there's absolutely nothing I've played that can be compared to wonderfully zany happenings of 428: Shibuya Scramble.\n\nThe story is told through from the perspectives of multiple characters whose paths collide throughout a rather unique day in Shibuya, with choices made by each character having a knock-on effect into the other routes. As an example, if character A needs to take a taxi but character B has already taken it, then character A might not be able to escape misfortune (or maybe they'll avoid misfortune by having avoided the taxi). What does this mean? Bad ends aplenty! From the terrifying to the downright hilarious, 428's bad endings never fail to be engrossing, & make the search for the right path throughout each characters routes even more rewarding.\n\nWhile the game as a whole can be described as a crime thriller, each character route tackles different genres, varying from pleasant things like lighthearted comedy & stories about friendship to harder stuff such as psychological horror & a full on cop drama. Each route is fantastic in its own right, with brilliantly written characters being brought to life thanks to a real sense of individual believability & the expertly crafted presentation.\n\nThe presentation as a whole is a mix of still-shots & live action video, & while there may be a few instances of the text not totally matching up to the photography, it's overall fantastic, with the few video sequences adding a real sense of importance when needed the most. The OST is an absolute banger from start to finish, with a real mix of genres ranging from relaxing shoegaze right up to the dramatic OP. Hopefully Spike can release it through Steam in the future!\n\nThere's also a very generous amount of bonus content, varying from a little quiz minigame (that opens up bonus scenes) to fully fleshed out routes exploring other times & characters within the world. Expect the main story to set you back anywhere between 20-30 hours, with the bonus content potentially adding another 15 or so hours ontop of that, although a lot of it will be gated behind reaching a certain number of bad ends. I'd not blame anyone for using a walkthrough because of this, but I'd really recommend keeping your main story playthrough as spoiler-free as possible, as the bad ends you'll undoubtedly encounter really add to the overall experience.\n\nUnfortunately, there are some technical annoyances that need to be mentioned. The biggest one regards auto mode, & how it behaves between pages. If there's an especially long sentence that spans across multiple pages, the engine will power through the first half of it & skip right to the second page & the second half of the sentence, making it almost impossible not to miss out on small bits of text unless you scroll up. This is made even worse by there being a few seconds delay between auto mode being manually disabled & being able to look back at the previous pages (or do anything else UI related). I also had issues with the controller uncoupling from the game, despite still being picked up by Steam. The only way I found to remedy this was by restarting the game, but after a while, I just swapped over to using the keyboard, & I'd suggest you do the same.\n\nOverall, while its tech issues & clunky interface can't completely be ignored, they do little to detract from what is otherwise an absolute gem of a character driven crime thriller. With its brilliant characters, wonderful presentation, & incredibly ambitious design, there really is nothing quite like 428: Shibuya Scramble, making it one of the very few VN experiences that I'd consider a must-read for any & all fans of the medium.",
      "First hour:         This is interesting but I'm not sure I will cry in the end...\nSecond hour:    Ok the story's going somewhere...\nThird hour:        Oh shit...\nFourth hour:      The tears won't stop, please help...",
      "[h1] 9/10 [/h1]\n[h1] As a sequel to Steins;Gate, you won't be able to understand the content of the game without playing the previous game. [/h1]\n\nThe sequel to the famous visual novel game Steins;Gate. Although some people think that Steins;Gate 0 is not as good as its predecessor, I think this game is a well-deserved excellent sequel.\n\nA change from the witty and relaxed game style of the previous game, the overall atmosphere of this game is heavy, and personally I prefer this kind of visual novel work. The plot of the game is naturally wonderful, so I won’t comment here to avoid spoilers. If you are deeply attracted by the game’s background settings and characters before playing Steins;Gate, then this work must be worthwhile. The music of this game is also very beautiful, and it will never disappoint the players. The only shortcoming of it is that the description of some characters is too sloppy and the characterization is insufficient, such as Kagari.\n\nIn any case, this one is definitely a must-try work for players who love Steins;Gate, and it is an important addition to the series of plots. As a related supplementary sequel, its nature is also destined that players must play the previous game in order to understand the content of this one.",
      "This is my Maifa Definitive edition review. As someone who has spent the last week of my life playing this game and 100% completing the game and all of its achievements, I feel like I can have an input on whether this game is worth a buy or not. \n\nFirstly I bought this game as part of the mafia trilogy bundle which at the time of buying it retailed for £49.99. As of writing this review I have not played the other 2 games so I cannot say if the bundle is worth it just yet. But that being said the first game is totally worth the £25 or so buying price. \n\nGame also played on Classic difficulty (the best one)\n\nThe Good -\nThe story and world -  (no spoilers) This is one of the better stories I have played for a long time and a lot of this  is due to the original game that came around in 2002. I was 2 years old so I have never really been aware of the game's story. The story, world and the characters are what I would say the game exelles at the most. The game had me chuckling at interactions between the characters and that is quite rare for me! The world is set in the 1920s era and it is amazing! Everything from the music, the cars, the suits, the guns are incredible. If you are like me and love a great story and some action and adventure. This game will hit the spot for you. \n\nThe combat - This is also one of the biggest enjoyment factors of the game for me. Each gun feels slightly unique with the way they shoot and the adjustment for recoil and how much damage each weapon does. Although the melee combat is one of the laziest I have seen in a long time. That being said, I had an absolutely horrific time with the controls with the mouse and keyboard. The combat was so frustrating at times and not being able to remap the keys to mouse buttons was extra irritating. So PLAY WITH A CONTROLLER. This makes the driving, combat and overall experience so more enjoyable.\n\nThe driving - This is something you do a LOT of in this game especially on classic difficulty. So again play with a controller because it can take some getting used to. Once you get the hang of it and understand the different mechanics like pressing A to nudge around corners. It makes for a cartoony yes but a very fun driving experience. You will feel yourself become the best driver in the city once you master it. \n\nThe missions itself - Again I won’t go into detail about the missions because if you are reading this you probably haven't played it yet. I just want to say that there are a good variety of missions that are interesting, whacky, strange, but also a great time. They offer a GTA like experience where you never quite know what's coming next. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bad- \n\nOptimisation issues - Okay this is a big one indeed and I had many issues with the game throughout my playthrough. Firstly I meet the requirements and have installed my driver updates. So it was definitely the game. Now what I experienced were low FPS, stutters, the game got slightly chopped off when borderless. No crashes though sometimes the stutters got so bad I couldn't control my car, which is a big issue in a game you drive a lot. What I did do to eventually get it running pretty much flawlessly with no stutters was to play in windowed mode with v-sync on. I can't really give much more detail so hopefully this helps. Just make sure you meet the recommended specs and run it windowed. \n\nThe UI - This is personal preference honestly, some people might not care but I did. This was something I was able to change in the menu settings so it was fine. Things like having giant markers in the way where a 1 year old could figure out where to go. Enemies on the minimap which took the immersion out of knowing exactly where enemies were. Etc. \n\nControls for keyboard and mouse - This is something I was baffled by, they took no time in making sure every person who plays on a keyboard and mouse has a good time. The controls are awful and almost impossible to remap to how I would want them. So play with a CONTROLLER please. It is the best way.\n\nGame and story length - I think this review took almost as much time to write as the game lasted. It isn't awful, but I would have liked it to be longer for sure. It feels like they skipped thighs out and time just moves very fast. Overall I completed everything the game has to offer in 25 hours give or take. \n\nConclusion - If you enjoy action adventure games like I do with a great storyline and characters, set in this amazing world that Hangar 13 has recreated you will honestly enjoy the experience. As long as your pc doesn't have issues with it of course. My advice would be buy the game, try it make sure it runs okay then play it and enjoy it. If it doesn't refund it.\n",
      "[b]What was added:[/b]\n- Roguelike mode\n- New campaigns\n- 5 new units\n- Groove/Super groove\n- 4 new commanders\n- New OST, including Commanders'\n\n[b]What did it cost:[/b]\n- No more Arcade and Puzzles\n- A lot of maps removed from Multiplayer\n- Can't randomize weather anymore (????)\n- Can't use previous OST\n- No more Co-op campaign\n- Nothing to unlock with stars. All characters are already unlocked, so there is no point completing the campaign with more than 1 star per mission.\n\n[b]With that being said, here are some issues:[/b]\n- Balancing may need some work. Won't get into details, but it doesn't feel right, as it wasn't right in Wargroove\n- AI is still bad. Even worse than before. They just didn't touch it. They will use their Groove on cooldown most of the time, without bothering about the Supergroove. Commanders will run into you only to get surrounded and killed.\n- Once a player lose, all of his team lose, putting the game to an end. Though there is a toggle in map editor to disable it, but doesn't seem to work\n- A lot of tooltips missing for settings. We don't know what most settings are doing...\n- Tried to make a map where Commanders can respawn after 2 turns, to prevent AI to lose instantly, and let them play more agressive. But when you increment counters or set flags booleans, they get changed for both teams, making it impossible to script... Can't debug efficiently either.\n- The new Commanders' themes are glitchy when looping\n- The Codex didn't get updated properly. When selecting a Commander, we can only see a short text for the Groove, without any details.\n- In Map Editors, there are two entries for Wulfar, but using different names.\n\nI'd say if you liked Wargroove 1, you'd just like that one too. But it feels really disappointing right now. I don't know why they removed features instead of just adding new ones... In 2020, they said they were working on AI. But they did absolutely nothing.",
      "Before I continue writing my review on this game, I got to say that the PC port of Valkyria Chronicles is one of the best, if not, [u]the[/u] best port. The game was originally exclusive for the PlayStation 3 back in 2008. The game was well received, but garnered low sales that would put the sequels Valkyria Chronicles 2 and 3 on the PSP. I actually never heard of this game before until a few week prior to the PC release on November 2014. That said, I will have to give a standing ovation to Sega for putting an effort to make the PC port well optimized in 1080p (or more) at 60 FPS (or more). Sega has my attention and I will present this review.\n \nValkyria Chronicles focuses on Welkin Gunther, a son of a legendary general who fought in the First Europan War, leads a platoon of some adults and teenage volunteers to defend their country against the invading forces of the Imperial Alliance. The game presents a mix of tactical strategy and third-person action that is very unique in the strategy game genre. Does this game deserve your attention? \n\nThe story takes place in a “fictional” European continent where the Second Europan War was fought primarily between the Atlantic Federation (think of all of the European countries, in a geographical sense) versus the Imperial Alliance (Russia, in a geographic sense). Gallia is a “neutral” country where it contains a unique resource known as Ragnite. Thus, the Imperial Alliance invade Gallia to get Ragnite to fuel up their war resources. One of the greatest parts about the game is how well the developers use analogies from World War II into the game and its execution is well-received. The analogies ranged from weapon designs (like the Gallian Scout weapons that look like the Soviet SVT-40 to the Imperial weaponry comparison to the real-life MP40 and STG44, and plenty others). The analogy extends to vehicles and geopolitical conflicts. \n\nThe character developments in the game are highly impressive, particularly with the relationship between Welkin (protagonist) and Alicia Melchiott (deuteragonist). The themes in Valkyria Chronicles consist a good mix of “light” moments (like hope as an example) and “semi-grotesque” themes of war (such as discrimination/racism, personal ambition over soldiers’ lives, and others themes that will unravel later on). Some reviewers criticized the game as being not serious on the themes about war. Honestly, I don’t think that the game is supposed to be depressing and a good mix between “light” and “dark” is best suited for the game. The story starts really slow in the beginning and actually begin to progress as you reach a certain point in the story. The plot is pretty good in most area while few scenes are a bit “awkward” in terms of sudden shifts between a sad event to a “positive motivation”. \n\nThe gameplay in Valkyria Chronicles is turn-based, but it is very unique because once you click on a character to choose, you can actually control the character to move to any location in third-person you like as long you have enough Action Points (basically, the movement bar). Experience points and money are earned by Ranks (like A, B, C, and D) by completing an objective within a certain number of turns (Example: Getting a ‘A’ rank within 3 turns or less to get the maximum amount of exp and money). However, it is possible that you can actually kill all of the enemies on the map, complete the objective, and still get an ‘A’ rank in the majority of missions (except for a few of them). \n\nWith the exp and money, you train your soldiers based on classes Scout, Shocktrooper, Lancer (Anti-Tank/Explosives), Engineers, and Sniper rather than individuals. The money are used up to upgrade weapons, buy tank parts, and purchasing “reports” from a reporter in certain chapters in the story. The game would last you a good 30-50 hours if you play the game in a smart, tactical manner or have an “OCD” on getting an “A” rank on every single mission in the story or a mix of both (like I did). \n\nThe game does have some faults, particularly when it comes to classes. Reviewers argued that Scouts are too overpowered, but in my view, it is best to say that scouts are too reliable since they have the most movement bar and top-tier weapons like the ZM Kar 8 (the game's version of Soviet PTRS-41 that can obliterate any enemy, even medium and heavy tanks if you shoot it in the back). Engineers are useless in the game since you won’t repair your tank very often (depending on your play style) and Scouts are the better alternative. There are some bugs in the game that is related to the monitor refresh rate (if you play it on a 144 Hz monitor like I did) in certain missions in the story. PC controls are a bit awkward when you control the tank. There are a few moments in the story that has some poor “transitions” (an example would be that an upsetting moment happened in the story and all of a sudden, some of the major characters wanted a medal for their part on a major battle in the next cutscene as if that upsetting moment never happen or affected them). \n\nThe game is often compared to XCOM when it comes to gameplay. This may be true, but Valkyria Chronicles is very unique since you can actually control the character in third person instead of the computer doing it for you when you command the character to move from Point A to B, in bird’s eye view. The game engine is very aesthetic and presents the story very well. I’m glad the Sega released Valkyria Chronicles to the PC and I am very pleased to hear that a (possible) new Valkyria Chronicles game is being trademarked (and hopefully in development) thanks to the PC sales. The default price of $20 is a good deal, -50% off is a great deal, -75% is a perfect steal. Valkyria Chronicles is one of my top games for 2014 due to its unique strategy gameplay and superb PC port optimization. I am looking forward for the new game that is being trademarked (or possible PC ports or revamp for VC2 and 3). This game has my highest recommendation for any strategy gamer who want to find something original, unique, and beautiful.",
      "This game's constant revealing of stranger and even stranger esoteric strangeness with every case, the way hitting start you are slammed in the gob by an unexpectedly gnarly tableau, a sinister mise-en-scene with a man burning to death on fire or blasted apart by a canon while wry cultists in various states of masked and undmaskedness make slight comments to say How deserving they were to be killed by us in just that way, oh yes!\n\nAhhhh! That is all about what I love The Case of the Golden Idol for.\n\nIt is 13 deduction puzzles (including the DLC) for you and perhaps a friend on the couch wherein you will become acquainted with a decades long revenge tragedy that tore several families and several kingdoms apart as many people lost there lives in heinous and sometimes magical ways. As you move along the story and investigations grow more complex, which could be a bit fatiguing, especially by the end of the DLC. Though everything here is great, don't mishear me. The art is disgusting. It's visuals and music complete the necessary deranged curious mood to undergird the transmutating tone of a murder-filled horror story into one that equally unnerving as it is subtly hilarious.\n\nThis is a game made by some Latvians from Latvia, and maybe, buster, you should just pay them some money and attention.",

I love that this is direction went by the developers, I feel it was a really good evolution of the series and mixing it up with a shoot em up gives it that extra punch/kick/slash. The graphics, characters and bosses are just so awesome and you can feel the grittiness of the mechs. Aside from the awesome game play, the environments and atmosphere has really leveled up. Love the boss destruction sequence as you can feel that accomplishment of kicking its ass. looking forward to Valfaris next installment. Congratulations with this metal AF game!",

      "Started strong, ended annoyingly.\n\nMoral of the story? People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.\n\nIt paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that \"routine\" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.\n\nI liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters. But it all fell apart and tries to teach a very vapid moral that someone in their early 20's who has never had a meaningful relationship would idealize.\n\nAt least it was short.\n"

Very fun and has endless replayibility\n- I only have 3 hours in this game but I can say it ain't worth £45. Graphics are trying to look cool but just look crap. Glitched unit textures. Runs well doesn't crash but I just hate the changes from the old total war games. Unit icons look crap I can't tell what is what. My general dies there are no notifications. Can't find how much ammo archers have. No tutorial at all. Tried attacking a tier 1 settlement only to lose everything to the towers. I'd rather play rome 2. I really hate the general idea, the fact that any old general can rock up and kill 600 men is stupid.\n- Most of the negative reviews cover my complaints already. So I won't rehash the ones I've already read. \n\nHere's my biggest complaints: \n\n- Jumpscares have never been compelling to me. Doubly so on VR. Are you trying to injure me in my computer room? Stop. \n\n- Guns are fun. Not having ammo for them is not fun. (The game is pretty generous with ammo but it also encourages tediously conservative behavior, if you just unload clips at shit you'll run out pretty fast) \n\n- \"Continuous Turning\" feels so bad. Like, how can I turn my headset and everything looks smooth as butter, but as soon as I use the look stick for turning suddenly it's all choppy and looks wrong? I'm familiar with some of the motion sickness issues people get with turning in VR games, but this isn't that... \n\n\nThough honestly it seems like they just leaned really into the whole horror thing, which is fine, but also just super not my thing. \n\nIf the mechanics and some design choices had been better I might have slogged through it anyway. \n\n\nGame's beautiful, though, so they got that going for them.\n- > go into time trial\n> classic f1 cars\n> 2004 ferrari\n> put on headphones\n> play with that gorgeous v10 as soundtrack\n> best day ever\n\nalso career mode is great\n- It looked old when it was released. Now it's downright ugly. The gunplay is clunky. The physics are terrible. The bugs are ever present.\n\nThe RPG mechanics are top notch. The choices you make matter.\n\nOne of the greatest games ever made.\n- Remember when you first played Thumper, and you were expecting a rhythm game but got so much more?\nOr when you played Thomas Was Alone, and you somehow fell in love with characters who were literally monochromatic rectangles?\nOr when you got to the final level of Journey, and you nearly cried of amazement at the emotional EXPLOSION AND RELEASE?\nAll those feelings? That is Sayonara Wild Hearts.\n- Heartbound is a fantastic indie game with a lot of heart and fantastical mysteries.\nIf you enjoy beautiful 2D gaming experiences this is the game for you! \n\nPlay as a young boy on his journey to find his doggo, Baron. \nYou will explore various, unique worlds on this journey each with mysteries of their own...\n\nThe music I must draw particular attention to: It is wonderful to listen to. Honestly do yourself a favour and pick up this game- it is still in development but you will be glad to know that the updates are (thankfully) free!\n\nGive this game the love and attention it deserves!\n- I am a 43 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he helped me. Loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.\nThank you <3\n- Early Access Review:\nPros: \n- Hilarious flavor text in the form of Books and Proverbs. Seriously, someone took a lot of time creating all that.\n- Really enjoyable music\n- Beautiful pixel art\n- Engaging and interesting story\n- Overall very fun introduction to a huge world\n- Highly responsive dev team that's not only advacing on completion of the game but actively listens to their already large community of players\n- There's a lot of secrets and things to do that you might run out of time to do before the end of the year deadline. You may find yourself needing to play the early access a few times to find everything.\n\nCons:\n- This is early access folks, there's going to be a few bugs here and there\n- The early access content ramps up really fast and gets very interesting and then ends with you really wanting to know what's next. This is really only a con because I'm really impatient and want the full game asap. ;)\n- I would recommend ARK only in 1 specific case – you have a group of friends and will play on a private/local server. You get to enjoy the game at your own pace, with modified server multipliers, without the worry of PvP and server-dominating tribes. Graphics are great, the world is beautiful, lots of cool dinos to tame. There’s a lot to do, to build, to explore, to figure out.\n\nBut playing on a large PvP server is horrible experience. You are at a mercy of alpha tribes that have everything and can do anything. Slow progression, server wipes, laggy combat, so much grinding to catch up just to have your base destroyed while offline. Maybe you could find some servers where all this is more balanced but even then, it just becomes a game of who can grind more. It’s just not something I would ever recommend.\n- No matter what the reviews say, this game is pretty excellent.\nGameplay wise its pretty good, the match 3 systems are fun and almost exciting to play at times.\nTheres no sex, which isn't a bad thing as if thats what you're looking for just search for it online lol\nThe stories are good and the designs are pretty, sure it's short but it fits the pricepoint.\n\nThe developers have announced that they've gone bankrupt which is a shame but what can you do.\n\nOverall 8/10\n- I have a serious love/hate relationship with Sea of Thieves. It is both one of the best games I have ever played and one of the most frustrating games I have ever played, all wrapped into one. The gameplay of Sea of Thieves is INCREDIBLE. The sailing is the best in any game I have ever played. The feeling of exploration and discovery as you blast through treasure hunts and puzzles and mysteries is unlike any feeling you can get from any other game. The cooking mechanic, the healing from food, the not-terrible fishing mechanic... all subsystems that prop up the rest of the gameplay are unique and interesting in their own right. The land-based combat is relatively uninspired, yet still satisfying when part of the greater picture that the game presents. Some of my favorite memories in gaming, full stop, come from completing long nights on the high seas or doing long-form content available in the game. The game is gorgeous, some of the best ocean/water graphics in any game. The rest of the game is equally beautiful while perfectly conveying the environment of the map you are in. I swear to Gaben that I can freaking smell the wet sand or sulfurous lava on some of these islands. The music and sound design are some of the best in the industry. Outright, the game is incredible. \n\nBUT... Sea of Thieves sweaties ruin the game for me. There is absolutely nothing worse than having a night full of fun absolutely destroyed by some player who's enjoyment of the game is derived from eliminating anyone else's fun. I understand that PvP is part of the \"pirate life\", but it is by far the worst part of the game by far. I would be willing to pay money, hell a freaking monthly subscription, for the opportunity to play SoT as a strictly PvE game with just my friends and the rest of the server populated by bots. I actively avoid playing the game now because of how many of my last play sessions started with me spawning at an outpost and subsequently being sunk less than 15 feet off the dock by some sweaty that hasn't seen sunlight since the Obama administration. I know that this is an incredibly unpopular opinion in the greater SoT-sphere, but part of the enjoyment of games is letting players enjoy them how they wish, and I really freaking wish that I could enjoy the aspects of SoT that are fun to me without being the plaything of those pirates who live only to ruin the fun of others.\n- Write a review they said.. alright.. here it is... \n\nI am at year 5, day 29, Population 250, its winter right now in my little village.. my vikings are freezing, but they should not be. I have stores of coal available to them but they just do not go get it. \n\non a scale of 1 - 10, right now.. a solid solid 7. Why just a 7, well.. its new.. its not finished yet.. and still a tiny bit buggy. \n\nGameplay. It's good.. but i would really like to be able to grab the map with a left click hold and drag it around that way. The camera movement when trying to move the map is slow.. too slow for me. Also the fact that you have to clear whatever you have selected before you can selected the next thing you want to build. \n\nGraphics... VERY nice.. love it.. everything has great detail. People walking really nicely. Now for the not great part.. zoom in on a fishing boat.. boats moving.. oars. well.. they are not moving, I think I have even seen a fisherperson sleeping in the boat as well.. little more on the animations will probably be inserted at a later time.. but I thought it humorous, People also do tend to walk right into the side of a mountain and vanish.. then poof.. they walk back out at another area. \n\nHousing:  Great looks on both the poor and good housing. the option to just upgrade from poor to good would be nice.. \n\nStorage: Storage needs some work.. seriously.. So you have the Wood storage and you have stone storage.. they are basicly the same looking building.. I'd like to see them combined, with that being said.. please add COAL and IRON as well. Make it so that we can set whats to be stored in that building and make it have workers.. that way we can have dedicated vikings move the specific stuff.. \n\nWater: Please allow the area of coverage to overlap.. OR. make the coverage a square so we can fully cover the areas.\n\nFOOD: You gave us these great fields to use. But um.. can we grow something other than wheat and barley? like. potatoes? carrots? I mean, the vikings didn't only eat meat and bread?(but i am also aware the games still in progress)\n\nThe only real issue I have had with the game so far on my system is I was spending point on the tree and when I went back to the village it was gone and I had to reload. I do know once in a while a reload will fix the workers from gathering resources but it doesn't always work.\n\nSo over all I really enjoy this game. I'd definitely recommend  this game to anyone who enjoys city building survival type game. \n\nHope everyone enjoys this game...\n- My previous review reflected the terrible state of the game as it was on launch day. After years of improvements, the game has had its map design & cover placement tweaked, pretty-boy playermodels have been dirtied up, cringy voicelines were adjusted & a bunch of new content has been added. A lot of my complaints were addressed and I recognize the amount of work the team has done to bring the game back. It finally feels content complete and has reached an acceptable level of quality that should've been there when it came out.\n\nHowever, I am still disappointed to say it falls very short of its predecessors in terms of gameplay, map design and atmosphere. I see no reason to play this instead of BF3/BF4. \n\nPlay the map Grand Bazaar in Battlefield 3. Look at all of the particle effects, post processing and detail that map has. It has such a thick rainy atmosphere. Play it through to the end and you'll see how players tear up the map and make it look destroyed. In BF4's Paracel Storm, the foliage will sway & the waves will rise as the strong winds of a storm approaches the map. Watch as a sandstorm creeps up in Gulf of Oman and eventually engulfs it in a torrent of chaos. These landscapes have so much drama that the ones in 2042 lack. Sure, there are sandstorms and tornadoes, but they still look so sterile compared to the previous games this title stands upon.\n\nConceptually, 2042's world is supposed to be on its knees. The growing reality of extreme climate, natural disasters becoming commonplace and the world powers fighting over the last resources Earth has to offer depicts a dire situation to immerse ourselves in. This makes me imagine maps where earthquakes adjust the layout of flags throughout the round, or tsunamis roll in and what once was a playable area is now flooded. Giant tornado events that tear down skyscrapers. Sandstorms that turn the widest of maps into a close-quarters brawl. \n\nThe maps in the game have some aspects of this concept but nowhere to the amount that it should. The technology is there. The previous games have had a genuinely impressive level of immersion and atmosphere. 2042 did not have this on launch and it still doesn't. This could have been the wild natural disaster Battlefield game where we see SHTF.\n\nI don't care that we have 128 player matches or goofy butt specialists to play as. They missed the mark with 2042 and no update can fix that, conceptually, it never was able to realize its potential.\n- ---{Gameplay}--- \n☑ Try not to get addicted\n☐ Very good\n☐ Good\n☐ Nothing special\n☐ Ehh\n☐ Bad\n☐ Just dont\n\n---{Graphics}---\n☐ Masterpiece\n☑ Beautiful\n☐ Good\n☐ Decent\n☐ Will do\n☐ Bad\n☐ Awful\n☐ Paint.exe\n\n---{Audio}--- \n☐ Eargasm\n☑ Very good\n☐ Good\n☐ Decent\n☐ Not too bad\n☐ Bad\n☐ Earrape\n\n---{Audience}--- \n☐ Kids\n☐ Teens\n☐ Adults\n☑ Everyone\n\n---{PC Requirements}--- \n☐ Check if you can run paint\n☑ Potato\n☐ Decent\n☐ Fast\n☐ Rich boi\n☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{Story}--- \n☑ Doesn't have \n☐ Something isnt nothing I guess\n☐ Not greatly told\n☐ Average\n☐ Good\n☐ Lovely\n☐ Will make you cry or smile alot\n\n---{Difficulity}--- \n☐ Just press a bunch of buttons\n☐ Easy\n☐ Significant brain usage \n☐ Easy to learn / Hard to master\n☐ Not so easy\n☑ Difficult\n☐ Dark Souls\n\n---{Grind}--- \n☐ Nothing\n☐ Only if you care about leaderboards/ranks\n☐ Isnt necessary to progress\n☐ A bit grindy sometimes\n☐ Average grind level\n☐ A bit grindy\n☑ Insanity\n\n---{Game Time}--- \n☐ Long enough for a cup of tea\n☐ Short\n☐ Average\n☐ Long\n☐ Depends on you\n☑ Endless\n\n---{Price}--- \n☑ Just buy it\n☐ Worth the price\n☐ Wait for sale\n☐ Maybe if you have some spare money left\n☐ Not recommended\n☐ Dont throw money into a rubbish bin\n\n---{Bugs/Glitches}--- \n☐ Never had any\n☑ Minor bugs/glitches\n☐ Few bugs/glitches \n☐ Can get annoying\n☐ Ruining the game\n☐ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs/glitches\n- [h1]Technology[/h1]\nThe game is (was?) awfully poorly optimized.\nI don't think this game looks good enough for the hardware it requires. Some old RTS games looked similar to this title but required much less to run (I am referencing how the technology is better but the \"PC to FPS\" ratio has gone downhills).\n\nI understand that calculating AI choices and the simulation take a lot of resources, but this is not a game with a few thousand AI players like e.g. EU4 is. This is a relatively small map with just some AI players. This game also does not look that much better than some other RTS/TBS titles and I had FPS issues even with the lowest settings.\n\nI first ran this title with R9 280, so a quite old GPU, but that GPU was fully capable of running many decently modern games. This is IMO unacceptable, the developer can't optimize the game, and releases poorly coded product. I tested different graphic settings and noticed nearly no differences in the framerate.\n\nI then upgraded my PC to the top AM4 CPU and a very new GPU card (6600XT, overclocked) and the game ran fine on the highest settings, but I would not call it super smooth. All the other games run perfectly.\nElden Ring, Baldurs Gate 3, Cyberpunk (absolutely 0 issues in Cyberpunk). I would say CA messed up their game and didn't care to optimize it.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThe game is rather decent, it's enjoyable and has a connection to the lore of Warhammer.\nYou can't say a bad word about the general RTS mechanics, the battles and whatever. Just a normal RTS...\n\nIt just isn't the greatest RTS/TBS. Compared to Heroes of Might and Magic 3, or titles like let's say Cossacks, Age of Empires, or maybe Supreme Commander... It is unique in the Total War way, but given the amount of games in the series, it's ... not unique really (I have seen everything this game offers in different titles over the years).\n\nJust a giant simulation with a surprising lack of mechanics for an RTS game (as in economic aspect, diplomacy, map tactics. I think Europa Universalis IV is a good example of a really advanced tactics model in an RTS/TBS game and Civ 6 would be a great example of map design/economics). I personally don't like the maps for real-time battles. These maps seem quite crude and the skirmishes are badly designed.\n\nIn order to inflict maximum casualties you would need to kill every single unit. It should be enough that you break the enemy and automatically win. It's also quite unbalanced. Depending on what you kill first the results can wildly vary (including the AI acting much differently every time and the proposed outcomes of auto-resolved battles are just unhinged).\n\n I probably would like this game more without the \"real-time\" battles, but I assume it's the \"Total War\" way. To me it's time intensive and just not interesting. I liked Warhammer 40k's battles much more. They felt more tactical. Placement of units in this game does matter, but I had more fun playing The Battle for Middle Earth 15 years ago than this. I think the units panic too quickly and the characters don't matter enough.\n\nIt's the closest to the HoMM in terms of map and characters, however it lacks many things that made HoMM great (like tailored character development with meaningful spells and ability to recruit units, find artifacts on the map etc). The cities feel kind of empty, the mechanics are rather poorly described/introduced and just weird for an RTS (for my liking). \n\nI am not sure why there is so little care about the main characters. It would be very cool to build them up, be able to find artifacts on the map (besides the Sword of Khaine, that's just one item) and do something else than just advance some skills in the skill tree. Even if you invest your time in them then they can be sieged and just die.\n\nI also don't like some mechanics, for example the corruption, or slaves (they are not much intuitive. I think they should create clearer GUI and work on the general set of game rules, rather than make every faction different but also following totally different rules. Are we supposed to compete in a campaign and how if we follow different rules?). \nSome game prompts are meant to \"help\" learning the game, but they not always load up and they also don't explain small logos (traits) of the units, it's pretty useless. You need to use web browser anyway. Why to bother?\nIn that aspect - I think the designers totally messed up the UI/UX.\n\n21st August 2023 update: I played Baldur's Gate 3 and imagine they paid enough of work to actually make icons explain the traits of characters or items, amazing is it not? Seems to be lack of care. Every single icon in BG3 is fully explained. I could learn the game's rules and effectively build my characters.\n\n[h1]Genre[/h1]\nThe game is pretty fine, it gives some fun when playing it. Feels like Warhammer I guess? I personally am more of the 40k fan, but a game in the old universe is making lots of sense and the character design with world design are high quality.\n\n[h1] Summary (what made me dump this game also) [/h1]\nThe character design is quite impressive and it seems that they cared about the \"vibe\", but the game is just a money grab. why are there 3 game titles instead of one? What is the main improvement in between all of these titles?\nEach one of them has dozens of DLCs. An average person surely won't spend 300$ just to play more factions.\n\nWhat angered me so much I stopped playing after the purchase:\nThe publisher releases a paid product that claims to have free DLCs - some of them are, but the most important one isn't, and without it the game has got only 50% functionality and feels like a demo.\nRTS game without skirmish mode or some kind of \"do whatever\" mode is a meme. This isn't a DnD campaign board (and ironically such a campaign would allow for much more than selection of 5 heroes on one map lol), but an RTS in a specific universe.\n\nEvery normal RTS game has got a skirmish/free play mode (The Battle for the Middle-earth, Command and Conquer, Supreme Commander, Cossacks, Starcraft. Like every single RTS EVER) and this is especially filthy when you proclaim to release FREE functionality for the title, but then the player gets informed that they must buy TWO titles (WH1 and WH2) to get functionalities in the one they wanted to expand. Such a money grab, and even then the game is still locked behind micro-transactions/DLCs. I wanted to play a game, not donate to the \"poor\" publisher in 10 different ways. If the publisher wants money then they can sell better games.\n\nAwfully lot of DLCs, that don't add many things into the game. The base game doesn't feel like a game, but a rather Free to Play game account, that has 80% of content locked. Choosing from like 4 factions, especially in a game which varies so wildly depending on the faction (the factions aren't meant to be following any common rules it seems).\n\nWhat I also dislike is the publisher urging you to create an account to claim some of the \"free\" DLCs - the purpose is to collect data, and force you into their own website I assume (to raise statistics and show it to the management?). Why bother releasing game on Steam if you can't offer free DLCs to Steam users? I don't want your stupid 3rd party website.\n\nI don't recommend this game. I like Warhammer, but CA is a terrible company. I updated this review and in the meantime there have been at least a few different internet dramas with them involved.\n\nI would personally rather pay 70$ to a company that cares and provides a fun product (e.g. Lorian), than a DLC-locked tech demo... that \"stock\" Warhammer sure is.\n- Great game! At times it can get frustrating (boss battles), but the good out weighs the bad by a landslide. Even when i did get mad, which was a lot, I never stayed mad for long. There is just far too much to enjoy about the game. The art style is just simply amazing, the movement of your character around the world is just so satisfying once you get used to it, the puzzles aren't too easy or too hard, and everything in the game just goes together pretty much perfectly. All in all this game is extremely well made. Would recommend buying if you want a super unique experience 11/10\n- Did you like the first two chapters?\nWell, here we have everything and tons of new and improved things, like the 2nd chapter did with regards to the first one (which was awesome, but quite simple gameplay-wise).\nA classical turn-based strategy game, now more polished than ever with wave-like combats and tons of units to start with, to upgrade and well, we don't even have real classes here - more correctly, each hero is a class on its own and has different abilities and such.\nThe story follows always the same one-way saga and you'll have to make lots of choices determining your fate, your battles and so on; the graphics are the most beautiful I've ever seen here and the soundtrack is quite amazing and atmospheric too.\nYou'll have also many features like arena combat, and a great history re-telling if you don't remember the first two chapters, plus a great tutorial to start with even if you're not new to the series and the genre.\nIt's quite fundamental if you're a little bit interested in this awesome story to play the other chapters - here in fact we'll start with all the old heroes, all the story right back from the caravan that reached Arberrang.\nWe're basically reviewing one of the best strategy tactical turn-based role-playing games of the last 5-10 years and I won't add more than this, it has already thousands of reviews and mine is quite useless I think. \nLots of endings, lots of characters to explore and promote, lots of weapons, accessories, modes.. we have everything. Recommended to anyone (maybe with a little discount).\n- Wow, talk about a disappointment. I was really excited to check out \"ASU Global\" but it's clear that the developers didn't put much effort into it. From the glitchy login process to the lack of translation and sound effects, it's clear that this game is a rushed, poorly executed mess. And to top it off, it's just a generic mobile Korean port. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one. It's not worth the hassle.\n- I have a hard time recommending this game because even though I liked it, I know it's the kind of thing that can only appeal to a very small demographic :/ Anyway, I believe small devs who try weird things deserve all the exposure they can get, so here's a review. This is the second episode of a series (the first one can be found [url=https://etherane.itch.io/hello-charlotte-ep1]here[/url] - it's free - and the last one is [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/760890/Hello_Charlotte_Childhoods_End/]on Steam[/url]). It's recommended to play them in order unless you don't want to understand anything in a story that's already pretty confusing in itself.\n\n+ Very original visuals. The artwork is mostly composed of cute characters, but there are writhing masses of eyes and flesh everywhere (guro fans rejoice). Areas are arranged into colorful, geometrical patterns similar to Mondrian's paintings.\n\n+ The setting is extremely strange. It's definitely dystopian, but it can go from completely silly to incredibly tragic in a matter of seconds.\n\n+ Production values increase with each episode. I wasn't very impressed with the first game (apart from its artwork, which I loved, and its ending, which... opened interesting possibilities), but starting from this one the writing gets way better, the characters are more developed, and the gameplay feels more focused.\n\n+ - Hello Charlotte is more or less Trigger Warning Land. This series is among the most disturbing things I have ever played, and it's not because of the omipresent gore (most of it being used for aesthetics or comedy instead of shock value). It deals with heavy themes (mental illness, social pressure, bullying, suicide, the value of life and death - from what I could gather, a lot of these come from the author's personal experience) and it felt so suffocating sometimes I had to play in short bursts to give me time to recover. I note this as both a positive and a negative, since I consider games that can make me uncomfortable are valuable - but don't play this if you're not sure you can handle it.\n\n- The gameplay mostly consists of going back and forth to the same locations, and can sometimes feel tedious. Sadly I don't really think this can be improved unless the game is changed into a full visual novel, but it would mean losing the environments.\n\n8/10 It's a weird game made for weird people.\n- very well made cant stop playing. only complaint is keyboard set up and i get that the game says play with controller but thats not an option for me but the keys are all over the place r select upgrade e to reroll f to chat with npc r to enter their shop its like that for everything and you cant change the keybinds for UI stuff i wish it was just e to interact its all over the place and i find my self still miss typing things. if you buy the game use a controller \n\n- Melatonin is a simple rhythm game, with a focus on ease of gameplay and calmer sounds.\nIf you're expecting something on the tougher or more upbeat side, this ain't it.  Ironically, I had more fun as I stopped focusing on scoring well, and more fun when I was just feeling the music and half-asleep.  The sounds and songs are quite relaxing lol.\n\nOn the shorter side of games, it still delivers an enjoyable experience in what it offers. The timing is a *little* on the forgiving side, and there are even accessibility options if you need a little more help, such as timing circles, metronome, and a bigger Perfect window.  If you'd rather go for a challenge, a Perfect only option is also available.\n\nControls are quite simple, using [strike]4[/strike] 3 directional keys and an action key (Space by default). In each tutorial, you're told whether you'll need to hit directional keys or the action key, and whether they're held or not, as well as general timing.  For some stages, the instructions don't give you as good an idea as the tutorial itself/timing circles do (Work and Time levels for me).  All good, but in some levels you get tempo changes in the middle of the song that can throw you a bit off, especially if you're just grooving to the audio cues... when you can hear and distinguish them.  Unfortunately, there are a few levels where the audio cues are either far too similar to each other, or happen too quickly to react to.  This can be a bit of a bummer, as I prefer working off audio for rhythm games, as their focus should be lol.  \n\nWhile Melatonin doesn't bring a whole lot to the table, it doesn't need to.  Less is more here, and the art and sound direction definitely hit their target.\nRelax.\n- After playing thousands of games both singleplayer and multiplayer, unlocking all achievements and getting every solo map medal, I think it's time for a review:\n\nIf you like tower defence games: I recommend.\nIf you like any previous Bloons games: I recommend.\nIf you want something casual and chill: I recommend.\nIf you want a bit of a challenge: I recommend.\n\nThe tower type variety is interesting and diverse, with 5 tiers of upgrades each (plus special \"paragon\" towers)\nThe game devs have been providing free updates for years.\nThere's lots of achievements and medals to get.\nThere's online co-op, boss events and even different game-modes.\n\nThe game is more expensive than it used to be, but literally any sale price makes it worth a buy!\n- First of all - Subnautica is a good game. Very atmospheric, very scary and overall a really overwhelming experience. At first. \nThis might be the only negative review in this month, but I think some of you might appreciate a different view than \"omg this game is just awesome\". Which it kinda is, but in some points it maybe isnt.\n\nThis first section of the review doesnt contain any major spoilers for the story, just a comment on the overall progress through the game stages.\nAt the time of writing this review, I played the game for ~ 35 hours, I have advanced quite a bit. The first few hours were fantastic, I was looking for new things to explore, the blueprints for all the stuff that I need and every new thing felt like I made a progress. But then at a certain point nothing new happend. It seemed to me like I had all resources I could ever need (even the blue crystals), I had all the vehicles you could build, all the upgrades I needed.\nAnd then there was no challenge anymore. You build your submarines, your bases and the game gets too easy, its not a challenge anymore. Don't continue reading after this point, if you havent played the game yet.\n\n[spoiler] The big strength of this game is the immersion in the seemingly endless underwater worlds. But at a certain point this immersion breaks (at least it did for me).\nNone of the monsters can really harm you, not even the biggest ones are a real threat. Just hop into you seamoth and out-speed everything. If there is a leviathan, just hug the walls or strave, they cant catch you. And if they do, just step out, repair your ship and continue. None of the threats is really dangerous. You really need to have bad luck to die. And if you do ... nothing happens. You just respawn.\nAt first the map seems endless, since you cant move fast. But once you get the seamoth, the map is very finite. Sure, there are deeper levels you cant access with the moth, but everything on the surface is within reach. Its the same with the deeper levels and the prawnsuit.\nSurvival is hard at first, since you constantly need to get water and food. Once you can plant you own food, you have unlimited supply and the survival aspect becomes just an annoyence.\n\nAnother thing that bothers me is the amount of resources you need to build stuff. In the later part of the game you need to build a giant structure. But the necessary resources are just like \"get 3 wooden planks, 2 nails and a hammer\". And with these resources you build the statue of liberty.\n\nMy last point is about the storyline. After something like 15 hours into the game there was a major stall for me - I had no clue where to go, to me it seemed like I searched everything I had access to at that time. I searched for 10 hours and found nothing. I went to the Islands twice to check if I missed anything, but no. I dont know, maybe I just had bad luck and something didnt trigger right, I missed a hint somewhere or something. It eventually went on, but on that point I already had the big submarine, the prawnsuit and everything. The story felt like I just need to run from A to B and back, there was no challenge anymore. \n [/spoiler]\n\nSo anyways. If you made it this far in the review, thanks for reading. If you disagree with me, thats totally fine for me. I don't want to ruin the game for anyone, maybe the points that bother me dont mean much to you.\nI know that my critique is pretty harsh. There are many positive aspects in this game. If you can really dive into this game and fully roleplay it, submerge in its story and ignore some flaws, this is a fantastic game.\nBut maybe some of you are like me, so some of my mentioned points could bother you too.\nThanks for reading, I hope I didnt butcher the English language too badly, feel free to comment, if you like.\n- Ok to make it short.\n\n- Poor graphics (like 10 years old PC game)\nBUT nothing more to complain about.\n\n- great atmosphere, great story, very good fighting mechanics. Of course great price.\n\nIf you have nothing against japan style - just play the game. One of funniest games in some years for me.\n- Dark Soul Combat System without health bar, and a better Romantic story than Twilight.\nLooks a lot like Agony trailer thought. Badass Bosses. Most of the time is dealing with the puzzles.\n\nIt really painful to watch a woman going through this kind of mentality. [b]FeelBadMan[/b]\n\nMany scenes looks like it almost the end of the games but it not.\n- Oh man. Where to even begin with this one. It would be an extreme disservice to simply call Arma 3 a shooter, as it is so, so much more than that. Arma 3 is a military simulator. This is a distinction that it’s developers hold sacred and are proud of, and one to which I can attest is completely accurate and deserved. But it’s even more than that. Arma 3 is a gaming platform, upon which so much has already been and will continue to be built for years to come. \n\nAt its core though, Arma 3 in a supremely excellent military sim. The graphics are stunning, the gameplay is excellent, the mechanics are solid, and Bohemia Interactive has done an absolutely amazing job packaging this all together. New comers to the Arma series (as I was) may initially be overwhelmed by the game’s complex mechanics and decidedly different pace from your typical FPS/shooter. Enemy engagements happen at much greater distance than is typical in the genre and are often brief, brutal, and more times than not will conclude with your demise. There is no handholding here. No mini-maps, no enemy UI icons/indicators, no hit markers, no health bars. If you get shot a couple of times, you will find yourself unceremoniously dispatched. While this creates a high barrier for entry and a steep learning curve for new players, it provides a unique and distinctive play style. Situational awareness, cover, teamwork, suppressive fire, and generally moving purposefully and as if your ass depended on knowing what was behind the next ridge or hiding in the bushes are paramount to your success. Add to these infantry mechanics the amazingly rendered vehicles, armor, helicopters, and planes, each with their own realistic mechanics to learn and master, and you end up with a truly amazing military simulation experience. \n\nOut of the box, Arma comes with a great single player campaign comprised of 3 separate acts, each containing ~12-15 missions. The campaign focuses on a well crafted story of a military conflict that has erupted over Arma 3’s two HUGE islands of Stratis and Altis. You play the part of a NATO soldier who finds himself stuck in the middle of a complex engagement. The campaign is rewarding, and challenging. (I have yet to complete it as I’m stuck on one mission that I simply can’t seem to complete.)\n\nHowever the single-player campaign is FAR from the end of this title. The mission editing tools have allowed this amazing community to develop some absolutely awesome single player missions, all of which can be downloaded free of charge from the Steam workshop and numerous other sites around the interwebs. I would also recommend you check out the supremely excellent full game conversion single player mods Whole Lotta Altis and Dynamic Universal War System which will provide countless additional single player hours and could be completely stand alone titles in themselves.\n\nOh and the multiplayer, oh god the multiplayer. Wasteland, King of the Hill, Invade and Annex, Battle Royale, Breaking Point, so many Co-Op opportunities, the amazing looking upcoming Epoch (currently in closed Alpha). I’m sure there are so many others that I haven’t even discovered yet. Each of these represent COMPLETELY USER GENERATED and totally disparate ways to play Multiplayer within the Arma 3 platform. By purchasing Arma 3, you immediately have access to each of these completely gratis and each could essentially be considered totally separate game.\n\nIn wrapping up this lengthy review, Arma 3 is an amazing experience and a true accomplishment in game development. It is the only game in recent memory that I can say with confidence that I never get bored with playing. Bohemia Interactive has made it clear that they plan to support this game for years to come, and they have built something amazing on which the possibilities are truly endless.  \n\nPurchase this game. Purchase it now. Thank me later. \n\n(IF YOU DO NOT FIND MY REVIEW HELPFUL, please leave a comment as to why. I welcome the constructive feedback.)\n- It may not be that similar to what most people are familiar with, as a building game, but in most every sense which counts, I believe this is the greatest building game I have ever played.\n\nThe controls are smooth, the Building Mechanics are smooth, the interplay of cuteness and silliness is so smooth, and Lillian has the cutest face in the known universe.\n\nTruly a fantastic game with enjoyable and concise mechanics, the Block Grid is as malleable as Minecraft (except that some areas cannot be mined, usually story quest locations), the ally AI is more involved than Conan (sitting at a table with Rosie to gobble some greens? cute), and the combat is slightly dangerous at first, but mostly very mellow and not in any way detrimental to the building side (the villagers even fix up the damage done to your village in story battles - at least in the 'tutorial' island).\n\nMy only advices:\n\n- If the Camera is too tight on you and too slow to zoom out, switch perspective and back, if that doesn't work, look down at the ground and jump a couple times! (your head will push the camera up into the sky faster)\n\n- Don't get too creative on Furrowfield Farm! I spent a lot of time building and customising, being slightly annoyed at the small build area of the island, but now I discover that the whole thing was essentially a tutorial, and that completing the story missions there opened up the game in a much bigger way. Now I am back on the home Island and am able to build across a much larger area. If you're still in Furrowfield, you basically haven't started the game yet, so get that story done!\n\n- IF YOU SUFFER FROM REGULAR COMPUTER OR PROGRAMME CRASHES:\nWhen loading a Game you can press (A) / (X) on Controller to Copy the Save File and Back it up on one of the other Save Slots. I recommend doing this every day you play in case of  Corrupted Save Data caused by Crashing while Sailing to another Island.\n\nI am tempted to give this game a 9/10 - which is a serious seal of approval from me. Even on my strictest day, I would never give it less than a 7 - it is fun, cute, silly, serious, touching, exciting, and above all else, architexcellent!\n- [h1] Brief summary of why the Chinese players are so pissed: [/h1]\n\nThe reason for the chinese players to absolutely despise the third party modding website is that the \"official modding\" was promised to be released over a year ago, but kept getting delayed. When it finally got released, everyone felt betrayed because it was a garbage third party website with so many restrictions.\n\nBut the reason why the game is still getting review bombed is the [b] developer's initial response [/b] to the first round of complaints. The team was dead silent for about 2 weeks, no comments about all the fiasco, yet people that were complaining about the modding on the chinese forums got their accounts banned left and right. Thats why many resorted to steam review bombing, and almost as soon as the steam review tanked, the developer came out and said the steam workshop will be launching in the end of the month, something he had being saying was \"really hard for the team\" and kept \"facing difficulties\" for the past year.\n\nSo yeah.... I kinda understand why people are still really mad about this one\n- This game was sunk by poor customer service as well. I at one point lost years worth of items due to a bug. I was told by one of the devs in an email to \"stop button mashing\". My email was nothing but respect and appreciation for a good game where I also simply asked if they could return my bugged items I have earned over the years. \"Stop Button Mashing\"! Really? And now your game is dead. Good work! Piss poor development. Just sad and dissapointed I have over 2k in hours in crap. And yes this game actually is years old it was originally released Jan 2015. At one point we had a good game to play. I believe even the most played game on steam. Then something happened. It became all about crates. F this game. I'm done!\n- A classic horror game that it’s worth every cent. I can’t stress enough, you have to play it yourself. [i]Mad Father[/i] has this eerie atmosphere that will make you so addicted that you won’t stop playing until you’ve solved the great puzzle centered in your family roots. It's a story about love, hate, madness, the fear of death. [spoiler]And about a crazy daddy carrying a f*cking chainsaw and chasing you. After all, that's the best way to tell \"I love you\" to his 11 years old daughter.[/spoiler]\n\n∞/10.\n- ✔ Procedurally generated levels (some are not)\n✔ Neat graphics and animations\n✔ Good sound design\n✔ Solid and gratifying game mechanics \n✔ Well-balanced difficulty curve\n✔ Linux support!\n\n✘ No DRM-free build (yet?)\n✘ No user-generated content (no level editor)\n\nRuns surprisingly well on very low-end specs computer (under Linux too!).\nAn excellent turned-based action strategy game. Very polished and entertaining!\nYet one more proof that Swedish developers are among the best on this planet.\n- Not For Broadcast is in the simplest of terms, a multi-tasking simulator.\n\nYou sit in a news control room and you have to keep track of multiple things: censoring curse words, switching between cameras, playing ads at the right time, ensuring your broadcast frequency isn't disrupted, as well as keeping an eye out for a bunch of other strange things that appear later in the game.\n\nThis isn't the easiest of games as it requires a good deal of attentiveness. The description isn't joking when they call this \"high-pressure\". You have to rely heavily on both audio and visual cues to make sure your broadcast doesn't get screwed up. As this is the news (and live), there is no rewind or undo button. If you mess up and want to get a good performance grade, you'll need to redo the entire news segment. \nIf you're a perfectionist like me, a 10 min segment can end up turning into an hour of trying to perfect that news segment. As such, I do hope an option to quick save, or at the very least, save and quit, can later be put into the game. It felt rather taxing having to keep an eye on so many things for so long. But as with any game, excellence isn't an art, it's a habit. You'll find yourself turning into a multitasking expert eventually.\n\nThankfully, the actors in the game do a great job of making the experience an entertaining one. There is a good amount of humour written into each broadcast, although I must admit I wasn't quite able to pay attention to all the dialogue, as I was too busy trying to switch to the right cameras whilst ensuring my electricity didn't get cut out. Luckily, the game does have an archive which allows you to playback the broadcasts. Without that, I'd probably be missing out on 70% of what was going on.\n\nThere is also a text narrative, choices matter portion in between news segments. As of now, it feels a little out of place and incomplete, but then again, this is an Early Access review.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that at the time of writing this review, there isn't really any \"propaganda\" aspect to the game yet.\n\nPerformance-wise, the game runs pretty smoothly. I did encounter occasional crashes if I looked left or right and back and forth too quickly, but other than that, the game is pretty much bug-free. Also, this game has my RTX 2070 Super running at rather high temps for some reason. Rather surprising for a game that doesn't appear to have particularly high-end graphics.\n\nAnyway, I'll be looking forward to see what comes next for this game. Definitely worth the buy despite being Early Access.\n- Before you flame this review to note that \"Clicker\" is literally right there in the name and I should have known better:\n\n1) the game tags list \"Clicker\" and \"Idler\" as the top two tags\n2) This genre as a whole tends to wrestle with how to appeal to both camps, often being better at one than the other.  \n\nAs such, this is really a neutral review.  In short, Cookie Clicker is a good active clicker game, but not much of an idler.\n\n Until your first ascension you won't gain any progress off-line, and even leaving the game running in the background, your progress will be significantly hampered both because of the need to buy upgrades and grandmas steadliy, but moreso because clicking Golden Cookies and later also wrinklers are a huge percentage of your revenue, and farms and towers will also require some regular attention. As a result it feels to me like the game doesn't really value strategy either, it really just values in-game time and clicking.\n\nI'd say if you want a very active clicker game that you can dedicate a lot of time to paying attention to, Cookie Clicker does have a lot of charm (albeit the text flashes at the top get old very quickly) and a lot of bells and whistles to keep you clicking.\n\nIf you're wanting something you can really walk away from, and still feel like you're progressing, Cookie Clicker really isn't that game.\n\n- One of the few exceptions of \"dont buy games on Early Access\".\n\nThis game, on early access, has more gameplay value than a lot of games on full access + 5 dlcs.\n\n- Would I recommend DBD? ...It's complicated.\n\nDead By Daylight is an unique experience of asymmetric hide and seek/tag with shifting rules. \nIs the game fun? Yes. Is it creative? Yes.\nIs it fair and enjoyable? Well, it depends.\nGames get very intense, and playing as killer is some of the most intense gaming experience I've ever accumulated...\nWhich is where things often go wrong. The survivors seem to have decided that the killers have to honor strict code of rules. Don't use these items, these abilities, or these strategies. If you do, you'll be insulted after the game.\nIf you follow these rules, the odds are that you will spend the game running in literal circles, the survivors will win, t-bag you at the gate and then insult you after the game. I don't know about you, but that kind of ruins the game for me. It is actually kind of amazing how helpless one can feel in this game.\n\nSo to conclude my thoughts; I really like the game, but I also really hate it. I can't recommend it, as every time I fire it up, there is about 50% chance I feel more harassed, than entertained.\nI play a lot of online games, from League of Legends to Tekken, but this is the only one that makes me frequently think: \n\"I should really uninstall this\"\n\nEdit: \nI returned after a long break, and I still kinda like the game. \nHowever, same pattern repeats whenever I return. Eventually, I get teabagged one time too many and uninstall the game. The game is fun, the community could not be much worse. And sadly, that often ruins the experience.\n- I even set a calendar reminder so that I could get this on release. I wish I hadn't bothered. Going great guns until I got to the passage. Game over as I can't progress. Tried allsorts to drop the jammer but unable to do so. I guess it is a case of waiting for all the bugs to get resolved.\n- getting better in controls, HUD, and resources management balances, unlike Rise TR\nslight improvement in graphics, OST is good though\nseveral 'cool' scenes, creativity has taken a great leap <applause>\ncross over with Assassin's Creed (due to same publisher?)\nLara is getting more and more 'demonic', no hard feelings, its just subliminary messages to the youth by major games coorporation\nI can't believe i can play as Lara Kid instead of Lara Croft :D '+1'\nstoryline is getting ridiculous, come back to earth bruh LOL its good fun\n\ngood luck on your future endeavour devs :)\n- This game is basically awesome, under 3 conditions:\n\n1- You get rid of all on-screen icons (i.e. incoming attacks, ennemy spotting)\n2- Do not care about secondary missions only here to further lenghten the game's lifespan\n3- Play the game as you would if  YOU were in charge\n\nBasically, nevermind the Ubisoft micro transactions' system and other abhorrent company induced  greed-leaned system to get stuff faster and more easily by robbing you out of your hard-earned cash...you can finish the game without spending a single dime in the store, it's all pay to win...\nThe open-world aspect is very satisfying and rewarding, in terms of progression, don't fall for the micro transaction system\nCombat is easy even in the highest difficulty setting, but makes you think you are badass when you slash through waves of ennemies, whose AI is rather basic, with your arsenal of rockets, LMGs and explosives but it is satisfying as fuck!\n\nImagine strapping C4 to your plane, jump out of it, have it crashing down an ennemy outpost meanwhile you are parachuting down and throwing hand grenades their way, land on a roof and eliminate the remaining ennemies with fire ammo shotgun and a motherfucking M60 with armor-piercing bullets while throwing dynamites and there you have it...FarCry5 in a nutshell\n\nOh and don't forget about the flame-thrower lol, who doesn't love a flame-thrower scorching ennemies to their own demise eh?\n\nFarCry5 got it all, extreme freedom of how you wanna handle a situation (stealthily or all guns blazing) while being challenging enough in the highest difficulty setting!\nP.S. don't forget to turn off all the on-screen icons, really ruins it for hardcore FPS fans by making it extremely easy, please hear me out, you don't need these!\n- This now classic arcade made history as being one of the first twin-stick shooters that employed 3D arenas in an interesting manner - this was an important addition to the shmup genre, which really blew me away as a developer working in the same genre. But this also brought a problem: the gameplay was made harder by the 3D rotating camera. \n \nIt impacts overall visibility and the clarity of collision between the player and the enemies. Also, the game is often late with its warnings to the player related to the incoming appearance of enemies.\n \nThis makes the player die occasionally not because of their own error but due to visual glitches. \n \nI personally didn't like the upgrades because I found it unclear in what ways are they affecting the gameplay and they didn’t really help me achieve higher scores. \nOther noteworthy features include 12 battle modes including Paciﬁsm, King, Claustrophobia and 4 all-new modes, but also the local co-op.\n \nOverall this is an interesting addition to Geometry Wars franchise, but Geometry Wars 2 still sits on the throne. If you are a GW fan, I would recommend this game because it shines in all other aspects. \n\nIf you are looking for other interesting shooter games, I would like to invite you to check our community group on Steam:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/593680\n\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/593680/Rocking_Pilot/\n- Always have to be online, even to play single player. Why?\n\nThis would be a perfect Steam Deck game, but they fucked it up.\n\nUPDATE OCT 20th: So they added off-line mode just for Steam Deck, which is great, but not allowing off-line mode on your PC is strange. Hopefully they update it again.\n- The fact that this VN used to be the highest rated game that hasn't been released outside Japan until, well, it was released outside Japan says it all. A must-buy position for every VN enthusiast and an insteresting position for any other player. Criminally underplayed (~55% of purchased copies haven't been started yet), true hidden gem. Consider buying it when on sale.\n- Pros\n\n- No crates which you can waste your money.\n- You don't pay for the extra maps.\n- Less Russians.\n- Less cheaters.\n- Very alive game (after 16 years).\n- More than 11, 000 active servers (according to Gametracker). \n- You don't need actually PC to play this (you can run it on a Calculator).\n- More mods than games on Steam.\n- You can spray in the game.\n- You can buy MP5.\n- You can use Flashlight and Nightvision.\n- You can choose a character.\n- You can play Assassination mod.\n- You can use Bunnyhop.\n- You can play CSGO MOD.\n\nAnd other stuff I can't remember....\n- Don't let the playtime fool you, I have hundreds of hours of this game on Epic, PS4 and Xbox. Here's the kicker: they actually use Neversoft's old handling code for this remake, so it's exactly as good as you remember it. THPS1+2 has snappy controls, great visuals, the works. Something to thoughtlessly get addicted to, time and time again. \n\nWe'll probably never see a THPS3+4, but cherish this remake, as it shows a great game with great care put into it. It's made by people who really really love the series, and it shows.\n\nGoogle \"THPS Pro\" to get the 3+4 levels into this as a mod, and keep on getting dunked by the pros in Online. The skill ceiling is high, but oh so worth it.\n- I love the Disgaea series (I've owned every game).  I gladly paid full price when it initially came out on PS2.  As the years have gone by, release after release, I find that the core game is pretty much the same.  With that said, these iterative approaches should by no means be priced at what they are.  I'd be semi OK to buy these at $40.  For such a niche genre, the price needs to be more accessible for folks to really want to get into it.\n\nI liked my short time with it, but I'd only recommend it at half price.  Thumbs down for price, which outweighs the thumbs up for a good game.\n- RIP Johnny Gat and your whole 2 minutes of screentime.\nWhile being a good sandbox game on its own merits, SR3 does NOT improve upon SR2 in very many aspects. In fact, they actually removed a lot of content from the previous game, though it's not like most people probably played that.\nGone are choosing more than one type of shirt to wear, or belts. You can no longer use your phone to dial numbers, or call taxis to transport you or ambulances to heal you. They removed a lot of activities as well as a lot of really cool things the other games had. So many, in fact, that I could probably spend a whole paragraph just listing them.\nThis is for a large part subjective, but the gangs in this game are very unimpressive by Saints Row standards. It comes down mostly to character writing, but the characterization on each faction is not good; motivations are usually left vague and most characters introduced besides the replacement Saints members are left undefined with little personality.\nThe game is extremely buggy (compared to the others in the series, although it's not quite Bethesda level) and the netcode is pretty bad too. Playing co-op is often pretty difficult because most actions done by both players will be out of sync with each other.\nAlso, it isn't a well-optimized port for PC. The graphics are sub-par for the most part, but the game still runs like garbage most of the time. Sub-60 FPS on high unless you're playing on a top-of-the-line system (by 2011 standards).\nOh, and one time I switched to one of the radio stations and was given a 2 minute long lecture by the DJ about how I'm \"wasting my life pressing buttons in a murder simulator\" and how I should \"go out and get a girlfriend or something.\" Game just killed itself on anything immersion related for breaking the fourth wall and trying to antagonize me for playing a video game. Ironically enough.\nThanks Volition.\nMost of the DLC in this game is low-quality and overpriced, and most of them except for the mission packs are already on the disk, by the way.\nThe co-op is cool is you have someone to play it with.\n- There is an ethereal beauty to Ori that makes you believe in the power of love. As you play it you know you're experiencing something special that comes around very seldomly and that you should do everything within your power to appreciate it. It feels like a special privilege to play through it. Its a piece of art for the twenty first century. It's a reminder that there still exists impossible beauty in what sometimes feels like a bleak hopeless materialistic world. If you remain steadfast though and look for it, you will find things that will inspire you, things that will give you hope again and things that will remind you of why life is so beautiful and worth fighting for. Don't despair, fight. Fight for Ori and everything she stands for. It's worth it.\n- Game concept is good, but execution is bad. Add to that the attitude of the dev team, and I recommend you don't encourage this kind of community censorship.\n\nDon't buy this. Devs close topics because their fanboys get flamey when you bring up any kind of criticism. Like how the servers with anti-cheat and server saving (which doesn't save player status/location) functions enabled kick all players from the server every 30-60 minutes. I wouldn't mind reconnecting if my location and hunger/thirst got saved during this \"server save\". But apparently trying to open a discussion on the topic is considered flaming and they close down your topic. Horribly handled.\n\n- If you are into space opera, transhumanism, cyperpunk-esque narratives, you're going to have a great time with this one. Even with my rampant ADHD, this game has kept my focus for a lot longer than most games. \n\nThe music is banging and the story is rich and diverse with a lot of awesome twists and turns. \n\nGo and grab your chits and buy some drugs.\n- Bullet hell? Check.\nAwesome animations? Check.\nBoss fights? Check.\nSongs from favorite artists? Check.\nParty mode? Check.\nMultiplayer/online mode? Check.\nBest physics? Check.\nOk that list is good... for now\n- On January 9th,  without warning, explanation, or justification, and lacking all sense of logic, Capcom forcefully reset customizable ingame key-binds and removed the ability to rebind them. These new forced and [b][u]locked[/u][/b] key-binds are extremely biased in favor of [i]right-hand-dominant, able-handed[/i] persons and can not be remapped or swapped. However, as this function has been revoked from PC keyboard/mouse customers, it has been ADDED for console controllers. \n\nCapcom has yet to address or even acknowledge this change.\n\n[b]If you are left-handed, handicapped, or for other reasons require customizable mouse/keyboard functions, Capcom has forcefully revoked the ability for you to play this game anymore.[/b]\n- Dandara is inspired by a legendary warrior who fought slavery in Brazil in the 17th Century. The similarities, however, seems to stop at the name and the fact that she is a black woman fighting a vague concept referred in the game as \"opression\". \nThe game mechanics are very unusual as you can`t really move back and forth and the art style is often charming, although sometimes it gets really generic with some enemies  inspired by Egyptian culture (I thought it was supposed to be about Brazil). The difficulty escalates quite suddenly at certain points in the game, and the fact that you have to be standing still at all times to attack your enemies is pretty frustrating. After you get used to the movement in the game, it is quite fun to jump around without the frustration of having to walk slowly through a huge map as you do in some games of the genre, especially before getting upgrades that allow you to teleport or move faster.\n The story and dialogues could also have been polished a little more. Everything is very vague making it feel a little bit like a waste of an interesting idea. Dandara is a little rough around the edges, but  pretty unique for a metroidvania style game. Worth checking out.\n- This game has such a HUGE potential like Stardew Valley in its early days!!\nCollecting stuff, helping people by crafting potions its so rewarding and lovely pls dear developers keep working on it. I BEG YOU! :D\nSure it has some bug right now but even on day one they managed to get some fast fixes and tried their best to make it work for everyone. \nThe controls were a bit tricky in the beginning (used Playstation 5 Controller) but its just a matter of time, its just not the normal controls like in other games.\nThe music was pretty nice and chill and also the animations were super cute, i love watching little Rubrum built his sandcastles over and over again. >3< \n\nOverall a good game, but could become even more better in the future, keep going guys!!\n- I do think the Mixed review rating is justified, but for the wrong reasons.\nHere are a few pro's and con's from someone who's been a long-time fan and played every Dirt game except the first one.\n\nPRO:\n+ Handling and physics are alright on both \"Gamer\" and \"Simulation\" settings\n+ Decent soundtrack\n+ Building and leveling up your staff and garage gives the game more depth\n\nCON:\n- Horrendously inconsistent AI. In roughly 15 years of playing racing games I've never seen AI as inconsistent as in this game. I played on \"Tough\" and could complete some races with a 10+ second gap, while others were quite literally impossible. This is because of the auto generated track system - unlike in the previous Dirt games, the AI never actually drives on the track, but stage times are auto-generated by how an AI *would* likely perform on a stage. \n- Lack of tracks / Boring tracks. As mentioned, there are no proper tracks for Rally events as they are auto-generated. While the tech behind it is quite impressive, this leaves most tracks feeling incredibly dull with no highlights or features whatsoever. Remember the cool cliff sides from Greece in Dirt Rally? None of these here. Essentially all tracks feel the same no matter what the location is. Couple that with the fact that there are only 5 locations and you'll find yourself bored quite quickly. Rallycross and Landrush tracks are not auto generated, but feel incredibly boring and forgettable. Baja or Malaysia in Dirt 2 were such a blast, but Dirt 4? Yawn.\n- Historical Rally. In its entirety. It's just normal Rally with older cars, but after a while I refused to continue this event type as the events are dragged out as hell. Near the middle you'll have to complete 12 events with each 5 stages. That's 60 stages in total. Consider my previous point about tracks feeling dull and I can't help but wonder who actually completed all these events. This seems to be a Codemasters thing though as I had the same issue with Grid Autosport.\n- Menuing. Why is it that I need to go out of the career every time I want to buy a car? Why is selecting sponsors (which you'll do often as they expire after awhile) in the same category where you can customize your car? Everything is a huge mess and finding the right things took me more time than it should every time.\n+ Lack of rewards. I actually found Joyride, which isn't part of the main career, to be the most fun thing to do in the game. Even though the events in Joyride repeat frequently but with different cars, it was a proper challenge compared to the career and is somehow quite addicting. The issue with it is that it's meaningless to complete. You don't get anything for getting a Gold medal on everything, not even new liveries or, heck, even an achievement. It's utterly pointless.\n\nAll in all this game is easily the weakest entry in the franchise (minus Dirt 1 maybe, but that one had a way smaller budget). To top it off it just feels like this game has no soul either. I vividly remember Dirt 2's gritty and colorful presentation, while this one lacks anything I could remember the game by. Really all this game made me want to do is play Dirt 2 or Dirt Rally again. Cheers and thanks for reading.\n- Black Mesa is a fantastic remake of the Original Valve classic and one of the greatest of all time video games, Half-Life.  This sci-fi classic FPS has you take on what might seem like a hum-drum day in the life of an experimental physicist, but things go quite off rails when experimenting with a strange material sample from an even stranger dude in a suit. \n\nAfter a while (and shooting a lot of aliens and bashing their heads in with a crowbar) you'll save the world... but now Black Mesa lets you do this with dramatically updated graphics, 4K support and a plethora of visual tweaks so you can rest assured this will run great on any gaming rig. \n\nA must have for big fans of Half-Life or gamers who are new to the scene and never got to play the original.   When on sale, of course!\n- Overall its a great hunting game. The base game is good enough on its own to give you an enjoyable experience hunting several varieties of animals. \n\nI feel that some of the best content is in the DLC's. I dont mind the price tag for maps are they are just a large and some of them have a truly diverse animal population. \n\nThe Weapon Packs have some items that really should have been available in the base game (.22 rifle).\nTripod stands, Tents and ATV's are also DLC items that i feel should have been included in the base game. \n\nThe cost for these packs are not huge, and I have bought them, but they really do impact your play in a meaningful way so it is hard not feel like they were left out on purpose. \n\nBeing a former hunter in real life I would say that the realism of it is pretty good. Lung shots and heart shots drop animals quickly and using the right ammo along with good aim greatly influences this. A poor shot will leave you tracking this wounded animal across the map till you sneak up on it again or just give up. \n\nThey have a system called Tru Racks (sumthn like that) that simulates different qualities of animals. So you end up with little bucks, average bucks, and monster bucks. Weight and coloration plays a part in this too. In short every animal has a trophy of some kind and they are varied by what must be some sort of RNG. \n\nAll that having been said, this game can devolve into a shooting gallery were you kill everything on sight as there in no real incentive not to. You get money and experience for every kill you claim and wiping out a heard of deer with your DLC M1 Garand on your DLC Tripod Stand becomes the quickest way to bypass the grind.\n\n It feels like the game starts as a \"hunting sim\" and becomes a \"poaching sim\" once you realize the progression system is going to take a long time to do...\"ethically?\".\n\n\nAgain, this is a game i would recommend, but it is just that, a game. \n\n\n- One of the better RPG maker games i've seen and played, especially considering it was made on RPG Maker 2003. The beginning of the game was great and felt like there was a ton of potential, but a lot of the overworld mechanics were underutilized (jumping, swimming, orb flying). The writing was alright in the beginning, but started to turn into a bad fanfic in the middle/end of the game. The ending was... wholly unsatisfying and abrupt. It made very little sense, and did absolutely nothing to answer any questions asked at any point in the game, rather asking brand new questions and providing no resolution for any of the characters. You'll get about 10-14 hours of this game, which is kind of amazing for an RPG maker game, but honestly, steam has SOOOO many better titles available in this price range that unless you're into RPG maker, you should go elsewhere.\n- Something I've been needing to get off my chest, despite how much maxis and EA go on about how much they care for the LGBTQ community, it's clear to me that they don't. First if they did they wouldn't be pushing the community the whey and as hard as they have. When things get pushed like they are, hateful people just harden there harts more, and just become infuriated. The sympathetic the become hatful towards it. The more something gets pushed, after awhile the more it gets hatted. A better approach would be, (if they really did care,) would be to put what they are talking about into a FREE pack, and get people whom make amazing custom content to contribute to it. If there is enough nice stuff in the pack people will download it, and talk people whom are on the fence to download it, and maybe to come over, and might start to get the people on the other side to at least get on the fence. That whey the LGBTQ community would get there representation, and acceptance would be pushed in a whey that won't burn people out.\n\n\nAnother resin why they should do it like this, and is part of why people are getting mad, is that they bought this game a certain whey, paid a lot for it and it's DLC, now they are changing, it and braking it to do so. Changing the experience against there will. Evan something you love like chocolate, or bacon, or anything will become something you hate if it's shoved down your throat ageist you will. If you want people to take it just offer it, most of the time people will take it. And if they don't just make it just make it more appealing. IE instead of braking the main game to add something even the LGBTQ community can't enjoy with a broken game. Make a free pack, and to tempt more people to get the pack, just add more nice CAS and build mode stuff. And maybe update the pack and add more stuff to it every once in awhile.\n\n\nI just had to say this for two resins, one companies being this careless or ignorant is just killing the public sentiment for LGBTQ and similar groups. And two, they are just killing interest in what they are selling, it will cut the Sims 4's life short, and will cut the Sims 5's life much, much sorter. \nIt's good to give options, as long as they are options. Or you are just like Hennery Ford, “The people can have the model T in any color! so long as it's black.”\n\n- I am a Filthy Casual (tm) who plays games like Mass Effect and Fallout 4 on easy and still die over and over. I got my \"you died\" achievement in Dark Souls 2 before the tutorial and stopped playing after like forty minutes with zero qualms. I have rage quit every single platformer game I have ever touched, and just sort of despise brutally hard things that feel like chores.\n\nBasically, I am not exactly sure why I decided to buy Dead Cells in the first place. Sure, I love the look and one of the few platformers I've ever 100%'d was Super Metroid (with a LOT of swearing and rage quitting), so 'Metroidvania' is an appealing term to me, but it is still inherently marketed as a game that is not for me, or people like me.\n\nThis game is hard. I have 11 hours on it and I can't get past the third area on any given path. I die for stupid reasons and lose all my stuff and... I don't care. I haven't rage quit once; in fact, I have to force myself away from the game after a death so I can do things like eat. I find the combat engaging and entertaining, the progression satisfying and there's something really solid about being forced to start from square one (ish) every single time, in a way I've just never experienced.\n\nSo, sure, buy this if you love hard games/Dark Souls/no checkpoint kind of games. Absolutely, I'm pretty sure you've alreeady heard this is likely to be up your alley.\n\nBut even if you're a dirty rotten casual gamer who button smashes in any game approaching action, and panics when the screen flashes red around the edges... give it a try if you get the opportunity. It is seriously fun.\n- For those of you still harbouring hesitations about \"walking simulators\"...here's one I'd definitely recommend you try.\n\n   So yes, it's quite linear, and no, it probably doesn't have an enormous amount of replayability. It's also quite short - about two to three hours - so I guess it's not that cheap at twenty buckaroonies. It is, however, one of the strongest examples of interactive storytelling you will ever enjoy, and an oddly varied experience given the bits of the game in which you briefly get to play the roles of cats, owls, and...well, I don't want to give too much away. Let's just say Tim Burton would be jealous (seeing what a boring old hack he's become these days).\n\n   For anyone who loves a good story in a game, with a willingness to sacrifice a bit of agency in order to have that superior narrative experience...it's a bit of a no-brainer. As for the rest of you, well: you only live once. And they do say variety is the spice of life. So if you only try one walking simulator before dismissing the entire genre, this could well be the one. Truly magical, wonderful stuff. And a bit of a tear-jerker at times, too.\n\nVerdict: 9.5/10.\n\n(PS Anyone claiming there is no \"gameplay\" in this title is either a drooling idiot, or hasn't played the game in its entirety. There's interaction and \"mini-games\" aplenty.)\n- ---{ Graphics }---\n☐ You forget what reality is\n☐ Beautiful\n☐ Good\n☐ Decent\n☐ Bad\n☑ Don‘t look too long at it\n☐ MS-DOS\n\n---{ Gameplay }---\n☐ Very good\n☐ Good\n☐ It's just gameplay\n☑ Mehh\n☐ Watch paint dry instead\n☐ Just don't\n\n---{ Audio }---\n☑ Eargasm\n☐ Very good\n☐ Good\n☐ Not too bad\n☐ Bad\n☐ I'm now deaf\n\n---{ Audience }---\n☑ Kids\n☑ Teens\n☑ Adults\n☑ Grandma\n\n---{ PC Requirements }---\n☑ Check if you can run paint\n☐ Potato\n☐ Decent\n☐ Fast\n☐ Rich boi\n☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{ Difficulty }---\n☐ Just press 'W'\n☐ Easy\n☐ Easy to learn / Hard to master\n☐ Significant brain usage\n☑ Difficult\n☐ Dark Souls\n\n---{ Grind }---\n☐ Nothing to grind\n☑ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n☐ Isn't necessary to progress\n☐ Average grind level\n☐ Too much grind\n☐ You'll need a second life for grinding\n\n---{ Story }---\n☑ No Story\n☐ Some lore\n☐ Average\n☐ Good\n☐ Lovely\n☐ It'll replace your life\n\n---{ Game Time }---\n☑ Long enough for a cup of coffee\n☐ Short\n☐ Average\n☐ Long\n☐ To infinity and beyond\n\n---{ Price }---\n☐ It's free!\n☐ Worth the price\n☐ If it's on sale\n☐ If u have some spare money left\n☐ Not recommended\n☑ You could also just burn your money\n\n---{ Bugs }---\n☐ Never heard of\n☐ Minor bugs\n☐ Can get annoying\n☐ ARK: Survival Evolved\n☑ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n---{ ? / 10 }---\n☐ 1\n☑ 2\n☐ 3\n☐ 4\n☐ 5\n☐ 6\n☐ 7\n☐ 8\n☐ 9\n☐ 10\n\n\n\n\n- PC version doesn't have rebindable controls for controller for some reason\n\nupdate: i have finished the game, still no rebindable controls, i can give a real review now. i wouldn't rate it negative but i wouldn't rate it positive either. this is a \"eh\" review.\n\nthe game is two games at once and neither of them are great.\n\n the roguelike part is like 20% of the game and is very simple and shallow, there's like 5 weapons and they all play the same, its also super easy. its ok but its not as good as a real roguelike.\n\n the cult building part is 80% of the game and is a bit more fun but past the earlygame its a bit eh too. choosing what you get doesn't really matter since you'll unlock everything pretty fast, and the doctrines 90% of the time are a choice between 2 useless things and 10% of the time a choice between a busted thing and a useless thing. the randomly generated quests the followers give you are just chores like revisiting old dungeons you already completed and the reward is pretty much nothing. its ok but its not as good as a real colony builder.\n\nnone of the systems in either part of the game are particularly deep.\n\nas of the time of this review, the game is still quite glitchy, though being patched by the devs.\n\nthe game is about 15 hours with side content and 18 hours for a completionist run. no real replayability \n\ni'd just recommend you get a full on action roguelike if you want to play a roguelike, or a full on colony builder if you want to play a colony builder. this game does both but is not great at either of them. \n\n game is very cute tho and the soundtrack is great. like 5/10\n- 100%'ed the LUCT version of the game and I'm slowly working my way through this version now.\n\nOver all the game itself is solid. If you're reading this, its a brilliant tactics game that helped define the genre. However most of the changes they made in reborn, while innovative, ultimately feel constraining. \n\nFor example, they've limited spell slots to 4, so you can only ever take 4 different spells. One or two of which (missile + indirect) are taken by a damage spell of your choice, leaving you with even less spell customization than you'd think. And its unfortunately the same situation with skills, as one will always be taken up by your weapon skill. \n\nThe cards that drop in battle, while an interesting system on paper, just end up cluttering the field most of the time, often with auto-skill activation up, which most of your units won't even really want compared to the other options. \n\nRandom battles were also removed, limiting chances to recruit to a few key dungeons as well as removing some of the more amusing battle locations from the game. \n\nI've also seen some people complain about the level cap, but in my current play-though of the game, it isn't too much of a concern for me, but it may be for others. \n\nOver all, it just feels like they've taken a step back from what Tactics ogre: Let us cling together, gave us. Yes there's bloat in that version, but it also gave us a feeling of freedom when we were putting our teams together that this version lacks. I am grateful that we saw a remake of this game within my lifetime, but I wish they had improved on Luct, rather than take steps back from it. \n\nIf they ever increase the amount of spells and/or skills you can take, to like 6-8, then I'd probably switch my review to a yes. But until then, with a heavy heart I have to say that this version just isn't as good as Luct so far.\n- The good:\n+ Great story with satisfying finale.\n+ Endearing main cast/characters.\n+ Great world building meets with 90s Indonesia culture.\n+ Pleasant pixel artstyle. The cutscenes visual is amazing, even though i notice few awkward animation.\n+ Nice soundtrack.\n+ Puzzle is mostly well balanced. Not too difficult and doesn't make you feel bored/annoyed either.\n\nThe bad: - \n\nThe ugly:\n* Some pacing problem. There are so many sidetrack a.k.a. \"To complete sub-task C you also must complete sub-sub-task X, Y and Z\" during chapter 2-4.\n* Sometimes you might have to going around in circles to solve certain task or accidentally skipped something.\n\nDespite few flaws, A Space for the Unbound is definitely best game developed by Mojiken Studio and best story-driven/adventure game among all games created by Indonesian developer. If you like side-scrolling/adventure game (such as GRIS, Unreal Life or Oneshot) or game made by Mojiken Studio/Toge production (such as Coffee Talk or When The Past Was Around), you should give this game a try.\n- You know that feeling when you are hesitant to buy a game because you're worried you might waste your money on something that might be a crap game in the end, get boring, and not sure if you should believe all the ratings because you dont know if everyone has the same interests and likes as you? well this game is the bomb diggity, straight up. Made by the same people who made rollercoaster tycoon and man did they deliver on this. For me it's the small things in a game that matter and did they really take the time to make sure this was as polished as it could be. Not sure if anyone remembers when they announced another rollercoaster tycoon a while back, and everyone was super excyited to find out what it was, and it ended up being some dumbass phone app? Well imagine all that excyitment, but instead of them coming out with that stupid app they came out with this bad boy. This is exactly what everyone was wishing and hoping for (just different name). Do I reccomend you buy this game? hell yes. will it be exactly what you are wishing for when you fist clicked this game to see the game play and reviews? sure as cocks will. But will it be just as fun as the original?.... YOU BET YOUR MOMS TITS IT WILL BE. \n\nPROS:                                \nbeen one since 1990\n\nCons:\nYou'll never know how fun it is till you buy it.\n- Ratchet & Clank is always fun. The older games are clearly better, as it feels like the more modern they get, the shallower and simpler they become. They now feel almost like a demo of a game - you just get to dip your toe into each of the systems, never really fully engaging with any of them. New abilities are just thrown at you with no fanfare, and then you only need them 3 times, and it never asks you to combine them in new ways. Everything feels underwhelming and tossed aside shortly after being introduced. That's almost the theme of the game - they even have Ratchet meeting a fellow Lombax for the first time ever, the thing he has been focused on since game 1, and it's pretty much just \"hi, let's go do the next thing.\" The series has been casualized, just as neutered as their formerly innuendo-laden titles. \n\nBut it's still fun to play, it's just lacking the magic it used to have.\n- Gameplay is similar to Hades. The story isn't as rich as Hades, but it's still pretty good. More forgiving than Hades, that's for sure. You see where I'm going with this - Hades is 10/10, the roguelike to compare/to beat. On a scale of 10 hades, I'd give this game a 7.5/10 Hades.\n- Pros:\n> Decent selection of interior desing elements\n> Uncommon but interesting gameplay idea if you're into interior design and building\n> Fair price for amount of activities you get in base game\n> Gameplay leght\n> Regural updates\n\nCons:\n> You can't change location of windows in the house - some are placed in awkward places thus creating decent rooms becomes difficult\n> Game optimisation is questionable for such graphics  -  with RX vega 56 I barely get 60 fps \n> No replayability on same save file - once you sell property you cannot do it again\n> Once property is sold there's only some screenshots but no actual way to look around again\n> No steam workshop or mods\n\nIdeas for possible future updates:\n> Add floor plan design feature - building and demolishing walls 10 times is frustrating\n> Add ability to build custom houses and change locations of windows\n> Add ability to enter sold properties\n> Increase game performance\n\nDLCs:\n> HGTV DLC adds moderate amount of additional jobs\n> Garden DLC adds alot of activities outside the house but is a bit buggy. In my opinion some features should be in base game\n- First steps:\n-set nioh.exe and nioh_launcher.exe to win7 compatibility (if you experience crashes).\n-first level (London) is poorly optimized, so better rush through it and judge the next.\n-experience this game as Nioh and not as a \"Souls\" game, tho I draw comparisons here\n\n\n[h1]Good[/h1]\n\nCombat\nBy far the best thing about the game. You get 7 weapon classes + 3 ranged weapons, and each of the 7 weapons has it's own unique skillset accompanied by 3 different stances. On the fly switching between 3 stances and 2 weapons, or even both at the same time allows for a ton of combinations to chain different attacks and combos. On top of all that you get magic, spirit guardians and ninjutsu. Sky is the limit if you're willing to experiment.\n\n\nBosses\nThe game comes with roughly over 30 unique bossfights, some of them will reappear or be demoted to regular enemies over the course of the game. There are only very few bosses I didn't like. Most of them are going to be human, but that doesn't mean they are boring. Most have sick movesets that make them very engaging and fun to fight, especially the DLC bosses. \n\n\nDifficulty\nJust like Dark Souls the game is as difficult as you want it to be. This means you get alot of tools that allow you to cheese the game. Like summons, or certain character builds centered around spirit guadians and op magic like sloth talisman which makes enemies move in slow motion. \nThe difficulty curve is a falling one, aka the game is more difficult in the begining when you're figuering things out, then it remains on a steady level with occasional spikes upwards. Disregarding bs like sloth talisman I would say the game is overall more difficult than Dark Souls. Combat is faster and mistakes are punished severly, even human fodder enemies can 1-shot you if you happen to take swings when they are in heavy stance.\n\n\nStory\nIt's decent, but nothing special. Nerds interested in the sengoku period to early edo period \nwill probably appreciate the characters and their interactions.\n\n\nWorld\nIt's not an interconnected world like DS1. It is mission based where you pick main or side missions from a map, personally I don't mind the \"arcade\" style. Main missions themself are big levels with multiple shortcuts that loop back to shrines (bonfires). Those levels are bigger than most designated areas in DS3, my guess is like 1.5x-2x the size. If I had to rank the level design... DS1 >>>> DS3 > Nioh >>>>>>> DS2 \n\n\nReplayability\nThe game offers 4 NG difficulties which spice things up by switching enemy placements or giving enemies (and bosses) status effects and new moves. Other than that you get Abyss mode which is most comparable to DMC's bloody palace. \n\n\nMultiplayer/Netcode + pseudo PvP\n3 ways to play mutiplayer: as summon/summoner, co-op missions where both players make progress at the same time and PvP (which is dead).  The Netcode worked quite well for me, even over wide distances like brazil-germany. I never had to adjust for delay and could parry attacks just like offline.  The netcode is quite good imo compared to DS3 where I did lots of co-op at Champion Gundyr and parrying was totally out of the question.\n\n\nThe other \"pvp mode\" is the faction/clan system. You get multiple clans that belong to 1 of the 2 factions. A clan gives you 2 passive buffs that can compliment your playstyle. You obtain glory by killing revenants, succesfull co-op or pvp for your clan. The more glory you obtain, the higher the rank of your faction, clan and yourself. Glory acts as another currency and can be used to buy npc skins, gestures or items.\n\n\nFashion Souls\nLike the look of a particular light armor set but hate getting insta killed by radroaches? No problem, at the blacksmith you can transform any weapon skin or piece of armor, and keep the stats of your preferred equipment. If you get tired of playing as William you can buy npc skins for glory at the teahouse (unlocks at roughly 33% of the game) which is the only way to play as a female as there is no character creation.\n\n[h1]Bad[/h1]\n\nEnemy Variaty\nThe games biggest weakness in my opinion.  Enemy \"species\" come in different flavours, e.g. humans can wield any of the 7 weapons, however this doesn't realy trigger the visual stimulation of seeing something new. Saving grace: the game throws you into different 1vsX situations, so the combination of enemies keeps things interesting, kinda like DMC4 which also has wack enemy variety. I think they could've done much more in terms of creativity when it comes to the yokai/oni realm given the huge amount of lore.\n\n\nRepetition\nSide missions take place in mostly the same batch of areas or in parts of main missions. \nThey try to keep things fresh by switching enemies and spawn points. But they still feel kinda tedious because skipping them isn't realy an option as you can't deny yourself the experience, rewards and loot.\n\n\nMusic\nGood but gets repetitive as only few themes are shared across bosses.\n\n\nFunky Optimization\nSelf explainatory. FPS tanks in London and I had random crashes. The later were solved by the tips mentioned at the top of the review.\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nI found the combat mechanics to be more than able to compensate for the games weaknesses (repetition, enemy variety). This means you've to take up responsibility and be creative yourself. If you're the type who doesn't like experimenting and spends 90% of his time with spear in mid stance, and plays like its DS (dodge > R1 > R1 > dodge > R1 > dodge...), then you're gonna get bored quickly. Although, I've seen those guys during co-op all the way up to NG3-4, so who knows... .\n- If you look past all of the stale \"The Cake Is A Lie\" memes, you have your self a pretty clean cut, innovative experience. Portal may only last a few short hours, but it provides friendships (with your Companion Cube) and a bitter thirst for revenge against a mysterious voice within an equally mysterious facility. If you have not picked it up already, I would suggest this gem as the next part of your Steam library.\n- Undoubtedly one of the best if not THE BEST modern video game remaster out there. I will summarize the pros and cons of this remaster into the following:\n\n[b]The Good:[/b]\n\n- Totally seamless transition into the new modern 4K visual from the old classic Win95 at a push of a key\n- Extremely faithful to the original titles (some might say that it is perhaps TOO faithful)\n- Game \"installation\" screen when you first boot up for both Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert is filled with God tier nostalgia \n- New UI with a complete revamp of the sidebar complete with higher quality artwork that totally feels in place\n- Plethora of never-before-seen bonus contents including exclusive missions and cinematic cutscenes for Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert that was only available on certain console platforms\n- You can queue multiple units while in production now\n- New multiplayer features and service is great. Finally you can now play 1v1 ranked and spectate any previous matches that was played including spectating ongoing games in the lobby\n- You can add, remove and create your very own custom music tracks in-game for both Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert however you want\n- All of Frank Klepacki's overly iconic classical and remixed tracks are here including various modern remixed that was composed solely for this remastered collection!!!\n\n[b]The Bad:[/b]\n\n- Minor bugs (though not a real dealbreaker)\n- The gameplay meta among factions/units remains as unbalanced as ever. Kinda of a tradeoff for being too faithful to the original titles\n- Multiplayer is still officially limited to a maximum of 4 players total per map in Tiberium Dawn, while in Red Alert the limit is a maximum of 8 players total\n- FMV cutscenes are all still heavily compressed in SD resolution extracted from the Playstation home console version and further artificially enhanced via AI upscaling due to the fact that the original master footage tapes for both Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert are still yet to be found\n\n[b]The Kinda Ugly:[/b]\n\n- Certain mission on hard difficulty are completely unbalanced. This is already another insult to injury as the AI blatantly cheats when it comes to resource procurement and unit build time. The fault of a clear lack of playtesting\n- Full disclosure: I'm not a racing guy. I'm not a car guy, even. My extent of car knowledge begins and ends at \"vroom-vroom go that way.\"\n\nBut that's all you need to know for this game. I can tune the holy bejeezus out of a million sliders that mean absolutely nothing to me, or I can just equip a premade setting by someone who does and suddenly the vroom-vrooms are *better*. Not sure when to brake or start a turn? Easy, there's a friendly line. Follow the line, make less vroom-vrooms when it's red, everything's gravy. Don't have the reaction time to follow the line? You can slow the game down until it's at a pace where you can. Incredible.\n\nYou can be as serious as you want with it. Me, I'm taking my van that's dolled up to look like the Mystery Machine and ramping it off a volcano.\n- [h1]One of the few multiplayer games that reminds me that people can be amazing[/h1]\n\nI've been playing games for a long time, I've seen some sh*t. I've seen people crumble, I've lost friends, I've watched people eat each other even when they are winning. When people are supposed to be working together and yet they would rather treat their ally like trash because they refuse to take the blame for their own wrongdoing.\n\nSquad is a game in which I have seen true potential. A group of 40 individuals work together to plan, execute, and accomplish masterful plans to outsmart their enemy. I've seen teams rally from the depths of defeat and flip unwinable games into incredible victories. Heros emerging from the storm of mortars landing upon their bunker, to squad leaders risking their own lives to save those of their squad.\n\nSquad is not a game for the light hearted. To enjoy squad to the fulllest, you must communicate, work together, and form a bond with the soldiers at your side. You are a team, you are a unit, and you will never win alone. Be it a medic patching the wounds of your comrades, a logistics driver supplying your team with the supplies they need at the front line, or a squad leader putting the responsibility of 8 individuals on your shoulders, each person is a vital component of the team.\n\nFor this reason, Squad has now become my most played game on steam. The depth, the people, the comraderie, it's an amazing experience that no other game captures. I encourage you all to try it out on a free weekend as I originally did, I have been playing it ever since.\n\nI'll see you on the front line.\n- As someone who has played the PS2 version roughly 3 years after release, I enjoyed myself. Then I saw that there was an HD remaster. Thought the game was possibly a bit overrated for a remaster, but got it and remembered why I enjoyed it after about halfway through the first level. I even enjoyed it a bit more than the first time around, since I appreciated the way the sound effects synced with the music a bit more the second time. Now Rez Infinite comes out, and the cycle repeats itself...\n\nBut this time, I'm wearing a f**king VR helmet. As someone who played many VR titles before this, and as someone who wanted this game, but put off playing it for full price... it lives up to the hype (it might help that this is the first time actually wearing headphones with it too...) Especially the Area X level. Holy crap especially that level. I only wish it were longer, and I see myself replaying that level alone many times in the future.\n\nThe gameplay may seem a bit dated to some, and it is short. But damn it, it earns it's classic status and it still holds up today. Decent gameplay that grows on you, cool sound track helped immensely by the cool way the sound effects play a part of the song, and great visuals all combine to explain how this game is pretty much the start of any cliche \"games are art\" speech. If you never played it and don't have VR, it's worth $15 (I'm sure. Haven't played this on the flatscreen, but I spent $15 on Rez HD I think, and I didn't regret it). If you have VR and any sort of nostalgia for this game, you probably wouldn't hate yourself buying it at full price, even if you're as cheap as me. If you only kind of liked the game before but didn't really see what the fuss was about, the ten or so minutes of Area X will probably show you why this game has such a cult following. \n\nAnd if you're a Rez fanatic? You'd spend $50 on Area X and still say you got your money's worth, short as it is.\n- The latest S tier Deckbuilder Roguelike, joining the ranks of Slay the Spire and Monster Train for me. I think that's all that really needs to be said.\n\nIt leans heavily into kiss/curse type effects, if you like the ability to manipulate rng and do some busted stuff with your sequencing you will love it. It is more of a thinker on a turn to turn basis than other games of this genre, but if that isn't a turn off then it's a really solid game with some unique characters/mechanics that feel fresh.\n- >Be me\n>Move to new city for job offer\n>Go straight to bed when I arrive, but still oversleep and miss meeting with business contact\n>Have a message, but no contact information, so at suggestion of greasy hotel guy, I start randomly asking people on the street and café if they’re who I’m looking for\n>No luck, but random stranger points me to a club\n>Meet a cool chick who actually doesn’t treat me like a jerk\n>She has a boyfriend\n>Sad feelings\n>She invites me to a cool party anyway\n>Second person I talk to gives me a drink that really messes me up\n>Black out within first half hour of party\n>Wake up at cool chick’s house, she’s on her way to work\n>For some reason when I try to talk to her, I come across as a total stalker type.\n>Go to sleep\n>Next day, watch a train crash over some sort of secret agent\n>Mysterious hooded figure shows up, looms over g-man, then flees\n>Finally, some content, I think\n>Follow mysterious figure\n>Go into store, chase her into the basement\n>Door locks behind her\n>Weird guy there, gives me some backstory I promptly forget\n>Ask him every question that comes to me, but it won’t advance the plot\n>Wander around, not sure what to do\n>Not having fun\n>Meet a cool guy\n>He gives me a hacking device\n>Tells me he’ll teach me how to use it some other time\n>So much waiting\n>Finally run into guy who hired me and told me to move to this town\n>Tells me I’m fired\n>Go back to club\n>See cool chick\n>(only one of two people who actually treats me like a human being)\n>Talk to her\n>She calls me a stalker, I’m not sure why\n>Unable to defend myself\n>Weird basement guy tells me not to worry, invites me to another party\n>All I do is wander around and go to parties\n>Flashbacks of my real 20’s\n>Kill time until party by opening random doors and hacking a frying pan\n>Maybe I started a fire\n>Pass out in front of weird laser gate\n>Did I get electrocuted, or did I just fall asleep?\n>Go back to party\n>Weird guy tells me to loosen up and talk to girls\n>Girls all give me cold shoulder\n>Against better judgement, I drink several beers\n>Carry empties around with me because I can’t set them on counter\n>Weird guy tells me about a test\n>Won’t tell me how to take test, where to take test, or what I need to know to pass test\n>Worst party ever\n>Cool chick shows up again\n>She’s actually happy to see me\n>Try not to sound like stalker, kinda succeed, but I think I’m missing half the conversation\n>Also, I think cool chick might have a drinking problem\n>Me too, I’m staggering around\n>Drink coffee to try and sober up\n>Doesn’t work\n>Not having fun\n>Leave party\n>Kick lamp\n>Go to bed\n>Not tired enough to fall asleep\n>Wander around town, stumbling drunk, at 5 AM\n>Flashbacks to a dark time in my real life\n>Take drugs so time passes faster, flashbacks intensify\n>Talk to strangers since what else am I supposed to do\n>No one wants to talk to me\n>Cringingly accurate simulator of awkward college party years\n>Not fun game\n\nI hear from other reviews that this game starts to pick up after this point, but I can't do it anymore. I've already invested a lot of time and energy into this game for little to no return. I'm not going to study guides and waste more time on this game just so I can dig the nuggets of fun out of this wasted youth simulator. I will say that it did a really good job of making me role-play an awkward alcoholic with no job prospects and zero understanding of how to talk to women, living out of a ****** hotel room. But I've already played the real life version of that, so I can't recommend it. If you want to play a fun game about programming, go with Human Resource Machine. If you want a good role-playing game about hackers, go with Shadowrun. If you want to pay money and spend your leisure time feeling really depressed about your 20's, then I can recommend Else Heart.Break(), but maybe you'd be better off talking to a friend about it instead.\n- I had the privilege of playing a game that provided an immersive and emotional experience set during the Great Patriotic War. This game, which I highly recommend. From the moment you start playing, it's evident that the developers spared no effort in recreating the atmosphere of the era. \nOne aspect that truly impressed me was the game's narrative. The storylines, filled with genuine human drama.\nI also must commend the game's sound design.\n- Great game for the most part.\nI do not like how they made a rpg with twitch aspects though.\nMy characters are supposed to be strong and agile not me on the keyboard.\nDo not expect to beat the island master(2nd ending) unless your very agile with your fingers.\nAt 50 years old it is impossible to get him down past 3/4 health.\nToo much twich and not enough character skill.\nGames like might and magic you never had to be agile with the keyboard.\nGuess this one goes under my \"Ending too hard category\"\n- Edit 2 (9/24/22): The devs have made several updates now to address some of the UI problems. And right now, the in battle experience is greatly improved, especially when not using a mouse. It's good enough that I'm having fun playing it now, and am looking forward to seeing more of it so I'm reversing the thumb on this review. However, the experience remains decidedly clunky, especially with a mouse and especially out of combat. Overall, to anyone who is expecting a modern game with modern usability and controls, this game is not for you. But if you don't mind those things so much, this game has some real meat on its bones. It also has delightful music and sound. I'm leaving the original review here, as I hope the devs will continue to improve on the usability of the game so that everyone can enjoy it fully. If you're playing on keyboard and mouse, I'd recommend using the option that disables the mouse, the jank doesn't feel as bad when you're not clicking\n\nEdit: The devs have taken this feedback very seriously, I'm keeping a close eye on this game to see when things change so I can give this game another go.\n\nAgh... I really want to like this game. The customization and squad building seems like it will get really cool in the later parts of the game. But I don't think I'm going to make it to the later parts of the game. Why? Because the UI and controls are so frustrating. Camera movement is frustrating, selecting units is frustrating, distinguishing between your units is difficult, managing your squads is frustrating, promoting your characters is confusing, even attacking is a pain in the butt. Every time I go to do anything there's always some interface or controls issue in my way. And every time I finish a map and have to go do the in-between battles management, I know the UI will fight me every step of the way. \n\nMy thoughts on what should change:\n\nOut of battle:\n- On the \"Organize Army\" screen, I shouldn't need to click \"Squad Operations\" first to look at a squad. Simply clicking a squad should do that.\n- When returning to \"Organize Army\" from a squads view, \"Squad Operations\" is deselected, and has to be clicked again.\n- It is not possible to scroll the squad list without clicking \"Squad Operations\"\n- When I am in one mode on the squad screen (say \"Move Unit\") I can't switch to another mode by clicking the appropriate button, I have to cancel first.\n- When changing classes, there is not a clear enough indicator on the version of the unit I need to click that shows it has an upgrade available.\n- When changing classes, an extra click is required for no reason (and with no UI indication) before the upgrade options are viewable.\n- When changing classes, it should be easier to see what the next tier options will be for that class.\n- There should be a way to quickly view and either upgrade or sleep for a year all units who have class mastery between battles, so I don't have to check every squad.\n- From the Organize Army screen, there is no way to see a squad's capacity, so you have to click into every squad to see if you can add another unit.\n- When equipping an artifact, the first empty slot should be selected automatically.\n- When equipping an artifact, if I click the item first and then the slot, that should work. Drag and drop would be nice too.\n- On unit details screens (such as Unit Status or Change Class) there should be derived stats, that let me see how much damage the unit does / resists. As is, it's hard to tell what my stats are doing for me.\n- Unit traits should show a tooltip saying what they do when you hover or click the name or icon, I shouldn't need to go to another page for that.\n- Affinities should show a tooltip saying what they do when you hover or click them, I shouldn't have to go all the way to the game manual for that.\n- When using an item, I should be able to see my list of items before selecting which unit I want to use it on.\n- When using an item, an extra click is needed before you can select the item, for no reason.\n- There should be a better visual indicator on the squad screen of who the squad leader is.[strike]Right now Jules looks identical to the archers on either side of him.[/strike]\n- In the marketplace, if I've clicked on \"Recruit\", and want to switch to buying items, I should be able to click direclty on \"Trader\" and vice-versa, without needing to cancel first.\n- When recruiting units, there should be a way to lock a units stats in place so I can look at their traits without accidentally mousing over another units name and switching it.\n- There should be a way to see what the deploy limit for the upcoming battle is, so I can organize my squads appropriately, without needing to go back to the battle prep screen after seeing it.\n- The mouse scroll wheel doesn't work on the game manual / tutorial pages\n\nIn Battle:\n- There should be a way to move the camera with the keyboard without moving the targeting cursor (this is necessary if I want to move the camera while still having my hand on the mouse)\n- It should be possible to move the camera with the mouse by left-click dragging, instead of having to bring the mouse near the edge of the screen (this is especially vital in windowed mode)\n- There should be a toggle to turn off the need to select \"Move\" for moving units on capture points\n- There should be a toggle to allow the turn to end automatically when all squads have taken their turn.\n[strike]There should be a hotkey to end the turn.[/strike] (There isn't, but double-tapping space is close to good enough)\n- There should be a hotkey to display the mission info, and the mission info should appear automatically at the start of a map.\n[strike]There should be a hotkey to move to the next unit whose turn is still available, so I don't always have to scan the screen visually for this.[/strike]\n- There should be a way to see a units health (% of units alive, maybe?) and morale at a glance from the battle map. It takes so much time to dig out morale information for each unit by clicking all the way into their unit details.\n[strike]When you hover a unit, their morale needs to appear in the little mini-squad-view that pops up.[/strike]\n- There should be a way to see a tooltip explaining what a piece of terrain does.\n[strike]There should be a way to make an enemy unit's attack range stay visible on the screen so I can plan around it. Ideally, I'd be able to have multiple units selected for this at once, and be able to highlight them in different colors.[/strike]\n- There should be a way to quickly distinguish between squads led by the same unit type at a glance, especially when both squads are led by main characters. [strike]Right now Jules' squad and Narima's squad are identical visually.[/strike]\n- During combat, there should be a clear indicator of which unit is the squad leader.\n- After selecting an attack type, and a squad to target, on the screen that shows the two squads, there should be buttons I can use to change my attack type (such as switching to \"Force Surrender\" after seeing the enemy's morale is low).\n[strike]If I back out of an attack, I should be able to change attack type, or which action I do without the unit undoing their entire turn and deselecting themselves[/strike]\n- On the list of attack types, \"Force Surrender\" should have an indicator of what the surrender chance is, so I don't have to keep checking it.\n- It should be easier to tell at a glance if a unit has ranged attacks. Especially, some of the icons for cavalry ranged units are hard to identify.\n[strike]When moving units, it would be nice to have a visual indicator for units I can do a charge or ambush attack against[/strike]\n\nGeneral:\n- There need to be better resolution settings. Almost every piece of text in the game is difficult to read on a high resolution monitor.\n- The game needs rebindable controls, it's an accessibility issue.\n\nIf the game sees improvement in this area, I hope to be able to give it another chance and change my review.\n- DLC and Bugs prove this company is Garbage.\n- It's hard to review a game like this.\n\nAs a game in it's own right, if you've never played it before, it's a good game. Typical crazy Final Fantasy story (although it takes a bit to get into it), interesting characters, and simple but fun real-time turn-based combat. Final Fantasy games are known for their stories and characters, which are great in this member of the series.\n\nIf you've played the game before on PS1, then it's good for nostalgia. However, many people complain about it being a bad port. It has built-in cheats, in case you just want to be able to enjoy the story, characters, and side-quests. I played this years ago on PS1, and I really enjoyed my trip down memory lane with this game.\n\nIf you're an achievement hunter, this game is horrible. There are achievements that, unless you're literally following an online scripted step-by-step walkthrough, you will miss some random little thing, not know it, and then have to play the entire game over. Another achievement requires you to speed through the game in under 12 hours, which means you will grind through the game you already played, watching the same story you just watched, all over again, wasting six hours (that's how long it took me), just for the sake of one achievement... There's also another achievement to kill 10k enemies. when you can play the whole game and not even kill 1k enemies... You might think, \"oh they just want you to play the game through 10 times then\". No. It's 10k enemies in one playthrough. You run out of content, and have nothing to do, except grind battles, for literally dozens of hours. It's terrible.\n\nDespite my bitterness about the achievements, it's a really enjoyable game. Considering the FF series are mainly known for their stories, it lives up to its reputation. If you're an RPG fan, this is definitely on the list of \"must plays\".\n- And that's it, after 278 hours of play, the adventure is over... \nThis type of game that you wish you could forget so you could rediscover it like the 1st time, where you discover everything, a bit like a child\nIt's a game made with passion for video games, to tell a story, to make the player laugh too, and to make him a little melancholic or horrified or even sickened sometimes\n\n[u]Divinity OS 2 will have marked my young adult life[/u], like Sonic and megadrive games, Pokémon, FFTactics, Zelda and gameboy / gamecube games, Warcraft3 (TT), or Mass Effect and other PC games did in my childhood and adolescence (I surely forget so much excellent games)\n\nIt's a 20/20 for me. The work is titanic. The game is really made with passion. The studio is very talented.\n\nSo when Steam asks me [i]\"Do you recommend this game\"[/i], I say:\nYes! Because this is where you feel that video games are an experience, an adventure to live! \nI went through Rivellion with my buddy, like I went through Kanto (Pokémon), or Ivalice in FF Tactics as a kid!\n\n\n[u][b]Atmosphere:[/b][/u]\nMany of us probably remember our adventures in Pokémon or other games in our childhood. We roamed, discovered and lived in these worlds!\n\nHere, it's the same thing, and not alone this time: I was with a very good friend! \nWe met frequently to venture into the world of Divinity as a lightning lizard warrior or a skeletal assassin with a mysterious past...\n\nWith our companions Lohse and Ifan, and Maladie, and Gareth, and Jahan and Han the survivor kid and Sir Lora and so many others. Impossible to forget... \n[i]They exist! Stop lying, I know they exist ![/i]\n\nOur choices were important: We decided to do justice to this or that person, provoking reactions (or death) in certain characters, slapping a few Magisters around when necessary\nAnd of course, we STRONGLY decided to stea... Borrow a lot of spells and equipments from the merchants, while the other one was distracting by chatting...\n... What? We didn't have the money and we had to save the world ! Well, we had the money, but you never know, maybe one day we will need it... !\nAnd then stealing, it's fun. And exhilarating hehehe\n\n\n[u][b]Gameplay:[/b][/u]\nA 3D tactical turn-based game, to play with friends. Really ! Don't play this game alone, I'm sure that with at least 1 buddy (or 3!), you will exploit the game to its full potential!\n\nAlso, [u]you can change your skills and class at any moment in the game[/u], it's very flexible ! I played rogue all my game, and in the last chapiter, I decided to play with spear and War skills ! I really enjoyed being able to switch like this, as I want ! The game want you to take FUN, not \"suffering\" your \"bad\" class choices !\n\nToo bad, I don't know anyone who is ready to take on the role of a GM (Game Master), to live a personalized campaign! Because it is a mode apart from the main campaign!\n\n\n[u][b]Music:[/b][/u]\nExtremely good and fits perfectly with the atmosphere of the game. This kind of OST that we listen to when we work and that makes us live our adventures again when the song becomes EPIC!\n\n\n[u][b]In summary:[/b][/u]\nTitanic content, assured re-playability for those who wish to know what would have happened if they had answered something else than \"FIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT\", and I repeat, the fact of being able to play with friends makes the game so much more pleasant to do!\n\n\n[b]*Sob*[/b]\nBut no, I'm not crying... I'm just allergic to emotions!\n\nI would like so much to forget this game to be able to rediscover it\n\nPlease play it, at least give it a try, and let yourself be immersed in Div's world!\n\nIn our case, we will do it again in HARDCORE mode !\n\nPeace guys !\n- Doublefine: How did Psychonauts flop? Why did nobody buy our enjoyable artistic platformer?\nUs: You didn’t market it. Heck, I legit thought it was a horror game when I got it as a kid.\nDoublefine: Well, either way, now that it’s a cult classic – we made a sequel.\nUs: Awesome, when is that coming out anyway?\nDoublefine: It’s already out. We just didn’t market it again.\n- Incomphrehesible UI, sloppy controls.\n\n\nGranted I'm a day one player, but very steep learning curve. Couldn't figure out interstellar nav, for the life of me, and the touchy controls made the dogfighting a chore. Save your money. This isn't a jump in and play game.\n- 1 week before release i played the demo, it was a 20 minutes demo that was very underwhelming, but i still thought i should give the game a chance to see if it gets better later on.\n\nIt doesn't.\n\nSo the first thing i read about this game in the embed of the steam link was \"a fresh take on the jrpg genre\", and its probably the biggest problem of the game. It is really the most basic, mediocre turn base combat you can find.\n\nTurn base combat, rock paper scissor elemental types plus physical, materia base skills with few spots (i had only 4 skills activated),  no gear, no party. Does that sound like a fresh take to you?\n\nSo if the gameplay is so barebones it means is at least hard right? Well no, it is basic and easy. The start is easy, in the mid part they blow up the HP of enemies so you understand you should buy new skills, and once you do it the game is easy again. Mob enemies are generally harder than bosses because you are 1vs3 most of the time, while in bosses you can just debuff it and make it slow, while you have 2 turns to spam healings and hitting. There also some questionable decisions on the minor mechanics of the combat system but i don't think they matter (see some paragraphs below)\n\nNow here is what is really the \"fresh take\": the setting being cyberpunk. Everything is written with tech terminology. The mana is called data, block and delay turn is called cache, melee combat is called hack? some of the terms don't even make sense of what they actually do. Also because we obviously live in a technological society we have people called \"V-sync\" or \"Nullpointer\", expresions like \"Digits!\" or \"Oh my grind!\", you know, normal behaviour if you ask me.\n\nThe story is pretty standard for a futuristic setting, it wasn't bad but also it wasn't good, pretty normal.\n\nThe artstyle is cool, the music is generally cool, which i think its why most people would don't mind the boring gameplay and will just play for the story, which is also present in the game itself because you have options to either skip every random encounter (yeah we have those here) or to insta win every battle when you want it.\n\nSo if you want to try this game because of the \"fresh take in the jrpg genre\" you will be disappointed, if you have played jrpgs before there is nothing new in this game, you have already played it before.\n- This is a passable if grindy 3D first person family friendly farming \"shooter\" with cartoony artwork.  You have a simple \"vacuum\" gun that you use to capture wild critters, throw them into pens, feed them, collect their stuff, sell it, rinse repeat.  \n\nThe implementation here is of high quality and works well on PC with a range of implementation options.  While the gameplay is somewhat repetitive and grindy, this is decent enough family friendly game that should be considered when on sale.  The retail price is too high, however, this game appears on sale and in bundles often enough.\n- I like the game, but I'd recommend waiting for the full release.\nDon't get me wrong, the game is beautiful and it's got great potential. The problem with it is, mostly, the keybindings. They are incredibly uncomfortable to use and you cannot change them.\nPlus, the dialogues sometimes feel never ending and quite pointless.\n- GIVE ME THE GODDAMN COPY/PASTE ROOM BUTTON!\n\n10/10 would play again.\n\n(Ttips to combat the somewhat broken system atm:\n\n1. Use patients list, manually send those patients to treatment or home: \na. Very high diagnosis but still queuing for GPs (even 100% patients will wait for GP till their death, it will waste most GP resources)\nb. Very low mood/health patient, if you can gurantee the patient getting their treatment soon w/o affecting others in the queue, use the room's queue function, or use click on the patient to change his position in the queue, otherwise send him home to avoid penalty\n\n2. Treatments are much more profitable than diagnosis, plus they leave after treatment no matter what, but if well treated, then you don't need much ghost hunting janitors\n\n3. If in need of money in the early game, don't bother with food/drink/bathroom/comfort, do the minium and focus on your diagnosis -> treatment, most patient will get treated before they rage quit, thus make you a lot of money. With staff, if they near rage quit, just raise their salary.\n\n4. In the early game, only put down the essential objects (e.g. only desk and file cabinet in GP's) to maximize your profit. They only room I recommend to decorate to lvl 5 is staff room to speed up their recovery.\n\n5. ALWAYS ensure there is a toilet right next to your staff room, and a cafe. If a tired staff need bathroom, he/she will walk all the way to the staff room and back to toilet and back to staff room, even if a toilet is right next to his/her office. Samething with Cafe, it provides a 'nice meal' bonus.\n\n6. Do not build more reception than you need, build less. It is a great way to control the patient flow, they don't wonder around while in a reception queue.\n\n7. For a large map, patients entering the hospital from mutiple gates. I don't recommend building reception other than one specific area (preferably right next to GP's office), reason as above.\n\n8. News agent can get long queue very easily, as long as you have one, patients in queue will travel all the way across the map for it. So be careful, either don't put any, or put one in every building (at least).\n\n9. With spare money, get your staff trained ASAP, especially staff providing treatment (to ensure high chance of successful treatment)\n\n10. Click on a room, goes to 'info' tab, the last sentence there will tell you what training the staff in the room should have.\n\n11. Keep track of your staff's skills, and assign them only ONE job in the staff -> job assignment menu, so AI won't mess your system up.)\n\nThings I'd really like to be changed:\n1. WAY too many patients.\nI think the new patients' growth(spawn) need to be slow down at certain point either automatically or mannually, I often found myself in need of double the amount of GP offices in the mid-game. Since GP offices are the choke points, it can get out of control in matter of seconds, which left no Human resources/money/time to train everyone. Besides, it is realistic, there are only so many people a town have.\nAnd because of the growth issue, I find myself have to build more and more, I'd like to slow down and taking care of every corner of my hospital, not just keep building. Quality takes time, nobody like be overly pushed by the game.\n\n2. Rooms merge\nJust like in real lives, Doctor's room are private, but pharmacy? I think other rooms should not be private - Allow us to put multiple machine and people in one room, make it shared. It is just bizzare to not make it shared, and vey wasteful of time/money/spaces. Besides, some room looks really empty.\n\n3. Wards\nWards are weird, I'm not sure why. Often than not, I have more than enough beds and nurses, but still 6+ wait outside, I'm not sure what triggers them to be 'called in'\n\n4. FOOD/DRINK/TOILET is broken\nI'm sorry, but I'm not gonna build cafe & bathroom every 3 inchs. IRL, most hospital have 1~3 cafes, a small~medium toilet on every floor. Space is valuable, I would rather leave it to medical facilities. I think the AI is a bit broken at this point, they constantly want drink/food/bathrooms while I have 6+ machines/2 toilets in every building. As if they can't walk 10m to the nearest one.\n\n5. Janitors are kind of dump.....I wish we can assign areas to janitors/assitances, so they won't always walk across the map back and forth.\n\n6. Man, this is 2018, we got central heating and air-conditioning...for real. Maybe make a seprate tunnel system? Like water, electricity, heat, air. Hospital's air exchange system is much more important than usual buildings I believe.\n\n7. Credit to Ibbi Wyxx in the commnet, I think it is great to set patient with certain percent of diagnosis straight to treatment rooms. It makes sense and later in the game, with doctors fully trained I imagine 100% diagnosis on most patients in the GP's shouldn't be a problem. And it is how real life works as well, dorctors are not always 100% sure whats wrong, they might start some harmless/urgent treatment first, myself actually is in this situation right now \n\n(sometimes I feel like I'm being treated in my own hospital because I just stayed at one IRL, so I have to make everything right as if trying to please myself...)\n\n8.  Some of those skills just look fancy since you can't replace them.\nThis one does not matter much, I'm very OCD when it comes to managment, so atm I have to wait for the right person w/o any skills I don't want on them so the training oppourtinity will not go wasted, but it is hard and annoying. Besides, it is a real problem since you can only learn 5 skills, so just choosing whoever is not effective and effecient in the long run. (for example a GP w/ Radiology skill)\n\nAlso, it makes some of the skill essentially useless, i.e. master class (speed up learning and teaching), it may seem useful, but it will eventually cost you a lot more than you gain. Down the line it will cost you one spot for other skill. If just hiring someone w/ this skill to teach then fire him, it is also costly and not making any real sense. \n\nThings I'd like to see (in DLCs?):\n1. Ambulances management. Ambulance are essential part of a hospital, ERs are even better! (Stayed at a ER bed not long ago watch the whole ER room working,man, ERs are cool af, but I do hope less people need to see it because it is...ER)\n2. Multifloor-hospital.\n3. ICU etc.?\n4. Medicin/drug development/management\n5. Specialists office?\n6. More background music/radio, its a bit repetitive at this point\n- buy it on sale. campaign was decent, however The Last Tiger mission was a standout. Multiplayer experience is ok overall, the hackers make it the worst bit. 6.5/10, if Dice fixes their servers and clears out the hackers then maybe it's worthy of an 8/10.\n- In 2013, after 10 years of waiting, the Sim City community of modders, fans, and aficionados rushed out to purchase the fifth installment of Sim City. Ten years is a long time to wait for a game, but people had a lot of faith in Maxis when they announced the title. Long story short, it was a massive dissapointment. Maxis and EA crippled Sim City 5 with DRM, Always On APM, tiny maps, forced origin installation, lacking mod support, no steam support, and a forced multiplayer aspect.  I decided to not purchase the title, so it may have been a decent game, but 2 years later a team of 12 people created a game that does everything maxis insisted was utterly and totaly impossible.  \n\nEverything the mod community did that kept Sim City 4 on the shelves in Wallmarts across America for an entire decade was ignored. Maxis (and to a lesser extent EA) ignored the fans, and gave the people who had kept them in business for twenty years a crippled subpar game.  And for that Maxis is now out of business. They will never make another game, and it is no one's fault but theirs.\n\nNow pretend none of that happened. It's 2013 again, and here it is people: Sim City 5. \n\nThe game balance is a bit on the easy side for veterans of the genre, but the potential map size is ENOURMOUS and customizing your city could fill up years of gameplay time.  The game runs so smoothly with so much going on, it really shows how lazy Maxis was with their approach.  The glass in buildings reflects the sun and the buildings near it, there are dynamic shadows, zoning is back, and it is not 'dumbed down'.  A single tile in this game is twice the size of the alloted map in Sim City, and you can purchase dozens of additional tiles to expand.  The map editor is awesome, the community is thriving, there are mods to do anything you want, and this is the city building game we've all been waiting for.  I can not possibly reccomend this more.\n- Not saying this as a tough guy thing or anything, But it is difficult for me to shed actual tears.\n\nThis game made me ugly cry twice, and happy cry once.\n\nThis not a story about zombies.\n\nIt is about a little girl growing up in the worst possible situation.\n\nAnd what she makes of it.\n\n2/13/2023 finished\n\nPS: If I ever have a daughter I will name her Clementine. This is the tier of impact this game had on me we are talking about.\n- 1. What is \"Pyre\"?\nThe game \"Pyre\" was made by Supergiant Games and was released on the 25th of July in 2017. After \"Bastion\" and \"Transistor\" this is their third game. \"Pyre\" is an indie-action-rpg, which story is mostly told in form of a novel. The gameplay is very different to the experience you probably made in \"Bastion/Transistor\", which lead a few people to put a negative review on steam. Now you will no longer play as one single character like before, but you are responsible for a group of exiles. The gameplay at it´s heart can be declared as 3 parts:\n \npart 1 contains travelling/exploring the world\n\npart 2 contains social interactivity with your group (talking/trading/decision-making)\n\npart 3 contains to take part in the rites, that means a fast-paced action ball game (3 vs 3) without        a planning phase (like in \"Transistor\")\n\n\n2. Technical details\n-the game runs fine on my windows 10 64 bit machine and it needs about 8.2 gb space of your hard drive. Unfortunately the game runs bad on old machines, because you need about 4 gb ram to run it without an error (my other 3 gb ddr2-system couldn´t run it, I received a ram-error-message when starting the game).\n\n-controls with mouse+keyboard or gamepad are good and well implemented.\n\n\n3. What does the game do right?\n-great rpg-novel-mixture as a whole unique and emotional experience\n-despite the linear progression (mentioned \"phases/parts\" above) the game stays interesting enough to continue\n-a colourful and fantastic world to explore (no open-world)\n-great character-design and a good variety of different creatures, which affects the gameplay during the rites\n-beautiful artstyle with a lot of detail and smooth animations \n-believable and fleshed-out storyline (NOT \"black and white\") with a personalised ending! \n-wonderful soundtrack (mostly ambient)\n-the creatures of the world speak their own language, subtitle is displayed in old-fashioned English\n-rites: the thrilling-faced-paced-action-game has a lot of depth to it (skill tree/character selection/items/area of the rite)\n-selectable difficulty level (rites can be optionally restartet), which can be changed during the game (+ \"titan-mode\": advanced challenges you can add separately like in \"Bastion/Transistor\")\n-meaningful and emotional decisions to be made (I´m looking at you mass effect), thankfully there are no dead-ends but different endings (personalised!)\n-\"Pyre\" is \"2-3 times\" longer compared to \"Bastion\"/\"Transistor\" without getting boring\n-good mouse+keyboard and gamepad support\n-\"versus-mode\": you can play against friends together on your pc or alone against CPU (with all the characters in the game!)\n\n\n4. What does the game do wrong?\n-the fast-paced-gameplay during the rites can be very fast and too stressful at times (I experienced some unfair situations here and there)\n-controls are sometimes not precise enough, especially when the gameplay is getting hot\n-hardware requirements (like \"Transistor\") with 4 gb ddr-ram are over the top regarding old rigs with dual-core cpu´s \n-some minor bugs during the rites (ball gets stuck, switching between characters over distance, bad camera angles over distance)\n-\"versus mode\" can only be played as local multiplayer\n-no bonus material for fans at all \n\n\n5. tl;dr\nPyre offers a fantastic but linear action-rpg-experience with a great story, which is told in form of a novel with a personalised ending. The gameplay is a mixture of exploration, social interactivity and a 3 vs 3 ball-sports-game. The level of creativity considering world-building, character design, music and the way the story is being told is on an insanely high level. If you liked \"Bastion\" and \"Transistor\" you need to know that you don´t play just as one character anymore. But what you can expect is a game with a heart, just like their games before. Pyre is in my opinion a masterpiece and the best Supergiant game so far.\n\n\n6. Final thoughts\nAs a child of the 80´s I played a lot of pc games. Sometimes I look back and remember how I bought game boxes from a company called \"Lucas Arts\". There were times I didn´t even inform myself about the upcoming games, I just bought them because I loved their games I purchased before. For me Supergiant reached that status in the present time. \n\n\n\nUntil the stars align!\nIf you liked this review be sure to hit the like button to help other players with helpful reviews. Thanks!\n- I wish there were a \"mixed\" option for recommending this game, as I think for a lot of people out there, this is a fantastic game, and it's definitely well made with a lot of love and attention to detail in many respects. I really like puzzles and problem solving, so part of my disappointment with The Witness is that I really thought I would enjoy the game. Myst was one of my favorite games growing up, and I was extremely excited to see a well-reviewed game in the Myst genre surface after far too long. \n\nThe problem for me was that The Witness is very much a game about the journey, and not the destination. It turns its head on the genre as it's less a game about solving puzzles within a set of rules, and more about discovering what those rules are. And for the most part, it does that well. Instead of the usual game conventions, rewards for solving hard puzzles weren't any kind of story unlock, more just to give you a harder puzzle. That approach was fun for awhile, but some story unlock would've been appreciated, especially because there is so much mystery and it's such an immersive world that was clearly built for a reason and has a fascinating backstory. \n\nSome of the mechanics also just seem arbitrary, or at the very least, not quite obvious enough. Sometimes perspective puzzles require you to either take a screenshot or jot down on pencil and paper the answer, then transfer it on screen. That seems like lazy game design and worst of all, takes you out of the immersive experience. It's possible I'm mostly tone deaf, as some of the sound puzzles seemed almost impossible to me, despite numerous listens. There's also just the repetitiveness of the \"pathfinding\" puzzles, which range from challenging (and satisfying) to punitive in their difficulty spikes. It's in these difficulty spikes where I think the core game mechanic of pathfinding lets you down, as it requires you to be much more of a planner than a \"hands on\" problem solver. In a game like this, I would think it would accommodate multiple approaches, but really there's a right way to approach this game, and a wrong way. Unfortunately for me, I think the way I approach puzzles (trial and error) is strongly discouraged, at times in punitive ways. \n\nThe philosophy from the audio/video portions will likely be appreciated by some, and for some come off as the worst kind of douchey-hipster nonsense. Had they been delivered in shorter pieces, I might've fallen into the former. But as rambling as some of them are, I found them more annoying than enjoyable unfortunately. \n\nI don't know, I'm really torn on this. It's a well made game, and while it seems so open and non-confined, I found the game to be far too linear in mechanics and how to approach problem solving. At times it actually made me feel like a lesser thinker because I have a different approach to puzzles than what the game designer prefers. What I'm sure is a really fun journey for some, left me disappointed with the destination. \n\nAm realizing this reads a lot like an apology for not liking this game, which I think it is. I really, really wanted to love The Witness, but in the end, not only was this game not for me, but I genuinely feel lesser for that fact because I feel like I should have loved it, and just didn't.\n- This is a poor excuse for a Korean mobile port in a long line of them with the lack of sound, spelling errors, bad translations, ugly UI, log-in issues and so much more and it has P2E crypto/NFT garbage and P2W.\n\nNot even the small number of upskirts and jiggly boobs can save this one.\n- [h1] 🕘          IMPRESSION:[/h1]\n* 2016: Game released\n* 2019: It seem fun, let's buy this\n* 2020: New content added\n* 2022: More content added\n\n🟢 = Available\n🔴 = Not available\n\n[h1]         GAMING CONTENT:[/h1] \n🟢 Teamwork with others\n🟢 Puzzle Challenges\n🟢 No Compass or Map Challenge\n🟢 Funny Avatar\n🟢 Customize Avatar\n🔴 3-4 players share screen\n🔴 Fast Sprint\n🔴 Time Attack for replay value\n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [th]iMeter[/th]\n        [th]SCORED[/th]\n        [th]iNTEREST METER[/th]\n        [th]DISCOUNT?[/th]\n [th]COMMUNITY[/th]\n        [th]REVIEWER[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [th]A+[/th]\n        [td]5[/td]\n        [td]Loving it [/td]\n        [td]No Wait[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [th]A[/th]\n        [td]4[/td]\n        [td]Liked it[/td]\n        [td]No Wait[/td]\n        [td] ✔[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [th]B[/th]\n        [td]2-3[/td]\n        [td]Half satisfied[/td]\n        [td]Wait 50%[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n        [td] ✔[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [th]C[/th]\n        [td] 1[/td]\n        [td]Less Interested[/td]\n        [td]Wait 75%[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [th]D[/th]\n        [td] 0[/td]\n        [td]Not what you need[/td]\n        [td]Wait 100%[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n\n🏅 Community Rating: [b] Very Positive [/b]\n🔎 Long Version Checklist ➜ [u][url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/expectationchecklist/discussions/1/1738883005311884039/]Reveal[/url][/u]\n📢 Disclaimer about Short Hours & English Error ➜ [u][url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/expectationchecklist/discussions/0/4594180031254224809/]Read Here[/url][/u]\n\n[quote]\n⚖️ iMeter {B} Worth a play, if you enjoy Teamwork Challenges with Puzzle.

I will grant that the with all the add ons it would feel a tad crowded to anyone who hadn't played it before, but you have a crazy amount of options. The game series tagline of \"one more turn\" could not be more applicable.\n\nYou can strive for one of several victories: diplomatic, cultural, technological or domination. Each has its unique challengers to overcome and create a lot of the fun of the game. They are also not necessarily mutually exclusive and after completing one victory, you can go for the others. Each AI opponent has their own personality, and are pretty predictable in how they behave. Any one who has started the game next to Neopoleon or Ghengis Kahn knows they immediately have to have a decent military to repel invasion, while Ghandi will to muscle you out with religion and culture.\n\nThere are some important changes between Civilization IV and V. One of the most notable is that wars are plausible again as you dont constantly lose health in enemy territory and cities are easier to conquer. Additionally, culture doesn't automatically take over neighbor's cities anymore. \n\nThis game is easily worth the money. I'm not entirely sure how it stacks up to Civilization VI, but any game that I log 200+ hours on over a period of years and still haven't come close to doing everything is doing something right. A great game from a great series.\n- Damn, deeply devoted developer designed Death's Door.\nDiscover dungeons, divine drama, delightfully depicted Death [b]:D[/b]\nDark daw's daunting duels demand deft digits.\nDynamite deal definitely does deserve desire!\n- It's horrible. It's annoying to play, it freaks you out, it insults you relentlessly. Yeah, of course I'm recommending it, why do you ask?\n\nWill You Snail is what it says it is. A platformer with traps popping on your predicted path with some meta plot and an evil AI commenting on your actions, mostly with clever insults. But it's also a little more than that, mainly due to the quality of its elements - so the game becomes more than the sum of its parts.\n\nYou're probably wondering about the difficulty. Well, good news: there are four settings, and by default they change depending on your performance. You struggle with the level too much? It's lowered. You beat it on the first few tries? It goes up. All with a (not) nice comment from Squid, the antagonist. I personally found the design annoying rather than actually challenging, but I'm quite sure that's intentional. The game's got it all: conveyor belts (that randomly change direction), underwater currents, perfectly timed spikes falling on your head, blocks that cave in on you after you break them. PhD in twatologist design. Due to the ever-shifting nature of the levels, I wouldn't even call this game a precision platformer - it's not about learning the level, but about adaptation. Luckily, the platforming segments are only one part of the game and there's some downtime between them, with optional (but fun) puzzles.\n\nOh, and for reference: I played mostly on difficulty 3 out of 4, sometimes dropping to 2 and rose to 4 towards the end. I found it roughly as difficult as Ori and the Blind Forest's latter sections, harder than Celeste ignoring strawberries, and easier than Garlic.\n\nLet's talk about Squid, the antagonist. The misanthropic, fatalistic, super-intelligent AI trope is pretty old at this point - but Squid is a very good refinement of that trope. It feels like he's really insulting you - the player - not the player character, like GLaDOS did. Mainly because he really reacts to the exact things that you do. You died just before the end? He'll point that out. You keep dying in one spot? He'll let you have it. You died to a spike? Comments about hitting your head incoming. Ran into a bomb? He'll tell you not to collect them. And so on. There so many lines, I never, ever, not once ran into a duplicate. That really makes him feel like a living, breathing person, not an NPC. I mean, he's not living and breathing... you know what I mean.\n\nOn that topic: if you've watched the trailer, you've probably noticed that Squid speaks with a non-native accent. That's because he's voiced by the dev, who's German; and indeed the general writing has this sardonic, matter-of-fact yet earnest quality that will be familiar to you if you know the German style of communication. No, no angry screaming, that's not how Germans talk. Stop watching WW2 speeches and watch some Staplerfahrer Klaus instead.\n\nAnd finally, there's the story. It's a bit meta, no surprises there. I won't write too much about it because I don't want to spoil it. Let's just say that it leaves many things out, but gives you just enough info to fill in the blanks. It's rather suspenseful; more importantly, it slowly builds up to... cosmic horror? Existential terror? Perhaps both. Also, it has a very clear message, delivered quite convincingly. Up to you to decide what to do with it.\n\nOverall, Will You Snail is pretty good. I don't think it's as flawless as many reviews make it out to be; the annoying design is still annoying in the end, even if it's thematically correct. Also, the music relies a little too much on the central leitmotif of the game, and it simply doesn't have the grace and variety to pull it off like Toby Fox did with UNDERTALE's soundtrack. Still; those little things aren't enough to wear down the emotional feast presented by this game. I'd say \"Guten appetit\" to this fine escargot meal, but in this case, we are the snails. Enjoy!\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42922988]Curator page[/url]\n- I played the demo and instantly became enamored. The mix of Slay the Spire-style deck-building with elements of the ship combat from FTL: Faster Than Light is an absolutely fascinating mix, and the \"single-axis\" movement system adds a whole extra layer that I've never seen in anything except the Mega Man: Battle Network series.\n\nI bought the full game within the first hour of being available. After having played for nearly 4 hours at the time of writing, my opinion hasn't changed in the slightest. I already love what's available and so far I feel like I've barely scratched the surface.\n\nI can't wait to see what awaits in the future for this awesome title.\n\nEDIT: As a small addition, I will say: I beat my very first run, which is set to the lowest difficulty (Normal). I jumped up to Hard to try to unlock a new ship, and I haven't been able to beat a run since then. It's probably just that I'm bad, all things considered, but be aware that the changes made with difficulty increases are probably more impactful than they may seem.\n\nAlso I wanna say to the devs: thank you for launching the game with mod support and working on making it easier! But also please look into getting Steam Workshop support if you can!\n- The EOS stands for End of Service. I am sure someone has fun with this or there wouldn't be a reason to keep bringing it back. Right? The usual Tab Target MMO. I do like that you can teleport to quest givers and mobs instead of the usual auto or manual run. Aside from that there isn't anything modern here.\n\n【グループB】\n- Someone has to be the first, I guess.\n\nI don't know, I just didn't really feel too hooked on the game's premise. I feel less like I'm solving a puzzle and more like I'm hitting a pinata for all the clues. Every replay, I'm just going to have to do something whacky in order to get a new clue as to what might further my cause. And that doesn't really make me feel like I'm a part of a story, as much as a I feel like I'm going through an eternally looping monday, getting increasingly distanced to the world around me as I finally end up throwing myself overboard, because 'why not?'.\n\nI won't refund it, because I think the devs have poured a lot of heart into this game and I do think they deserve the money, but I couldn't really find too much entertainment in the game.\n- 12 years have passed and you decide to update the game by increasing the price, removing multiplayer, radio stations, and adding your shitty launcher, yet you haven't fixed those frame drop issues that have been sticking with us since release and make the game completely unplayable no matter what computer you're running it on.\n\n12 years for this. Fuck you Rockstar.\n- Volition ups the silly, and adds super powers, but loses a little something along the way.\n\nI loved Saint's Row: the Third, and by all rights should have loved IV as well, but I mostly just liked it. The set up was fun, and seemed to up the ante again, but then you get the presidency ripped away from you almost immediately (without even seeing the consequences of your first pushed legislation!). Placing the game in a virtual city for the most part with the only real characters being on your space ship, really kinda seemed to gut the game. Even when [spoiler]the world gets destroyed[/spoiler], a detached, \"meh\" was all I could muster. The humor is there, but it's mostly better in the DLC. The radio stations feel kind of underwhelming without DJs.\n\nFinally all the fun of collecting and customizing various interesting cars, and finding ways to climb or fall to interesting places with a stolen plane/parachute are gutted with the inclusion of super powers. Also, the super powers make gunplay, leveling any of your other stuff, and pretty much every mechanic carried over from Saints Row: the Third obsolete.\n\nIf you get this game, do yourself a favor and make sure you get all the DLC where most of the real fun is. Is it as good as the previous Saints Row? I don't think so, but I still recommend getting it and playing through it. It is a lot of fun, and I love the 50's break out scenario at the beginning.\n\nStacey's thoughts:\nStill awaiting DLC with Jane Austin and the D*ldo Bat.

Then I bought a horse and left the tutorial area, and things got weird. I'm pretty on board with this one.\n- Great story, great features. But in my honest opinion unless your going for a nostalgia trip, give it a pass. The gun play and AI alone is enough for me to justify a refund, I mean shit cops hear the sounds of gunshots right next to them and act like nothing is happening. Immersion 0/10 sorry. I must admit I really enjoyed this game on console, but I am gonna have to take the money and run. Notice how almost all of the reviews just say All YOU haD to do Was FoLlow The DAmn Train cj or Ill HAve TWo NumBER 9s. I cant say I didn't expect this game to be a little shit judging by how old it is, but I will NOT suck it off and say buy it, the actual game play is PATHETIC. In all honesty I think this game remastered with gta v's physics and polish would be SOOO much better than gta v. They really captured the hood life in this one, damn shame it fucking sucks. This game's age sadly isn't up to par and sadly, it's getting a fat thumbs down from this boomer.\n- I do think the Mixed review rating is justified, but for the wrong reasons.\nHere are a few pro's and con's from someone who's been a long-time fan and played every Dirt game except the first one.\n\nPRO:\n+ Handling and physics are alright on both \"Gamer\" and \"Simulation\" settings\n+ Decent soundtrack\n+ Building and leveling up your staff and garage gives the game more depth\n\nCON:\n- Horrendously inconsistent AI. In roughly 15 years of playing racing games I've never seen AI as inconsistent as in this game. I played on \"Tough\" and could complete some races with a 10+ second gap, while others were quite literally impossible. This is because of the auto generated track system - unlike in the previous Dirt games, the AI never actually drives on the track, but stage times are auto-generated by how an AI *would* likely perform on a stage. \n- Lack of tracks / Boring tracks. As mentioned, there are no proper tracks for Rally events as they are auto-generated. While the tech behind it is quite impressive, this leaves most tracks feeling incredibly dull with no highlights or features whatsoever. Remember the cool cliff sides from Greece in Dirt Rally? None of these here. Essentially all tracks feel the same no matter what the location is. Couple that with the fact that there are only 5 locations and you'll find yourself bored quite quickly. Rallycross and Landrush tracks are not auto generated, but feel incredibly boring and forgettable. Baja or Malaysia in Dirt 2 were such a blast, but Dirt 4? Yawn.\n- Historical Rally. In its entirety. It's just normal Rally with older cars, but after a while I refused to continue this event type as the events are dragged out as hell. Near the middle you'll have to complete 12 events with each 5 stages. That's 60 stages in total. Consider my previous point about tracks feeling dull and I can't help but wonder who actually completed all these events. This seems to be a Codemasters thing though as I had the same issue with Grid Autosport.\n- Menuing. Why is it that I need to go out of the career every time I want to buy a car? Why is selecting sponsors (which you'll do often as they expire after awhile) in the same category where you can customize your car? Everything is a huge mess and finding the right things took me more time than it should every time.\n+ Lack of rewards. I actually found Joyride, which isn't part of the main career, to be the most fun thing to do in the game. Even though the events in Joyride repeat frequently but with different cars, it was a proper challenge compared to the career and is somehow quite addicting. The issue with it is that it's meaningless to complete. You don't get anything for getting a Gold medal on everything, not even new liveries or, heck, even an achievement. It's utterly pointless.\n\nAll in all this game is easily the weakest entry in the franchise (minus Dirt 1 maybe, but that one had a way smaller budget). To top it off it just feels like this game has no soul either. I vividly remember Dirt 2's gritty and colorful presentation, while this one lacks anything I could remember the game by. Really all this game made me want to do is play Dirt 2 or Dirt Rally again. Cheers and thanks for reading.\n- UGH! The scariest thing about this game is that someone at Steam okayed it for being released. Absolute garbage! Frustrating as heck and not fun in the least bit. If you want a scare, you might accidentally get one through a jumpscare, but don't count on it. Avoid this game at all costs, even if its free, I would be hesitant to recommend downloading this pile of crap. You'll spend the entire time just trying to find things to click on, and when you do, you're rewarded with? some of the worst animations ever to be found in gaming\n- *Sigh* This game was just tiring. I wouldn't come to say it was a complete rip off of Paper's Please, but it was a very similar game but just worse. Mainly to the point that I played, at most, 10 minutes, I saw multiple repeats of the same messages, and the only updates were legislation, unlike in Papers, Please where you got new rules and new tools almost every day. I won't completely judge the game since I haven't played it the entire way through, but it's just not very good. Plain and simple.\n- Playing Football Manager is like doing drugs. You don't know why people do it, and you don't know how to do it. However, once you start doing it and get the hang of it, you can never stop doing it. 5 stars\n- So, I hated this game at first...\n\n I've never been into a MMO before, and I went into it with a mindset of \"FUCK YEAH! MULTIPLAYER SKYRIM LETS GO\" - In short don't do that. This isn't going to be like playing Skyrim, Oblivion, Morrowind. \n\nIt is when it all comes down to the core an MMO, it's set in Tamriel, it sounds like Tamriel and the storylines feel like an Elder Scrolls game. However being an MMO, it has a lot of grindy MMO style quests. And don't get me wrong, it's bewildering at first, all these mechanics, all these places to go....and before the 'One Tamriel' update if you chose the wrong faction, you were screwed, in a place all on your own surrounded by all these people who are WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY higher level than you. But thankfully they changed all of that. The game scales now, so you can rock up to a dungeon with your level V300 mate, and still have some fun slicing up enemies.\n\nSo I saw a friend playing the other day, and spent a few hours installing this to join him (By the way its like 70 Gig...If you have slow internet prepare for a few days of download), I got back on it after not playing for 14 months, but this time I was playing with a friend who was already Veteran Level 250, So I was in luck, he introduced me to everything and I got used to all the deconstructing of equipment to get my blacksmithing up, showed me about dungeons and bascially got me to enjoy the grind. I think my previous time was a bit lackluster because I got dropped in the middle of the Aldmeri Dominion on my own, without any of my friends. So I left.\n\nNow I know what I'm doing, and keep in mind I usually hate MMO's never played WoW or anything like that, this is the first one. I'm enjoying myself, I'm triple digits into this game time-wise and I don't see it stopping now. We've made a guild for noobies. To help them out, and get them to enjoy the game also. Because the community is nice...but you still get the elitist fucks from any competitive game kicking you out of dungeons because you're only level 14. But you won't get that when you're in a guild, having people to play with and explain all the mechanics did help, a lot. I've even gone as far as to buy this AGAIN on steam just to collect my hours and so on.\n\nAdd-ons are awesome being able to mod basic features of the game to help with information and quality of life improvements is a must. I'll provide an essential mods pack if any of you wish to know.\n\nFor those of you who actually got this far into this, well done. I didn't think I'd keep you captivated long enough to get to the end.\n\nIf any of you are new to the game, on EU server and would like to join a guild to show you the way, add me or visit our [url=www.godsofsalt.com]website[/url] and join us on teamspeak, or just message us in game @diseasedcrow.\n\nBut all in all if you like Elder Scrolls and you think you want to try this, just do, I'm glad I gave it a second chance.\n- \"The good things, the happy things, all of it changes. Nothing can stay the same forever. Still...can you find it in your heart to still love this place?\" (paraphrase)\n\nClannad . . .\n\nOH Clannad . . .\n\nI remember watching the anime in high school, and absolutely falling in love with it. Upon realizing the REAL story was told in a visual novel...I HAD to get my hands on it. I almost died of a joy-induced heart attack when a legitimate English version of the game was released on Steam.\n\nThis game bro. This f***** game. When I was a senior in high school back in the day, this game was my refuge. I was mostly friends with older kids back then, so by the time I was a senior I didn't really have anybody to chill with cuz all my friends already graduated. Its kinda hard for me to make new friends, then and now if I'm being honest. I related to Nagisa a lot for that reason. \n\nI mostly related to Tomoya and Sunohara tho. One of my best friends growing up really reminded me of Sunohara no cap lol. Type of dude who was the comic relief/brunt of everyone's s*** talking but w/ a mutual understanding its done in jest and love. And when things ever got serious we always had each others' backs, and even tho he's a goofball and kind of a meme, he's seriously loyal and a true ride or die.\n\nMany times when Tomoya was expressing himself in this game, I had to almost pinch my face and remind myself I'm not the one thinking these thoughts: I'm playing a VN lol. That's how much I seriously related to Tomoya. In so many aspects and ways that would make my review even longer than it is now if I were to attempt to explain why I relate to Tomoya so much. Yeah, sure that could just be shrewd character design from Maeda Jun's part, but it was almost uncanny how many of the things Tomoya went thru when he was younger/issues with his father/intimacy issues he develops later on in adulthood etc. almost perfectly mirrored what I was struggling with irl. It gave me something to relate to. It expressed emotions I was having trouble even admitting were present in my own self. Maybe that's the real reason I love Clannad so much, and maybe because of that I sit here biased with rose-colored nostalgia goggles. But even if I type this review with a tinge of rose-coloring obstructing my critical eyes, I can say with confidence that Clannad is more than a game. More than an anime. \n\nClannad is an experience. An experience I wish I could forget all about...just so I could experience it anew all over again. Whether you experience Clannad thru the anime, VN, movie, whatever...Clannad is an experience in a league of its own in my book. And the best way to have your Clannad experience is by playing this masterpiece of a Visual Novel. Hands down. \n\nHonestly, I'd ideally have all Clannad virgins go straight to the VN and play it to completion but that's just not a realistic request as this game takes the average player 80+ hours to complete just the main story apart from optional achievements haha. If you're a fan of the anime...why haven't you played the VN yet!? Lol. If you've never seen the anime or movie I'd STILL recommend playing this game. Just keep in mind to use a guide (just trust me on that. please) and be willing for it to be a bit boring at first. If you stick with it, believe me...it's not gonna stay boring for long.\n\nIf you liked the anime but hated the anime ending, PLAY THE VN. No spoilers, but trust me when I say the VN ending is the true conclusion of the Clannad experience. You'll find out what I mean if you stick with the VISUAL NOVEL to the end.\n\nI didn't go to my senior prom. I spent it playing this game. And I don't regret that decision one bit to this day. I experienced this game, standing in similar shoes as Tomoya at that time irl: rebellious kid about to graduate high school with no real goals or aspirations, struggling to find it hard to \"love this place\" or truly find something passionate to live for. I didn't want to go to college. There was nothing I wanted to do there. Most of the people in my grade back then thought I was quiet and lonely freshman-sophomore, then bad news junior-senior when I started acting out. I was just, lost. \n\nExperiencing Clannad helped me find what I was truly passionate about in life. Family. Friendship (as corny as that may sound). Being able to step up for what only YOU can protect when life is calling you to maturity.\n\nClannad helped me see that even though things can get dark... even though tragedies will happen regardless of our efforts to keep them from happening... even though things can never, and will never, ever stay the same in this life...and even if you lose your way eventually... and sadly reach such a lost and depressed state in life, that you mistakenly conclude for a short while you'd rather sever all your connections and ties with the world and everybody in it... in an effort to try to prevent experiencing even more pain... \n\nThat \"loving this place,\" loving this world, loving people, and forming deep, lifelong and lasting connections with this world and its people, NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS, is ALWAYS, ALWAYS, worth it in the end. Especially when it matters the most.\n\nNow I'm not gonna front: Clannad isn't for everybody. Some people just can't get into the moe art style. Some people may find it a bit too melodramatic at times. Some people may find some of the comedy or bits of the story weird, or just not their cup of tea. Some people may find it hard to relate to all of the characters, and for some people it won't have a Cindarella's slipper level of relatability like it did for me. For those people who are kinda feelin \"ehh idk if i'll really like this game\" I'd say it'd be smart to watch the anime first. But if you're feeling good about it and wanna experience Clannad the BEST way: cop this VN. Just wait for the good bits to slowly boil. Patience is a virtue :) And save yourself hours of rage by using a guide from the beginning until the after-story credits roll. With Clannad I'd say its almost always recommended to use a guide.\n\nAnd if you love the anime and haven't played the VN... you're weirdo number 1, 2, 3, 4 and even 5. Haha I'm playin but srsly get the VN already you owe it to yourself to experience the VN. Knowing what happens in the story and getting some events \"spoiled\" doesn't detract from the VN experience. That I promise you. As someone who watched the anime before playing the VN, who's now such an obvious fanboy of the Clannad VN as demonstrated by my wall of text of a review (lol), trust me: I'd bet money you'll love this game just as much as I do.  \n\nTo Maeda Jun, and all of the brilliant writers of this quintessential, modern classic of a story: thank you. Thank you for gifting all of us the experience that is Clannad. Because of your labours, you've helped a wayward knucklehead like me finally be able to declare this in spirit and in truth:\n\n\"I love this place.\"\n\nLong live Kazamatsuri!\n- Alright. **Frog Detective 3: Corruption at Cowboy County** is done and dusted.\n\nIn this latest mystery for the *Frog Detective* to solve, somebody has....stolen...all the Cowboy County resident's....HATS!!! \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3067651098\n\nWill you find the missing hats? Will you find the Hat Thief? These questions and more will be answered in this game!\n\nThis was actually the longest game in the series by a wide margin. Too about and hour forty to wrap up, and the game features two parts. The second part accessed after the credits roll.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3067650496\n\nEpiside 3 was an excellent wrap up to the series. It is completely Steam Deck compatible. Also...doing sick scooter tricks around the desert is pretty sweet.\n\nThis one is an easy recommendation, and presumably, you will have played the other two games anyway, so you'll want to finish the series.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3067651219\n\n[code]If you found this review helpful and would be interested in supporting my Curator group, it would be appreciated. Cheers.\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/curator/32549618/[/code]\n- I bought the game and the mechanics are fun! The battle system is super impactful and just FEELS fun. It really gives you a sense of satisfaction. And it has interesting elements that really every game should have... but the UI sucks, the classes are genderlocked, and there are so many systems going on at once it's annoying. Like something as simple as a constant notification in the middle of the screen of some other person or random guild you know nothing about doing quests or getting skill points. It's a fun game, but has WAAAY too many minor (except genderlocked classes. Genderlock is never a minor thing) problems that just add up making it annoying to play\n- Mysterious, claustrophobic, and psychedelic --- this is undoubtedly the most unorthodox game in The Legend of Heroes series. This game is basically what you get when you put The Legend of Heroes, Shin Megami Tensei and a certain Silent Hill title [i](which I won't specify for a good reason)[/i] into a blender machine. Nonetheless, it is still very much an LoH game at its core, though its semi-fandisc nature holds it back from being as coherent of an overall package as its two predecessors.\n\nI cannot stress this enough: [b][u]If you were a big fan of the previous two games, you will not necessarily like this game; on the other hand, if you didn't hold them in high regard, this game is still worth trying out due to its stark contrast in tone and structure from its predecessors.[/u][/b] There is a good reason this game is named [u][b]\"the 3rd\"[/b][/u] instead of \"Third Chapter\", because it is definitely not a direct continuation of SC (i.e. Trails in the Sky Second Chapter).\n\nIf you want more of the upbeat, kingdom-trotting adventure of the previous two games, you're not going to find it here.\n\nIf you want towns full of vibrant NPCs, you're not going to find it here (at least not in the main story).\n\nIf you want a protagonist who wears their heart on their sleeves and acts like your typical spunky JRPG hero, you're not going to find it here.\n\nThis game is first and foremost [u][b]a gameplay-heavy dungeon crawler[/b][/u], one that is light on (main) story but carries some very heavy themes. The most interesting aspect of the game to me is that [i][b]the protagonist Kevin Graham is not a hero[/b][/i] (which is ironic considering the name of this series). This game is his harrowing personal journey, one in which he doesn't set out to save the world, his homeland, or anyone for that matter.\n\nThere are initially only two playable characters, but more and more join your party at a steady pace throughout the game [b](16 in total)[/b]. Be sure to talk to these characters when you swap them out of your party; they are ironically the only source of \"NPC dialogue\" for the majority of the game, and their dialogue updates after every plot point like in most other Falcom games. You know Falcom has done their NPCs justice in FC&SC when their complete absence here creates an uneasy sense of isolation.\n\nThere are visual-novel-like sidequests (called Memory Doors) which serve to further flesh out the characters and setting of this series, giving all the playable (and some non-playable) characters their own spotlight to shine in. To this day the cast of Trails in the Sky still remains my favorite cast of any RPG, and I have to give a good chunk of the credit to this game's characterization of them.\n\nThese sidequests take up a sizeable chunk of the game, which one might argue distract from the dungeon-crawling main game. Fortunately, they don't expire like in FC&SC and can be accessed at any point in the game before the final dungeon (with convenient fast-travel to boot), effectively enabling the player to pace the game themselves. \n\nWord of warning though, some of these sidequests take on a much darker tone than one would expect: there's a very good reason why the console versions of this game was censored [i](don't worry, the Steam version isn't)[/i]. Please be mentally prepared for the final sidequest you come across in the game, i.e. [spoiler]Star Door 15[/spoiler].\n\nThere is also plenty of foreshadowing for the rest of the series littered throughout the game, some obvious and some very subtle [i](I'm looking at you Mr. N)[/i]. Needless to say, this game gives you lots to think about if you are into the lore of this series, especially if you have played some of the later Trails games.\n\nOh, and did I mention that the soundtrack is widely regarded as the best in the trilogy?\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nTo end on a more critical note, I'd like to elucidate the \"semi-fandisc\" nature of this game:\n\nThere is severe disconnect between the main story and side content, with the latter adding nothing to the former for the most part; the sidequests are more of an anthology of supplementary material for the entire Trails series and are only tenuously tied to the main campaign, which by itself is sparse in story.\n\nThere is also an egregious amount of asset recycling from the previous two games. Although this is mostly justified within the context of the story, it's still vexing and makes the devs look lazy. They had the opportunity to add a lot of interesting new locales, especially those pertaining to Kevin and the church, but they chose not to for the majority of the game. Get ready to traverse through lots of familiar looking areas and dungeons...\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nP.S. Advice for 1st playthrough: If you are here mostly to enjoy the story, don't play on Hard; if you value your sanity as a gamer, don't play on Nightmare. Seriously, don't.\n\nP.S.2 When you first open up the game, don't skip the \"Falcom\" logo animation; just sit back and watch. There's a bit more after that.\n\nP.S.3 If you're really curious as to which Silent Hill title I was comparing this game to, potential spoilers if you are familiar with the SH franchise: [spoiler]Silent Hill 2[/spoiler]. Just how deep the similarities run between these two games, I'll let you find out for yourself.\n\nP.S.4 A bit more on the censorship of this game: Falcom cut out large chunks of the aforementioned final sidequest when porting the 3rd from PC to the Sony consoles (PSP, PS3, and PSVita). They did this in order to keep the age rating consistent across the Sky trilogy; the PC version of the 3rd would undoubtedly have been rated \"M\" had it gone through ESRB. If you need a list of potentially distressing content in this game, feel free to PM me.\n- I really liked the concept of this game of navigating through orbits to collect crates and then successfully landing on the exit.  However, there just isn't enough content to justify it being sold as a complete product, especially at its current price of $6.99.  You see everything there is in the first couple of levels.  No new mechanics are added to the game as you progress.  The developer admits that the game is too simple and the fix was to add artificial difficulty to make the game longer.  For instance, rather than have intuitive controls using toggles, it requires the player to activate thrusters with one hand and turn them off with another.  The level design stops adding anything new and just adds more tedious narrow paths that must be navigated rather than an actual challenge or puzzles.  Finally, the DLC appears to be “pay to win” rather than getting any new content, it just gives the player access to aircraft that should be included already in the game.  By level 9 it is near impossible to progress any further with the default ship as it cannot accelerate fast enough to get through the small orbit and requires purchasing the DLC to advance the level.\n- [h1]A game meant to bring back memories that is similar to Super Mario World on the SNES and it does this with relatively few gameplay and gimmick elements.

After all, it has to be ready for take-off in order for children everywhere to receive their presents on schedule. But a wicked troll blasts us out of the sky just as the test drive is about to end. He went over the line and wants to ruin Christmas for everyone on Earth. It is up to us to bring the troll to his senses and save Christmas for everyone.\n\nTLoS brings players to one world and six levels of great platforming that are reminiscent of Super Mario World (SNES) but simplified. There are only six levels total, one of which is a castle, before the final battle with the troll. The only difference is that we will be collecting chocolate cookies rather than the traditional yellow coins. We also lose part of our cloak when we are injured, so it's not uncommon for you to find yourself jumping through the levels wearing nothing but red boxer shorts. For instance, red blocks can give you a new coat, which means extra life, or Santa socks and hats, which give a power-up or simply chocolate cookies. The power-up allows you to throw stones as if you had collected the Fire Flower from Super Mario, and that's about it. TLoS also offers a 2-4 co-op player mode, in which players will be able to work together to complete this short and family-friendly adventure.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3009359595\n\nSimilar to Super Mario World, you walk to a level to choose them in the Overworld. Once we reach a certain level, we are allowed to walk, leap, and even sprint. Additionally, there are other indications on the screen that show you how many cookies you have already gathered and how much time is remaining to finish the level. We get an extra life when 100 cookies are collected. We can activate a checkpoint about halfway through the level to pick up exactly where the checkpoint was reached, instead of having to do the entire level all over again. The game also features side-scrolling and underwater levels. The only problem is that if you quit at level three, close the game and start again, you have to start from level one, so you have to play the game in one go. This means that there are no save points or \"save states\". Considering the length of the game, this is not a big deal, but it's still \"annoying\".\n\n[h3] My Specs [/h3]\n\n[code]CPU: i9 9900k\nGPU: RTX 2080 Ti\nRAM: DDR4 32 GB RAM\nOS: Win10\nResolution: 1440p @144hz\n[/code]\n\n[h3] Conclusion [/h3]\n\nWe are all hoping that Nintendo will release their IPs on Steam so that we can play with them one more time. We may all agree, based on experience, that this is probably never going to happen, but Indie developers are there to make it happen. To avoid the tedious teachings at school, you used to be able to play these types of games in class on the usual Flash Player websites, and now you can play them on Steam. Though it's not a masterpiece, it's extremely minimalistic, and it's unquestionably too short, the 20 minutes I spent playing it were nevertheless a lot of fun, especially because the platforming is accurate and not wonky at all. Just remember, it's very minimalistic and may be too minimalistic for some, but if that doesn't bother you, feel free to go ahead and try it out.\n\nIt would be my personal highlight if there were additional levels, more secret exits, more power-up alternatives, and more hours of overall playtime.\n\n[h2] Final Verdict: 8/10 A typical gas station snack that turns out to be a surprisingly good one.🎅 [/h2]\n- Disclaimer: This is review from player who prefer story-rich game and haven't played any game by Arkhouse Telegraph.\n\nThe good:\n+ Outstanding 80's-esque visual pixel artstyle. It reminds me of few SNES/Atari/Gameboy games.\n+ Fairly good soundtrack.\n+ Some cutscene/area have fascinating atmosphere.\n+ Run well with Steam proton, so it's likely this game is playable for Linux/Steam Deck user. Although the platformer area might show too many small detail for 7\" display.\n+ Game OST/artbook is available for free on Arkhouse website.\n\nThe bad:\n- While i understand nature of this game require player to find out most thing and go through trial-and-error, some parts definitely need to be explained better. I refer to lack of autosave (for most part of the game), not letting player know about manual save (you can do it by head left after exit for cylinder elevator until you see display/sign \"< S\" and suggestion to visit block H (where you get some guidance).\n- While the manual say i can play R. U. N. E. 3000 first, i have hard time understanding the story and lore/world building. Conversation such as \"DO? DORODO!\" is mostly gibberish and i only can make vague guess based on few specific term (\"V2\", \"50/50\", etc.) and area i've visited. Short recap of previous games (even it's on the manual) could be really helpful for newcomers.\n\nThe ugly:\n* I experience a bug where i fight boss i'm not supposed to fight yet. In detail, [spoiler] after i exit from P block to get symbol cracking code, i was thrown to G block where i fight G-Cat/10th boss. The worst part is the boss HP bar started with red color and auto 3-60 cannon never perform attack. Fortunately the bug doesn't occur again after i load from manual save.  [/spoiler].\n* The gameplay variation/idea is very interesting, but the execution is mixed bags (more explanation on below paragraph)\n\nSaturn Quest: R. U. N. E. 3000 has lots of gameplay variant/modes (Adventure, Shoot'em up, Platformer and many more) to keep the game fresh. While each area/boss have different reason why it's challenging/difficult, many of those is very unbalanced. For example, [spoiler] Bioplatus M-3D/6th boss [/spoiler] require you to have extraordinary eye-hand coordination and multitasking skill. Among all enemy that resemble boss fight, i only managed to beat 6-7 boss without using cheat.\n\nThis game also has very few checkpoint on each area/boss. On adventure/platformer area, you could restart from beginning after spending 10-20 minutes where you have to avoid same trap or collect same item again. On boss fight, that means you'll need to repeat whole fight most of the time. It's could be annoying because since you're forced to find out boss behavior the hard way or repeating tedious part of the fight.\n\n3 HP and lack of difficulty option could be irritating for most modern player. There are time when i found out i only lose 3-10 HP when i use cheat and beat the boss. If there's easier difficulty where i have 6-10 HP, i could beat more boss by myself. But don't get me wrong, i feel really satisfied each time i beat boss (which i deemed can be beaten with practical amount of effort) without cheat. If the developer bother add easy difficulty which has higher player HP, give more Nana and slightly lower boss HP, far more people could enjoy this unique piece of artwork.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nWhile i have some rant, it's really unique experience even though i've played few hundred games. In overall, i have more positive sentiment than negative sentiment of this game. But even though i choose \"Yes\" when Steam ask \"Do you recommend this game?\", i'd rather choose \"Neutral\" or \"Information\" instead. If you're fan of 80's game or really like difficult game, you might come to like this game. But for most people, i'd recommend you to seek other game. Although if you really insist to play this game, you could use Cheat Engine and modify HP/Nana using value type Double (also called float64 or 8-byte float).\n\nP.S. I definitely will play the sequel (Episode IV-VI: White Meteor Saga according to the artbook) [b]IF[/b] the developer bother add easy difficulty option and more checkpoint during boss fight/exploration.\n- Boss fight Heihachi vs Kazuia devil fprm\nThird form, three 1/3 heal and every heal comes with unti-combo breaker. \nGOOD JOB NAMCO ON GAMEDISGNE WITH DIFFICULTY BALLANCE! \n\nI love the game but this is bullshit, and this should be fixed for the sake of u know,\nEven Ork, even doctor in third tekken was easier\n(Difficulty: Medium)\n\nEverything else is good though\n- A fun game for drinking parties, take a shot every time you feel like you just wasted 19 cents.\n- It's a puzzle game about placing toppings onto donuts and delivering them to different areas on the boar. Great vibe and the first few hours are fun, but it gets incredibly repetitive even with the frequent introduction of new mechanics, especially so if you don't click with said mechanics particularly well. If it's on sale, give it a go - you very well might like it much more than I did.\n- I have it on the Epic store but the amount of stuttering it has made it unplayable so I gave up. I got the Humble choice for $6 to get a steam key and try it on here because I have a few games on steam that run well but run poorly on other platforms like the awful Windows store or the below average Epic launcher, but it's unfortunately the same deal on here for this game. It has done it on two entirely different computer setups for me so that tells me that they didn't bother to spend enough time testing enough different pc setup combinations when it was in development, and my pc setup isn't rare by any means. The look and functioning of the UI and menu's shows that it is a obvious direct console port which would explain their lack of attention to the pc version.\n\nEven giving it a fair shot based on content, it's pretty much just a modified version of Borderlands 2. The amount of dialogue is unbearable. No one in the game EVER shuts up, and every single last word they say is cringe. It's like a kid in fifth grade who laughs at fart jokes wrote the entire script. In addition to everyone never shutting up, the main boss randomly has page-long speeches over the radio just to make sure you get the message that they want you to feel entirely uncomfortable at this game's bottomless amount of cringe.\n\nThe gameplay is identical to BL2, with the only real new noticeable features being that some guns have two functions that you can toggle on and off with the C key and of course the new playable characters. However even without the stuttering ruining the game for me, it's my opinion that BL3's negatives, mainly the insane amount of neverending dialogue and how unbelievably cringe it is, overshadow its positives.\n- Heard joke once: Man goes to doctor. Says he's depressed. Says life seems harsh and cruel. Says he feels all alone in a threatening world where what lies ahead is vague and uncertain. Doctor says, \"Treatment is simple. Steam is having a sale tonight. Go buy a game. That should pick you up.\" Man siles. Says to Doctor, \"good idea, Doc! A nice relaxing distraction!\" Man goes home. Man buys DF.\n\nGood joke. Everybody laugh.\n\n\n\nBut seriously, I built a working moat with a remote drainage system control tower and a 4 storey above ground fort, becoming a thriving 200-strong hold of what was once a moribund empire of less than 10 dwarves. 100/10 game that is definitely worth the learning curve.\n- The good:\n+ Great story with satisfying finale.\n+ Endearing main cast/characters.\n+ Great world building meets with 90s Indonesia culture.\n+ Pleasant pixel artstyle. The cutscenes visual is amazing, even though i notice few awkward animation.\n+ Nice soundtrack.\n+ Puzzle is mostly well balanced. Not too difficult and doesn't make you feel bored/annoyed either.\n\nThe bad: - \n\nThe ugly:\n* Some pacing problem. There are so many sidetrack a.k.a. \"To complete sub-task C you also must complete sub-sub-task X, Y and Z\" during chapter 2-4.\n* Sometimes you might have to going around in circles to solve certain task or accidentally skipped something.\n\nDespite few flaws, A Space for the Unbound is definitely best game developed by Mojiken Studio and best story-driven/adventure game among all games created by Indonesian developer. If you like side-scrolling/adventure game (such as GRIS, Unreal Life or Oneshot) or game made by Mojiken Studio/Toge production (such as Coffee Talk or When The Past Was Around), you should give this game a try.\n- I like to think of this game as what a Telltale game should have been.\nReal decisions that have real consequences. Allies who leave you due to the actions you take, betrayal due to dumb decisions. All of which only happen due to the choices you can make.\nBut instead of quicktime events, you play some games of Gwent.\nSome really difficult decisions as well, ones that i had to seriously stop and think about. A couple of stupidly easy ones as well, but i can forgive that.\nAlso some fantastic tongue in cheek references to other games/pop culture that i had some laugh out loud moments.\n\nYou also get to upgrade and customise your deck as you earn new cards along the way and they do that well. Save a <random character so as no spoiler> and convince him to journey with you? You know have access to his cool card (and trust me, there are some really cool cards). \nBut piss him off so he leaves, well his card is no longer available to you. I'm actually convinced ive missed a possible card or two due to some story decisions.\n\nIf there was one thing i think the game lacks, its risk.\nSome people have complained that its too easy, even on the hardest difficulty, which i think has some truth to it, but even that i dont think is the real problem.\nThe real problem is that if you lose a fight, it doesnt let you continue, you just retry till you win.\nSo if the game asks you, do you engage in a risky fight to save some of your trapped soldiers or do you leave them to their fate, you obviously would always choose the risky fight, as there is no punishment to losing the fight. You just keep retrying till you win.\nIt does take the weight away from a bunch of decisions and i also think it takes away that feeling if triumph you should get when you win the difficult fight and save the troops. You literally risked nothing.\nHowever, There are more than enough difficult decisions that have nothing to do with combat that you will still love this game.\nNot sure how they could fix this at this point, since the story is already fairly detailed with branching decisions.\nMaybe something to keep in mind for the next game. Give us fights that if we lose affect the story badly. Make it feel riskier for us to always choose the better path, so we are tempted to choose the easier one and therefore feel good when we succeed the  hard one, or feel the consequences when we fail the harder path.\n\nIs it worth the cost? I honestly think so, I haven't regret the money ive spent so far. Some people complaining its too short for what it costs (based on the 30 hour estimate, not them having actually played it), but for me its a really good quality 30 hours and i wish more games would take note.\nPeople complaining about 30 dollars for 30 hours are the reason Dragon Age Inquisition had 60 hours of useless grindy soul destroying fetch quests instead of being a streamlined, awesome game.\n- First of all, i'd like to mention that i found this game by chance. But it's surprisingly better than some RPGMaker game i've tried and it's not your typical RPGMaker which is surprising since it's developed by one person.\n\n[h2]Story/character[/h2]\nOverall the story is good enough to keep myself immersed with the game. However the story and characters aren't really memorable. For lack of better comparison, it's similar with movie which entertain you but you won't remember it for long time. Although it's probably because i've played many top-rated RPGMaker game which have more budget/resource.\n\n[h2]Gameplay[/h2]\nWhile the developer emphasize this game is story-focused game, i would also describe this game as puzzle-focused RPGMaker game. Store page mention 3 hours, but it took me 9.5 hours to beat this game. Although if i never experience bug (mentioned below) and stuck at one puzzle (where i asked help on Steam discussion), i expect i would spend 7.5 hours.\n\nThe amount and variety of puzzle presented on this game is surprisingly very diverse. Some of them are the best puzzle I've experienced even though I've played fair amount of RPGMaker game. Although few others feels repetitive, difficult due to lack of hint or force you to walk around if you miss/skip something. Lack of option to run/always run is also mildly annoying for me.\n\nAnd since the puzzle of this game is rather challenging/tricky for RPGMaker game, here are few general hints from me in case you're stuck,\n[list]\n    [*]Check for hidden/invisible wall.\n    [*]Try to use items on your inventory.\n    [*]Some interactive object have no impact to solve the puzzle.\n    [*]The game show some hint, usually by highlight/flicker certain object.\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Graphic/music[/h2]\nNothing much to say here. There's few usage of stock RPGMaker asset which used accordingly. The music is nice. While the artstyle/visual is on good side, personally i feel it doesn't match very well with space/sci-fi theme. The cutscene CG also looks good.\n\n[h2]Misc.[/h2]\nThis game runs well on Linux with only minor problem. I experienced one bug which makes me unable to continue the game (not caused by Linux, since it also happen on device which use Windows OS), but the developer fixed it after some time. The game only offer single save file which is annoying to me since i experienced a bug and few puzzle are very tricky.\n\n[h2]Conclusion[/h2]\nOverall Mihirha's Legacy is nice RPGMaker despite few hiccups I've mentioned above. The developer is also responsive to my query which is also plus point. If you're RPGMaker enthusiast, you might want to try this game.\n- This is like, the End of Evangelion of RPGmaker games.\n- 8 years of free updates and counting\nCheap price of $9.99 and frequent sales\nHundreds of hours of gameplay\nA crap load of customization options\nAmazing mod support\nTold Epic Games to go away when they tried to buy them out\n\nHow based can a developer get???\n- \nWell, after almost a year of not playing this game, I must say, the devs did fix most of my issues. *Most*. Creative mode is fun, but you still need to collect stuff to make things, which is incredibly tedious. On top of that, the character dialogue is still really annoying and you need a NASA computer to play at a stable framerate, but hey, you can actually play without getting your ass beat. I'd like to up my ranking to an 8/10. Very fun, but I highly recommend playing with others. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOG REVIEW (outdated):\nThis game has potential, but unfortunately having fun with it is impossible if you aren't a hardcore survivalist.\n\nCritical Issue #1:\nThe main characters won't stop talking. Everytime you eat or hold the torch they say an unfunny one-liner that makes me want to gouge my eyes out with forks. Even Robin Ayou from Subnautica: Below Zero talked less, and the original game had a silent protaganist. Having characters that have constant dialogue that always repeats is just so annoying to the point where I had to turn off the volume. If the main characters were silent but atleast talked with each other, then I could see potential in that. But they just talk and talk and talk and none of it means anything.\n\nCritical Issue #2:\nThe enemies are way too hard to battle. To make better gear, you need to take on enemies that are so difficult to battle. Maybe you could say I'm just not good at battling enemies in survival games, but I was able to easily battle monsters in Terraria, Minecraft, Subnautica and Raft just fine. When your in-game monsters are too hard to defeat without gear that requires you to battle even MORE monsters, it is not fun, repetitive, and frustrating.\n\nCritical Issue #3:\nThe story is in the background. The fact that the story doesn't impact the game as much as it should is probably the worst aspect of any piece of media out there. The game sends you an a goose chase to find the  main story and it is infuriating. The story itself is all over the place. First it just seems like you need to make yourself grow bigger, but then it goes completely off the rails and into this scientist bunker with a robot that gives you quests, but you can ignore him and continue playing. I don't know if they finished the story, but so far it is not good.\n\nSomewhat Critical Issue:\nThere is no setting to dial back the graphics without lowering the resolution to look like Terraria. I can't see, and it is dumb and brings the whole beautiful vibe of being small down, ironically.\n\nMinor Issues:\nThe music is bland, and although I love electronic/synth music, this is just not it. The fact that you can't have bugs as pets or mounts, or even herd them is extremely upsetting. The farming sucks ass, it gives you 4 items of what you grew every 2 in-game days, when you can just find that item in more abundance at the place where it is located. Under the pond... JESUS CHRIST, the graphics are so bad. The wavy filter looks so bad, and you can see the entire underwater area crystal f**king clear, even though other smaller bodies of water have some kind of murkiness to it. Minor issues like this hold back the game.\n\nAlthough this is still in early access, it feels as if they wasted a lot of potential already. For such a unique world and concept, it never really exploits the amazing and obvious things that it can accomplish. Why not grow your own personal army of ants? Oh sorry, you can pick up eggs but they hatch and they aren't friendly. Why not create a raft made of weed stems and lilypads? Oh sorry, you can just build a base that looks like a boat. Although there are much worse steam games out there, and ones that I have hated more than this, this was sort of a slap to the face. It's not god-awful, and there are a lot of good things about it like the cartoony bug designs and the beautiful graphics, but honestly, it's a 6/10 bordering on a 7, and although many others have enjoyed this, being the super critical demogorgon that I am, this didn't exactly \"ground\" me.\n- This game is basically awesome, under 3 conditions:\n\n1- You get rid of all on-screen icons (i.e. incoming attacks, ennemy spotting)\n2- Do not care about secondary missions only here to further lenghten the game's lifespan\n3- Play the game as you would if  YOU were in charge\n\nBasically, nevermind the Ubisoft micro transactions' system and other abhorrent company induced  greed-leaned system to get stuff faster and more easily by robbing you out of your hard-earned cash...you can finish the game without spending a single dime in the store, it's all pay to win...\nThe open-world aspect is very satisfying and rewarding, in terms of progression, don't fall for the micro transaction system\nCombat is easy even in the highest difficulty setting, but makes you think you are badass when you slash through waves of ennemies, whose AI is rather basic, with your arsenal of rockets, LMGs and explosives but it is satisfying as fuck!\n\nImagine strapping C4 to your plane, jump out of it, have it crashing down an ennemy outpost meanwhile you are parachuting down and throwing hand grenades their way, land on a roof and eliminate the remaining ennemies with fire ammo shotgun and a motherfucking M60 with armor-piercing bullets while throwing dynamites and there you have it...FarCry5 in a nutshell\n\nOh and don't forget about the flame-thrower lol, who doesn't love a flame-thrower scorching ennemies to their own demise eh?\n\nFarCry5 got it all, extreme freedom of how you wanna handle a situation (stealthily or all guns blazing) while being challenging enough in the highest difficulty setting!\nP.S. don't forget to turn off all the on-screen icons, really ruins it for hardcore FPS fans by making it extremely easy, please hear me out, you don't need these!\n- Great gameplay with baaad user experience. There are no tooltips or explanations as to what is going on at all, just kinda gotta figure it out. Otherwise the gameplay is smooth and there's a climb mode called spiral, slay the spire style, very fun. 5 different classes all able to level their decks and get new cards and abilities until lvl 30 I think, got my enchantress to 20 but still more to go. Story mode is more of a tutorial but still interesting.\n- Great game, Horrible new publishers who stole the IP from the original creators. Do not support these thieves\n- Great Game, play the Demo instead of reading reviews.\n- Horrible game couldn't learn how to drift in 13 hours i was using a wheel btw apparently its harder but like wheel is cool I'm not gonna play it on controller that's lame. My dad also couldn't drift either and he knows how to drift irl. I also cant get a refund because i spent so long try to drift :(\n- This is easily one of the funniest games I played in 2017.  In the 20 hours it took me to solve it the first time, I pretty much did nothing else until I had finished it, despite the fact that I was supposed to be studying.\n\nThe game is set in absurd western themed world where humour is so baked into the fabric of everything that there is virtually nothing that isn't some kind of joke.  This could easily fall flat if it were poorly written, but I found the writing to be fantastic.  Obviouslly humour is subjective so if you aren't onboard with it's humour you proably won't get much out of it.  For everyone else you are due for a hell of a ride as the game is an absolute hoot.\n\nThe game takes place in a kind of openinsh world with your character setting out from a location on their horse. You can either select to \"Wander\" in which case you will make a broad loop out and around, potentially unovering new map locations or encountering a random encounter.  You can also direct travel to locations you have found and will also be told about map locations from NPC's or as the outcomes of various quests.    The world is feels quite expansive with a lot of interesting locations to explore.  There are a couple of central plot quests to pursue and a bunch of side quests as well.  In my 20 hour playthrough I managed to complete the main story but still had a few side things Id managed to miss all the clues for.\n\nCombat in the game takes place in a turn based format that should feel familiar to anyone has played a JRPG before.  You stand on one side, your foes tand on the other and you select your various attacks and abilities from a list specific to each characters class.  As you gain XP  you can choose what skills you buy so you can tailor your character to your play style, with higher skill levels costing increasing amounts of XP.  You can further personalise your character with a swathe of various equiment, almost all of which is humorous and absurd.  The combat is not particularly complex but its good enough and the humour is so good that it really does the heavy lifting for keeping you engaged.\n\nAs you can see from the screenshots the graphics portray everything in stick figures, but everything is surpisingly detailed and the great animation and the little touches really add to the charm of world.  A still screenshot doesn't really do justice to how much fun this game is to see in motion.\n\nThe music and sound are suprisingly good too, with twangy guitars and banjos mixed with good old time whistling and other wild west sounding stuffness.  Once again is better than you have any right to expect from such an overtly daft title and between the lively graphics and relelentless humour It's just another layer of polish to draw you into the games odd version of the wild west.\n\nLook I flat out loved this game. It was a delight. As I said, your milage may vary if the humour doesn't tickle your funny bone but I can tell you now, never have I laughed so hard at a game as I did digging through the spitoons in West of Loathing.\n\nGold.\n\n9 out of 10\n- If you are looking for a game that you can never master, here is the game for you.\n- I bought this game in order to review it, seeing as there were no current reviews for it. \nI thought I'd help the game out by maybe giving it that tiny bit of publicity it needed to get off the ground.\nIn doing so I have failed. As this game isn't worth reviewing, there is nothing to review. Well, I should say there is stuff to review but I feel as though the dev's didn't even attempt to make this a game that anyone would enjoy. Well actually I'll let them off of the target of \"enjoy\", I'd go further to say it doesn't even feel like they tried to make a game that someone who had nothing to do and was bored out of their mind would say maybe I'll play this for a bit\nI jumped straight in, ignored the help in menu and started playing. It took me at least 4-5 mins before I even had the slightest concept of what was going on and what I had to achieve. Once I did get the hang of it I still thought \"I must be missing something, I'm not really doing anything\" so I ventured to the help menu to find that nope, thats it buddy.\nThe controls are lacking, the soundtrack and the sound effects (which happen to be a melody playing) do not blend at all, (they play completely out of time on top of the soundtrack).\nYou can buy it and prove me wrong, go ahead. This is just my opinion.\n- EDIT: I nominated this game for game of the year (2023)\n\nLong ago I had heard about this game and how detailed and intricate it could be, and how you could spend hours upon hours building the massive empire of dwarves only for it to all come crashing down in some spectacular but unforeseen way.  Then I got into Rimworld briefly and thought it was ok, but it tended toward chaos a bit too much for my liking.  THEN I heard this game was coming to steam and I eagerly awaited it.\n\nIt's not necessarily that I was too good to play a game with mostly ascii/character graphics (I used to play them a lot back in the 1980s).  I was more intimidated by the depth of the game and not knowing if there was a wiki for it (there is) or how I'd find help if I needed it (I'm sure there's a ton of communities JUST for this game).  I expected that when it came to Steam, it'd be beefed up and worth the wait.\n\nWell it finally arrived and I think I'm STILL a bit intimidated by the sheer amount of options you have... mostly because it's not just me that I have to worry about, but a whole community of dwarves.  In the case of something like minecraft, I could dig a whole intricate tunnel and if stuff starts to go bad, I just high-tail it out of there and recover until I can go back and finish it.  In Dwarf Fortress though, if stuff starts to go bad, you can't just leave.  You are encouraged to deal with the adversity and push onward in the name of greatness... or something.\n\nIn a way it's like role playing, except you don't have to roll character sheets and you don't really control any of the characters directly.  You make decisions about where to mine, what trees to chop down, what to build, what to trade, what to plant, and for every thing there is a season (turn turn turn).  You're forced to deal with death, birth, attacks, sickness, madness, and a ton of other things that I have no idea are coming.  \n\nI keep thinking \"I could do better\" and I start a new game, but then I start to realize that no matter what I do, I'm never gonna have a perfect game, or a game where everything goes exactly according to plan.  I am eventually going to have to buckle down and stick to one game save to see it through.\n\nIf you're like me and starting something new holds a lot more interest than continuing an existing project (ADHD?) you may have difficulty with this game.  At the same time you may become so engrossed in it that you lose track of time and suddenly it's 6am and you wonder why you stayed up all night digging holes.  I'm starting to feel a bit of the madness myself.  (it's almost 4:30am as I write this)\n\nIn any case, it's probably not for everyone, but I'd say if you're unsure, find the non-steam version and try that, and if you can grok what's going on and it interests you, definitely buy this and support the developers... OR buy this and try to stay under the 2 hour refund  limit while you learn the basics (Good luck with that, it'll be 6 hours before you know what happened).  I believe this game is worth the money though (full price).  If you were going to wait for a sale you'd be waiting a long time anyway.  \n\nTL;DR If this looks interesting to you, don't wait! Buy now.  If you aren't sure, do a bit of research and come back and buy it.\n- Even with over 500 years difference between us, Andreas is one of the most relatable characters I've played this year because I too would rather try to ineffectively solve random mysteries than directly confront my depression.\n- [h1]An amazing sequel to Resident Evil 1.\n\nIncluding auto-saves, no more tedious door/room loading transitions, fluid movement controls, new weapons, enemies and more!\n\nThe character models and graphics are absolutely amazing!\nClaire lookin' pretty fire in the red jacket. Reminds you of Zoey from Left4Dead.\n(Although neither were modeled from each other, a total coincidence)\n\nDefinitely more fun than RE:1 in my opinion!\n\n10/10[/h1]\n- Disclaimer: This is review from player who prefer story-rich game and haven't played any game by Arkhouse Telegraph.\n\nThe good:\n+ Outstanding 80's-esque visual pixel artstyle. It reminds me of few SNES/Atari/Gameboy games.\n+ Fairly good soundtrack.\n+ Some cutscene/area have fascinating atmosphere.\n+ Run well with Steam proton, so it's likely this game is playable for Linux/Steam Deck user. Although the platformer area might show too many small detail for 7\" display.\n+ Game OST/artbook is available for free on Arkhouse website.\n\nThe bad:\n- While i understand nature of this game require player to find out most thing and go through trial-and-error, some parts definitely need to be explained better. I refer to lack of autosave (for most part of the game), not letting player know about manual save (you can do it by head left after exit for cylinder elevator until you see display/sign \"< S\" and suggestion to visit block H (where you get some guidance).\n- While the manual say i can play R. U. N. E. 3000 first, i have hard time understanding the story and lore/world building. Conversation such as \"DO? DORODO!\" is mostly gibberish and i only can make vague guess based on few specific term (\"V2\", \"50/50\", etc.) and area i've visited. Short recap of previous games (even it's on the manual) could be really helpful for newcomers.\n\nThe ugly:\n* I experience a bug where i fight boss i'm not supposed to fight yet. In detail, [spoiler] after i exit from P block to get symbol cracking code, i was thrown to G block where i fight G-Cat/10th boss. The worst part is the boss HP bar started with red color and auto 3-60 cannon never perform attack. Fortunately the bug doesn't occur again after i load from manual save.  [/spoiler].\n* The gameplay variation/idea is very interesting, but the execution is mixed bags (more explanation on below paragraph)\n\nSaturn Quest: R. U. N. E. 3000 has lots of gameplay variant/modes (Adventure, Shoot'em up, Platformer and many more) to keep the game fresh. While each area/boss have different reason why it's challenging/difficult, many of those is very unbalanced. For example, [spoiler] Bioplatus M-3D/6th boss [/spoiler] require you to have extraordinary eye-hand coordination and multitasking skill. Among all enemy that resemble boss fight, i only managed to beat 6-7 boss without using cheat.\n\nThis game also has very few checkpoint on each area/boss. On adventure/platformer area, you could restart from beginning after spending 10-20 minutes where you have to avoid same trap or collect same item again. On boss fight, that means you'll need to repeat whole fight most of the time. It's could be annoying because since you're forced to find out boss behavior the hard way or repeating tedious part of the fight.\n\n3 HP and lack of difficulty option could be irritating for most modern player. There are time when i found out i only lose 3-10 HP when i use cheat and beat the boss. If there's easier difficulty where i have 6-10 HP, i could beat more boss by myself. But don't get me wrong, i feel really satisfied each time i beat boss (which i deemed can be beaten with practical amount of effort) without cheat. If the developer bother add easy difficulty which has higher player HP, give more Nana and slightly lower boss HP, far more people could enjoy this unique piece of artwork.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nWhile i have some rant, it's really unique experience even though i've played few hundred games. In overall, i have more positive sentiment than negative sentiment of this game. But even though i choose \"Yes\" when Steam ask \"Do you recommend this game?\", i'd rather choose \"Neutral\" or \"Information\" instead. If you're fan of 80's game or really like difficult game, you might come to like this game. But for most people, i'd recommend you to seek other game. Although if you really insist to play this game, you could use Cheat Engine and modify HP/Nana using value type Double (also called float64 or 8-byte float).\n\nP.S. I definitely will play the sequel (Episode IV-VI: White Meteor Saga according to the artbook) [b]IF[/b] the developer bother add easy difficulty option and more checkpoint during boss fight/exploration.\n- [I received this product for free from a giveaway]. Only played for a short time, but sheesh, it's a bit of a mess both visually and gameplay wise. There's not much I can really say that would differ from what's shown in the trailer (rather crude MS-paint looking drawings with a few short looping backgrounds). You jump when moving right or left, flappy-bird esque, you dodge stuff going across the screen and from the top, which is a bit boring to me, but some may enjoy it more. You also have to go out of the screen to dodge sometimes, but also if you go too far out (who knows how far) you'll die as well. It might be an okay time waster for free (like old flash games), but I wouldn't recommend spending your money on this.\n- Holy fuck. I wish I could recommend this game. I really, really wish I could. But there's just so much frustration with the core experience that kills me, to the point that I cannot see myself going through to the end.\n\nOkay. The graphics, story, music, world design and even some of the small design features are incredible. I don't need to tell anyone that. I love Studio Ghibli, and as a fellow composer, Joe Hisaishi's music. However, the core aspect you probably noticed I left out is the gameplay. Yeah.\n\nThe amount of grind in this game feels unreal, which as a JRPG I wouldn't care about, but the combat system is so utterly meaningless. I saw a review that said something to the effect of - the game works on \"if you find a difficult section, you can't outsmart it, just have to grind until it's not difficult anymore\" and that is the most accurate sentence I've heard about any game. A third of my playtime is grind. The sacrifice of static turn-based combat is the game has a major lack of input from the player, but also a lack of responsiveness when the player actually needs to make quick and smart decisions. For reference, I got up to when the game gives you a dragon and essentially sets you off on a quest for 3 magic macguffin items, where it should open up, but that's when the majority of grind kick in.\n\nImagine you were playing Pokemon, but every evolution resets your level. No hyperbole, it resets the level to 1, and you have to grind it up all again, spending about an hour to get back the stats you lost, which itself is dependant on the evolution actually being worth it (it usually isn't). Not only that. but all the Pokemon you catch also only come at level 1. That is this game. What I find incredibly difficult about this is you have to willingly handicap yourself to progress for an hour, and if you try to evolve your familiars in bulk, you end up with a useless party. This whole system of catching creatures they directly took from Pokemon, meaning they saw how leveling up worked and thought this needed to be changed. It was a very deliberate design decision. Not to mention you often get multiple evolution paths that drastically change play-styles with little to no indicator to what you're actually choosing from.\n\nAs a kid, this game would be too complex with too many systems and options to handle at once. As an adult, I don't have the time to pour hours into a game that so frequently disrespects your time. If this game wasn't animated by Studio Ghibli, it would've been forgotten about quickly. Change my mind.\n- Honestly I've put over 400 hours into 20XX and this game is even better! Even though it's unfinished as of current it's still a fantastic time and truly stands out on it's own.\n- (If you're past a certain age, I can just say that this is Take Two Interactive's \"Bureau 13\" game, except actually done WELL. If not, keep reading.)\n\nTechnobabylon was one of the best games I played in 2017 (yeah I know it came out in 2015, shh). Wadjet Eye has done it again with Unavowed, one of the best games I played in 2018 and an amazing capstone to all of their work so far. You can play this game without having played the Blackwell series, but you'll get a little more out of it if you have.\n\nIt's also a rather dark piece of work, with a tone somewhere between Sleepy Hollow (the TV show) and something like Buffy. Your character (whose gender and former profession are chosen by you) gets possessed and goes on a year-long murderfestival rampage across New York City. Eventually the Unavowed, a brave supernatural-evil-fighting duo show up, and with the body back in your own control you sign up to fight evil with them. \n\nAs the game goes on, you recruit more characters in Bioware style, solve mysteries (all of which center around that year of hell your character went through), make Tough Choices and work to make the city a better place. All in absolutely gorgeous 640x480 resolution pixel art. \n\nThere were a couple of puzzles that slowed me down (the word \"LEGS\" is going to cause me to make faces for weeks) but this mostly flowed very smoothly. If you're at all a fan of past Wadjet Eye creations, this game needs to be in your life. If you're not, it's a good starting place, maybe the best starting place except that its quality might spoil you for the rough patches of past games.\n\nThis game contains some gore, some body/existential horror that might be jarring to some, and a lot of swearing.\n- Would I recommend DBD? ...It's complicated.\n\nDead By Daylight is an unique experience of asymmetric hide and seek/tag with shifting rules. \nIs the game fun? Yes. Is it creative? Yes.\nIs it fair and enjoyable? Well, it depends.\nGames get very intense, and playing as killer is some of the most intense gaming experience I've ever accumulated...\nWhich is where things often go wrong. The survivors seem to have decided that the killers have to honor strict code of rules. Don't use these items, these abilities, or these strategies. If you do, you'll be insulted after the game.\nIf you follow these rules, the odds are that you will spend the game running in literal circles, the survivors will win, t-bag you at the gate and then insult you after the game. I don't know about you, but that kind of ruins the game for me. It is actually kind of amazing how helpless one can feel in this game.\n\nSo to conclude my thoughts; I really like the game, but I also really hate it. I can't recommend it, as every time I fire it up, there is about 50% chance I feel more harassed, than entertained.\nI play a lot of online games, from League of Legends to Tekken, but this is the only one that makes me frequently think: \n\"I should really uninstall this\"\n\nEdit: \nI returned after a long break, and I still kinda like the game. \nHowever, same pattern repeats whenever I return. Eventually, I get teabagged one time too many and uninstall the game. The game is fun, the community could not be much worse. And sadly, that often ruins the experience.\n- I really liked the concept of this game of navigating through orbits to collect crates and then successfully landing on the exit.  However, there just isn't enough content to justify it being sold as a complete product, especially at its current price of $6.99.  You see everything there is in the first couple of levels.  No new mechanics are added to the game as you progress.  The developer admits that the game is too simple and the fix was to add artificial difficulty to make the game longer.  For instance, rather than have intuitive controls using toggles, it requires the player to activate thrusters with one hand and turn them off with another.  The level design stops adding anything new and just adds more tedious narrow paths that must be navigated rather than an actual challenge or puzzles.  Finally, the DLC appears to be “pay to win” rather than getting any new content, it just gives the player access to aircraft that should be included already in the game.  By level 9 it is near impossible to progress any further with the default ship as it cannot accelerate fast enough to get through the small orbit and requires purchasing the DLC to advance the level.\n- Is Duskers a fun game? Yes. Would I recommend it? No, because of one simple reason:\n\nA lack of content with no mod support.\n\nDuskers is a little like No Man's Sky in the sense that the first few hours are filled with fun and wonder, but everything afterwards becomes a disappointment because the game turns out to be far more shallow than it initially seemed. As a player, I yearned to explore more of the randomly generated galaxy in Duskers because I wanted to see what other horrors, mods, and derelict types I would encounter in the empty universe - but in the end, it turned out that there was really very little else to see besides what you find in the first couple of hours. \n\nHere's a quick rundown of where the content was most lacking:\n\n--Enemy types: there's only 4 different enemies. FOUR. They also behave pretty much identically with the exception of the last one.  This was definitely the biggest interest-killer for me. \n\n--Derelict types end up mattering very little. Government A? Salvage C? Military B? It really doesn't change the layout in a particularly noticeable fashion, with the only differences being 1-2 extra ship defense turrets or something like that. \n\nI really, really wanted to give Duskers a thumbs up - I loved the aesthetic, I loved the atmosphere, and I loved the unique command line interface - but unfortunately, after a few hours, I came to realize that there's really just not enough actual content here, and that's heartbreaking for fans of this niche genre like myself.\n\n\n- game is good and perfect graphics but i have a big big problem that the machines like harvesters dosent harvest all the crops and leave a lot behind !! and also sowing and planting machines !!!! what a big problem \n\ni been playing farming simulator since farming simulator 2011 and i never had a problem like this before ..\n\nHELP ME PLEASEEEEE\n\nPlus This game is just like every farm before :) only with a better graphics\n- It's more of a mixed recommendation but the positives outweigh the negatives if you're a returning fan.\n\nEverything in the game that's an adaptation of the original FF7, I love.  It gave me major nostalgia vibes to walk through a gorgeously rendered versions of FF7's environments.  The combat is much more engaging - no more watching a tv show on the side while I button-mash another random encounter.  Many of the big story moments still hit and I found even more to love in the characters based on their performances going beyond text boxes and blocky animations.  Even the music is just top-notch.  The OST will be a mainstay in my playlist for years.  It feels like I'm seeing the old game with fresh eyes and remembering why it made such an impact.\n\nThat said, the new content feels like a filler arc in a beloved anime.  Your character falls into a random hole like 3-4 times, spends 2 hours fighting random baddies, and then walks out like \"right, so back to that thing I was doing.\"  I don't even know if a new player could understand wtf is happening with Sephiroth because he's never really introduced and certain essential events are never explained.  It tries to take some clever left-turns on the plot so returning players have new surprises to enjoy but it often feels pretentious and pointless.  The ending gave me flashbacks to Peter Jackson's Hobbit trilogy because of how unnecessarily forced it was and the sudden cartoon levels of action.\n\nI'm tentatively enthusiastic for the sequel but there's a few troubling signs I hope don't become a trend.\n- In 2013, after 10 years of waiting, the Sim City community of modders, fans, and aficionados rushed out to purchase the fifth installment of Sim City. Ten years is a long time to wait for a game, but people had a lot of faith in Maxis when they announced the title. Long story short, it was a massive dissapointment. Maxis and EA crippled Sim City 5 with DRM, Always On APM, tiny maps, forced origin installation, lacking mod support, no steam support, and a forced multiplayer aspect.  I decided to not purchase the title, so it may have been a decent game, but 2 years later a team of 12 people created a game that does everything maxis insisted was utterly and totaly impossible.  \n\nEverything the mod community did that kept Sim City 4 on the shelves in Wallmarts across America for an entire decade was ignored. Maxis (and to a lesser extent EA) ignored the fans, and gave the people who had kept them in business for twenty years a crippled subpar game.  And for that Maxis is now out of business. They will never make another game, and it is no one's fault but theirs.\n\nNow pretend none of that happened. It's 2013 again, and here it is people: Sim City 5. \n\nThe game balance is a bit on the easy side for veterans of the genre, but the potential map size is ENOURMOUS and customizing your city could fill up years of gameplay time.  The game runs so smoothly with so much going on, it really shows how lazy Maxis was with their approach.  The glass in buildings reflects the sun and the buildings near it, there are dynamic shadows, zoning is back, and it is not 'dumbed down'.  A single tile in this game is twice the size of the alloted map in Sim City, and you can purchase dozens of additional tiles to expand.  The map editor is awesome, the community is thriving, there are mods to do anything you want, and this is the city building game we've all been waiting for.  I can not possibly reccomend this more.\n- The Witch's House has been my most favorite RPG Maker horror game for years and now I have the remaster which I can buy to directly support the developer. Needless to say how good it is so I will only talk about what is changed and what still remains.\nThe game is still suspenseful and very atmospheric. Some people may worry that the updated graphic and engine may take that away but trust me it is still there and not going anywhere.\nSome sound effects/dialogues have been changed beside the graphic which I am not against it at all. Still very like the remaster.\nThe control is still the same which is as clunky as before when you are not used to. I think the developers know that and decided to not change it so I won't complain. Just say it out for you to know because the game is very old so the control is still there in the past with many other RPG maker games.\nI very like the new graphic and I think they deserve much more compliments for this. However, I like the weird-big-eye Viola model and her less hair skinny portrait more. It look weird and funny at the same time. The new model makes her more beautiful but the portrait makes her kinda fat (at least to me).\nThe new hard mode is.... hard that all I can say without spoiler.\nI don't know whether or not I should calll this a remake but at least it is done better than DSR. And Small indie developers should be supported more. May be \"Ib\" will be remastered some days too if this game is success\nThump Up!\n- good game but later missions seem to be less polished ran in multiple bugs when playing as The Son enemies getting stuck in impossible to reach places and for some odd reason some characters have dog killing animations that for the most part are bugged and only work half the time causing an insta death and a retry don't even understand why later in the game you have to do animations to kill dogs as for basically the whole game you don't need to perform animations also seems to have some input lag throughout the whole game but overall its decent and when its on sale you should buy it.\n- [i] THIS MATCH WILL BE RED HOT. HERE GOES [/i]\n\nLord knows what attempt number, and you again hear the ring bell. The level boss keeps laughing, taunting your every failure. The brainwashing music is starting to give you a headache, your eyes are moving on their own, the difficulty is boiling your blood to the very cells and the controller screams for mercy as every retry gets more and more intense. The anger flows and the addicted child in you claims it will be the last try. The reactions become pure instinct, flowing in a quick, relentless succession of moving, shooting and dodging a thousand projectiles. But suddenly, it happens. \n\n[i]A KNOCKOUT![/i] \n“Phew, that was intense...time for the next one!”\n\nThis is the very essence of Cuphead. A punishing yet immensly satisfying game of bullet hell, mixed with a beautiful and just so goddamned perfectly recreated animation technique that will have you wondering what crazy stuff they will make up next. This is a game that yells nostalgia and effort in every moment. It’s a wonderful experience that at every turn you can tell they didn't just put blood, tears, effort and sweat at every second of work for the last years, they put so much LOVE. Love for the past and love for an era long gone but never forgotten.\n\nThe most pure fun I had raging in the whole year. Absolutely recommended to anyone up for a challenge that will give as much as it takes.\n- if you're looking to experience the greatest time travel drama ever made then I really recommend giving it a chance because there is a lot to love here. Steins;Gate: Elite is a great game, every part is animated, which is nice. Many scenes have completely different music and honestly it all fits better. I think it is the best version of Steins;Gate. If you've only watched the anime, this is worth checking out for the additional endings and science themes.\n\nSteins;Gate Elite is a new way to discover the classic story, fusing the anime with the visual novel. El Psy Kongroo, 10/10\n- Hard as balls, fantastic music, great gameplay, and a great premise in the story.  It also has the side benefit of being completely unique, nothing else like it out there at the moment.\n\nA game I keep cursing at, rage quiting, and yet keep coming back to.  Truly rewarding, as the game gets better as you get better.\n\nCan't recommend it enough.\n- Armored Souls Prepare to sigh....\nIf you are a long running fan of this game it's a mixed bag, if you are new to the series you might like it.\n\nFor the new comers this is robots on roller skates, also screw the natural laws of physics because it makes a cool game.  The key to this game is overwhelming fire power and maneuverability. Here's the rub for me I have AC1 and a PS2 to play it on, I have every US release of this game since AC1 to AC4A, I never finished Nine breaker as it was boring. Below are my gripes, my praise, then my mixed bag in order of paragraphs.\n\nFirst the bad: this game is infested with mechanics that are from Dark Souls and have no place in an AC game.  In no order here they are: status effects, stunning other players,  firing hand weapons cause you to stop moving and leave yourself vulnerable,  repair kits (the flasks from souls), being stunned due to poise (or whatever new dumb name they called it), resupply before a boss fight, and 360 shields.  Stats effects build up like they do in dark souls, this is new to the franchise and really has no place in it, I could see heat weapons causing things to over heat more quickly and maybe some other things, the way this is done is so odd, it feels like a multiplayer add on.  Although its fun to stun bosses and other opponents, this is new to the game and feels like it doesn't belong, I can only assume its been added for competitive multi again.  There's always been this idea that traumatic impacts don't hit the pilots in this game, it's just always been like that and considering the tech it make sense. The latter is true for your AC being stunned too.  AC as a series has gone back and fourth on making you stop to fire a BACK mounted weapon unless you had quad legs or a tank base, this game is the first where a hand weapon makes you stop to fire it.  This is an utter anathema to the game in general, maneuverability and quickly timed dodges were always key.  It ruins your ability to stay moving and fight effectively, which also limits the fun in building and designing your AC.  I don't think there is an AC game in the US with \"repair kits\" yet.  I'm not saying get gud we don't need repair kits, but they are just a distraction to me with no added value.  Giving a player a very high health value is not bad, but I makes each engagement more meaningful, I need to keep my HP high, their are may fights I had where I didn't need to bother with them.  Adding to this mess is the boost before a boss fight, they were never announced like this before; whatever HP you had going in was all you got.  This sticks with me, because the most memorable boss in the whole series was the only one I cannot beat: I took too much damage before the boss fight every time, no magic box to helped me out.  For those of you who are curious it was Zinaida in last Ravens, the suicide drones took too much out of me before the battle.  In AC4A and AC4 there were 360 shields, I'm only guessing, but the shields seemed to mitigate damage.  I don't know because don't get hit or kill them fast has always been my basic plan.  In this new one, its just another health bar that exists for reasons... I don't mind the old shield system give up a defensive advantage for things like assault armor blasts.\n\nThe good stuff.  I like the mix of common enemies being easily dispatched, but still being a threat if you are too slow.  Adding to this is the more dangerous commons like the quad leg MT's.  There is a good combat balance here with crazy mini bosses mixed in like the stealth sniper bots. The bosses are big and badass, with some conventions thrown out the window like the bull charging boss not being weak after a charge. I did hate all the boss fights that involved a 360 shield. The world looks great, yup just darn purdy.  The new super fast tank base inspired by a wheel chair is dumbly fun.  The odd addition of quad legs letting you basically hover is novel and adds some depth to the outfitting of an AC.  Keeping reverse joint legs making you jump faster/higher is classic. The more effective AOE weapons on groups feels more strategic or a the very least feels damn cool when you nail three targets with one shot. Finally letting your AC back mount hand weapons and switch to them at the price of a second or two is a massive evolution, I love it, it should have always been there.\n\nSo there some other things that have changed, which I have mixed thoughts about.  There's now a thing with chips that make you more resilient to damage and other RPGesq things, cool I guess, its another reason to do the arena.  I still will kill them all until I am #1. Hidden objects are now in the game, I don't like them, but whatever, first time I have had to google anything on AC game other then where to buy it.  The plot is oddly boring for me, I think that's just me, last game being AC4A. The game announces when you are making a plot altering decision, its ok, but I would like it if the world just reacted to my decisions naturally no banners.  Weak spots on bosses,  ok its a thing, but firing an AT or plasma weapon at something (that isn't a soft spot) does nothing...not matter how many impacts, ehhh fine. \n\nI'm not done with the game, but over all fun.  Quit making armored souls and make Armored Core.  I was here before demon souls and I will be here after whatever souls, but only if you just keep making ARMORED CORE.  Is there a Japanese word for purity of purpose or ideal? I could use it to try and get my point across. \n\n\nP.S. the fan community paint jobs uploaded on line are gold.\n\n- Very calm game with heartwarming moments. Better played with friends. Really brilliant gameplay idea. I just hope it gets a final ending really soon!\n\nEdit: After reaching the ultimate end, I felt bit disappointed. The progress was just straight up boring and uninteresting after years of restarting again and again.\nVery fun game anyways\n- Steam version Review (For veterans coming from the mobile version):\n\nHi everyone! I've been a long time fan, playing the game on mobile since 1.5 (Theory of everything)\nThe Steam version is great, because, PC versions are always better, so if you have the mobile version and you're looking to \"Upgrade\" your game, this is your ticket. I highly disagree with people who try to crack the game. Come on, what are 4 dollars just to support the person who made us this amazing game? With that said, I will list all the pros and cons, comparing to the mobile version:\nPros:\n-Obviously better graphics, the backgrounds look beautiful and the blocks are more detailed, you can also adjust graphics to your prefference, varying from quiality, windowed mode resolution, as well as some other adjustments.\n-The level editor interface is VERY comfortable, there's a shortcut key for EVERYTHING. Nothing compared to Bluestacks. Using the new layers mode, you can classify your objects of the level in groups, for example, you can use one layer for solid blocks, one for decor, one for effects, etc... Incredibly helpful, as this will prevent you from constantly fighting with the game, in order to select an object which is placed in the same location as others.\n-Gameplay is great. Multiple ways to jump, and keys to place and remove checkpoints on practice. Really looking foward to being able to make your own controls scheme on 2.1!\n-2 exclusive icons. 'Cause why not, exclusives are always good.\n-Incredibly faster online performance. On mobile, it' almost impossible to save your progress. On PC it's done quick, songs are downloaded fast, as well as levels.\n-Tired of your phone/tablet running out of battery but you want to keep playing? No longer a problem! Unless you don't pay your electricity service (Higly unlikely) or have laptop (Just play while plugged in).\n\nCons:\n\n-Obviously, this great version cannot be taken on the go, so... Back to mobile GD.\n\nAlas, I'm done. This version is amazing. Recommended 100% to every Geometry Dash mobile player and newcomer as well. Thanks for reading, hope this makes you decide to buy the game!\n10/10 -IGN\n- This game surprised me in how good it was. I had heard about it, like everyone, and also like a lot of people I had dismissed it as a watered-down Dark Souls clone with a Star Wars skin, and let it collect dust in my Steam collection.\n\nI was wrong. The game's combat is tight and polished, just the right difficulty on Normal. The movement, the general game feel, is superb. The game has a competent story with excellent characterizations, character arcs, dialogue, exposition, world-building, and pacing.  The music feels like top-shelf Star Wars without being a lazy copypasta of John Williams's score (though you'll hear sprinklings of familiar motifs throughout, of course). \n\nThere are collectibles (they are all cosmetics), but it's a tasteful, reasonable amount of them, and they are distributed in a way that feels fun instead of like a chore, and you're never pressured into collecting them with menus or reminders; they are entirely optional in both a technical and a psychological sense. I actually found it fun to collect new appearances in order to play dress-up \"Fashion Souls\". \n\nThere are bosses, and they are challenging but not frustrating. Definitely easier than Dark Souls's harder bosses like Ornstein or Artorias, but still tricky enough that it feels rewarding to overcome them.\n\nIf I had to describe this game in two words, it would be \"just right\". There is just the right amount of each little element that it feels fun, never tedious, never like a grind. I'm a jaded old man who has seen it all and who is not easy to entertain, and I found this game extremely refreshing. If you read this review during the sale where it's only 3.99 USD, get it immediately.\n- [h1]After over 600 hours (played a few months extra via gamepass), im ready to drop a 'goodbye' review[/h1]\n\n\nI've bought this game knowing what im getting myself into, as i was playing FH4 for roughly 500 hours, being in a discord community that is very engaging with the game and players and is in an overall high quality, it made me want to keep playing both Forzas for way more time than initially intended, so im really grateful to these discord groups and their staff and members for this reason.\nWith that being being said, playing on your own will make your experience way quicker to be burnt out than with a community (and i aint talking about co-op convoys, but just getting more content by other players you can befriend with and talk to online). Community-wise, the game feels kinda the same like GTA V online, where you're dropped into an unnamed massive server with random players around you, yet arent given enough tools to properly communicate with them. Add to that, the horrendous platform that is called MS store / Xbox console companion that feels so damn clunky that even befriending and chatting with other friends is a gauntlet on its own, and makes you feel like you really need to find an actual community on a 3rd party platform (discord is generally ideal for this), or else you're being left to play alone even if the game is in online mode. These hurdles can be felt regardless if playing the Steam version or MS version, as making a MS account is necessary for this game to work and be connected online.\n\n[b]Ok, enough chatter about friends. . . .[/b]\n\n\nThe game itself is great and welcoming for the car newbs and car nuts alike, and no matter where you are on the car spectrum IRL and in the gaming world, you will feel the fun of this game especially if this is your first or 2nd Forza Horizon experience (i.e - you havent played FH 1-3). FH4 was quite similar to this one but had a lot more passion put into it, while FH5 has been given lots of QoL updates over its predecessors. Things like increased amount of props and the ability to put props in route creation so now you can design your own tracks with props involved, turning this game into a gmod-like experience if you're so inclined, alongside adding 'rules' to the driving experience, turning any typical race into a minigame of its own, with different objectives than just 'finish first'.\n[b]Important side note - [/b]This game is mostly for arcade fun and not designed for sim racing in mind, meaning that any gripes you have about its physics, sound, lack of competitiveness, etc, are quite redundant as there is always a fragile balance between fun and realism. Also, this game will not fulfill your mid 2000's NFS vibes, at all. This game is its own sub-genre of sorts and is less about weeb car upgrades (tho there are plentiful overall) and nitro, and more about car veriety and making new builds.\n\nThe game is structured with a playlist system - Each month is divided into 4 seasons (4 seasons per month - one per week). The months are called 'series' which the game devs are pushing into the game, and you have a month-long content to enjoy, with a weekly 'reset' time for each season (happening every thursday afternoon). Each month has its own theme, e.g - japanese cars, offroad racing, classic cars,  high performance track cars, etc. Each week (season) you get a new playlist of objectives to do (this is generally referred to as 'the weekly grind') like certain tournaments and other stuff. Playing with no pause would take you about 5-10 hours to finish an entire weekly playlist, in a typical non tryhardy playstyle.\n\n[b]Other content in this game[/b]\n\n* Over 700 cars in total, and more are being added every month with new (free) updates.\n* A spacious open world map of Mexico where you can drive freely with other players, (randoms or friends), either as freeroam or as a grouped convoy.\n* Co-op mode with random lobbies or friends you invite ahead of time.\n* Online racing, when you're playing against upto 11 other players (no bots) in typical fashion racing for xp and money (in game currency, called cr for short).\n* Community-made tracks - This is where the real fun begins especially if you're a member of a group that delivers high quality custom tracks. These tracks can have any theme in them like high/low performance cars, any road type, etc.\n* Auction house - You can buy and sell cars in an auction with other players.\n* Forza-official radio stations with genres like EDM, pop music, hip hop, rock, and lots of latina-based music.\n* Community livery and tunes - You can create and share your own car tunes and liveries and take others' from the community database.\n* Countless other minigames like capture the flag, zombies, super7 (custom objective-based challenges), and even a full scale battle royale mode.\n\n\n[b]My GamerTag is Avees128, so check out my custom tracks / tunes if you feel like it![/b]\n\n\n\n[b]Game versions and DLC expansions - Which to buy?[/b]\n\nThis game has 3 versions - Standard, Deluxe, and Premium. In general, you should only be thinking to buy either the standard or the premium version, as the deluxe only gives the (base game and) car pass, which is a free access to a bunch of some other cars you could eventually get in game anyway, without paying for that game version. The premium version of the game also adds some other meaningless car packs and (more importantly) 2 expansion maps.\nNow, you could see the fairly negative reviews these 2 expansions (Hot Wheels and Rally Adventure) have on steam, and this is because the reviewers have compared these DLC's to the DLC's from the past FH games, which were objectively superior to these current ones in most ways. Do you care about Hot Wheels at all? If no, skip it. Are you a rally fanatic? If no, then skip this one as well.\nImo, these 2 DLC's dont give an enjoyable content (and im not even a fan of HW nor Rally), especially when being compared to the past DLC's from FH4 (personally played and loved every inch of it) and FH3 (have not played at all but i only hear positive things about it and its DLC's - which ironically, one of them was HW).\n\n\n[b]Performance - [/b]I have a Ryzen 9 5900x + AMD RX 5700xt. When testing the built-in benchmark a year ago, i was getting the following results:\n\n1080p high - 113 FPS\n1080p ultra - 79 FPS\n1440p high - 99 FPS\n1440p ultra - 69 FPS (nice)\n\nUpscaling (FSR/DLSS) in this game is really bad, both for AMD and nVidia tech, so avoid these if you can. I cant comment on Ray Tracing since i cant run any RT features with my GPU, but from what i can tell, its minimal RT at best (which also means minimal performance drops). The game really loves Smart Access Memory / reBAR, so make sure you have it enabled if you can for a great fps boost of about 20% !.\n\n\n[b]In conclusion - [/b]The game itself is great and is a legit time sink (for better and for worse), but if you're not engaged in a welcoming community, it will be a relatively short amount of time (50-100ish hours till you'll feel exhausted from the endless grind of everything, so bare that in mind). If you're unsure if this game fits your flavor of racing game, i would either opt for the standard version or just try it out via gamepass and see how it feels like (just note that there are NO cross saves between the MS store platform and steam, so you will need to start over if you're switching between versions!).\n- After almost 300 hours in-game, I might be qualified to review this. I'll start by saying that Larian has really got something special here. I'm glad that the work is ongoing, but the progress is palpable. I've broken down my review into a couple sections to hopefully give you a better idea of what you can expect.\n\n1. Graphics\nBG3 has the best graphics in any CRPG I've played up until this point. The animations still need work, as there are a number of cutscenes where things and characters are misplaced. However, environments, spell effects, equipment, characters, etc., are all meticulously designed and you can rest assured that Larian has painstakingly made even the most inconsequential NPC stand out.\n\n2. Sound\nThe sound design is fantastic. Each spell and weapon attack has a unique sound. The ambient sounds are distinct with each area you are located in, as well as the soundtrack. The soundtrack, in general, is well composed. I could sit on the title screen and just listen to the opening song for a long time. The voice acting is fantastic, especially the narrator. The only issue that I've found with the sound is similar to that of graphical bugs: cutscenes need polish. Sometimes characters don't properly voice their lines when cued. If there is a large fight going on with many different effects at once, some new effects may not properly play either.\n\n3. Story\nNot a whole lot of tied up loose ends story-wise as of yet. However, the intro scene is phenomenal. Probably the best intro cutscene in just about any game I've played. From there, the story picks up on a grand scale, then drops you off in the  starting area. You then begin to pick up the pieces to figure out what is going on and how to best solve your little problem. The storyline so far as what's available in EA isn't overly complex, but the particularly enticing part about it is the number of other smaller plots and characters which lend to the main. Over the course of my playthrough, I've picked up several potential paths which could ultimately be taken probably closer to the midpoint of the finished game. \n\n4. Characters\nI'll keep this one brief, but I just want to take a second to say that all of the characters are very well fleshed out and distinct. Even simple NPC's have personalities which, for the most part, don't strike me as cookie cutter in any way. Care has been taken into writing seemingly each and every character, even many animals and corpses. Many actions you take have an effect on your party's opinion of you, but each character has different preferences. Some party members, however, are a tough to nail down as to what makes them happy, even after almost 300 hours. The personality differences between what is expressed through character dialogue and what changes their opinion of your character can feel a bit inconsistent.\n\n5. Combat\nThe combat is fun and rewarding. Each action you take feels as if it has a distinct impact on the battle. This is partially due to the aforementioned animation and sound effects, very punchy and flashy, lots of pretty colors. This is also thanks, in part, to the combat system adopted from 5th ed. D&D. The die rolls, while not visible during combat, add quite a bit of tension and strategy to a fight. You can't just fling cantrips and spells willy-nilly at random enemies and expect to come out on top (for the most part). The balancing is done well enough to allow for a fair fight, but one that doesn't hold your hand throughout and is rewarding when you win. The world design is also done so well that, anywhere a fight could possibly break out (you can attack/kill anyone), the environment lends a lot of variation and strategy to the fight. The enemies are also very smart, to the point where they will flank and take the high ground on you. Stay frosty!\n\n6. Exploration\nExpanding on the final point of the Combat section, the world design makes Faerun feel alive. There is usually something to find around every corner; exploration is very rewarding. Exploration is rewarded in a few different ways. You can get unique loot (while not necessarily as distinct as titles such as Elden Ring, there is a good variety of equipment to find), find interesting social encounters, or battles. Furthermore, battles can be turned to social encounters or vice versa. The versatility in how the player overcomes different situations is very well thought out. My main grip with the exploration is a personal one, but it's the map. It can get sort of tedious trying to navigate the world using the map. But, the exploration area is not particularly sprawling, so you won't be caught wandering around looking for a particular area for too long. A few important items for side quests also come to mind as being particularly hard to find, as they don't really stand out from the background. But, holding Left ALT will bring up titles for items lying around the area if you want to go that route.\n\n7. Races/Classes\nThe current races available are as follows: drow, human, githyanki, dwarf, elf, half elf, halfling, gnome, and tiefling. The classes are fighter, wizard, rogue, ranger, cleric, warlock, druid, sorcerer, warlock, and bard. Larian has done a good job distinguishing each race and class from one another, whether the customization options or progression. The only issue that I have is that the full PHB selection is not yet available. There are subraces available for each race, each with differing characteristics from another. The subclasses are all very self explanatory, if you are familiar with the 5th edition Player's Handbook. A few names had to be changed for certain things within classes, probably due to licensing issues. Also no multiclassing as of just yet. Curious to see if they decide to patch that one in.\n\n8. Character Creation (Visual)\nKind of simplistic at this point. There are no sliders which allow to you to sculpt the face or body, although there are a fair number of preset faces. A good number of hairstyles and facial hair options, as well as colors to apply. And yes, you can apply beards to female dwarves (lookin' at you, Rings of Power).\n\n9. Progression\nSimilar progression to 5e, except that there are several events which grant XP other than just slaying your enemies. Now comes the main problem I have with EA, the level cap. The world is very well designed and very dense, each action you take for the most part feels well rewarded with XP. But, a full playthrough of all the content could see you sitting at 4th level for several hours before completing. This is especially frustrating because 5th level is when you get your second attack and 3rd level spells. But the loot in the game still allows for a little more variety as it does continue to progress in power/utility even up until the end.\n\n10. Optimization\nI run this on a pretty mid-system (Ryzen 5, 1660ti, 16gb RAM) and I can hold between 50-60 fps when exploring on high settings. When in a busier fight, my fps ranges from 35-45 ish. There are a few bugs which impact functionality (dialogue not displaying during conversation, getting stuck on a character's turn during combat, random crashes, etc.). Luckily, these have all vastly reduced in frequency. While the gameplay is by no means flawless, it has reduced frequency enough to where it's not so bothersome as to ruin the game for me. Just depends on your bug tolerance. If you're a Bethesda fan, you'll be just fine.\n\nJust a final thought before I end this thing. If you just want to experience something different and don't mind playing a work in progress, this game is for you. Larian is fantastic at listening to user feedback for optimization to things as small as simple tooltips. If you want a full experience (and I 100% would not blame you if that were the case), just wait until it comes out. Hoping for early-mid '23.\n- [b][i]AMID EVIL[/i] is very much [i]Quake[/i] 1 level design in a [i]Hexen[/i]/[i]Heretic[/i] universe.[/b] It's well done. We're a bit spoiled this year with outstanding '90s FPS shooters. Personally, I prefer both [i]Ion Maiden[/i] and [i]DUSK[/i] over this title for the following reasons:\n\n1) I find [i]AMID EVIL[/i] to be a bit generic in terms of theme; the fantasy setting could use a bit more to set it apart.\n\n2) I prefer real or low fantasy weapons/guns over wands and totally high fantasy weapons. Now, don't get it twisted - I appreciate that these high fantasy weapons exist, but yeah, they leave something to be desired. I miss reloading and all of that. \n\n3) The level design in [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is much more 'sprawling' (for lack of a better term) just like the original [i]Quake[/i]. Most levels are indoors in what feels like an underground compound (at the time of writing this review). I personally like the backwoods feel of [i]DUSK[/i], or the dystopian cityscape of [i]Ion Maiden[/i] far more. I want to look up at the sky in most levels.\n\n4) The enemy design is different than the other two games I mention, which is good - but they all mostly have a 'same' kind of feel. The enemies are all super fast, so most of your efforts are focused on running backwards while fending them off. It's fun, but gunplay isn't quite as fun as the other two games for this particular reason.\n\n5) The font and overall menu system definitely feels 'Early Access'. I know the font is being worked on, which is desperately needed. \n\n6) My favorite way to play the game is Endless mode - and I feel like that's a flaw in itself. It's the opposite for me with [i]DUSK[/i]. I want to fall in love with the campaign, but eh, there isn't really any story or anything all that interesting to suck me in. The secrets are super easy to find compared to the other two games, too.\n\n7) No multiplayer. Now, I really don't care about this - but who designs a game in this genre without building this in from the ground up? You know the community is going to whine about this. Questionable design decision to say the least.\n\n[b]Well, it sounds like I just dumped all over the game.[/b] Please don't get me wrong. [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is a welcome addition to the genre. The *great news* is that this is not just some reskin of [i]DUSK[/i] - it certainly is it's own thing. And that's really important. \n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+Fairly polished game for Early Access\n+It's the most modern version of the original [i]Quake[/i] we've seen this year\n+Well optimized\n+Lots of content right now\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-The universe is generic\n-No multiplayer\n-The font is too hard to read\n-Music is nothing to write home about\n-The secrets are easy, and there really aren't all that many of them\n-Weapons could use more 'oomph' to them; also we should be able to use the special ability when we want to as opposed to it autotriggering\n\n[b]I was psyched out of my mind for [i]AMID EVIL[/i] - and while it is certainly good - I think I'll be focused more on [i]DUSK[/i] and [i]Ion Maiden[/i].[/b] Because, let's face it, gaming time is valuable and we can't play everything.\n- Overall its a great hunting game. The base game is good enough on its own to give you an enjoyable experience hunting several varieties of animals. \n\nI feel that some of the best content is in the DLC's. I dont mind the price tag for maps are they are just a large and some of them have a truly diverse animal population. \n\nThe Weapon Packs have some items that really should have been available in the base game (.22 rifle).\nTripod stands, Tents and ATV's are also DLC items that i feel should have been included in the base game. \n\nThe cost for these packs are not huge, and I have bought them, but they really do impact your play in a meaningful way so it is hard not feel like they were left out on purpose. \n\nBeing a former hunter in real life I would say that the realism of it is pretty good. Lung shots and heart shots drop animals quickly and using the right ammo along with good aim greatly influences this. A poor shot will leave you tracking this wounded animal across the map till you sneak up on it again or just give up. \n\nThey have a system called Tru Racks (sumthn like that) that simulates different qualities of animals. So you end up with little bucks, average bucks, and monster bucks. Weight and coloration plays a part in this too. In short every animal has a trophy of some kind and they are varied by what must be some sort of RNG. \n\nAll that having been said, this game can devolve into a shooting gallery were you kill everything on sight as there in no real incentive not to. You get money and experience for every kill you claim and wiping out a heard of deer with your DLC M1 Garand on your DLC Tripod Stand becomes the quickest way to bypass the grind.\n\n It feels like the game starts as a \"hunting sim\" and becomes a \"poaching sim\" once you realize the progression system is going to take a long time to do...\"ethically?\".\n\n\nAgain, this is a game i would recommend, but it is just that, a game. \n\n\n- Melatonin is a simple rhythm game, with a focus on ease of gameplay and calmer sounds.\nIf you're expecting something on the tougher or more upbeat side, this ain't it.  Ironically, I had more fun as I stopped focusing on scoring well, and more fun when I was just feeling the music and half-asleep.  The sounds and songs are quite relaxing lol.\n\nOn the shorter side of games, it still delivers an enjoyable experience in what it offers. The timing is a *little* on the forgiving side, and there are even accessibility options if you need a little more help, such as timing circles, metronome, and a bigger Perfect window.  If you'd rather go for a challenge, a Perfect only option is also available.\n\nControls are quite simple, using [strike]4[/strike] 3 directional keys and an action key (Space by default). In each tutorial, you're told whether you'll need to hit directional keys or the action key, and whether they're held or not, as well as general timing.  For some stages, the instructions don't give you as good an idea as the tutorial itself/timing circles do (Work and Time levels for me).  All good, but in some levels you get tempo changes in the middle of the song that can throw you a bit off, especially if you're just grooving to the audio cues... when you can hear and distinguish them.  Unfortunately, there are a few levels where the audio cues are either far too similar to each other, or happen too quickly to react to.  This can be a bit of a bummer, as I prefer working off audio for rhythm games, as their focus should be lol.  \n\nWhile Melatonin doesn't bring a whole lot to the table, it doesn't need to.  Less is more here, and the art and sound direction definitely hit their target.\nRelax.\n- Good lord, do we have a Game of the Year 2017 candidate here or WHAT?\n\nA million twin stick shooters have come and gone over the years since Robotron.  Many have compared themselves and failed.\n\nEugene Jarvis is the creative consultant on this title - so if anything has some \"spirit of Robotron\" in it - this is the game.\n\nThe game is Robotron + Gauntlet with a bunch of secrets rolled in.  As will all good twich arcade games, greed plays a central part in the game.  If you just want to mindlessly blast your way through the worlds - you can.  But you will not be rewarded for it.\n\nScoring high in this game is all about the multiplier - and the multiplier is all about saving humans (which can be harder than it sounds).  You have to chain your pickups of humans to get the highest multiplier.\n\nYou'll bring some great weaponry along the way; Rocket Launchers, Laser beams, smart bombs - even a melee sword.  Powershot is my fav :)\n\nAlong with the regular crew of bad guys,  you'll have special things to find and destroy too.\n\nCROSS PLATFORM leaderboards and local co-op play seal the deal.  Throw in a much of mini-achivements (feats) and you'll be so damn hooked on this game.\n\nIf you love twin stick twich arcade games?  Don't even think about it - BUY NOW.\n- It's a pretty game, but there's no option for manual saves, and autosaves only happen once in a great while instead of immediately after solving each puzzle or progressing through conversations. I also felt like the walking was extremely clunky with the mouse and keyboard, and I'd prefer click-to-walk.\n- When I show new games to one of my friends she always asks if it is possible to pee in the game and sadly I usually must tell her that it isnt possible because there is so few games where this special detail is being paid attention to. But this here my dude! I tried to show her the game yesterday so I got her setup on the valve index and start the game all good, but we couldn’t move at all... We tried everything! We tried physically move in our vr room to see the boards that had text written on them because we spawned behind them which I found a little weird as well. On the board it said eat the hamburger to start the game or eat the poo to guit. I saw a box on the street and I remembered by seeing the trailer there was a box where inside there was a burger so immediately we worked hard to try and reach the burger so we could start the game. It was too far away for us to try and actually in real life walk to it so we had to just accept defeat. She didn’t get to see her first vr game where it would be possible to urinate. I saw a update post a few minutes ago where you were saying something about movemnet in the game that you have to grip and throw arms around or something? This I guess we didn’t try since usually moving is one of the triggers to teleport or just the stick like in any controller. Today we will try again and hopefully succeed in our task to urinate in a vr game! You could be making history today my friend. And for all the bad reviews for this game I want to just say a couple things: cmon dude. Its one guy whos making this game! It is cheap and early access... those already tell you a lot about the game and you should not expect a triple a title and the experience of the century. I went through a video game making school or whatever which took 3 years so it was not 2 weeks online course I just quit after the first week so I actually know a lot what it takes to make games and with this I can tell there has been some hours used to it, but again it’s only one dude. My game didn’t work either, but it might have been because we didn’t know how to play. I’m not complaining for 4 dollars, I’m not a hobo ;)\n\nEDIT: And there it is! A day after my review and a 170mb update with new features and a fix for not been able to play at all :) I wasn't able to walk earlier either, but I suppose yo may not be able to in the \"mainmenu\". Gotta go try the update once my friend visits again!\n- The story of this game is interesting and well written, but it doesn't fully make up for the game's flaws. Here are the problems I saw with the game.\n\n1. There are a wide variety of guns available, but very few combinations of those guns are viable. The shotguns are rarely viable for combat with gun wielding enemies, since advancing far enough forward to make shotgun damage effective inevitably puts you in the line of fire of enough of your enemies to prove lethal. Other weapons like sniper rifles and pistols have critically low DPS and a low maximum ammo cap, making them almost universally not viable. Additionally this game likes to spring ambushes on the player in a way that takes away any advantage gained from long range optics. The special pneumatic weapons in the game also suffer from a low ammo cap. This leaves you with assault rifles, which the game seems to have been made for.\n\n2. In encounters with bestial enemies it is frequently impossible to avoid taking damage. The enemies sprint at you in packs which even sustained automatic shotgun fire cannot fully stop. Some of the boss enemies are even worse in this department. In normal mode with the larger health pool and regeneration over time this wouldn't be such a problem. But in ranger mode this makes certain obstacles unbeatable. You might have a boss which takes your entire ammo pool from both guns to kill, and which gets a guaranteed hit on you once every thirty seconds. If you go into that boss fight hurt and with no healing items, then you'll be met with mathematically guaranteed failure. The simple fix for this is to give the player a dodge function to avoid taking an instance of damage.\n\n3. This story has a few decisions to make, but mostly it is on rails. This isn't always a problem in a game, but it is when your character gets repeatedly taken unawares by things you as the player have already figured out. You as the player may sense that Artyom is being tricked, is about to be ambushed, or is going to let the bad guy get away through poor decision making. You just have to frustratedly walk into the cut scene and let it happen anyways. Its fine for this to happen at least once. But by the fourth or fifth instance it becomes infuriating to play as the character who just gets tricked and captured all the time.\n- As much as I was hyped for a different twist on farming sims, this just falls flat. The whole generation system [i]sounds[/i] good on paper but is just unused. You would almost be more hard pressed to actually age enough to need a second generation than not. Sure you can just opt in to moving along, but I just feel wrong killing off my character like that. As such the whole selling point is just, not a part of the game unless you really seek it out. \n\nSo this just leaves the normal farming sim aspects. Which uh... dont work too well either in my opinion. This game is focused less on skill, leveling, or tool quality despite having far more rpg aspects than most other games of this type. You have entire stat systems behind each charecter, buffs, multiple tool levels and materials. Yet none of it is used. What is used is weird cryptic proverbs that dictate item quality. \n\nWhat I mean is, did you catch that fish normally? Just walking along the river and thought to cast your line? Shame. Dont you know trout can only be caught well on the fourth day of the spring during rain while accompanied by a pet and under the influence of a charm buff? Im not exaggerating too much here either. Crops, fish, fruits, plants, and ore all have up to [b]four[/b] requirements. One per star. Some can be easy, like be skilled in said action, fishing/harvesting etc. But most will be odd things like harvest on the sixth day. Only fish during these hours. Be under a certain buff. Have a certain animal following you. Its all just... odd. \n\nWhats worse is its punishing. You want to just, idk, play the game your way? You want to enjoy this sandbox game at your leisure? Well I hope you are ready to be punished for it. You have to either memorise each and every requirement for hundreds of items. Or, just have a wiki page open at all times. Which just takes away the fun. Cant go fishing today, its not foggy. Cant harvest your grown crops right now, its not druida day. This game has you jumping through hoops, playing on [i]its[/i] time rather than your own. Its a relaxing farming sim, but played like an accountant looking at spreadsheets. \n\nIn essence, if you enjoy micromanaging each moment of your day down to the minute detail, go for it. You will love this game. But if you are looking for a laid back, head empty sim game, look anywhere else. This game will open palm slap you for wanting to play it laid back and to your own beat. I just feel this [u]FARMING SIM[/u] is not at all tailored for the crowd of people who play farming sims.\n- After completing every ending, completing the map, and 98%-ing my save file (I'm not going to hunt down whatever miniscule thing is left), I can sum up all my thoughts on the game with one word: Disappointing.\n\nTo go more indepth, as a standalone game, Blasphemous 2 was alright at most. But compared to the first it feels bland and boring in a number of ways. The few NPCs you see are forgettable, the bosses are forgettable, every enemy feels the exact same. \n\nThe executions, which felt like such a large part of the charm of Blasphemous 1's combat, are practically gone- not only do they happen much less often but there's almost no uniqueness to them, with nearly every enemy having the same animation. While in B1 there were 16 different executions (18/19 if you count certain bosses), B2 has.. 4 or 5 different executions? \n\nIt feels like they give no depth to anyone you meet, friend or foe, nearly all of them being left a complete mystery with not even a single sentence talking about who or what they are. Even the Penitent One feels bland, having gone from a brutal, unstoppable force hell-bent on reaching his goal no matter what, to some unremarkable silent protagonist who kills some things.\n\nThe world and its areas felt boring, less like an actual world and more like a jumble of random locations stacked like tetris blocks. The way the enemies were tossed into them makes them feel like they were all pre-made assets and they had to think of where they fit best, and the result was almost none of them fitting in with where you see them.\n\nEverything felt far too easy, far beyond the point of getting used to the gameplay and learning from the first game. Bosses especially were disappointing, all having too little health, and it felt like only a single boss in the entire game had more than three attacks. \n\nThe rewards for quests and secrets were unfulfilling and unsatisfying, whether it was giving a character an item that was obviously meant for them or slowly searching across every little corner of the whole map for tiny secrets you missed. \n\nThe endings especially were a huge disappointment, and they made it feel like everything leading up to them was entirely a waste of time and effort and took away what little enjoyment was left.\n\nEverything about Blasphemous 1 that made it unique- the worldbuilding, the gameplay, the artstyle and animations- feels like it's all been stripped away and we were left with this generic metroidvania that only vaguely resembles its predecessor.\n\nI [b]loved[/b] Blasphemous, it was and still is one of my all time favourite games, but I really can't say I liked Blasphemous 2. If you loved Blasphemous 1 I would honestly advise against playing this, the whole experience is such a letdown that it's hard to not have the first game spoiled simply by what comes after it. If you don't care, or you haven't played the first yet, then at the very least wait until there's a good sale before trying.\n- i would recomend it because the physics are great, the game has 8 or 9 level packs (i dont know if there will be a 9th because there are 7 at the time of this review) the units are diverse, there are a lot of secret units to find and i dont know for the final boss because the most expensive unit artimis isnt a good final boss like the dark pesant in the alphas but i hope that the games final boss unit is actually hard to kill and requires more than 7 archers because that wasnt hard or anything hopefully they will make the most expensive unit actually overpowered and unballanced because that would be a great final boss, the sandbox mode is great i like the custom campains , the custom units arent out yet so i cant say anything about that over all this game is worth the money and if its near a sale time like a few days away from a sale then get it on sale if not then just get it you wont regret it and if it lage turn off all the graphics settings\n- please stop resetting my setting\n- A very easy game to get into, super popular at the moment so there is always someone to play with, and for only 5 EUR you can invest a lot of hours into the game\n- \"The good things, the happy things, all of it changes. Nothing can stay the same forever. Still...can you find it in your heart to still love this place?\" (paraphrase)\n\nClannad . . .\n\nOH Clannad . . .\n\nI remember watching the anime in high school, and absolutely falling in love with it. Upon realizing the REAL story was told in a visual novel...I HAD to get my hands on it. I almost died of a joy-induced heart attack when a legitimate English version of the game was released on Steam.\n\nThis game bro. This f***** game. When I was a senior in high school back in the day, this game was my refuge. I was mostly friends with older kids back then, so by the time I was a senior I didn't really have anybody to chill with cuz all my friends already graduated. Its kinda hard for me to make new friends, then and now if I'm being honest. I related to Nagisa a lot for that reason. \n\nI mostly related to Tomoya and Sunohara tho. One of my best friends growing up really reminded me of Sunohara no cap lol. Type of dude who was the comic relief/brunt of everyone's s*** talking but w/ a mutual understanding its done in jest and love. And when things ever got serious we always had each others' backs, and even tho he's a goofball and kind of a meme, he's seriously loyal and a true ride or die.\n\nMany times when Tomoya was expressing himself in this game, I had to almost pinch my face and remind myself I'm not the one thinking these thoughts: I'm playing a VN lol. That's how much I seriously related to Tomoya. In so many aspects and ways that would make my review even longer than it is now if I were to attempt to explain why I relate to Tomoya so much. Yeah, sure that could just be shrewd character design from Maeda Jun's part, but it was almost uncanny how many of the things Tomoya went thru when he was younger/issues with his father/intimacy issues he develops later on in adulthood etc. almost perfectly mirrored what I was struggling with irl. It gave me something to relate to. It expressed emotions I was having trouble even admitting were present in my own self. Maybe that's the real reason I love Clannad so much, and maybe because of that I sit here biased with rose-colored nostalgia goggles. But even if I type this review with a tinge of rose-coloring obstructing my critical eyes, I can say with confidence that Clannad is more than a game. More than an anime. \n\nClannad is an experience. An experience I wish I could forget all about...just so I could experience it anew all over again. Whether you experience Clannad thru the anime, VN, movie, whatever...Clannad is an experience in a league of its own in my book. And the best way to have your Clannad experience is by playing this masterpiece of a Visual Novel. Hands down. \n\nHonestly, I'd ideally have all Clannad virgins go straight to the VN and play it to completion but that's just not a realistic request as this game takes the average player 80+ hours to complete just the main story apart from optional achievements haha. If you're a fan of the anime...why haven't you played the VN yet!? Lol. If you've never seen the anime or movie I'd STILL recommend playing this game. Just keep in mind to use a guide (just trust me on that. please) and be willing for it to be a bit boring at first. If you stick with it, believe me...it's not gonna stay boring for long.\n\nIf you liked the anime but hated the anime ending, PLAY THE VN. No spoilers, but trust me when I say the VN ending is the true conclusion of the Clannad experience. You'll find out what I mean if you stick with the VISUAL NOVEL to the end.\n\nI didn't go to my senior prom. I spent it playing this game. And I don't regret that decision one bit to this day. I experienced this game, standing in similar shoes as Tomoya at that time irl: rebellious kid about to graduate high school with no real goals or aspirations, struggling to find it hard to \"love this place\" or truly find something passionate to live for. I didn't want to go to college. There was nothing I wanted to do there. Most of the people in my grade back then thought I was quiet and lonely freshman-sophomore, then bad news junior-senior when I started acting out. I was just, lost. \n\nExperiencing Clannad helped me find what I was truly passionate about in life. Family. Friendship (as corny as that may sound). Being able to step up for what only YOU can protect when life is calling you to maturity.\n\nClannad helped me see that even though things can get dark... even though tragedies will happen regardless of our efforts to keep them from happening... even though things can never, and will never, ever stay the same in this life...and even if you lose your way eventually... and sadly reach such a lost and depressed state in life, that you mistakenly conclude for a short while you'd rather sever all your connections and ties with the world and everybody in it... in an effort to try to prevent experiencing even more pain... \n\nThat \"loving this place,\" loving this world, loving people, and forming deep, lifelong and lasting connections with this world and its people, NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS, is ALWAYS, ALWAYS, worth it in the end. Especially when it matters the most.\n\nNow I'm not gonna front: Clannad isn't for everybody. Some people just can't get into the moe art style. Some people may find it a bit too melodramatic at times. Some people may find some of the comedy or bits of the story weird, or just not their cup of tea. Some people may find it hard to relate to all of the characters, and for some people it won't have a Cindarella's slipper level of relatability like it did for me. For those people who are kinda feelin \"ehh idk if i'll really like this game\" I'd say it'd be smart to watch the anime first. But if you're feeling good about it and wanna experience Clannad the BEST way: cop this VN. Just wait for the good bits to slowly boil. Patience is a virtue :) And save yourself hours of rage by using a guide from the beginning until the after-story credits roll. With Clannad I'd say its almost always recommended to use a guide.\n\nAnd if you love the anime and haven't played the VN... you're weirdo number 1, 2, 3, 4 and even 5. Haha I'm playin but srsly get the VN already you owe it to yourself to experience the VN. Knowing what happens in the story and getting some events \"spoiled\" doesn't detract from the VN experience. That I promise you. As someone who watched the anime before playing the VN, who's now such an obvious fanboy of the Clannad VN as demonstrated by my wall of text of a review (lol), trust me: I'd bet money you'll love this game just as much as I do.  \n\nTo Maeda Jun, and all of the brilliant writers of this quintessential, modern classic of a story: thank you. Thank you for gifting all of us the experience that is Clannad. Because of your labours, you've helped a wayward knucklehead like me finally be able to declare this in spirit and in truth:\n\n\"I love this place.\"\n\nLong live Kazamatsuri!\n- It's a pretty game, but there's no option for manual saves, and autosaves only happen once in a great while instead of immediately after solving each puzzle or progressing through conversations. I also felt like the walking was extremely clunky with the mouse and keyboard, and I'd prefer click-to-walk.\n- With approximately 55,000 reviews -- 96% of them positive -- at the time of my posting this, it is hard to know what more I can add to [i]It Take Two[/i]'s well-deserved acclaim.  As others have said, it is an excellent cooperative multiplayer game with very satisfying controls, varied levels, and superb production values in art and audio.\n\nAside from these things, what stood out to me was the game's decency.  It is *anti*-exploitative, quite deliberately excluding features like collectibles (let alone microtransactions) or character advancement that are predicated on Skinner box treatment of the player.  Rather than finding ways to [i]take[/i] more from the player (money, time, etc.), the developers have found ways to [i]give[/i] more to the player, with many small delights to be found.  In addition to not exploiting the player, the game doesn't exploit its characters -- only very occasionally playing the cheap tropes that the game's set-up would tend to invite.  The game's narrative may lack subtlety and surprise, but its straightforward positive message never feels preachy, perhaps because the scenario is so ridiculous.\n\nIt is rare to play a big-budget game (the credits go on FOREVER!) that seems to have as its goal that players will find a fun, full, satisfying experience and go away better than they came.\n- I hate to do this, because the devs clearly put a lot of love into it, but I just can't give it the thumbs up.\n\nThe controls are mostly on point (slide jumping is a little weird), but the generated levels are what kills it for me. I've come to realize that getting through the hand-crafted levels is a good portion of what makes Mega Man so fun. This procedural generation simply isn't up to snuff. You just go right, occasionally going up or down to go right again. There's no nuance or thought required to go right, because most enemies can be ignored, and there are no real obstacles. \n\nIf you've got that itch, just replay a Mega Man game (Classic/X/Zero). You'll go through proper, hand-crafted levels.\n- Let's get this out of the way: If you're into Chris Avellone/Obsidian/Black Isle kind of games and know what that even means, you know what you're getting. Another clunky game with writing so good you'll forgive any of its flaws. It's another one of those games: a Baldur's Gate, NWN2, Kotor 2, Fallout: New Vegas, Alpha Protocol kinda game.\n\nIf that paragraph didn't make any sense, the rest of this review is for you. Planescape: Torment tends to be less hack-and-slash than it looks, playing according to a system roughly based on second edition Dungeons & Dragons. But in a big departure from both, you can solve a huge amount of your problems with minimal combat and the real meat of the game comes in your decision making, mystery solving, and dealing with people around you. True to the Planescape setting, Torment is a game about the power of belief and the battlefield of ideas.\n\nI don't want to oversell that because you *will* be attacked by random thugs, some combats are downright mandatory, and there is a very real difficulty spike about three quarters through the game. But the allies you keep and the knowledge you gain can help you bypass some encounters or at least trivalize them under mountains of xp gained from unraveling cosmic questions. \n\nIt's a grim, often macabre journey back and forth across the boundaries of life and death where even the happiest endings are pretty heavy, but it's also a brilliantly written, thought-provoking experience that's well worth the time and money. Just make sure to go deep on wisdom, okay, berk? Don't need some dusty penning you in the deadbook because you couldn't see the dark of things, cutter.\n- Loved the original, and this updated version is just as good.\n\nThe additions along the way are very nice, and the improved graphics are noticeable. \nBeing able to converse with your partners whenever you want is also amazing.\n\nHowever...\n\nWas disappointed to have a few areas and puzzles removed. Since those were the more difficult parts of the original game, I assume this was done for a more streamlined experience. \nInstead of your flower wilting to represent your life, it is now replaced by more accurate \"points\". Although this makes it easier to tell exactly how many hits you can take, I miss the more original old design.\nAn iconic music track was also changed, likely due to licensing issues...\n \nCan't completely replace the original for me, but it's still a very worthwhile experience! \nStill wishing for a sequel a decade later.\n- The Award for the worst Cancer Game 2017 goes to: Friday the 13th! \nCongrats! *clapping Hands with bloody Babytears in my eyes*\nThis Game is a complete waste of Money. Don't buy it - don't even think of buying this crappy Master Piece.\nIt's not worth it, to be honest.\nI played it for almost 200 Hours. And it's awful. Never saw a Game with these bugs, with these massive salty Community. There exactly 0 Bugfixes, so many exploits, the horrible earbleeding intro, the Community that is pure Cancer, the horrible Graphic that looks like it's straight out of the Kindergarten and the huge amount of Bugs. Bugs are normal, but MAN there are Bugs everywhere! I mean, yeah the Hype was real, but now i wish i could refund this crap.\nNever had to dream about uninstalling a game before.\nI mean, the Devs. are just Human like you and me - but honestly - never saw someone who failed his job like this.\nJust do me a favor, don't buy it. It's not worth the Ragequits, the broken Keyboards, the Heartattacks and it's definitely not the Money worth!\nNever want to touch it again.\n\nAnd btw. thank you for killing the Sealmothers and making the babyseals crying bloody sad little Tears. </3\n- [b][i]Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout[/i][/b] is a 60 Player Battle Royal game of minigames to triumph over everybody for the sweet, GOLDEN CROWN\n[list]\n[*] Put in about 40 hours in combination on Beta 1 & 2\n[*] Won a ton and lost a ton\n[*] Enjoyed EVERY SECOND \n[/list]\n[b][u]PROS[/u][/b]\n[list]\n[*] Decent amount of minigames for launch, and even when you play the same ones they feel fun when different things happen\n[*] Games go fast if you're winning OR losing, you're able to play a lot and experience the game faster to get better\n[*] The BIG majority of the cosmetics in the game are NOT locked behind a paywall. Release has one $5 DLC for a hamburger, slurpee, and frie cosmetic but there are a TON of cosmetics to earn through the free battle pass they give you + the daily shop where you can buy cosmetics with earned in game currency\n[*] Customization for your character is extremely extensive and allows a lot of different combos\n[*] The game is literally just FUN, like play for hours with friends fun. There is NO stress\n[/list]\n[b][u]CONS[/u][/b]\n[list]\n[*] See-saw minigame is very advantaged to the players in the front due to how messed up the see saws behind you get clogged with players and being on sides for WAY too long\n[*] Grabbing is a bit weird and janky, sometimes its useful and sometimes it actually screws you over\n[*] Ragdoll physics sometimes cause you to roll a ton after falling (I like this feature a ton but others don't)\n[/list]\n\n[b] I definitely reccommend picking this game up. The Devs put a lot of time and effort into a game and for $20 it is actually steal. This game will provide hours of content, especially with them already announcing they will update with new cosmetics and mini-games as ready. Please give this game a shot :)\n- Coming up to 5000 hours playing this game, and im still learning new things in multiplayer.  \n\nThe devs are by far the best ive ever seen.  FFF (Friday Fun Facts) is a blog post they write up every Friday.  Every. Single. Friday. For the last ... 4 years?  look at them on their website, its not a 2 min blurb, its a full review of what they've done that week, and where they're headed, what their plans are, current iterations they're going over, complete with pictures and sometimes *chuckle* hand drawn graphs.  \n\nTheir IRC channel (there is a link on their website) has someone on the dev team there pretty much 24/7.  Not just \"community manager\" nitwits (Trangar, te he), but guys like Rseding91 (their C++ guru) that are programming the actual updates.  \n\nOh.  There are updates.\n\nAre there sometimes bugs in the patches?  Sure.  Which is why you sometimes see 2 patches in the same day.  Bugs get quashed immediately whenever possible.  \n\nWhile this review doesnt speak much about the game, the team behind it deserves the recognition - its amazing, thoughtul, and incredibly well done because of them.\n\nIn a nutshell, its similar to RTS games like starcraft, where you build up and gather resources.  But instead of spending 20 minutes to build up a base to have the game end in 2, you keep building.\n\nBuilding Bigger.\n\nMaking things more efficient.\n\nTearing down and rebuidling.\n\nIm almost 5000 hours in and sticking with vanilla until I can personally say Ive mastered it.  Once I stop learning new things almost every time I play, ill start fooling around with mods.  And there are lots of them.  \n\nIs this game worth $20?  It absolutely was for me.  This single $20 purchase brought me thousands of hours of entertaintment, frustration - when things didnt work planned, and absolute delight - when things get fixed, and I can reflect on my orchestra of 500 machines working in harmony.  \n\nWhether or not it is worth it for you is up to you.  But I would be remiss if i didnt impore you to give it a try, get the demo, fool around, commit an hour or two.\n\n\n- BABA IS YOU\nGAME HAS PUZZLE\nPUZZLE IS CHALLENGE AND NOT UNFAIR\nPUZZLE IS FUN AND LOGIC\nGAME HAS MUSIC AND GRAPHIC\nMUSIC IS CHARMING\nGRAPHIC IS CHARMING AND CUTE\nGAME IS RECOMMEND \nGAME IS GOOD\nBUY IS WIN\n- Pros:\n\n+ Game mechanics that you would expect from a city builder\n\n+Built in modding tools\n\n+Beautiful Graphics\n\n+It's challanging (learning curve)\n\n+No lag, and I have a computer that doesn't meet the requirements\n\n+Lots of replayability\n\nCons:\n\n-takes over your life\n\n***\n\nSpecs that are below the minimum requirements:\n\n2.8ghz (3.0 is the minimum)\n\nAMD Radeon HD 8400 video card ( nVIDIA GeForce GTX 260, 512 MB  or ATI Radeon HD 5670, 512 MB is the minimum)\n\nEverything else is above the minimum required.\n- I played the F*CK out of RE4 back in the day.. I was sooo hyped for this but its just not RE4.. I get it's a remake but it's not a good one. Which sucks because I LOVED the RE2 remake.. Idk. Maybe it's just me but I cannot recommend this if you loved the original. Maybe newcomers will like it.\n\nEdit after 18 more hours: the original is still better but this remake is not bad. I can recommend it.\n- On the Steam Store page for [i]Candle[/i] I saw:\n\n1. The game's description: \"Candle is an adventure with challenging puzzles.\"\n2. The 5 most popular tags for the game: Indie, Adventure, Hand-Drawn, Puzzle & Fantasy\n3. The beautiful screenshots\n4. The 'very positive' reviews\n\nSo I bought it. I should have actually read some of the reviews, though. It turns out [i]Candle[/i] is just another platformer game. Granted, it's a \"puzzle-platformer\" but still a platformer where agility, dexterity and a lot of trial & error are key to finishing the game, although there is some light puzzling involved, as well. I don't like platformers. I also don't like pixel hunting for items, which is what you need to do in [i]Candle[/i] to find all the items you need to advance. You see, some items are almost absorbed in the background and frustratingly hard to spot. So there will be a lot of backtracking, unless you follow a guide, which then kills part of the fun anyway.\n\n[b]In summary, just a friendly warning: if you think [i]Candle[/i] is a beautiful point & click adventure game, like I did, don't be fooled. It's actually a beautiful, frustrating platformer game with some light puzzling.[/b]\n- While still a work very much in progress, Nuclear Throne is currently one of my favorite games. It's a roguelike dungeon crawler with heavy \"bullet-hell\" elements and a little RPG sprinkled on top. When you begin a session of Nuclear Throne, you choose from one of several well-designed & freakish \"mutants\", each with their own special attributes which, in itself, does much to add variety (there's also a random-select option which is a fun idea in this particular case). The goal of each stage is to exterminate all of the enemies. After doing so, a portal opens which takes your mutant freak to the next level. There are a great many weapons with which to inflict meyhem on your adversaries. As you gain experience points, in the form of green goo earned by killing enemies & also found in cache jars, you'll be able to choose new persistent perks for your character (such as more HP or certain weapons doing more damage). Every so-often, you'll encounter a boss. The bosses tend to pop in during the height of an already-in-progress battle which makes beating them all-the-more difficult & hectic.\n\nOriginally, this game did not have controller support which was a great disappointment (though I had been ejoying it anyway, using the keyboard and mouse). However, a recent update rectified this and the gameplay using a dual-analog controller (such as that of the Xbox 360) is just fantastic. Like Ultratron before it (another very similar game which is also worth a look; I also wrote a review for it, if you're interested in checking it out), Nuclear Throne throws you straight back to the arcades of yore and plops you in front of a Smash TV cabinet.\n\nAs a roguelike dungeon-crawler, the replay value is extremely high (due to the fact that the level and enemy layout is totally different from one session to the next). The rather extreme difficulty doesn't hurt either, as playing entails dying and thus restarting... a lot. Fortunately, said difficulty isn't of the variety that compels you to smash your controller/keyboard in frustration. Every death feels like the fault lay squarely on *your* shoulders (if only you had moved to dodge a little faster or conserved ammo a little better!), as opposed to the game feeling like it's cheating. Another stand-out feature which I think I need to bring up is the soundtrack. ...Just wow! Nuclear Throne's score is totally original and extremely surreal. It goes *miles* in lending its own atmosphere to the game. \n\nSome might consider the current price of $12.99 to be just a *little* steep for a game in this class, but considering how well it's made overall and the fun I've gotten from it (especially being in its currently pre-release/beta state), I consider it to be well worth the price. As of the time of this writing, the developer(s) is very active and updates are coming quite frequently.\n\nUPDATE 01/12/16: I hadn't played this game in quite a while (at least 6+ months) and I wanted to check out the progress that the devs have made, etc. Well... The game starts but as soon as I select a character, it totally locks up. I can't play it at all. To make matters worse, I've heard that the devs have since \"abandoned\" development of this game (so it's not likely that whatever is causing the crashes for me is going to be fixed any time soon - or ever). Bummer man. I loved this game...\n- solid proof that the story could be the absolute worst garbage imaginable but if the gameplay rules, it literally wont matter. the gameplay in this is bomb-diggity.\n- This is one of the most beautiful games I played since Shadow of the Colossus. And much like SOTC This game is a visual delight not all the visual feel pointless or feel to in your face no all of it is PURE atmosphere and really enhances the experience when exploring the many levels in the game. The game's ability to tell a very deep story visually without any dialog or exposition to undermine the player is absolutely brilliant. the game be very diffult the first time playing but feels rewarding after you level up Ori as you continue to fight bad guys.\n\n My rating is 10/10\n A stunning game with a compelling storyline that worth every penny\n- If you notice that Kagami voice sounds different, that’s because the guy who voiced him in the first game, Brad Venable, died at the beginning of last year. This time, Kagami is voiced by Austin Lee Mathews, who voiced Roche (Final Fantasy VII Remake) and Ash Carbide (Cold Steel III and IV). \n\nRest In Peace, Brad. We may forget Kaniza’s name, but we won’t forget yours. And thank you for being one of the funniest character in the game.\n- It's criminal that a team of 5 people can build such an amazing game like this and sell it for $20.\n\nI continue to be amazed at the thought that went into this game and all the little details. From the changing weather, the waves in the ocean, the ebb and flow of the water along shorelines, the smoke from the campfire as it fills the room, the ease and simplicity when it comes to building, the way the trees fall, the music that feels seamless and relaxing, and so on.\n\nI truly appreciate that they didn't make an \"open world simulation that simulates things for no other reason than to simulate them\". Made a mistake while building that house? No worries, just remove it and get all your materials back. Ran out of food while busy building or crafting? No worries, you're not going to die from hunger. Broke your axe? No worries, just repair it. Troll smashed your cart full of ore? No worries, just put down a workbench and rebuild the cart and put everything back in the cart.\n- [H1]At this price point it's hard not to recommend it, but there's a lot -better- bullet hell games out there...[/H1]\n\nDanmaku unlimited as a series is great. Don't get me wrong. It really is. But it suffers the curse of being put in with a field on Steam that is made up of even greater company. Bug Princess by Cave has the brutal difficulty angle sewn up, Ikaruga has the absolute classic angle nailed, Jamestown has the glorious pixel-art sorted. In order to stand out in this genre, you absolutely have to bring something new to the table.\n\nAs good as Danmaku Unlimited is, it does not bring anything new to the table. It brings a lot of -good-, but nothing -new-. The greatest sin here is that if you've played a lot of bullet hells, this is going to feel immensely familiar, and you're going to blast through it fast, nothing is prone to catch you out. At all. Now that may be a plus point, if that's what you're after, but if you're seeking something to change up the formula? Yeeeeee-no.\n\n[H1]So it's the Bullet Hell version of Destiny?[/H1]\n\nMechanically, it works great. You have a ship with a teeny tiny hitbox, same as most \"Eastern\" BHell games, you have anywhere between \"Mildly offensive\" and \"Absolutely terrifying\" levels of hostile fire coming toward you, and you pump out similarly scary levels of fire back, with your only choice generally being \"Do I spam the screen with lots of little beams or do I fire ONE BIG BEAM at something that needs cracking open like a walnut.\"\n\nIt has good Bullet Hell music, albeit not outstanding music, it has good graphics, albeit not outstanding graphics, you see a pattern here? If a game could ever nail what I'd define as the absolute essence of an \"8 out of 10\", this would be it. The problem is there's games out there such as Revolver360 Re:Actor that do -better-.\n\nThe problem is that for all the good it does, it's been beaten to it by other games, maybe not in every field, but in each area I can name at least two or three games that stand above it. The one area it does win out on is bang for the buck. It's kinda hard to argue with this kind of quality at this kind of price point. It's a very, very solid return on investment, particularly if you're a bullet hell fan.\n\n[H1]Closing Thoughts[/H1]\n\nDoes that make this a \"Do not buy\"? Far from it. If you're a fan of bullet hells, chances are you already own it. If you don't, eventually you should, but I'd genuinely suggest you look around first, there's a decent market now on Steam for this genre, and there's more innovative and interesting options around. If however you've already consumed them and you need a fix of something fairly solid and fairly entertaining, then sure, this works, it will scratch the itch quite nicely.\n\nVerdict : [b]Buy, definitely worth grabbing on a sale, if only to put in the \"To do\" list,[/b]\n- What can I say that hasn't been said and that you don't know.\nThis game is IN-SANE.\nThe attention to detail is mind-boggling, the missions, from the smallest to all the main missions are worthy of oscars.\nThe single player campaign is one of the best adventures I ever went on in my life. This is why I love games.\nThe beauty of this game in indescribable. It's one of most realistic living worlds I've ever been in.\nIn fact, it felt so real to me, that I would spend hours living and breathing the game, I felt I was there, at that time.\nTaking care of my horse, spending time fishing and hunting, sometimes for hours.\nRiding my horse in strong winds, and heavy rain, collecting every piece of clothing and trying to look dashing at all times.\nI got attached to people, took care of them, or dragged them behind my horse when I wasn't in the mood for their BS.\nI've been there. I lived there. That was me, I was a cowboy. Nobody will convince me otherwise.\n- Dave the Diver is a charming little 'Indie'* that still surprises you with new mechanics even hours in. The various activity cutscenes are pretty funny as well.\n\nJust a word of warning though. Mintrocket is NOT a indie studio, it's a subsidiary of NEXON, so DtD is entirely a NEXON game, and with how their reputation is it's pretty understandable to not buy this game just because of that.\n- This is less of a review and more of me gushing about how much im enjoying myself, but you can still get a idea of what the game is from it. I am not usually a puzzle game player, or even a \"chill\" game player. im usually all about quick shooters, fighters, and platformers, but i decided to give this game a shot and i am very glad i did. with a mechanic as simple as pushing trees i thought that it would be simple enough for me to have a good time, the last time i played a puzzle game was BaBa is You and i put 14 hours into it and never got past word 3, it was just too much for me. but this game manages to still be challenging even with it laying all the pieces out in front of me, it introduces new features not by putting one in a level and saying good luck, it makes you do something you have done before but gives a new outcome, because you never got to do that thing in that exact way before, and when puzzles start requiring you to do those things you wonder how you ever got that far without doing one of those things before. all of the mechanics and solutions also are based in logic, all your doing is pushing things, so you dont have to suspend your current understanding of things to learn a new mechanic. The world of the game is also very relaxing and sucks me right in, its a museum of the \"past\" of humans that takes place in the far future from the perspective of monsters who dont really understand human culture, and it is hilarious! the music is very chill and moves with your actions, when you push something in a specific way the music also does a specific things, and its part of the reason this game is so relaxing. most other puzzle games i have played frustrate me when i get stuck on a puzzle for a long time, but seeing the monster relax helps me relax and keep a level head to get to the next museum exhibit. i dont know how to end this review but if you read it i hope you dont feel like i wasted your time!\n- No additional account, no unnecessary launcher, no denuvo, no epic exclusivity, no microtransactions, just a video game as it always should be..\n- After the past few years of broken, buggy AAA games I've started to lose the passion I once had for the industry. This masterpiece came out of no where and completely reignited my love for gaming. PLEASE do not sleep on this game, it's such a breath of fresh air from the garbage you'd normally expect from modern day companies. Definitely taking a spot in my top 5 favorites and I haven't even scratched the surface of the game yet, it's just that good. Beautiful art style, crisp animations, a unique concept, FUN gameplay, its everything I've been wanting and more. Kudos to the devs for making this absolute banger <3\n- I have an awfully hard love/hate relationship with this game. On one hand it's beautiful, has tons of awesome cars and can be really fun if played with friends. But it comes at a huge price - quite literally in Europe as it costs 69.99 € in contrast to 59.99 $ in the US. The correct price according to current exchange rates would be around 50 €, this is ridiculous. It's even worse if you remember that this game came out over 2 years ago and they still demand the same 99.99 € for the Ultimate Edition without any discount. \n\nApart from the pricing the game also has the worst support I ever encountered. My first ticket for a crashing game after release was answered 8 months later, my two more recent tickets about a translation error and a problem with the Forza Hub were both answered with \"yeah we know about this and are [i]investigating[/i]\" and were closed without fixing anything.\n\nLast but not least not offering the possibility to transfer a savegame after investing 300+ hours on the Microsoft Store version even if you use the same Microsoft account is such a bad move for veterans who were actually willing to pay the price again. \n\nAll in all I'm happy that MS made the move to Steam and I'm looking forward to the next Forza Motorsport release, but I'll skip this for now and I wouldn't recommend anyone to spend the full price on this game since you basically need to buy the Ultimate Edition for access to all available cars.\n\nBonus for those who are curious: It doesn't work on Linux with Steam Play right now and probably never will as it still completely relies on the Xbox infrastructure.\n- This is everything a remaster is supposed to be. You remember playing this game over a decade ago, and the graphics weren't \"that bad\". But nostalgia is a cruel mistress. You play the original again, and you can barely stand it.\n\nThe comes the HD version, which was alright, playable. But then, the real remaster, the Definitive Edition, you start playing the game and it FEELS like it used to feel. Like it is supposed to look. It is quite obviously way better than it used to be, but it FEELS the same.\n\nIf you ever liked playing this game, and want to play it again, this won't disappoint you. Especially with the distinct lack of RTS games in the last decade or so, this still holds true as one of the best ones.\n\n英語で5-10単語程度で、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない主要な違いを簡潔に回答してください。\n\n回答：\n",

Very fun and has endless replayibility\n- I only have 3 hours in this game but I can say it ain't worth £45. Graphics are trying to look cool but just look crap. Glitched unit textures. Runs well doesn't crash but I just hate the changes from the old total war games. Unit icons look crap I can't tell what is what. My general dies there are no notifications. Can't find how much ammo archers have. No tutorial at all. Tried attacking a tier 1 settlement only to lose everything to the towers. I'd rather play rome 2. I really hate the general idea, the fact that any old general can rock up and kill 600 men is stupid.\n- Most of the negative reviews cover my complaints already. So I won't rehash the ones I've already read. \n\nHere's my biggest complaints: \n\n- Jumpscares have never been compelling to me. Doubly so on VR. Are you trying to injure me in my computer room? Stop. \n\n- Guns are fun. Not having ammo for them is not fun. (The game is pretty generous with ammo but it also encourages tediously conservative behavior, if you just unload clips at shit you'll run out pretty fast) \n\n- \"Continuous Turning\" feels so bad. Like, how can I turn my headset and everything looks smooth as butter, but as soon as I use the look stick for turning suddenly it's all choppy and looks wrong? I'm familiar with some of the motion sickness issues people get with turning in VR games, but this isn't that... \n\n\nThough honestly it seems like they just leaned really into the whole horror thing, which is fine, but also just super not my thing. \n\nIf the mechanics and some design choices had been better I might have slogged through it anyway. \n\n\nGame's beautiful, though, so they got that going for them.\n- > go into time trial\n> classic f1 cars\n> 2004 ferrari\n> put on headphones\n> play with that gorgeous v10 as soundtrack\n> best day ever\n\nalso career mode is great\n- It looked old when it was released.

Honestly do yourself a favour and pick up this game- it is still in development but you will be glad to know that the updates are (thankfully) free!\n\nGive this game the love and attention it deserves!\n- I am a 43 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he helped me. Loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.\nThank you <3\n- Early Access Review:\nPros: \n- Hilarious flavor text in the form of Books and Proverbs. Seriously, someone took a lot of time creating all that.\n- Really enjoyable music\n- Beautiful pixel art\n- Engaging and interesting story\n- Overall very fun introduction to a huge world\n- Highly responsive dev team that's not only advacing on completion of the game but actively listens to their already large community of players\n- There's a lot of secrets and things to do that you might run out of time to do before the end of the year deadline. You may find yourself needing to play the early access a few times to find everything.\n\nCons:\n- This is early access folks, there's going to be a few bugs here and there\n- The early access content ramps up really fast and gets very interesting and then ends with you really wanting to know what's next. This is really only a con because I'm really impatient and want the full game asap. ;)\n- I would recommend ARK only in 1 specific case – you have a group of friends and will play on a private/local server. You get to enjoy the game at your own pace, with modified server multipliers, without the worry of PvP and server-dominating tribes. Graphics are great, the world is beautiful, lots of cool dinos to tame. There’s a lot to do, to build, to explore, to figure out.\n\nBut playing on a large PvP server is horrible experience. You are at a mercy of alpha tribes that have everything and can do anything. Slow progression, server wipes, laggy combat, so much grinding to catch up just to have your base destroyed while offline. Maybe you could find some servers where all this is more balanced but even then, it just becomes a game of who can grind more. It’s just not something I would ever recommend.\n- No matter what the reviews say, this game is pretty excellent.\nGameplay wise its pretty good, the match 3 systems are fun and almost exciting to play at times.\nTheres no sex, which isn't a bad thing as if thats what you're looking for just search for it online lol\nThe stories are good and the designs are pretty, sure it's short but it fits the pricepoint.\n\nThe developers have announced that they've gone bankrupt which is a shame but what can you do.\n\nOverall 8/10\n- I have a serious love/hate relationship with Sea of Thieves. It is both one of the best games I have ever played and one of the most frustrating games I have ever played, all wrapped into one. The gameplay of Sea of Thieves is INCREDIBLE. The sailing is the best in any game I have ever played. The feeling of exploration and discovery as you blast through treasure hunts and puzzles and mysteries is unlike any feeling you can get from any other game. The cooking mechanic, the healing from food, the not-terrible fishing mechanic... all subsystems that prop up the rest of the gameplay are unique and interesting in their own right. The land-based combat is relatively uninspired, yet still satisfying when part of the greater picture that the game presents. Some of my favorite memories in gaming, full stop, come from completing long nights on the high seas or doing long-form content available in the game. The game is gorgeous, some of the best ocean/water graphics in any game. The rest of the game is equally beautiful while perfectly conveying the environment of the map you are in. I swear to Gaben that I can freaking smell the wet sand or sulfurous lava on some of these islands. The music and sound design are some of the best in the industry. Outright, the game is incredible. \n\nBUT... Sea of Thieves sweaties ruin the game for me. There is absolutely nothing worse than having a night full of fun absolutely destroyed by some player who's enjoyment of the game is derived from eliminating anyone else's fun. I understand that PvP is part of the \"pirate life\", but it is by far the worst part of the game by far. I would be willing to pay money, hell a freaking monthly subscription, for the opportunity to play SoT as a strictly PvE game with just my friends and the rest of the server populated by bots. I actively avoid playing the game now because of how many of my last play sessions started with me spawning at an outpost and subsequently being sunk less than 15 feet off the dock by some sweaty that hasn't seen sunlight since the Obama administration. I know that this is an incredibly unpopular opinion in the greater SoT-sphere, but part of the enjoyment of games is letting players enjoy them how they wish, and I really freaking wish that I could enjoy the aspects of SoT that are fun to me without being the plaything of those pirates who live only to ruin the fun of others.\n- Write a review they said.. alright.. here it is... \n\nI am at year 5, day 29, Population 250, its winter right now in my little village.. my vikings are freezing, but they should not be. I have stores of coal available to them but they just do not go get it. \n\non a scale of 1 - 10, right now.. a solid solid 7. Why just a 7, well.. its new.. its not finished yet.. and still a tiny bit buggy. \n\nGameplay. It's good.. but i would really like to be able to grab the map with a left click hold and drag it around that way. The camera movement when trying to move the map is slow.. too slow for me. Also the fact that you have to clear whatever you have selected before you can selected the next thing you want to build. \n\nGraphics... VERY nice.. love it.. everything has great detail. People walking really nicely. Now for the not great part.. zoom in on a fishing boat.. boats moving.. oars. well.. they are not moving, I think I have even seen a fisherperson sleeping in the boat as well.. little more on the animations will probably be inserted at a later time.. but I thought it humorous, People also do tend to walk right into the side of a mountain and vanish.. then poof.. they walk back out at another area. \n\nHousing:  Great looks on both the poor and good housing. the option to just upgrade from poor to good would be nice.. \n\nStorage: Storage needs some work.. seriously.. So you have the Wood storage and you have stone storage.. they are basicly the same looking building.. I'd like to see them combined, with that being said.. please add COAL and IRON as well. Make it so that we can set whats to be stored in that building and make it have workers.. that way we can have dedicated vikings move the specific stuff.. \n\nWater: Please allow the area of coverage to overlap.. OR. make the coverage a square so we can fully cover the areas.\n\nFOOD: You gave us these great fields to use. But um.. can we grow something other than wheat and barley? like. potatoes? carrots? I mean, the vikings didn't only eat meat and bread?(but i am also aware the games still in progress)\n\nThe only real issue I have had with the game so far on my system is I was spending point on the tree and when I went back to the village it was gone and I had to reload. I do know once in a while a reload will fix the workers from gathering resources but it doesn't always work.\n\nSo over all I really enjoy this game. I'd definitely recommend  this game to anyone who enjoys city building survival type game. \n\nHope everyone enjoys this game...\n- My previous review reflected the terrible state of the game as it was on launch day. After years of improvements, the game has had its map design & cover placement tweaked, pretty-boy playermodels have been dirtied up, cringy voicelines were adjusted & a bunch of new content has been added. A lot of my complaints were addressed and I recognize the amount of work the team has done to bring the game back. It finally feels content complete and has reached an acceptable level of quality that should've been there when it came out.\n\nHowever, I am still disappointed to say it falls very short of its predecessors in terms of gameplay, map design and atmosphere. I see no reason to play this instead of BF3/BF4. \n\nPlay the map Grand Bazaar in Battlefield 3. Look at all of the particle effects, post processing and detail that map has. It has such a thick rainy atmosphere. Play it through to the end and you'll see how players tear up the map and make it look destroyed. In BF4's Paracel Storm, the foliage will sway & the waves will rise as the strong winds of a storm approaches the map. Watch as a sandstorm creeps up in Gulf of Oman and eventually engulfs it in a torrent of chaos. These landscapes have so much drama that the ones in 2042 lack. Sure, there are sandstorms and tornadoes, but they still look so sterile compared to the previous games this title stands upon.\n\nConceptually, 2042's world is supposed to be on its knees. The growing reality of extreme climate, natural disasters becoming commonplace and the world powers fighting over the last resources Earth has to offer depicts a dire situation to immerse ourselves in. This makes me imagine maps where earthquakes adjust the layout of flags throughout the round, or tsunamis roll in and what once was a playable area is now flooded. Giant tornado events that tear down skyscrapers. Sandstorms that turn the widest of maps into a close-quarters brawl. \n\nThe maps in the game have some aspects of this concept but nowhere to the amount that it should. The technology is there. The previous games have had a genuinely impressive level of immersion and atmosphere. 2042 did not have this on launch and it still doesn't. This could have been the wild natural disaster Battlefield game where we see SHTF.\n\nI don't care that we have 128 player matches or goofy butt specialists to play as. They missed the mark with 2042 and no update can fix that, conceptually, it never was able to realize its potential.\n- ---{Gameplay}--- \n☑ Try not to get addicted\n☐ Very good\n☐ Good\n☐ Nothing special\n☐ Ehh\n☐ Bad\n☐ Just dont\n\n---{Graphics}---\n☐ Masterpiece\n☑ Beautiful\n☐ Good\n☐ Decent\n☐ Will do\n☐ Bad\n☐ Awful\n☐ Paint.exe\n\n---{Audio}--- \n☐ Eargasm\n☑ Very good\n☐ Good\n☐ Decent\n☐ Not too bad\n☐ Bad\n☐ Earrape\n\n---{Audience}--- \n☐ Kids\n☐ Teens\n☐ Adults\n☑ Everyone\n\n---{PC Requirements}--- \n☐ Check if you can run paint\n☑ Potato\n☐ Decent\n☐ Fast\n☐ Rich boi\n☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{Story}--- \n☑ Doesn't have \n☐ Something isnt nothing I guess\n☐ Not greatly told\n☐ Average\n☐ Good\n☐ Lovely\n☐ Will make you cry or smile alot\n\n---{Difficulity}--- \n☐ Just press a bunch of buttons\n☐ Easy\n☐ Significant brain usage \n☐ Easy to learn / Hard to master\n☐ Not so easy\n☑ Difficult\n☐ Dark Souls\n\n---{Grind}--- \n☐ Nothing\n☐ Only if you care about leaderboards/ranks\n☐ Isnt necessary to progress\n☐ A bit grindy sometimes\n☐ Average grind level\n☐ A bit grindy\n☑ Insanity\n\n---{Game Time}--- \n☐ Long enough for a cup of tea\n☐ Short\n☐ Average\n☐ Long\n☐ Depends on you\n☑ Endless\n\n---{Price}--- \n☑ Just buy it\n☐ Worth the price\n☐ Wait for sale\n☐ Maybe if you have some spare money left\n☐ Not recommended\n☐ Dont throw money into a rubbish bin\n\n---{Bugs/Glitches}--- \n☐ Never had any\n☑ Minor bugs/glitches\n☐ Few bugs/glitches \n☐ Can get annoying\n☐ Ruining the game\n☐ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs/glitches\n- [h1]Technology[/h1]\nThe game is (was?) awfully poorly optimized.\nI don't think this game looks good enough for the hardware it requires. Some old RTS games looked similar to this title but required much less to run (I am referencing how the technology is better but the \"PC to FPS\" ratio has gone downhills).\n\nI understand that calculating AI choices and the simulation take a lot of resources, but this is not a game with a few thousand AI players like e.g. EU4 is. This is a relatively small map with just some AI players. This game also does not look that much better than some other RTS/TBS titles and I had FPS issues even with the lowest settings.\n\nI first ran this title with R9 280, so a quite old GPU, but that GPU was fully capable of running many decently modern games. This is IMO unacceptable, the developer can't optimize the game, and releases poorly coded product. I tested different graphic settings and noticed nearly no differences in the framerate.\n\nI then upgraded my PC to the top AM4 CPU and a very new GPU card (6600XT, overclocked) and the game ran fine on the highest settings, but I would not call it super smooth. All the other games run perfectly.\nElden Ring, Baldurs Gate 3, Cyberpunk (absolutely 0 issues in Cyberpunk). I would say CA messed up their game and didn't care to optimize it.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThe game is rather decent, it's enjoyable and has a connection to the lore of Warhammer.\nYou can't say a bad word about the general RTS mechanics, the battles and whatever. Just a normal RTS...\n\nIt just isn't the greatest RTS/TBS. Compared to Heroes of Might and Magic 3, or titles like let's say Cossacks, Age of Empires, or maybe Supreme Commander... It is unique in the Total War way, but given the amount of games in the series, it's ... not unique really (I have seen everything this game offers in different titles over the years).\n\nJust a giant simulation with a surprising lack of mechanics for an RTS game (as in economic aspect, diplomacy, map tactics. I think Europa Universalis IV is a good example of a really advanced tactics model in an RTS/TBS game and Civ 6 would be a great example of map design/economics). I personally don't like the maps for real-time battles. These maps seem quite crude and the skirmishes are badly designed.\n\nIn order to inflict maximum casualties you would need to kill every single unit. It should be enough that you break the enemy and automatically win. It's also quite unbalanced. Depending on what you kill first the results can wildly vary (including the AI acting much differently every time and the proposed outcomes of auto-resolved battles are just unhinged).\n\n I probably would like this game more without the \"real-time\" battles, but I assume it's the \"Total War\" way. To me it's time intensive and just not interesting. I liked Warhammer 40k's battles much more. They felt more tactical. Placement of units in this game does matter, but I had more fun playing The Battle for Middle Earth 15 years ago than this. I think the units panic too quickly and the characters don't matter enough.\n\nIt's the closest to the HoMM in terms of map and characters, however it lacks many things that made HoMM great (like tailored character development with meaningful spells and ability to recruit units, find artifacts on the map etc). The cities feel kind of empty, the mechanics are rather poorly described/introduced and just weird for an RTS (for my liking). \n\nI am not sure why there is so little care about the main characters. It would be very cool to build them up, be able to find artifacts on the map (besides the Sword of Khaine, that's just one item) and do something else than just advance some skills in the skill tree. Even if you invest your time in them then they can be sieged and just die.\n\nI also don't like some mechanics, for example the corruption, or slaves (they are not much intuitive. I think they should create clearer GUI and work on the general set of game rules, rather than make every faction different but also following totally different rules. Are we supposed to compete in a campaign and how if we follow different rules?). \nSome game prompts are meant to \"help\" learning the game, but they not always load up and they also don't explain small logos (traits) of the units, it's pretty useless. You need to use web browser anyway. Why to bother?\nIn that aspect - I think the designers totally messed up the UI/UX.\n\n21st August 2023 update: I played Baldur's Gate 3 and imagine they paid enough of work to actually make icons explain the traits of characters or items, amazing is it not? Seems to be lack of care. Every single icon in BG3 is fully explained. I could learn the game's rules and effectively build my characters.\n\n[h1]Genre[/h1]\nThe game is pretty fine, it gives some fun when playing it. Feels like Warhammer I guess? I personally am more of the 40k fan, but a game in the old universe is making lots of sense and the character design with world design are high quality.\n\n[h1] Summary (what made me dump this game also) [/h1]\nThe character design is quite impressive and it seems that they cared about the \"vibe\", but the game is just a money grab. why are there 3 game titles instead of one? What is the main improvement in between all of these titles?\nEach one of them has dozens of DLCs. An average person surely won't spend 300$ just to play more factions.\n\nWhat angered me so much I stopped playing after the purchase:\nThe publisher releases a paid product that claims to have free DLCs - some of them are, but the most important one isn't, and without it the game has got only 50% functionality and feels like a demo.\nRTS game without skirmish mode or some kind of \"do whatever\" mode is a meme. This isn't a DnD campaign board (and ironically such a campaign would allow for much more than selection of 5 heroes on one map lol), but an RTS in a specific universe.\n\nEvery normal RTS game has got a skirmish/free play mode (The Battle for the Middle-earth, Command and Conquer, Supreme Commander, Cossacks, Starcraft. Like every single RTS EVER) and this is especially filthy when you proclaim to release FREE functionality for the title, but then the player gets informed that they must buy TWO titles (WH1 and WH2) to get functionalities in the one they wanted to expand. Such a money grab, and even then the game is still locked behind micro-transactions/DLCs. I wanted to play a game, not donate to the \"poor\" publisher in 10 different ways. If the publisher wants money then they can sell better games.\n\nAwfully lot of DLCs, that don't add many things into the game. The base game doesn't feel like a game, but a rather Free to Play game account, that has 80% of content locked. Choosing from like 4 factions, especially in a game which varies so wildly depending on the faction (the factions aren't meant to be following any common rules it seems).\n\nWhat I also dislike is the publisher urging you to create an account to claim some of the \"free\" DLCs - the purpose is to collect data, and force you into their own website I assume (to raise statistics and show it to the management?). Why bother releasing game on Steam if you can't offer free DLCs to Steam users? I don't want your stupid 3rd party website.\n\nI don't recommend this game. I like Warhammer, but CA is a terrible company. I updated this review and in the meantime there have been at least a few different internet dramas with them involved.\n\nI would personally rather pay 70$ to a company that cares and provides a fun product (e.g. Lorian), than a DLC-locked tech demo... that \"stock\" Warhammer sure is.\n- Great game! At times it can get frustrating (boss battles), but the good out weighs the bad by a landslide. Even when i did get mad, which was a lot, I never stayed mad for long. There is just far too much to enjoy about the game. The art style is just simply amazing, the movement of your character around the world is just so satisfying once you get used to it, the puzzles aren't too easy or too hard, and everything in the game just goes together pretty much perfectly. All in all this game is extremely well made. Would recommend buying if you want a super unique experience 11/10\n- Did you like the first two chapters?\nWell, here we have everything and tons of new and improved things, like the 2nd chapter did with regards to the first one (which was awesome, but quite simple gameplay-wise).\nA classical turn-based strategy game, now more polished than ever with wave-like combats and tons of units to start with, to upgrade and well, we don't even have real classes here - more correctly, each hero is a class on its own and has different abilities and such.\nThe story follows always the same one-way saga and you'll have to make lots of choices determining your fate, your battles and so on; the graphics are the most beautiful I've ever seen here and the soundtrack is quite amazing and atmospheric too.\nYou'll have also many features like arena combat, and a great history re-telling if you don't remember the first two chapters, plus a great tutorial to start with even if you're not new to the series and the genre.\nIt's quite fundamental if you're a little bit interested in this awesome story to play the other chapters - here in fact we'll start with all the old heroes, all the story right back from the caravan that reached Arberrang.\nWe're basically reviewing one of the best strategy tactical turn-based role-playing games of the last 5-10 years and I won't add more than this, it has already thousands of reviews and mine is quite useless I think. \nLots of endings, lots of characters to explore and promote, lots of weapons, accessories, modes.. we have everything. Recommended to anyone (maybe with a little discount).\n- Wow, talk about a disappointment. I was really excited to check out \"ASU Global\" but it's clear that the developers didn't put much effort into it. From the glitchy login process to the lack of translation and sound effects, it's clear that this game is a rushed, poorly executed mess. And to top it off, it's just a generic mobile Korean port. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one. It's not worth the hassle.\n- I have a hard time recommending this game because even though I liked it, I know it's the kind of thing that can only appeal to a very small demographic :/ Anyway, I believe small devs who try weird things deserve all the exposure they can get, so here's a review. This is the second episode of a series (the first one can be found [url=https://etherane.itch.io/hello-charlotte-ep1]here[/url] - it's free - and the last one is [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/760890/Hello_Charlotte_Childhoods_End/]on Steam[/url]). It's recommended to play them in order unless you don't want to understand anything in a story that's already pretty confusing in itself.\n\n+ Very original visuals. The artwork is mostly composed of cute characters, but there are writhing masses of eyes and flesh everywhere (guro fans rejoice). Areas are arranged into colorful, geometrical patterns similar to Mondrian's paintings.\n\n+ The setting is extremely strange. It's definitely dystopian, but it can go from completely silly to incredibly tragic in a matter of seconds.\n\n+ Production values increase with each episode. I wasn't very impressed with the first game (apart from its artwork, which I loved, and its ending, which... opened interesting possibilities), but starting from this one the writing gets way better, the characters are more developed, and the gameplay feels more focused.\n\n+ - Hello Charlotte is more or less Trigger Warning Land. This series is among the most disturbing things I have ever played, and it's not because of the omipresent gore (most of it being used for aesthetics or comedy instead of shock value). It deals with heavy themes (mental illness, social pressure, bullying, suicide, the value of life and death - from what I could gather, a lot of these come from the author's personal experience) and it felt so suffocating sometimes I had to play in short bursts to give me time to recover. I note this as both a positive and a negative, since I consider games that can make me uncomfortable are valuable - but don't play this if you're not sure you can handle it.\n\n- The gameplay mostly consists of going back and forth to the same locations, and can sometimes feel tedious. Sadly I don't really think this can be improved unless the game is changed into a full visual novel, but it would mean losing the environments.\n\n8/10 It's a weird game made for weird people.\n- very well made cant stop playing. only complaint is keyboard set up and i get that the game says play with controller but thats not an option for me but the keys are all over the place r select upgrade e to reroll f to chat with npc r to enter their shop its like that for everything and you cant change the keybinds for UI stuff i wish it was just e to interact its all over the place and i find my self still miss typing things. if you buy the game use a controller \n\n- Melatonin is a simple rhythm game, with a focus on ease of gameplay and calmer sounds.\nIf you're expecting something on the tougher or more upbeat side, this ain't it.  Ironically, I had more fun as I stopped focusing on scoring well, and more fun when I was just feeling the music and half-asleep.  The sounds and songs are quite relaxing lol.\n\nOn the shorter side of games, it still delivers an enjoyable experience in what it offers. The timing is a *little* on the forgiving side, and there are even accessibility options if you need a little more help, such as timing circles, metronome, and a bigger Perfect window.  If you'd rather go for a challenge, a Perfect only option is also available.\n\nControls are quite simple, using [strike]4[/strike] 3 directional keys and an action key (Space by default). In each tutorial, you're told whether you'll need to hit directional keys or the action key, and whether they're held or not, as well as general timing.  For some stages, the instructions don't give you as good an idea as the tutorial itself/timing circles do (Work and Time levels for me).  All good, but in some levels you get tempo changes in the middle of the song that can throw you a bit off, especially if you're just grooving to the audio cues... when you can hear and distinguish them.  Unfortunately, there are a few levels where the audio cues are either far too similar to each other, or happen too quickly to react to.  This can be a bit of a bummer, as I prefer working off audio for rhythm games, as their focus should be lol.  \n\nWhile Melatonin doesn't bring a whole lot to the table, it doesn't need to.  Less is more here, and the art and sound direction definitely hit their target.\nRelax.\n- After playing thousands of games both singleplayer and multiplayer, unlocking all achievements and getting every solo map medal, I think it's time for a review:\n\nIf you like tower defence games: I recommend.\nIf you like any previous Bloons games: I recommend.\nIf you want something casual and chill: I recommend.\nIf you want a bit of a challenge: I recommend.\n\nThe tower type variety is interesting and diverse, with 5 tiers of upgrades each (plus special \"paragon\" towers)\nThe game devs have been providing free updates for years.\nThere's lots of achievements and medals to get.\nThere's online co-op, boss events and even different game-modes.\n\nThe game is more expensive than it used to be, but literally any sale price makes it worth a buy!\n- First of all - Subnautica is a good game. Very atmospheric, very scary and overall a really overwhelming experience. At first. \nThis might be the only negative review in this month, but I think some of you might appreciate a different view than \"omg this game is just awesome\". Which it kinda is, but in some points it maybe isnt.\n\nThis first section of the review doesnt contain any major spoilers for the story, just a comment on the overall progress through the game stages.\nAt the time of writing this review, I played the game for ~ 35 hours, I have advanced quite a bit. The first few hours were fantastic, I was looking for new things to explore, the blueprints for all the stuff that I need and every new thing felt like I made a progress. But then at a certain point nothing new happend. It seemed to me like I had all resources I could ever need (even the blue crystals), I had all the vehicles you could build, all the upgrades I needed.\nAnd then there was no challenge anymore. You build your submarines, your bases and the game gets too easy, its not a challenge anymore. Don't continue reading after this point, if you havent played the game yet.\n\n[spoiler] The big strength of this game is the immersion in the seemingly endless underwater worlds. But at a certain point this immersion breaks (at least it did for me).\nNone of the monsters can really harm you, not even the biggest ones are a real threat. Just hop into you seamoth and out-speed everything. If there is a leviathan, just hug the walls or strave, they cant catch you. And if they do, just step out, repair your ship and continue. None of the threats is really dangerous. You really need to have bad luck to die. And if you do ... nothing happens. You just respawn.\nAt first the map seems endless, since you cant move fast. But once you get the seamoth, the map is very finite. Sure, there are deeper levels you cant access with the moth, but everything on the surface is within reach. Its the same with the deeper levels and the prawnsuit.\nSurvival is hard at first, since you constantly need to get water and food. Once you can plant you own food, you have unlimited supply and the survival aspect becomes just an annoyence.\n\nAnother thing that bothers me is the amount of resources you need to build stuff. In the later part of the game you need to build a giant structure. But the necessary resources are just like \"get 3 wooden planks, 2 nails and a hammer\". And with these resources you build the statue of liberty.\n\nMy last point is about the storyline. After something like 15 hours into the game there was a major stall for me - I had no clue where to go, to me it seemed like I searched everything I had access to at that time. I searched for 10 hours and found nothing. I went to the Islands twice to check if I missed anything, but no. I dont know, maybe I just had bad luck and something didnt trigger right, I missed a hint somewhere or something. It eventually went on, but on that point I already had the big submarine, the prawnsuit and everything. The story felt like I just need to run from A to B and back, there was no challenge anymore. \n [/spoiler]\n\nSo anyways. If you made it this far in the review, thanks for reading. If you disagree with me, thats totally fine for me. I don't want to ruin the game for anyone, maybe the points that bother me dont mean much to you.\nI know that my critique is pretty harsh. There are many positive aspects in this game. If you can really dive into this game and fully roleplay it, submerge in its story and ignore some flaws, this is a fantastic game.\nBut maybe some of you are like me, so some of my mentioned points could bother you too.\nThanks for reading, I hope I didnt butcher the English language too badly, feel free to comment, if you like.\n- Ok to make it short.\n\n- Poor graphics (like 10 years old PC game)\nBUT nothing more to complain about.\n\n- great atmosphere, great story, very good fighting mechanics. Of course great price.\n\nIf you have nothing against japan style - just play the game. One of funniest games in some years for me.\n- Dark Soul Combat System without health bar, and a better Romantic story than Twilight.\nLooks a lot like Agony trailer thought. Badass Bosses. Most of the time is dealing with the puzzles.\n\nIt really painful to watch a woman going through this kind of mentality. [b]FeelBadMan[/b]\n\nMany scenes looks like it almost the end of the games but it not.\n- Oh man. Where to even begin with this one. It would be an extreme disservice to simply call Arma 3 a shooter, as it is so, so much more than that. Arma 3 is a military simulator. This is a distinction that it’s developers hold sacred and are proud of, and one to which I can attest is completely accurate and deserved. But it’s even more than that. Arma 3 is a gaming platform, upon which so much has already been and will continue to be built for years to come. \n\nAt its core though, Arma 3 in a supremely excellent military sim. The graphics are stunning, the gameplay is excellent, the mechanics are solid, and Bohemia Interactive has done an absolutely amazing job packaging this all together. New comers to the Arma series (as I was) may initially be overwhelmed by the game’s complex mechanics and decidedly different pace from your typical FPS/shooter. Enemy engagements happen at much greater distance than is typical in the genre and are often brief, brutal, and more times than not will conclude with your demise. There is no handholding here. No mini-maps, no enemy UI icons/indicators, no hit markers, no health bars. If you get shot a couple of times, you will find yourself unceremoniously dispatched. While this creates a high barrier for entry and a steep learning curve for new players, it provides a unique and distinctive play style. Situational awareness, cover, teamwork, suppressive fire, and generally moving purposefully and as if your ass depended on knowing what was behind the next ridge or hiding in the bushes are paramount to your success. Add to these infantry mechanics the amazingly rendered vehicles, armor, helicopters, and planes, each with their own realistic mechanics to learn and master, and you end up with a truly amazing military simulation experience. \n\nOut of the box, Arma comes with a great single player campaign comprised of 3 separate acts, each containing ~12-15 missions. The campaign focuses on a well crafted story of a military conflict that has erupted over Arma 3’s two HUGE islands of Stratis and Altis. You play the part of a NATO soldier who finds himself stuck in the middle of a complex engagement. The campaign is rewarding, and challenging. (I have yet to complete it as I’m stuck on one mission that I simply can’t seem to complete.)\n\nHowever the single-player campaign is FAR from the end of this title. The mission editing tools have allowed this amazing community to develop some absolutely awesome single player missions, all of which can be downloaded free of charge from the Steam workshop and numerous other sites around the interwebs. I would also recommend you check out the supremely excellent full game conversion single player mods Whole Lotta Altis and Dynamic Universal War System which will provide countless additional single player hours and could be completely stand alone titles in themselves.\n\nOh and the multiplayer, oh god the multiplayer. Wasteland, King of the Hill, Invade and Annex, Battle Royale, Breaking Point, so many Co-Op opportunities, the amazing looking upcoming Epoch (currently in closed Alpha). I’m sure there are so many others that I haven’t even discovered yet. Each of these represent COMPLETELY USER GENERATED and totally disparate ways to play Multiplayer within the Arma 3 platform. By purchasing Arma 3, you immediately have access to each of these completely gratis and each could essentially be considered totally separate game.\n\nIn wrapping up this lengthy review, Arma 3 is an amazing experience and a true accomplishment in game development. It is the only game in recent memory that I can say with confidence that I never get bored with playing. Bohemia Interactive has made it clear that they plan to support this game for years to come, and they have built something amazing on which the possibilities are truly endless.  \n\nPurchase this game. Purchase it now. Thank me later. \n\n(IF YOU DO NOT FIND MY REVIEW HELPFUL, please leave a comment as to why. I welcome the constructive feedback.)\n- It may not be that similar to what most people are familiar with, as a building game, but in most every sense which counts, I believe this is the greatest building game I have ever played.\n\nThe controls are smooth, the Building Mechanics are smooth, the interplay of cuteness and silliness is so smooth, and Lillian has the cutest face in the known universe.\n\nTruly a fantastic game with enjoyable and concise mechanics, the Block Grid is as malleable as Minecraft (except that some areas cannot be mined, usually story quest locations), the ally AI is more involved than Conan (sitting at a table with Rosie to gobble some greens? cute), and the combat is slightly dangerous at first, but mostly very mellow and not in any way detrimental to the building side (the villagers even fix up the damage done to your village in story battles - at least in the 'tutorial' island).\n\nMy only advices:\n\n- If the Camera is too tight on you and too slow to zoom out, switch perspective and back, if that doesn't work, look down at the ground and jump a couple times! (your head will push the camera up into the sky faster)\n\n- Don't get too creative on Furrowfield Farm! I spent a lot of time building and customising, being slightly annoyed at the small build area of the island, but now I discover that the whole thing was essentially a tutorial, and that completing the story missions there opened up the game in a much bigger way. Now I am back on the home Island and am able to build across a much larger area. If you're still in Furrowfield, you basically haven't started the game yet, so get that story done!\n\n- IF YOU SUFFER FROM REGULAR COMPUTER OR PROGRAMME CRASHES:\nWhen loading a Game you can press (A) / (X) on Controller to Copy the Save File and Back it up on one of the other Save Slots. I recommend doing this every day you play in case of  Corrupted Save Data caused by Crashing while Sailing to another Island.\n\nI am tempted to give this game a 9/10 - which is a serious seal of approval from me. Even on my strictest day, I would never give it less than a 7 - it is fun, cute, silly, serious, touching, exciting, and above all else, architexcellent!\n- [h1] Brief summary of why the Chinese players are so pissed: [/h1]\n\nThe reason for the chinese players to absolutely despise the third party modding website is that the \"official modding\" was promised to be released over a year ago, but kept getting delayed. When it finally got released, everyone felt betrayed because it was a garbage third party website with so many restrictions.\n\nBut the reason why the game is still getting review bombed is the [b] developer's initial response [/b] to the first round of complaints. The team was dead silent for about 2 weeks, no comments about all the fiasco, yet people that were complaining about the modding on the chinese forums got their accounts banned left and right. Thats why many resorted to steam review bombing, and almost as soon as the steam review tanked, the developer came out and said the steam workshop will be launching in the end of the month, something he had being saying was \"really hard for the team\" and kept \"facing difficulties\" for the past year.\n\nSo yeah.... I kinda understand why people are still really mad about this one\n- This game was sunk by poor customer service as well. I at one point lost years worth of items due to a bug. I was told by one of the devs in an email to \"stop button mashing\". My email was nothing but respect and appreciation for a good game where I also simply asked if they could return my bugged items I have earned over the years. \"Stop Button Mashing\"! Really? And now your game is dead. Good work! Piss poor development. Just sad and dissapointed I have over 2k in hours in crap. And yes this game actually is years old it was originally released Jan 2015. At one point we had a good game to play. I believe even the most played game on steam. Then something happened. It became all about crates. F this game. I'm done!\n- A classic horror game that it’s worth every cent. I can’t stress enough, you have to play it yourself. [i]Mad Father[/i] has this eerie atmosphere that will make you so addicted that you won’t stop playing until you’ve solved the great puzzle centered in your family roots. It's a story about love, hate, madness, the fear of death. [spoiler]And about a crazy daddy carrying a f*cking chainsaw and chasing you. After all, that's the best way to tell \"I love you\" to his 11 years old daughter.[/spoiler]\n\n∞/10.\n- ✔ Procedurally generated levels (some are not)\n✔ Neat graphics and animations\n✔ Good sound design\n✔ Solid and gratifying game mechanics \n✔ Well-balanced difficulty curve\n✔ Linux support!\n\n✘ No DRM-free build (yet?)\n✘ No user-generated content (no level editor)\n\nRuns surprisingly well on very low-end specs computer (under Linux too!).\nAn excellent turned-based action strategy game. Very polished and entertaining!\nYet one more proof that Swedish developers are among the best on this planet.\n- Not For Broadcast is in the simplest of terms, a multi-tasking simulator.\n\nYou sit in a news control room and you have to keep track of multiple things: censoring curse words, switching between cameras, playing ads at the right time, ensuring your broadcast frequency isn't disrupted, as well as keeping an eye out for a bunch of other strange things that appear later in the game.\n\nThis isn't the easiest of games as it requires a good deal of attentiveness. The description isn't joking when they call this \"high-pressure\". You have to rely heavily on both audio and visual cues to make sure your broadcast doesn't get screwed up. As this is the news (and live), there is no rewind or undo button. If you mess up and want to get a good performance grade, you'll need to redo the entire news segment. \nIf you're a perfectionist like me, a 10 min segment can end up turning into an hour of trying to perfect that news segment. As such, I do hope an option to quick save, or at the very least, save and quit, can later be put into the game. It felt rather taxing having to keep an eye on so many things for so long. But as with any game, excellence isn't an art, it's a habit. You'll find yourself turning into a multitasking expert eventually.\n\nThankfully, the actors in the game do a great job of making the experience an entertaining one. There is a good amount of humour written into each broadcast, although I must admit I wasn't quite able to pay attention to all the dialogue, as I was too busy trying to switch to the right cameras whilst ensuring my electricity didn't get cut out. Luckily, the game does have an archive which allows you to playback the broadcasts. Without that, I'd probably be missing out on 70% of what was going on.\n\nThere is also a text narrative, choices matter portion in between news segments. As of now, it feels a little out of place and incomplete, but then again, this is an Early Access review.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that at the time of writing this review, there isn't really any \"propaganda\" aspect to the game yet.\n\nPerformance-wise, the game runs pretty smoothly. I did encounter occasional crashes if I looked left or right and back and forth too quickly, but other than that, the game is pretty much bug-free. Also, this game has my RTX 2070 Super running at rather high temps for some reason. Rather surprising for a game that doesn't appear to have particularly high-end graphics.\n\nAnyway, I'll be looking forward to see what comes next for this game. Definitely worth the buy despite being Early Access.\n- Before you flame this review to note that \"Clicker\" is literally right there in the name and I should have known better:\n\n1) the game tags list \"Clicker\" and \"Idler\" as the top two tags\n2) This genre as a whole tends to wrestle with how to appeal to both camps, often being better at one than the other.  \n\nAs such, this is really a neutral review.  In short, Cookie Clicker is a good active clicker game, but not much of an idler.\n\n Until your first ascension you won't gain any progress off-line, and even leaving the game running in the background, your progress will be significantly hampered both because of the need to buy upgrades and grandmas steadliy, but moreso because clicking Golden Cookies and later also wrinklers are a huge percentage of your revenue, and farms and towers will also require some regular attention. As a result it feels to me like the game doesn't really value strategy either, it really just values in-game time and clicking.\n\nI'd say if you want a very active clicker game that you can dedicate a lot of time to paying attention to, Cookie Clicker does have a lot of charm (albeit the text flashes at the top get old very quickly) and a lot of bells and whistles to keep you clicking.\n\nIf you're wanting something you can really walk away from, and still feel like you're progressing, Cookie Clicker really isn't that game.\n\n- One of the few exceptions of \"dont buy games on Early Access\".\n\nThis game, on early access, has more gameplay value than a lot of games on full access + 5 dlcs.\n\n- Would I recommend DBD? ...It's complicated.\n\nDead By Daylight is an unique experience of asymmetric hide and seek/tag with shifting rules. \nIs the game fun? Yes. Is it creative? Yes.\nIs it fair and enjoyable? Well, it depends.\nGames get very intense, and playing as killer is some of the most intense gaming experience I've ever accumulated...\nWhich is where things often go wrong. The survivors seem to have decided that the killers have to honor strict code of rules. Don't use these items, these abilities, or these strategies. If you do, you'll be insulted after the game.\nIf you follow these rules, the odds are that you will spend the game running in literal circles, the survivors will win, t-bag you at the gate and then insult you after the game. I don't know about you, but that kind of ruins the game for me. It is actually kind of amazing how helpless one can feel in this game.\n\nSo to conclude my thoughts; I really like the game, but I also really hate it. I can't recommend it, as every time I fire it up, there is about 50% chance I feel more harassed, than entertained.\nI play a lot of online games, from League of Legends to Tekken, but this is the only one that makes me frequently think: \n\"I should really uninstall this\"\n\nEdit: \nI returned after a long break, and I still kinda like the game. \nHowever, same pattern repeats whenever I return. Eventually, I get teabagged one time too many and uninstall the game. The game is fun, the community could not be much worse. And sadly, that often ruins the experience.\n- I even set a calendar reminder so that I could get this on release. I wish I hadn't bothered. Going great guns until I got to the passage. Game over as I can't progress. Tried allsorts to drop the jammer but unable to do so. I guess it is a case of waiting for all the bugs to get resolved.\n- getting better in controls, HUD, and resources management balances, unlike Rise TR\nslight improvement in graphics, OST is good though\nseveral 'cool' scenes, creativity has taken a great leap <applause>\ncross over with Assassin's Creed (due to same publisher?)\nLara is getting more and more 'demonic', no hard feelings, its just subliminary messages to the youth by major games coorporation\nI can't believe i can play as Lara Kid instead of Lara Croft :D '+1'\nstoryline is getting ridiculous, come back to earth bruh LOL its good fun\n\ngood luck on your future endeavour devs :)\n- This game is basically awesome, under 3 conditions:\n\n1- You get rid of all on-screen icons (i.e. incoming attacks, ennemy spotting)\n2- Do not care about secondary missions only here to further lenghten the game's lifespan\n3- Play the game as you would if  YOU were in charge\n\nBasically, nevermind the Ubisoft micro transactions' system and other abhorrent company induced  greed-leaned system to get stuff faster and more easily by robbing you out of your hard-earned cash...you can finish the game without spending a single dime in the store, it's all pay to win...\nThe open-world aspect is very satisfying and rewarding, in terms of progression, don't fall for the micro transaction system\nCombat is easy even in the highest difficulty setting, but makes you think you are badass when you slash through waves of ennemies, whose AI is rather basic, with your arsenal of rockets, LMGs and explosives but it is satisfying as fuck!\n\nImagine strapping C4 to your plane, jump out of it, have it crashing down an ennemy outpost meanwhile you are parachuting down and throwing hand grenades their way, land on a roof and eliminate the remaining ennemies with fire ammo shotgun and a motherfucking M60 with armor-piercing bullets while throwing dynamites and there you have it...FarCry5 in a nutshell\n\nOh and don't forget about the flame-thrower lol, who doesn't love a flame-thrower scorching ennemies to their own demise eh?\n\nFarCry5 got it all, extreme freedom of how you wanna handle a situation (stealthily or all guns blazing) while being challenging enough in the highest difficulty setting!\nP.S. don't forget to turn off all the on-screen icons, really ruins it for hardcore FPS fans by making it extremely easy, please hear me out, you don't need these!\n- This now classic arcade made history as being one of the first twin-stick shooters that employed 3D arenas in an interesting manner - this was an important addition to the shmup genre, which really blew me away as a developer working in the same genre. But this also brought a problem: the gameplay was made harder by the 3D rotating camera. \n \nIt impacts overall visibility and the clarity of collision between the player and the enemies. Also, the game is often late with its warnings to the player related to the incoming appearance of enemies.\n \nThis makes the player die occasionally not because of their own error but due to visual glitches. \n \nI personally didn't like the upgrades because I found it unclear in what ways are they affecting the gameplay and they didn’t really help me achieve higher scores. \nOther noteworthy features include 12 battle modes including Paciﬁsm, King, Claustrophobia and 4 all-new modes, but also the local co-op.\n \nOverall this is an interesting addition to Geometry Wars franchise, but Geometry Wars 2 still sits on the throne. If you are a GW fan, I would recommend this game because it shines in all other aspects. \n\nIf you are looking for other interesting shooter games, I would like to invite you to check our community group on Steam:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/593680\n\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/593680/Rocking_Pilot/\n- Always have to be online, even to play single player. Why?\n\nThis would be a perfect Steam Deck game, but they fucked it up.\n\nUPDATE OCT 20th: So they added off-line mode just for Steam Deck, which is great, but not allowing off-line mode on your PC is strange. Hopefully they update it again.\n- The fact that this VN used to be the highest rated game that hasn't been released outside Japan until, well, it was released outside Japan says it all. A must-buy position for every VN enthusiast and an insteresting position for any other player. Criminally underplayed (~55% of purchased copies haven't been started yet), true hidden gem. Consider buying it when on sale.\n- Pros\n\n- No crates which you can waste your money.\n- You don't pay for the extra maps.\n- Less Russians.\n- Less cheaters.\n- Very alive game (after 16 years).\n- More than 11, 000 active servers (according to Gametracker). \n- You don't need actually PC to play this (you can run it on a Calculator).\n- More mods than games on Steam.\n- You can spray in the game.\n- You can buy MP5.\n- You can use Flashlight and Nightvision.\n- You can choose a character.\n- You can play Assassination mod.\n- You can use Bunnyhop.\n- You can play CSGO MOD.\n\nAnd other stuff I can't remember....\n- Don't let the playtime fool you, I have hundreds of hours of this game on Epic, PS4 and Xbox. Here's the kicker: they actually use Neversoft's old handling code for this remake, so it's exactly as good as you remember it. THPS1+2 has snappy controls, great visuals, the works. Something to thoughtlessly get addicted to, time and time again. \n\nWe'll probably never see a THPS3+4, but cherish this remake, as it shows a great game with great care put into it. It's made by people who really really love the series, and it shows.\n\nGoogle \"THPS Pro\" to get the 3+4 levels into this as a mod, and keep on getting dunked by the pros in Online. The skill ceiling is high, but oh so worth it.\n- I love the Disgaea series (I've owned every game).  I gladly paid full price when it initially came out on PS2.  As the years have gone by, release after release, I find that the core game is pretty much the same.  With that said, these iterative approaches should by no means be priced at what they are.  I'd be semi OK to buy these at $40.  For such a niche genre, the price needs to be more accessible for folks to really want to get into it.\n\nI liked my short time with it, but I'd only recommend it at half price.  Thumbs down for price, which outweighs the thumbs up for a good game.\n- RIP Johnny Gat and your whole 2 minutes of screentime.\nWhile being a good sandbox game on its own merits, SR3 does NOT improve upon SR2 in very many aspects. In fact, they actually removed a lot of content from the previous game, though it's not like most people probably played that.\nGone are choosing more than one type of shirt to wear, or belts. You can no longer use your phone to dial numbers, or call taxis to transport you or ambulances to heal you. They removed a lot of activities as well as a lot of really cool things the other games had. So many, in fact, that I could probably spend a whole paragraph just listing them.\nThis is for a large part subjective, but the gangs in this game are very unimpressive by Saints Row standards. It comes down mostly to character writing, but the characterization on each faction is not good; motivations are usually left vague and most characters introduced besides the replacement Saints members are left undefined with little personality.\nThe game is extremely buggy (compared to the others in the series, although it's not quite Bethesda level) and the netcode is pretty bad too. Playing co-op is often pretty difficult because most actions done by both players will be out of sync with each other.\nAlso, it isn't a well-optimized port for PC. The graphics are sub-par for the most part, but the game still runs like garbage most of the time. Sub-60 FPS on high unless you're playing on a top-of-the-line system (by 2011 standards).\nOh, and one time I switched to one of the radio stations and was given a 2 minute long lecture by the DJ about how I'm \"wasting my life pressing buttons in a murder simulator\" and how I should \"go out and get a girlfriend or something.\" Game just killed itself on anything immersion related for breaking the fourth wall and trying to antagonize me for playing a video game. Ironically enough.\nThanks Volition.\nMost of the DLC in this game is low-quality and overpriced, and most of them except for the mission packs are already on the disk, by the way.\nThe co-op is cool is you have someone to play it with.\n- There is an ethereal beauty to Ori that makes you believe in the power of love. As you play it you know you're experiencing something special that comes around very seldomly and that you should do everything within your power to appreciate it. It feels like a special privilege to play through it. Its a piece of art for the twenty first century. It's a reminder that there still exists impossible beauty in what sometimes feels like a bleak hopeless materialistic world. If you remain steadfast though and look for it, you will find things that will inspire you, things that will give you hope again and things that will remind you of why life is so beautiful and worth fighting for. Don't despair, fight. Fight for Ori and everything she stands for. It's worth it.\n- Game concept is good, but execution is bad. Add to that the attitude of the dev team, and I recommend you don't encourage this kind of community censorship.\n\nDon't buy this. Devs close topics because their fanboys get flamey when you bring up any kind of criticism. Like how the servers with anti-cheat and server saving (which doesn't save player status/location) functions enabled kick all players from the server every 30-60 minutes. I wouldn't mind reconnecting if my location and hunger/thirst got saved during this \"server save\". But apparently trying to open a discussion on the topic is considered flaming and they close down your topic. Horribly handled.\n\n- If you are into space opera, transhumanism, cyperpunk-esque narratives, you're going to have a great time with this one. Even with my rampant ADHD, this game has kept my focus for a lot longer than most games. \n\nThe music is banging and the story is rich and diverse with a lot of awesome twists and turns. \n\nGo and grab your chits and buy some drugs.\n- Bullet hell? Check.\nAwesome animations? Check.\nBoss fights? Check.\nSongs from favorite artists? Check.\nParty mode? Check.\nMultiplayer/online mode? Check.\nBest physics? Check.\nOk that list is good... for now\n- On January 9th,  without warning, explanation, or justification, and lacking all sense of logic, Capcom forcefully reset customizable ingame key-binds and removed the ability to rebind them. These new forced and [b][u]locked[/u][/b] key-binds are extremely biased in favor of [i]right-hand-dominant, able-handed[/i] persons and can not be remapped or swapped. However, as this function has been revoked from PC keyboard/mouse customers, it has been ADDED for console controllers. \n\nCapcom has yet to address or even acknowledge this change.\n\n[b]If you are left-handed, handicapped, or for other reasons require customizable mouse/keyboard functions, Capcom has forcefully revoked the ability for you to play this game anymore.[/b]\n- Dandara is inspired by a legendary warrior who fought slavery in Brazil in the 17th Century. The similarities, however, seems to stop at the name and the fact that she is a black woman fighting a vague concept referred in the game as \"opression\". \nThe game mechanics are very unusual as you can`t really move back and forth and the art style is often charming, although sometimes it gets really generic with some enemies  inspired by Egyptian culture (I thought it was supposed to be about Brazil). The difficulty escalates quite suddenly at certain points in the game, and the fact that you have to be standing still at all times to attack your enemies is pretty frustrating. After you get used to the movement in the game, it is quite fun to jump around without the frustration of having to walk slowly through a huge map as you do in some games of the genre, especially before getting upgrades that allow you to teleport or move faster.\n The story and dialogues could also have been polished a little more. Everything is very vague making it feel a little bit like a waste of an interesting idea. Dandara is a little rough around the edges, but  pretty unique for a metroidvania style game. Worth checking out.\n- This game has such a HUGE potential like Stardew Valley in its early days!!\nCollecting stuff, helping people by crafting potions its so rewarding and lovely pls dear developers keep working on it. I BEG YOU! :D\nSure it has some bug right now but even on day one they managed to get some fast fixes and tried their best to make it work for everyone. \nThe controls were a bit tricky in the beginning (used Playstation 5 Controller) but its just a matter of time, its just not the normal controls like in other games.\nThe music was pretty nice and chill and also the animations were super cute, i love watching little Rubrum built his sandcastles over and over again. >3< \n\nOverall a good game, but could become even more better in the future, keep going guys!!\n- I do think the Mixed review rating is justified, but for the wrong reasons.\nHere are a few pro's and con's from someone who's been a long-time fan and played every Dirt game except the first one.\n\nPRO:\n+ Handling and physics are alright on both \"Gamer\" and \"Simulation\" settings\n+ Decent soundtrack\n+ Building and leveling up your staff and garage gives the game more depth\n\nCON:\n- Horrendously inconsistent AI. In roughly 15 years of playing racing games I've never seen AI as inconsistent as in this game. I played on \"Tough\" and could complete some races with a 10+ second gap, while others were quite literally impossible. This is because of the auto generated track system - unlike in the previous Dirt games, the AI never actually drives on the track, but stage times are auto-generated by how an AI *would* likely perform on a stage. \n- Lack of tracks / Boring tracks. As mentioned, there are no proper tracks for Rally events as they are auto-generated. While the tech behind it is quite impressive, this leaves most tracks feeling incredibly dull with no highlights or features whatsoever. Remember the cool cliff sides from Greece in Dirt Rally? None of these here. Essentially all tracks feel the same no matter what the location is. Couple that with the fact that there are only 5 locations and you'll find yourself bored quite quickly. Rallycross and Landrush tracks are not auto generated, but feel incredibly boring and forgettable. Baja or Malaysia in Dirt 2 were such a blast, but Dirt 4? Yawn.\n- Historical Rally. In its entirety. It's just normal Rally with older cars, but after a while I refused to continue this event type as the events are dragged out as hell. Near the middle you'll have to complete 12 events with each 5 stages. That's 60 stages in total. Consider my previous point about tracks feeling dull and I can't help but wonder who actually completed all these events. This seems to be a Codemasters thing though as I had the same issue with Grid Autosport.\n- Menuing. Why is it that I need to go out of the career every time I want to buy a car? Why is selecting sponsors (which you'll do often as they expire after awhile) in the same category where you can customize your car? Everything is a huge mess and finding the right things took me more time than it should every time.\n+ Lack of rewards. I actually found Joyride, which isn't part of the main career, to be the most fun thing to do in the game. Even though the events in Joyride repeat frequently but with different cars, it was a proper challenge compared to the career and is somehow quite addicting. The issue with it is that it's meaningless to complete. You don't get anything for getting a Gold medal on everything, not even new liveries or, heck, even an achievement. It's utterly pointless.\n\nAll in all this game is easily the weakest entry in the franchise (minus Dirt 1 maybe, but that one had a way smaller budget). To top it off it just feels like this game has no soul either. I vividly remember Dirt 2's gritty and colorful presentation, while this one lacks anything I could remember the game by. Really all this game made me want to do is play Dirt 2 or Dirt Rally again. Cheers and thanks for reading.\n- Black Mesa is a fantastic remake of the Original Valve classic and one of the greatest of all time video games, Half-Life.  This sci-fi classic FPS has you take on what might seem like a hum-drum day in the life of an experimental physicist, but things go quite off rails when experimenting with a strange material sample from an even stranger dude in a suit. \n\nAfter a while (and shooting a lot of aliens and bashing their heads in with a crowbar) you'll save the world... but now Black Mesa lets you do this with dramatically updated graphics, 4K support and a plethora of visual tweaks so you can rest assured this will run great on any gaming rig. \n\nA must have for big fans of Half-Life or gamers who are new to the scene and never got to play the original.   When on sale, of course!\n- Overall its a great hunting game. The base game is good enough on its own to give you an enjoyable experience hunting several varieties of animals. \n\nI feel that some of the best content is in the DLC's. I dont mind the price tag for maps are they are just a large and some of them have a truly diverse animal population. \n\nThe Weapon Packs have some items that really should have been available in the base game (.22 rifle).\nTripod stands, Tents and ATV's are also DLC items that i feel should have been included in the base game. \n\nThe cost for these packs are not huge, and I have bought them, but they really do impact your play in a meaningful way so it is hard not feel like they were left out on purpose. \n\nBeing a former hunter in real life I would say that the realism of it is pretty good. Lung shots and heart shots drop animals quickly and using the right ammo along with good aim greatly influences this. A poor shot will leave you tracking this wounded animal across the map till you sneak up on it again or just give up. \n\nThey have a system called Tru Racks (sumthn like that) that simulates different qualities of animals. So you end up with little bucks, average bucks, and monster bucks. Weight and coloration plays a part in this too. In short every animal has a trophy of some kind and they are varied by what must be some sort of RNG. \n\nAll that having been said, this game can devolve into a shooting gallery were you kill everything on sight as there in no real incentive not to. You get money and experience for every kill you claim and wiping out a heard of deer with your DLC M1 Garand on your DLC Tripod Stand becomes the quickest way to bypass the grind.\n\n It feels like the game starts as a \"hunting sim\" and becomes a \"poaching sim\" once you realize the progression system is going to take a long time to do...\"ethically?\".\n\n\nAgain, this is a game i would recommend, but it is just that, a game. \n\n\n- One of the better RPG maker games i've seen and played, especially considering it was made on RPG Maker 2003. The beginning of the game was great and felt like there was a ton of potential, but a lot of the overworld mechanics were underutilized (jumping, swimming, orb flying). The writing was alright in the beginning, but started to turn into a bad fanfic in the middle/end of the game. The ending was... wholly unsatisfying and abrupt. It made very little sense, and did absolutely nothing to answer any questions asked at any point in the game, rather asking brand new questions and providing no resolution for any of the characters. You'll get about 10-14 hours of this game, which is kind of amazing for an RPG maker game, but honestly, steam has SOOOO many better titles available in this price range that unless you're into RPG maker, you should go elsewhere.\n- Something I've been needing to get off my chest, despite how much maxis and EA go on about how much they care for the LGBTQ community, it's clear to me that they don't. First if they did they wouldn't be pushing the community the whey and as hard as they have. When things get pushed like they are, hateful people just harden there harts more, and just become infuriated. The sympathetic the become hatful towards it. The more something gets pushed, after awhile the more it gets hatted. A better approach would be, (if they really did care,) would be to put what they are talking about into a FREE pack, and get people whom make amazing custom content to contribute to it. If there is enough nice stuff in the pack people will download it, and talk people whom are on the fence to download it, and maybe to come over, and might start to get the people on the other side to at least get on the fence. That whey the LGBTQ community would get there representation, and acceptance would be pushed in a whey that won't burn people out.\n\n\nAnother resin why they should do it like this, and is part of why people are getting mad, is that they bought this game a certain whey, paid a lot for it and it's DLC, now they are changing, it and braking it to do so. Changing the experience against there will. Evan something you love like chocolate, or bacon, or anything will become something you hate if it's shoved down your throat ageist you will. If you want people to take it just offer it, most of the time people will take it. And if they don't just make it just make it more appealing. IE instead of braking the main game to add something even the LGBTQ community can't enjoy with a broken game. Make a free pack, and to tempt more people to get the pack, just add more nice CAS and build mode stuff. And maybe update the pack and add more stuff to it every once in awhile.\n\n\nI just had to say this for two resins, one companies being this careless or ignorant is just killing the public sentiment for LGBTQ and similar groups. And two, they are just killing interest in what they are selling, it will cut the Sims 4's life short, and will cut the Sims 5's life much, much sorter. \nIt's good to give options, as long as they are options. Or you are just like Hennery Ford, “The people can have the model T in any color! so long as it's black.”\n\n- I am a Filthy Casual (tm) who plays games like Mass Effect and Fallout 4 on easy and still die over and over. I got my \"you died\" achievement in Dark Souls 2 before the tutorial and stopped playing after like forty minutes with zero qualms. I have rage quit every single platformer game I have ever touched, and just sort of despise brutally hard things that feel like chores.\n\nBasically, I am not exactly sure why I decided to buy Dead Cells in the first place. Sure, I love the look and one of the few platformers I've ever 100%'d was Super Metroid (with a LOT of swearing and rage quitting), so 'Metroidvania' is an appealing term to me, but it is still inherently marketed as a game that is not for me, or people like me.\n\nThis game is hard. I have 11 hours on it and I can't get past the third area on any given path. I die for stupid reasons and lose all my stuff and... I don't care. I haven't rage quit once; in fact, I have to force myself away from the game after a death so I can do things like eat. I find the combat engaging and entertaining, the progression satisfying and there's something really solid about being forced to start from square one (ish) every single time, in a way I've just never experienced.\n\nSo, sure, buy this if you love hard games/Dark Souls/no checkpoint kind of games. Absolutely, I'm pretty sure you've alreeady heard this is likely to be up your alley.\n\nBut even if you're a dirty rotten casual gamer who button smashes in any game approaching action, and panics when the screen flashes red around the edges... give it a try if you get the opportunity. It is seriously fun.\n- For those of you still harbouring hesitations about \"walking simulators\"...here's one I'd definitely recommend you try.\n\n   So yes, it's quite linear, and no, it probably doesn't have an enormous amount of replayability. It's also quite short - about two to three hours - so I guess it's not that cheap at twenty buckaroonies. It is, however, one of the strongest examples of interactive storytelling you will ever enjoy, and an oddly varied experience given the bits of the game in which you briefly get to play the roles of cats, owls, and...well, I don't want to give too much away. Let's just say Tim Burton would be jealous (seeing what a boring old hack he's become these days).\n\n   For anyone who loves a good story in a game, with a willingness to sacrifice a bit of agency in order to have that superior narrative experience...it's a bit of a no-brainer. As for the rest of you, well: you only live once. And they do say variety is the spice of life. So if you only try one walking simulator before dismissing the entire genre, this could well be the one. Truly magical, wonderful stuff. And a bit of a tear-jerker at times, too.\n\nVerdict: 9.5/10.\n\n(PS Anyone claiming there is no \"gameplay\" in this title is either a drooling idiot, or hasn't played the game in its entirety. There's interaction and \"mini-games\" aplenty.)\n- ---{ Graphics }---\n☐ You forget what reality is\n☐ Beautiful\n☐ Good\n☐ Decent\n☐ Bad\n☑ Don‘t look too long at it\n☐ MS-DOS\n\n---{ Gameplay }---\n☐ Very good\n☐ Good\n☐ It's just gameplay\n☑ Mehh\n☐ Watch paint dry instead\n☐ Just don't\n\n---{ Audio }---\n☑ Eargasm\n☐ Very good\n☐ Good\n☐ Not too bad\n☐ Bad\n☐ I'm now deaf\n\n---{ Audience }---\n☑ Kids\n☑ Teens\n☑ Adults\n☑ Grandma\n\n---{ PC Requirements }---\n☑ Check if you can run paint\n☐ Potato\n☐ Decent\n☐ Fast\n☐ Rich boi\n☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{ Difficulty }---\n☐ Just press 'W'\n☐ Easy\n☐ Easy to learn / Hard to master\n☐ Significant brain usage\n☑ Difficult\n☐ Dark Souls\n\n---{ Grind }---\n☐ Nothing to grind\n☑ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n☐ Isn't necessary to progress\n☐ Average grind level\n☐ Too much grind\n☐ You'll need a second life for grinding\n\n---{ Story }---\n☑ No Story\n☐ Some lore\n☐ Average\n☐ Good\n☐ Lovely\n☐ It'll replace your life\n\n---{ Game Time }---\n☑ Long enough for a cup of coffee\n☐ Short\n☐ Average\n☐ Long\n☐ To infinity and beyond\n\n---{ Price }---\n☐ It's free!\n☐ Worth the price\n☐ If it's on sale\n☐ If u have some spare money left\n☐ Not recommended\n☑ You could also just burn your money\n\n---{ Bugs }---\n☐ Never heard of\n☐ Minor bugs\n☐ Can get annoying\n☐ ARK: Survival Evolved\n☑ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n---{ ? / 10 }---\n☐ 1\n☑ 2\n☐ 3\n☐ 4\n☐ 5\n☐ 6\n☐ 7\n☐ 8\n☐ 9\n☐ 10\n\n\n\n\n- PC version doesn't have rebindable controls for controller for some reason\n\nupdate: i have finished the game, still no rebindable controls, i can give a real review now. i wouldn't rate it negative but i wouldn't rate it positive either. this is a \"eh\" review.\n\nthe game is two games at once and neither of them are great.\n\n the roguelike part is like 20% of the game and is very simple and shallow, there's like 5 weapons and they all play the same, its also super easy. its ok but its not as good as a real roguelike.\n\n the cult building part is 80% of the game and is a bit more fun but past the earlygame its a bit eh too. choosing what you get doesn't really matter since you'll unlock everything pretty fast, and the doctrines 90% of the time are a choice between 2 useless things and 10% of the time a choice between a busted thing and a useless thing. the randomly generated quests the followers give you are just chores like revisiting old dungeons you already completed and the reward is pretty much nothing. its ok but its not as good as a real colony builder.\n\nnone of the systems in either part of the game are particularly deep.\n\nas of the time of this review, the game is still quite glitchy, though being patched by the devs.\n\nthe game is about 15 hours with side content and 18 hours for a completionist run. no real replayability \n\ni'd just recommend you get a full on action roguelike if you want to play a roguelike, or a full on colony builder if you want to play a colony builder. this game does both but is not great at either of them. \n\n game is very cute tho and the soundtrack is great. like 5/10\n- 100%'ed the LUCT version of the game and I'm slowly working my way through this version now.\n\nOver all the game itself is solid. If you're reading this, its a brilliant tactics game that helped define the genre. However most of the changes they made in reborn, while innovative, ultimately feel constraining. \n\nFor example, they've limited spell slots to 4, so you can only ever take 4 different spells. One or two of which (missile + indirect) are taken by a damage spell of your choice, leaving you with even less spell customization than you'd think. And its unfortunately the same situation with skills, as one will always be taken up by your weapon skill. \n\nThe cards that drop in battle, while an interesting system on paper, just end up cluttering the field most of the time, often with auto-skill activation up, which most of your units won't even really want compared to the other options. \n\nRandom battles were also removed, limiting chances to recruit to a few key dungeons as well as removing some of the more amusing battle locations from the game. \n\nI've also seen some people complain about the level cap, but in my current play-though of the game, it isn't too much of a concern for me, but it may be for others. \n\nOver all, it just feels like they've taken a step back from what Tactics ogre: Let us cling together, gave us. Yes there's bloat in that version, but it also gave us a feeling of freedom when we were putting our teams together that this version lacks. I am grateful that we saw a remake of this game within my lifetime, but I wish they had improved on Luct, rather than take steps back from it. \n\nIf they ever increase the amount of spells and/or skills you can take, to like 6-8, then I'd probably switch my review to a yes. But until then, with a heavy heart I have to say that this version just isn't as good as Luct so far.\n- The good:\n+ Great story with satisfying finale.\n+ Endearing main cast/characters.\n+ Great world building meets with 90s Indonesia culture.\n+ Pleasant pixel artstyle. The cutscenes visual is amazing, even though i notice few awkward animation.\n+ Nice soundtrack.\n+ Puzzle is mostly well balanced. Not too difficult and doesn't make you feel bored/annoyed either.\n\nThe bad: - \n\nThe ugly:\n* Some pacing problem. There are so many sidetrack a.k.a. \"To complete sub-task C you also must complete sub-sub-task X, Y and Z\" during chapter 2-4.\n* Sometimes you might have to going around in circles to solve certain task or accidentally skipped something.\n\nDespite few flaws, A Space for the Unbound is definitely best game developed by Mojiken Studio and best story-driven/adventure game among all games created by Indonesian developer. If you like side-scrolling/adventure game (such as GRIS, Unreal Life or Oneshot) or game made by Mojiken Studio/Toge production (such as Coffee Talk or When The Past Was Around), you should give this game a try.\n- You know that feeling when you are hesitant to buy a game because you're worried you might waste your money on something that might be a crap game in the end, get boring, and not sure if you should believe all the ratings because you dont know if everyone has the same interests and likes as you? well this game is the bomb diggity, straight up. Made by the same people who made rollercoaster tycoon and man did they deliver on this. For me it's the small things in a game that matter and did they really take the time to make sure this was as polished as it could be. Not sure if anyone remembers when they announced another rollercoaster tycoon a while back, and everyone was super excyited to find out what it was, and it ended up being some dumbass phone app? Well imagine all that excyitment, but instead of them coming out with that stupid app they came out with this bad boy. This is exactly what everyone was wishing and hoping for (just different name). Do I reccomend you buy this game? hell yes. will it be exactly what you are wishing for when you fist clicked this game to see the game play and reviews? sure as cocks will. But will it be just as fun as the original?.... YOU BET YOUR MOMS TITS IT WILL BE. \n\nPROS:                                \nbeen one since 1990\n\nCons:\nYou'll never know how fun it is till you buy it.\n- Ratchet & Clank is always fun. The older games are clearly better, as it feels like the more modern they get, the shallower and simpler they become. They now feel almost like a demo of a game - you just get to dip your toe into each of the systems, never really fully engaging with any of them. New abilities are just thrown at you with no fanfare, and then you only need them 3 times, and it never asks you to combine them in new ways. Everything feels underwhelming and tossed aside shortly after being introduced. That's almost the theme of the game - they even have Ratchet meeting a fellow Lombax for the first time ever, the thing he has been focused on since game 1, and it's pretty much just \"hi, let's go do the next thing.\" The series has been casualized, just as neutered as their formerly innuendo-laden titles. \n\nBut it's still fun to play, it's just lacking the magic it used to have.\n- Gameplay is similar to Hades. The story isn't as rich as Hades, but it's still pretty good. More forgiving than Hades, that's for sure. You see where I'm going with this - Hades is 10/10, the roguelike to compare/to beat. On a scale of 10 hades, I'd give this game a 7.5/10 Hades.\n- Pros:\n> Decent selection of interior desing elements\n> Uncommon but interesting gameplay idea if you're into interior design and building\n> Fair price for amount of activities you get in base game\n> Gameplay leght\n> Regural updates\n\nCons:\n> You can't change location of windows in the house - some are placed in awkward places thus creating decent rooms becomes difficult\n> Game optimisation is questionable for such graphics  -  with RX vega 56 I barely get 60 fps \n> No replayability on same save file - once you sell property you cannot do it again\n> Once property is sold there's only some screenshots but no actual way to look around again\n> No steam workshop or mods\n\nIdeas for possible future updates:\n> Add floor plan design feature - building and demolishing walls 10 times is frustrating\n> Add ability to build custom houses and change locations of windows\n> Add ability to enter sold properties\n> Increase game performance\n\nDLCs:\n> HGTV DLC adds moderate amount of additional jobs\n> Garden DLC adds alot of activities outside the house but is a bit buggy. In my opinion some features should be in base game\n- First steps:\n-set nioh.exe and nioh_launcher.exe to win7 compatibility (if you experience crashes).\n-first level (London) is poorly optimized, so better rush through it and judge the next.\n-experience this game as Nioh and not as a \"Souls\" game, tho I draw comparisons here\n\n\n[h1]Good[/h1]\n\nCombat\nBy far the best thing about the game. You get 7 weapon classes + 3 ranged weapons, and each of the 7 weapons has it's own unique skillset accompanied by 3 different stances. On the fly switching between 3 stances and 2 weapons, or even both at the same time allows for a ton of combinations to chain different attacks and combos. On top of all that you get magic, spirit guardians and ninjutsu. Sky is the limit if you're willing to experiment.\n\n\nBosses\nThe game comes with roughly over 30 unique bossfights, some of them will reappear or be demoted to regular enemies over the course of the game. There are only very few bosses I didn't like. Most of them are going to be human, but that doesn't mean they are boring. Most have sick movesets that make them very engaging and fun to fight, especially the DLC bosses. \n\n\nDifficulty\nJust like Dark Souls the game is as difficult as you want it to be. This means you get alot of tools that allow you to cheese the game. Like summons, or certain character builds centered around spirit guadians and op magic like sloth talisman which makes enemies move in slow motion. \nThe difficulty curve is a falling one, aka the game is more difficult in the begining when you're figuering things out, then it remains on a steady level with occasional spikes upwards. Disregarding bs like sloth talisman I would say the game is overall more difficult than Dark Souls. Combat is faster and mistakes are punished severly, even human fodder enemies can 1-shot you if you happen to take swings when they are in heavy stance.\n\n\nStory\nIt's decent, but nothing special. Nerds interested in the sengoku period to early edo period \nwill probably appreciate the characters and their interactions.\n\n\nWorld\nIt's not an interconnected world like DS1. It is mission based where you pick main or side missions from a map, personally I don't mind the \"arcade\" style. Main missions themself are big levels with multiple shortcuts that loop back to shrines (bonfires). Those levels are bigger than most designated areas in DS3, my guess is like 1.5x-2x the size. If I had to rank the level design... DS1 >>>> DS3 > Nioh >>>>>>> DS2 \n\n\nReplayability\nThe game offers 4 NG difficulties which spice things up by switching enemy placements or giving enemies (and bosses) status effects and new moves. Other than that you get Abyss mode which is most comparable to DMC's bloody palace. \n\n\nMultiplayer/Netcode + pseudo PvP\n3 ways to play mutiplayer: as summon/summoner, co-op missions where both players make progress at the same time and PvP (which is dead).  The Netcode worked quite well for me, even over wide distances like brazil-germany. I never had to adjust for delay and could parry attacks just like offline.  The netcode is quite good imo compared to DS3 where I did lots of co-op at Champion Gundyr and parrying was totally out of the question.\n\n\nThe other \"pvp mode\" is the faction/clan system. You get multiple clans that belong to 1 of the 2 factions. A clan gives you 2 passive buffs that can compliment your playstyle. You obtain glory by killing revenants, succesfull co-op or pvp for your clan. The more glory you obtain, the higher the rank of your faction, clan and yourself. Glory acts as another currency and can be used to buy npc skins, gestures or items.\n\n\nFashion Souls\nLike the look of a particular light armor set but hate getting insta killed by radroaches? No problem, at the blacksmith you can transform any weapon skin or piece of armor, and keep the stats of your preferred equipment. If you get tired of playing as William you can buy npc skins for glory at the teahouse (unlocks at roughly 33% of the game) which is the only way to play as a female as there is no character creation.\n\n[h1]Bad[/h1]\n\nEnemy Variaty\nThe games biggest weakness in my opinion.  Enemy \"species\" come in different flavours, e.g. humans can wield any of the 7 weapons, however this doesn't realy trigger the visual stimulation of seeing something new. Saving grace: the game throws you into different 1vsX situations, so the combination of enemies keeps things interesting, kinda like DMC4 which also has wack enemy variety. I think they could've done much more in terms of creativity when it comes to the yokai/oni realm given the huge amount of lore.\n\n\nRepetition\nSide missions take place in mostly the same batch of areas or in parts of main missions. \nThey try to keep things fresh by switching enemies and spawn points. But they still feel kinda tedious because skipping them isn't realy an option as you can't deny yourself the experience, rewards and loot.\n\n\nMusic\nGood but gets repetitive as only few themes are shared across bosses.\n\n\nFunky Optimization\nSelf explainatory. FPS tanks in London and I had random crashes. The later were solved by the tips mentioned at the top of the review.\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nI found the combat mechanics to be more than able to compensate for the games weaknesses (repetition, enemy variety). This means you've to take up responsibility and be creative yourself. If you're the type who doesn't like experimenting and spends 90% of his time with spear in mid stance, and plays like its DS (dodge > R1 > R1 > dodge > R1 > dodge...), then you're gonna get bored quickly. Although, I've seen those guys during co-op all the way up to NG3-4, so who knows... .\n- If you look past all of the stale \"The Cake Is A Lie\" memes, you have your self a pretty clean cut, innovative experience. Portal may only last a few short hours, but it provides friendships (with your Companion Cube) and a bitter thirst for revenge against a mysterious voice within an equally mysterious facility. If you have not picked it up already, I would suggest this gem as the next part of your Steam library.\n- Undoubtedly one of the best if not THE BEST modern video game remaster out there. I will summarize the pros and cons of this remaster into the following:\n\n[b]The Good:[/b]\n\n- Totally seamless transition into the new modern 4K visual from the old classic Win95 at a push of a key\n- Extremely faithful to the original titles (some might say that it is perhaps TOO faithful)\n- Game \"installation\" screen when you first boot up for both Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert is filled with God tier nostalgia \n- New UI with a complete revamp of the sidebar complete with higher quality artwork that totally feels in place\n- Plethora of never-before-seen bonus contents including exclusive missions and cinematic cutscenes for Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert that was only available on certain console platforms\n- You can queue multiple units while in production now\n- New multiplayer features and service is great. Finally you can now play 1v1 ranked and spectate any previous matches that was played including spectating ongoing games in the lobby\n- You can add, remove and create your very own custom music tracks in-game for both Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert however you want\n- All of Frank Klepacki's overly iconic classical and remixed tracks are here including various modern remixed that was composed solely for this remastered collection!!!\n\n[b]The Bad:[/b]\n\n- Minor bugs (though not a real dealbreaker)\n- The gameplay meta among factions/units remains as unbalanced as ever. Kinda of a tradeoff for being too faithful to the original titles\n- Multiplayer is still officially limited to a maximum of 4 players total per map in Tiberium Dawn, while in Red Alert the limit is a maximum of 8 players total\n- FMV cutscenes are all still heavily compressed in SD resolution extracted from the Playstation home console version and further artificially enhanced via AI upscaling due to the fact that the original master footage tapes for both Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert are still yet to be found\n\n[b]The Kinda Ugly:[/b]\n\n- Certain mission on hard difficulty are completely unbalanced. This is already another insult to injury as the AI blatantly cheats when it comes to resource procurement and unit build time. The fault of a clear lack of playtesting\n- Full disclosure: I'm not a racing guy. I'm not a car guy, even. My extent of car knowledge begins and ends at \"vroom-vroom go that way.\"\n\nBut that's all you need to know for this game. I can tune the holy bejeezus out of a million sliders that mean absolutely nothing to me, or I can just equip a premade setting by someone who does and suddenly the vroom-vrooms are *better*. Not sure when to brake or start a turn? Easy, there's a friendly line. Follow the line, make less vroom-vrooms when it's red, everything's gravy. Don't have the reaction time to follow the line? You can slow the game down until it's at a pace where you can. Incredible.\n\nYou can be as serious as you want with it. Me, I'm taking my van that's dolled up to look like the Mystery Machine and ramping it off a volcano.\n- [h1]One of the few multiplayer games that reminds me that people can be amazing[/h1]\n\nI've been playing games for a long time, I've seen some sh*t. I've seen people crumble, I've lost friends, I've watched people eat each other even when they are winning. When people are supposed to be working together and yet they would rather treat their ally like trash because they refuse to take the blame for their own wrongdoing.\n\nSquad is a game in which I have seen true potential. A group of 40 individuals work together to plan, execute, and accomplish masterful plans to outsmart their enemy. I've seen teams rally from the depths of defeat and flip unwinable games into incredible victories. Heros emerging from the storm of mortars landing upon their bunker, to squad leaders risking their own lives to save those of their squad.\n\nSquad is not a game for the light hearted. To enjoy squad to the fulllest, you must communicate, work together, and form a bond with the soldiers at your side. You are a team, you are a unit, and you will never win alone. Be it a medic patching the wounds of your comrades, a logistics driver supplying your team with the supplies they need at the front line, or a squad leader putting the responsibility of 8 individuals on your shoulders, each person is a vital component of the team.\n\nFor this reason, Squad has now become my most played game on steam. The depth, the people, the comraderie, it's an amazing experience that no other game captures. I encourage you all to try it out on a free weekend as I originally did, I have been playing it ever since.\n\nI'll see you on the front line.\n- As someone who has played the PS2 version roughly 3 years after release, I enjoyed myself. Then I saw that there was an HD remaster. Thought the game was possibly a bit overrated for a remaster, but got it and remembered why I enjoyed it after about halfway through the first level. I even enjoyed it a bit more than the first time around, since I appreciated the way the sound effects synced with the music a bit more the second time. Now Rez Infinite comes out, and the cycle repeats itself...\n\nBut this time, I'm wearing a f**king VR helmet. As someone who played many VR titles before this, and as someone who wanted this game, but put off playing it for full price... it lives up to the hype (it might help that this is the first time actually wearing headphones with it too...) Especially the Area X level. Holy crap especially that level. I only wish it were longer, and I see myself replaying that level alone many times in the future.\n\nThe gameplay may seem a bit dated to some, and it is short. But damn it, it earns it's classic status and it still holds up today. Decent gameplay that grows on you, cool sound track helped immensely by the cool way the sound effects play a part of the song, and great visuals all combine to explain how this game is pretty much the start of any cliche \"games are art\" speech. If you never played it and don't have VR, it's worth $15 (I'm sure. Haven't played this on the flatscreen, but I spent $15 on Rez HD I think, and I didn't regret it). If you have VR and any sort of nostalgia for this game, you probably wouldn't hate yourself buying it at full price, even if you're as cheap as me. If you only kind of liked the game before but didn't really see what the fuss was about, the ten or so minutes of Area X will probably show you why this game has such a cult following. \n\nAnd if you're a Rez fanatic? You'd spend $50 on Area X and still say you got your money's worth, short as it is.\n- The latest S tier Deckbuilder Roguelike, joining the ranks of Slay the Spire and Monster Train for me. I think that's all that really needs to be said.\n\nIt leans heavily into kiss/curse type effects, if you like the ability to manipulate rng and do some busted stuff with your sequencing you will love it. It is more of a thinker on a turn to turn basis than other games of this genre, but if that isn't a turn off then it's a really solid game with some unique characters/mechanics that feel fresh.\n- >Be me\n>Move to new city for job offer\n>Go straight to bed when I arrive, but still oversleep and miss meeting with business contact\n>Have a message, but no contact information, so at suggestion of greasy hotel guy, I start randomly asking people on the street and café if they’re who I’m looking for\n>No luck, but random stranger points me to a club\n>Meet a cool chick who actually doesn’t treat me like a jerk\n>She has a boyfriend\n>Sad feelings\n>She invites me to a cool party anyway\n>Second person I talk to gives me a drink that really messes me up\n>Black out within first half hour of party\n>Wake up at cool chick’s house, she’s on her way to work\n>For some reason when I try to talk to her, I come across as a total stalker type.\n>Go to sleep\n>Next day, watch a train crash over some sort of secret agent\n>Mysterious hooded figure shows up, looms over g-man, then flees\n>Finally, some content, I think\n>Follow mysterious figure\n>Go into store, chase her into the basement\n>Door locks behind her\n>Weird guy there, gives me some backstory I promptly forget\n>Ask him every question that comes to me, but it won’t advance the plot\n>Wander around, not sure what to do\n>Not having fun\n>Meet a cool guy\n>He gives me a hacking device\n>Tells me he’ll teach me how to use it some other time\n>So much waiting\n>Finally run into guy who hired me and told me to move to this town\n>Tells me I’m fired\n>Go back to club\n>See cool chick\n>(only one of two people who actually treats me like a human being)\n>Talk to her\n>She calls me a stalker, I’m not sure why\n>Unable to defend myself\n>Weird basement guy tells me not to worry, invites me to another party\n>All I do is wander around and go to parties\n>Flashbacks of my real 20’s\n>Kill time until party by opening random doors and hacking a frying pan\n>Maybe I started a fire\n>Pass out in front of weird laser gate\n>Did I get electrocuted, or did I just fall asleep?\n>Go back to party\n>Weird guy tells me to loosen up and talk to girls\n>Girls all give me cold shoulder\n>Against better judgement, I drink several beers\n>Carry empties around with me because I can’t set them on counter\n>Weird guy tells me about a test\n>Won’t tell me how to take test, where to take test, or what I need to know to pass test\n>Worst party ever\n>Cool chick shows up again\n>She’s actually happy to see me\n>Try not to sound like stalker, kinda succeed, but I think I’m missing half the conversation\n>Also, I think cool chick might have a drinking problem\n>Me too, I’m staggering around\n>Drink coffee to try and sober up\n>Doesn’t work\n>Not having fun\n>Leave party\n>Kick lamp\n>Go to bed\n>Not tired enough to fall asleep\n>Wander around town, stumbling drunk, at 5 AM\n>Flashbacks to a dark time in my real life\n>Take drugs so time passes faster, flashbacks intensify\n>Talk to strangers since what else am I supposed to do\n>No one wants to talk to me\n>Cringingly accurate simulator of awkward college party years\n>Not fun game\n\nI hear from other reviews that this game starts to pick up after this point, but I can't do it anymore. I've already invested a lot of time and energy into this game for little to no return. I'm not going to study guides and waste more time on this game just so I can dig the nuggets of fun out of this wasted youth simulator. I will say that it did a really good job of making me role-play an awkward alcoholic with no job prospects and zero understanding of how to talk to women, living out of a ****** hotel room. But I've already played the real life version of that, so I can't recommend it. If you want to play a fun game about programming, go with Human Resource Machine. If you want a good role-playing game about hackers, go with Shadowrun. If you want to pay money and spend your leisure time feeling really depressed about your 20's, then I can recommend Else Heart.Break(), but maybe you'd be better off talking to a friend about it instead.\n- I had the privilege of playing a game that provided an immersive and emotional experience set during the Great Patriotic War. This game, which I highly recommend. From the moment you start playing, it's evident that the developers spared no effort in recreating the atmosphere of the era. \nOne aspect that truly impressed me was the game's narrative. The storylines, filled with genuine human drama.\nI also must commend the game's sound design.\n- Great game for the most part.\nI do not like how they made a rpg with twitch aspects though.\nMy characters are supposed to be strong and agile not me on the keyboard.\nDo not expect to beat the island master(2nd ending) unless your very agile with your fingers.\nAt 50 years old it is impossible to get him down past 3/4 health.\nToo much twich and not enough character skill.\nGames like might and magic you never had to be agile with the keyboard.\nGuess this one goes under my \"Ending too hard category\"\n- Edit 2 (9/24/22): The devs have made several updates now to address some of the UI problems. And right now, the in battle experience is greatly improved, especially when not using a mouse. It's good enough that I'm having fun playing it now, and am looking forward to seeing more of it so I'm reversing the thumb on this review. However, the experience remains decidedly clunky, especially with a mouse and especially out of combat. Overall, to anyone who is expecting a modern game with modern usability and controls, this game is not for you. But if you don't mind those things so much, this game has some real meat on its bones. It also has delightful music and sound. I'm leaving the original review here, as I hope the devs will continue to improve on the usability of the game so that everyone can enjoy it fully. If you're playing on keyboard and mouse, I'd recommend using the option that disables the mouse, the jank doesn't feel as bad when you're not clicking\n\nEdit: The devs have taken this feedback very seriously, I'm keeping a close eye on this game to see when things change so I can give this game another go.\n\nAgh... I really want to like this game. The customization and squad building seems like it will get really cool in the later parts of the game. But I don't think I'm going to make it to the later parts of the game. Why? Because the UI and controls are so frustrating. Camera movement is frustrating, selecting units is frustrating, distinguishing between your units is difficult, managing your squads is frustrating, promoting your characters is confusing, even attacking is a pain in the butt. Every time I go to do anything there's always some interface or controls issue in my way. And every time I finish a map and have to go do the in-between battles management, I know the UI will fight me every step of the way. \n\nMy thoughts on what should change:\n\nOut of battle:\n- On the \"Organize Army\" screen, I shouldn't need to click \"Squad Operations\" first to look at a squad. Simply clicking a squad should do that.\n- When returning to \"Organize Army\" from a squads view, \"Squad Operations\" is deselected, and has to be clicked again.\n- It is not possible to scroll the squad list without clicking \"Squad Operations\"\n- When I am in one mode on the squad screen (say \"Move Unit\") I can't switch to another mode by clicking the appropriate button, I have to cancel first.\n- When changing classes, there is not a clear enough indicator on the version of the unit I need to click that shows it has an upgrade available.\n- When changing classes, an extra click is required for no reason (and with no UI indication) before the upgrade options are viewable.\n- When changing classes, it should be easier to see what the next tier options will be for that class.\n- There should be a way to quickly view and either upgrade or sleep for a year all units who have class mastery between battles, so I don't have to check every squad.\n- From the Organize Army screen, there is no way to see a squad's capacity, so you have to click into every squad to see if you can add another unit.\n- When equipping an artifact, the first empty slot should be selected automatically.\n- When equipping an artifact, if I click the item first and then the slot, that should work. Drag and drop would be nice too.\n- On unit details screens (such as Unit Status or Change Class) there should be derived stats, that let me see how much damage the unit does / resists. As is, it's hard to tell what my stats are doing for me.\n- Unit traits should show a tooltip saying what they do when you hover or click the name or icon, I shouldn't need to go to another page for that.\n- Affinities should show a tooltip saying what they do when you hover or click them, I shouldn't have to go all the way to the game manual for that.\n- When using an item, I should be able to see my list of items before selecting which unit I want to use it on.\n- When using an item, an extra click is needed before you can select the item, for no reason.\n- There should be a better visual indicator on the squad screen of who the squad leader is.[strike]Right now Jules looks identical to the archers on either side of him.[/strike]\n- In the marketplace, if I've clicked on \"Recruit\", and want to switch to buying items, I should be able to click direclty on \"Trader\" and vice-versa, without needing to cancel first.\n- When recruiting units, there should be a way to lock a units stats in place so I can look at their traits without accidentally mousing over another units name and switching it.\n- There should be a way to see what the deploy limit for the upcoming battle is, so I can organize my squads appropriately, without needing to go back to the battle prep screen after seeing it.\n- The mouse scroll wheel doesn't work on the game manual / tutorial pages\n\nIn Battle:\n- There should be a way to move the camera with the keyboard without moving the targeting cursor (this is necessary if I want to move the camera while still having my hand on the mouse)\n- It should be possible to move the camera with the mouse by left-click dragging, instead of having to bring the mouse near the edge of the screen (this is especially vital in windowed mode)\n- There should be a toggle to turn off the need to select \"Move\" for moving units on capture points\n- There should be a toggle to allow the turn to end automatically when all squads have taken their turn.\n[strike]There should be a hotkey to end the turn.[/strike] (There isn't, but double-tapping space is close to good enough)\n- There should be a hotkey to display the mission info, and the mission info should appear automatically at the start of a map.\n[strike]There should be a hotkey to move to the next unit whose turn is still available, so I don't always have to scan the screen visually for this.[/strike]\n- There should be a way to see a units health (% of units alive, maybe?) and morale at a glance from the battle map. It takes so much time to dig out morale information for each unit by clicking all the way into their unit details.\n[strike]When you hover a unit, their morale needs to appear in the little mini-squad-view that pops up.[/strike]\n- There should be a way to see a tooltip explaining what a piece of terrain does.\n[strike]There should be a way to make an enemy unit's attack range stay visible on the screen so I can plan around it. Ideally, I'd be able to have multiple units selected for this at once, and be able to highlight them in different colors.[/strike]\n- There should be a way to quickly distinguish between squads led by the same unit type at a glance, especially when both squads are led by main characters. [strike]Right now Jules' squad and Narima's squad are identical visually.[/strike]\n- During combat, there should be a clear indicator of which unit is the squad leader.\n- After selecting an attack type, and a squad to target, on the screen that shows the two squads, there should be buttons I can use to change my attack type (such as switching to \"Force Surrender\" after seeing the enemy's morale is low).\n[strike]If I back out of an attack, I should be able to change attack type, or which action I do without the unit undoing their entire turn and deselecting themselves[/strike]\n- On the list of attack types, \"Force Surrender\" should have an indicator of what the surrender chance is, so I don't have to keep checking it.\n- It should be easier to tell at a glance if a unit has ranged attacks. Especially, some of the icons for cavalry ranged units are hard to identify.\n[strike]When moving units, it would be nice to have a visual indicator for units I can do a charge or ambush attack against[/strike]\n\nGeneral:\n- There need to be better resolution settings. Almost every piece of text in the game is difficult to read on a high resolution monitor.\n- The game needs rebindable controls, it's an accessibility issue.\n\nIf the game sees improvement in this area, I hope to be able to give it another chance and change my review.\n- DLC and Bugs prove this company is Garbage.\n- It's hard to review a game like this.\n\nAs a game in it's own right, if you've never played it before, it's a good game. Typical crazy Final Fantasy story (although it takes a bit to get into it), interesting characters, and simple but fun real-time turn-based combat. Final Fantasy games are known for their stories and characters, which are great in this member of the series.\n\nIf you've played the game before on PS1, then it's good for nostalgia. However, many people complain about it being a bad port. It has built-in cheats, in case you just want to be able to enjoy the story, characters, and side-quests. I played this years ago on PS1, and I really enjoyed my trip down memory lane with this game.\n\nIf you're an achievement hunter, this game is horrible. There are achievements that, unless you're literally following an online scripted step-by-step walkthrough, you will miss some random little thing, not know it, and then have to play the entire game over. Another achievement requires you to speed through the game in under 12 hours, which means you will grind through the game you already played, watching the same story you just watched, all over again, wasting six hours (that's how long it took me), just for the sake of one achievement... There's also another achievement to kill 10k enemies. when you can play the whole game and not even kill 1k enemies... You might think, \"oh they just want you to play the game through 10 times then\". No. It's 10k enemies in one playthrough. You run out of content, and have nothing to do, except grind battles, for literally dozens of hours. It's terrible.\n\nDespite my bitterness about the achievements, it's a really enjoyable game. Considering the FF series are mainly known for their stories, it lives up to its reputation. If you're an RPG fan, this is definitely on the list of \"must plays\".\n- And that's it, after 278 hours of play, the adventure is over... \nThis type of game that you wish you could forget so you could rediscover it like the 1st time, where you discover everything, a bit like a child\nIt's a game made with passion for video games, to tell a story, to make the player laugh too, and to make him a little melancholic or horrified or even sickened sometimes\n\n[u]Divinity OS 2 will have marked my young adult life[/u], like Sonic and megadrive games, Pokémon, FFTactics, Zelda and gameboy / gamecube games, Warcraft3 (TT), or Mass Effect and other PC games did in my childhood and adolescence (I surely forget so much excellent games)\n\nIt's a 20/20 for me. The work is titanic. The game is really made with passion. The studio is very talented.\n\nSo when Steam asks me [i]\"Do you recommend this game\"[/i], I say:\nYes! Because this is where you feel that video games are an experience, an adventure to live! \nI went through Rivellion with my buddy, like I went through Kanto (Pokémon), or Ivalice in FF Tactics as a kid!\n\n\n[u][b]Atmosphere:[/b][/u]\nMany of us probably remember our adventures in Pokémon or other games in our childhood. We roamed, discovered and lived in these worlds!\n\nHere, it's the same thing, and not alone this time: I was with a very good friend! \nWe met frequently to venture into the world of Divinity as a lightning lizard warrior or a skeletal assassin with a mysterious past...\n\nWith our companions Lohse and Ifan, and Maladie, and Gareth, and Jahan and Han the survivor kid and Sir Lora and so many others. Impossible to forget... \n[i]They exist! Stop lying, I know they exist ![/i]\n\nOur choices were important: We decided to do justice to this or that person, provoking reactions (or death) in certain characters, slapping a few Magisters around when necessary\nAnd of course, we STRONGLY decided to stea... Borrow a lot of spells and equipments from the merchants, while the other one was distracting by chatting...\n... What? We didn't have the money and we had to save the world ! Well, we had the money, but you never know, maybe one day we will need it... !\nAnd then stealing, it's fun. And exhilarating hehehe\n\n\n[u][b]Gameplay:[/b][/u]\nA 3D tactical turn-based game, to play with friends. Really ! Don't play this game alone, I'm sure that with at least 1 buddy (or 3!), you will exploit the game to its full potential!\n\nAlso, [u]you can change your skills and class at any moment in the game[/u], it's very flexible ! I played rogue all my game, and in the last chapiter, I decided to play with spear and War skills ! I really enjoyed being able to switch like this, as I want ! The game want you to take FUN, not \"suffering\" your \"bad\" class choices !\n\nToo bad, I don't know anyone who is ready to take on the role of a GM (Game Master), to live a personalized campaign! Because it is a mode apart from the main campaign!\n\n\n[u][b]Music:[/b][/u]\nExtremely good and fits perfectly with the atmosphere of the game. This kind of OST that we listen to when we work and that makes us live our adventures again when the song becomes EPIC!\n\n\n[u][b]In summary:[/b][/u]\nTitanic content, assured re-playability for those who wish to know what would have happened if they had answered something else than \"FIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT\", and I repeat, the fact of being able to play with friends makes the game so much more pleasant to do!\n\n\n[b]*Sob*[/b]\nBut no, I'm not crying... I'm just allergic to emotions!\n\nI would like so much to forget this game to be able to rediscover it\n\nPlease play it, at least give it a try, and let yourself be immersed in Div's world!\n\nIn our case, we will do it again in HARDCORE mode !\n\nPeace guys !\n- Doublefine: How did Psychonauts flop? Why did nobody buy our enjoyable artistic platformer?\nUs: You didn’t market it. Heck, I legit thought it was a horror game when I got it as a kid.\nDoublefine: Well, either way, now that it’s a cult classic – we made a sequel.\nUs: Awesome, when is that coming out anyway?\nDoublefine: It’s already out. We just didn’t market it again.\n- Incomphrehesible UI, sloppy controls.\n\n\nGranted I'm a day one player, but very steep learning curve. Couldn't figure out interstellar nav, for the life of me, and the touchy controls made the dogfighting a chore. Save your money. This isn't a jump in and play game.\n- 1 week before release i played the demo, it was a 20 minutes demo that was very underwhelming, but i still thought i should give the game a chance to see if it gets better later on.\n\nIt doesn't.\n\nSo the first thing i read about this game in the embed of the steam link was \"a fresh take on the jrpg genre\", and its probably the biggest problem of the game. It is really the most basic, mediocre turn base combat you can find.\n\nTurn base combat, rock paper scissor elemental types plus physical, materia base skills with few spots (i had only 4 skills activated),  no gear, no party. Does that sound like a fresh take to you?\n\nSo if the gameplay is so barebones it means is at least hard right? Well no, it is basic and easy. The start is easy, in the mid part they blow up the HP of enemies so you understand you should buy new skills, and once you do it the game is easy again. Mob enemies are generally harder than bosses because you are 1vs3 most of the time, while in bosses you can just debuff it and make it slow, while you have 2 turns to spam healings and hitting. There also some questionable decisions on the minor mechanics of the combat system but i don't think they matter (see some paragraphs below)\n\nNow here is what is really the \"fresh take\": the setting being cyberpunk. Everything is written with tech terminology. The mana is called data, block and delay turn is called cache, melee combat is called hack? some of the terms don't even make sense of what they actually do. Also because we obviously live in a technological society we have people called \"V-sync\" or \"Nullpointer\", expresions like \"Digits!\" or \"Oh my grind!\", you know, normal behaviour if you ask me.\n\nThe story is pretty standard for a futuristic setting, it wasn't bad but also it wasn't good, pretty normal.\n\nThe artstyle is cool, the music is generally cool, which i think its why most people would don't mind the boring gameplay and will just play for the story, which is also present in the game itself because you have options to either skip every random encounter (yeah we have those here) or to insta win every battle when you want it.\n\nSo if you want to try this game because of the \"fresh take in the jrpg genre\" you will be disappointed, if you have played jrpgs before there is nothing new in this game, you have already played it before.\n- This is a passable if grindy 3D first person family friendly farming \"shooter\" with cartoony artwork.  You have a simple \"vacuum\" gun that you use to capture wild critters, throw them into pens, feed them, collect their stuff, sell it, rinse repeat.  \n\nThe implementation here is of high quality and works well on PC with a range of implementation options.  While the gameplay is somewhat repetitive and grindy, this is decent enough family friendly game that should be considered when on sale.  The retail price is too high, however, this game appears on sale and in bundles often enough.\n- I like the game, but I'd recommend waiting for the full release.\nDon't get me wrong, the game is beautiful and it's got great potential. The problem with it is, mostly, the keybindings. They are incredibly uncomfortable to use and you cannot change them.\nPlus, the dialogues sometimes feel never ending and quite pointless.\n- GIVE ME THE GODDAMN COPY/PASTE ROOM BUTTON!\n\n10/10 would play again.\n\n(Ttips to combat the somewhat broken system atm:\n\n1. Use patients list, manually send those patients to treatment or home: \na. Very high diagnosis but still queuing for GPs (even 100% patients will wait for GP till their death, it will waste most GP resources)\nb. Very low mood/health patient, if you can gurantee the patient getting their treatment soon w/o affecting others in the queue, use the room's queue function, or use click on the patient to change his position in the queue, otherwise send him home to avoid penalty\n\n2. Treatments are much more profitable than diagnosis, plus they leave after treatment no matter what, but if well treated, then you don't need much ghost hunting janitors\n\n3. If in need of money in the early game, don't bother with food/drink/bathroom/comfort, do the minium and focus on your diagnosis -> treatment, most patient will get treated before they rage quit, thus make you a lot of money. With staff, if they near rage quit, just raise their salary.\n\n4. In the early game, only put down the essential objects (e.g. only desk and file cabinet in GP's) to maximize your profit. They only room I recommend to decorate to lvl 5 is staff room to speed up their recovery.\n\n5. ALWAYS ensure there is a toilet right next to your staff room, and a cafe. If a tired staff need bathroom, he/she will walk all the way to the staff room and back to toilet and back to staff room, even if a toilet is right next to his/her office. Samething with Cafe, it provides a 'nice meal' bonus.\n\n6. Do not build more reception than you need, build less. It is a great way to control the patient flow, they don't wonder around while in a reception queue.\n\n7. For a large map, patients entering the hospital from mutiple gates. I don't recommend building reception other than one specific area (preferably right next to GP's office), reason as above.\n\n8. News agent can get long queue very easily, as long as you have one, patients in queue will travel all the way across the map for it. So be careful, either don't put any, or put one in every building (at least).\n\n9. With spare money, get your staff trained ASAP, especially staff providing treatment (to ensure high chance of successful treatment)\n\n10. Click on a room, goes to 'info' tab, the last sentence there will tell you what training the staff in the room should have.\n\n11. Keep track of your staff's skills, and assign them only ONE job in the staff -> job assignment menu, so AI won't mess your system up.)\n\nThings I'd really like to be changed:\n1. WAY too many patients.\nI think the new patients' growth(spawn) need to be slow down at certain point either automatically or mannually, I often found myself in need of double the amount of GP offices in the mid-game. Since GP offices are the choke points, it can get out of control in matter of seconds, which left no Human resources/money/time to train everyone. Besides, it is realistic, there are only so many people a town have.\nAnd because of the growth issue, I find myself have to build more and more, I'd like to slow down and taking care of every corner of my hospital, not just keep building. Quality takes time, nobody like be overly pushed by the game.\n\n2. Rooms merge\nJust like in real lives, Doctor's room are private, but pharmacy? I think other rooms should not be private - Allow us to put multiple machine and people in one room, make it shared. It is just bizzare to not make it shared, and vey wasteful of time/money/spaces. Besides, some room looks really empty.\n\n3. Wards\nWards are weird, I'm not sure why. Often than not, I have more than enough beds and nurses, but still 6+ wait outside, I'm not sure what triggers them to be 'called in'\n\n4. FOOD/DRINK/TOILET is broken\nI'm sorry, but I'm not gonna build cafe & bathroom every 3 inchs. IRL, most hospital have 1~3 cafes, a small~medium toilet on every floor. Space is valuable, I would rather leave it to medical facilities. I think the AI is a bit broken at this point, they constantly want drink/food/bathrooms while I have 6+ machines/2 toilets in every building. As if they can't walk 10m to the nearest one.\n\n5. Janitors are kind of dump.....I wish we can assign areas to janitors/assitances, so they won't always walk across the map back and forth.\n\n6. Man, this is 2018, we got central heating and air-conditioning...for real. Maybe make a seprate tunnel system? Like water, electricity, heat, air. Hospital's air exchange system is much more important than usual buildings I believe.\n\n7. Credit to Ibbi Wyxx in the commnet, I think it is great to set patient with certain percent of diagnosis straight to treatment rooms. It makes sense and later in the game, with doctors fully trained I imagine 100% diagnosis on most patients in the GP's shouldn't be a problem. And it is how real life works as well, dorctors are not always 100% sure whats wrong, they might start some harmless/urgent treatment first, myself actually is in this situation right now \n\n(sometimes I feel like I'm being treated in my own hospital because I just stayed at one IRL, so I have to make everything right as if trying to please myself...)\n\n8.  Some of those skills just look fancy since you can't replace them.\nThis one does not matter much, I'm very OCD when it comes to managment, so atm I have to wait for the right person w/o any skills I don't want on them so the training oppourtinity will not go wasted, but it is hard and annoying. Besides, it is a real problem since you can only learn 5 skills, so just choosing whoever is not effective and effecient in the long run. (for example a GP w/ Radiology skill)\n\nAlso, it makes some of the skill essentially useless, i.e. master class (speed up learning and teaching), it may seem useful, but it will eventually cost you a lot more than you gain. Down the line it will cost you one spot for other skill. If just hiring someone w/ this skill to teach then fire him, it is also costly and not making any real sense. \n\nThings I'd like to see (in DLCs?):\n1. Ambulances management. Ambulance are essential part of a hospital, ERs are even better! (Stayed at a ER bed not long ago watch the whole ER room working,man, ERs are cool af, but I do hope less people need to see it because it is...ER)\n2. Multifloor-hospital.\n3. ICU etc.?\n4. Medicin/drug development/management\n5. Specialists office?\n6. More background music/radio, its a bit repetitive at this point\n- buy it on sale. campaign was decent, however The Last Tiger mission was a standout. Multiplayer experience is ok overall, the hackers make it the worst bit. 6.5/10, if Dice fixes their servers and clears out the hackers then maybe it's worthy of an 8/10.\n- In 2013, after 10 years of waiting, the Sim City community of modders, fans, and aficionados rushed out to purchase the fifth installment of Sim City. Ten years is a long time to wait for a game, but people had a lot of faith in Maxis when they announced the title. Long story short, it was a massive dissapointment. Maxis and EA crippled Sim City 5 with DRM, Always On APM, tiny maps, forced origin installation, lacking mod support, no steam support, and a forced multiplayer aspect.  I decided to not purchase the title, so it may have been a decent game, but 2 years later a team of 12 people created a game that does everything maxis insisted was utterly and totaly impossible.  \n\nEverything the mod community did that kept Sim City 4 on the shelves in Wallmarts across America for an entire decade was ignored. Maxis (and to a lesser extent EA) ignored the fans, and gave the people who had kept them in business for twenty years a crippled subpar game.  And for that Maxis is now out of business. They will never make another game, and it is no one's fault but theirs.\n\nNow pretend none of that happened. It's 2013 again, and here it is people: Sim City 5. \n\nThe game balance is a bit on the easy side for veterans of the genre, but the potential map size is ENOURMOUS and customizing your city could fill up years of gameplay time.  The game runs so smoothly with so much going on, it really shows how lazy Maxis was with their approach.  The glass in buildings reflects the sun and the buildings near it, there are dynamic shadows, zoning is back, and it is not 'dumbed down'.  A single tile in this game is twice the size of the alloted map in Sim City, and you can purchase dozens of additional tiles to expand.  The map editor is awesome, the community is thriving, there are mods to do anything you want, and this is the city building game we've all been waiting for.  I can not possibly reccomend this more.\n- Not saying this as a tough guy thing or anything, But it is difficult for me to shed actual tears.\n\nThis game made me ugly cry twice, and happy cry once.\n\nThis not a story about zombies.\n\nIt is about a little girl growing up in the worst possible situation.\n\nAnd what she makes of it.\n\n2/13/2023 finished\n\nPS: If I ever have a daughter I will name her Clementine. This is the tier of impact this game had on me we are talking about.\n- 1. What is \"Pyre\"?\nThe game \"Pyre\" was made by Supergiant Games and was released on the 25th of July in 2017. After \"Bastion\" and \"Transistor\" this is their third game. \"Pyre\" is an indie-action-rpg, which story is mostly told in form of a novel. The gameplay is very different to the experience you probably made in \"Bastion/Transistor\", which lead a few people to put a negative review on steam. Now you will no longer play as one single character like before, but you are responsible for a group of exiles. The gameplay at it´s heart can be declared as 3 parts:\n \npart 1 contains travelling/exploring the world\n\npart 2 contains social interactivity with your group (talking/trading/decision-making)\n\npart 3 contains to take part in the rites, that means a fast-paced action ball game (3 vs 3) without        a planning phase (like in \"Transistor\")\n\n\n2. Technical details\n-the game runs fine on my windows 10 64 bit machine and it needs about 8.2 gb space of your hard drive. Unfortunately the game runs bad on old machines, because you need about 4 gb ram to run it without an error (my other 3 gb ddr2-system couldn´t run it, I received a ram-error-message when starting the game).\n\n-controls with mouse+keyboard or gamepad are good and well implemented.\n\n\n3. What does the game do right?\n-great rpg-novel-mixture as a whole unique and emotional experience\n-despite the linear progression (mentioned \"phases/parts\" above) the game stays interesting enough to continue\n-a colourful and fantastic world to explore (no open-world)\n-great character-design and a good variety of different creatures, which affects the gameplay during the rites\n-beautiful artstyle with a lot of detail and smooth animations \n-believable and fleshed-out storyline (NOT \"black and white\") with a personalised ending! \n-wonderful soundtrack (mostly ambient)\n-the creatures of the world speak their own language, subtitle is displayed in old-fashioned English\n-rites: the thrilling-faced-paced-action-game has a lot of depth to it (skill tree/character selection/items/area of the rite)\n-selectable difficulty level (rites can be optionally restartet), which can be changed during the game (+ \"titan-mode\": advanced challenges you can add separately like in \"Bastion/Transistor\")\n-meaningful and emotional decisions to be made (I´m looking at you mass effect), thankfully there are no dead-ends but different endings (personalised!)\n-\"Pyre\" is \"2-3 times\" longer compared to \"Bastion\"/\"Transistor\" without getting boring\n-good mouse+keyboard and gamepad support\n-\"versus-mode\": you can play against friends together on your pc or alone against CPU (with all the characters in the game!)\n\n\n4. What does the game do wrong?\n-the fast-paced-gameplay during the rites can be very fast and too stressful at times (I experienced some unfair situations here and there)\n-controls are sometimes not precise enough, especially when the gameplay is getting hot\n-hardware requirements (like \"Transistor\") with 4 gb ddr-ram are over the top regarding old rigs with dual-core cpu´s \n-some minor bugs during the rites (ball gets stuck, switching between characters over distance, bad camera angles over distance)\n-\"versus mode\" can only be played as local multiplayer\n-no bonus material for fans at all \n\n\n5. tl;dr\nPyre offers a fantastic but linear action-rpg-experience with a great story, which is told in form of a novel with a personalised ending. The gameplay is a mixture of exploration, social interactivity and a 3 vs 3 ball-sports-game. The level of creativity considering world-building, character design, music and the way the story is being told is on an insanely high level. If you liked \"Bastion\" and \"Transistor\" you need to know that you don´t play just as one character anymore. But what you can expect is a game with a heart, just like their games before. Pyre is in my opinion a masterpiece and the best Supergiant game so far.\n\n\n6. Final thoughts\nAs a child of the 80´s I played a lot of pc games. Sometimes I look back and remember how I bought game boxes from a company called \"Lucas Arts\". There were times I didn´t even inform myself about the upcoming games, I just bought them because I loved their games I purchased before. For me Supergiant reached that status in the present time. \n\n\n\nUntil the stars align!\nIf you liked this review be sure to hit the like button to help other players with helpful reviews. Thanks!\n- I wish there were a \"mixed\" option for recommending this game, as I think for a lot of people out there, this is a fantastic game, and it's definitely well made with a lot of love and attention to detail in many respects. I really like puzzles and problem solving, so part of my disappointment with The Witness is that I really thought I would enjoy the game. Myst was one of my favorite games growing up, and I was extremely excited to see a well-reviewed game in the Myst genre surface after far too long. \n\nThe problem for me was that The Witness is very much a game about the journey, and not the destination. It turns its head on the genre as it's less a game about solving puzzles within a set of rules, and more about discovering what those rules are. And for the most part, it does that well. Instead of the usual game conventions, rewards for solving hard puzzles weren't any kind of story unlock, more just to give you a harder puzzle. That approach was fun for awhile, but some story unlock would've been appreciated, especially because there is so much mystery and it's such an immersive world that was clearly built for a reason and has a fascinating backstory. \n\nSome of the mechanics also just seem arbitrary, or at the very least, not quite obvious enough. Sometimes perspective puzzles require you to either take a screenshot or jot down on pencil and paper the answer, then transfer it on screen. That seems like lazy game design and worst of all, takes you out of the immersive experience. It's possible I'm mostly tone deaf, as some of the sound puzzles seemed almost impossible to me, despite numerous listens. There's also just the repetitiveness of the \"pathfinding\" puzzles, which range from challenging (and satisfying) to punitive in their difficulty spikes. It's in these difficulty spikes where I think the core game mechanic of pathfinding lets you down, as it requires you to be much more of a planner than a \"hands on\" problem solver. In a game like this, I would think it would accommodate multiple approaches, but really there's a right way to approach this game, and a wrong way. Unfortunately for me, I think the way I approach puzzles (trial and error) is strongly discouraged, at times in punitive ways. \n\nThe philosophy from the audio/video portions will likely be appreciated by some, and for some come off as the worst kind of douchey-hipster nonsense. Had they been delivered in shorter pieces, I might've fallen into the former. But as rambling as some of them are, I found them more annoying than enjoyable unfortunately. \n\nI don't know, I'm really torn on this. It's a well made game, and while it seems so open and non-confined, I found the game to be far too linear in mechanics and how to approach problem solving. At times it actually made me feel like a lesser thinker because I have a different approach to puzzles than what the game designer prefers. What I'm sure is a really fun journey for some, left me disappointed with the destination. \n\nAm realizing this reads a lot like an apology for not liking this game, which I think it is. I really, really wanted to love The Witness, but in the end, not only was this game not for me, but I genuinely feel lesser for that fact because I feel like I should have loved it, and just didn't.\n- This is a poor excuse for a Korean mobile port in a long line of them with the lack of sound, spelling errors, bad translations, ugly UI, log-in issues and so much more and it has P2E crypto/NFT garbage and P2W.\n\nNot even the small number of upskirts and jiggly boobs can save this one.\n- [h1] 🕘          IMPRESSION:[/h1]\n* 2016: Game released\n* 2019: It seem fun, let's buy this\n* 2020: New content added\n* 2022: More content added\n\n🟢 = Available\n🔴 = Not available\n\n[h1]         GAMING CONTENT:[/h1] \n🟢 Teamwork with others\n🟢 Puzzle Challenges\n🟢 No Compass or Map Challenge\n🟢 Funny Avatar\n🟢 Customize Avatar\n🔴 3-4 players share screen\n🔴 Fast Sprint\n🔴 Time Attack for replay value\n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [th]iMeter[/th]\n        [th]SCORED[/th]\n        [th]iNTEREST METER[/th]\n        [th]DISCOUNT?[/th]\n [th]COMMUNITY[/th]\n        [th]REVIEWER[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [th]A+[/th]\n        [td]5[/td]\n        [td]Loving it [/td]\n        [td]No Wait[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [th]A[/th]\n        [td]4[/td]\n        [td]Liked it[/td]\n        [td]No Wait[/td]\n        [td] ✔[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [th]B[/th]\n        [td]2-3[/td]\n        [td]Half satisfied[/td]\n        [td]Wait 50%[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n        [td] ✔[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [th]C[/th]\n        [td] 1[/td]\n        [td]Less Interested[/td]\n        [td]Wait 75%[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [th]D[/th]\n        [td] 0[/td]\n        [td]Not what you need[/td]\n        [td]Wait 100%[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n\n🏅 Community Rating: [b] Very Positive [/b]\n🔎 Long Version Checklist ➜ [u][url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/expectationchecklist/discussions/1/1738883005311884039/]Reveal[/url][/u]\n📢 Disclaimer about Short Hours & English Error ➜ [u][url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/expectationchecklist/discussions/0/4594180031254224809/]Read Here[/url][/u]\n\n[quote]\n⚖️ iMeter {B} Worth a play, if you enjoy Teamwork Challenges with Puzzle.

I will grant that the with all the add ons it would feel a tad crowded to anyone who hadn't played it before, but you have a crazy amount of options. The game series tagline of \"one more turn\" could not be more applicable.\n\nYou can strive for one of several victories: diplomatic, cultural, technological or domination. Each has its unique challengers to overcome and create a lot of the fun of the game. They are also not necessarily mutually exclusive and after completing one victory, you can go for the others. Each AI opponent has their own personality, and are pretty predictable in how they behave. Any one who has started the game next to Neopoleon or Ghengis Kahn knows they immediately have to have a decent military to repel invasion, while Ghandi will to muscle you out with religion and culture.\n\nThere are some important changes between Civilization IV and V. One of the most notable is that wars are plausible again as you dont constantly lose health in enemy territory and cities are easier to conquer. Additionally, culture doesn't automatically take over neighbor's cities anymore. \n\nThis game is easily worth the money. I'm not entirely sure how it stacks up to Civilization VI, but any game that I log 200+ hours on over a period of years and still haven't come close to doing everything is doing something right. A great game from a great series.\n- Damn, deeply devoted developer designed Death's Door.\nDiscover dungeons, divine drama, delightfully depicted Death [b]:D[/b]\nDark daw's daunting duels demand deft digits.\nDynamite deal definitely does deserve desire!\n- It's horrible. It's annoying to play, it freaks you out, it insults you relentlessly. Yeah, of course I'm recommending it, why do you ask?\n\nWill You Snail is what it says it is. A platformer with traps popping on your predicted path with some meta plot and an evil AI commenting on your actions, mostly with clever insults. But it's also a little more than that, mainly due to the quality of its elements - so the game becomes more than the sum of its parts.\n\nYou're probably wondering about the difficulty. Well, good news: there are four settings, and by default they change depending on your performance. You struggle with the level too much? It's lowered. You beat it on the first few tries? It goes up. All with a (not) nice comment from Squid, the antagonist. I personally found the design annoying rather than actually challenging, but I'm quite sure that's intentional. The game's got it all: conveyor belts (that randomly change direction), underwater currents, perfectly timed spikes falling on your head, blocks that cave in on you after you break them. PhD in twatologist design. Due to the ever-shifting nature of the levels, I wouldn't even call this game a precision platformer - it's not about learning the level, but about adaptation. Luckily, the platforming segments are only one part of the game and there's some downtime between them, with optional (but fun) puzzles.\n\nOh, and for reference: I played mostly on difficulty 3 out of 4, sometimes dropping to 2 and rose to 4 towards the end. I found it roughly as difficult as Ori and the Blind Forest's latter sections, harder than Celeste ignoring strawberries, and easier than Garlic.\n\nLet's talk about Squid, the antagonist. The misanthropic, fatalistic, super-intelligent AI trope is pretty old at this point - but Squid is a very good refinement of that trope. It feels like he's really insulting you - the player - not the player character, like GLaDOS did. Mainly because he really reacts to the exact things that you do. You died just before the end? He'll point that out. You keep dying in one spot? He'll let you have it. You died to a spike? Comments about hitting your head incoming. Ran into a bomb? He'll tell you not to collect them. And so on. There so many lines, I never, ever, not once ran into a duplicate. That really makes him feel like a living, breathing person, not an NPC. I mean, he's not living and breathing... you know what I mean.\n\nOn that topic: if you've watched the trailer, you've probably noticed that Squid speaks with a non-native accent. That's because he's voiced by the dev, who's German; and indeed the general writing has this sardonic, matter-of-fact yet earnest quality that will be familiar to you if you know the German style of communication. No, no angry screaming, that's not how Germans talk. Stop watching WW2 speeches and watch some Staplerfahrer Klaus instead.\n\nAnd finally, there's the story. It's a bit meta, no surprises there. I won't write too much about it because I don't want to spoil it. Let's just say that it leaves many things out, but gives you just enough info to fill in the blanks. It's rather suspenseful; more importantly, it slowly builds up to... cosmic horror? Existential terror? Perhaps both. Also, it has a very clear message, delivered quite convincingly. Up to you to decide what to do with it.\n\nOverall, Will You Snail is pretty good. I don't think it's as flawless as many reviews make it out to be; the annoying design is still annoying in the end, even if it's thematically correct. Also, the music relies a little too much on the central leitmotif of the game, and it simply doesn't have the grace and variety to pull it off like Toby Fox did with UNDERTALE's soundtrack. Still; those little things aren't enough to wear down the emotional feast presented by this game. I'd say \"Guten appetit\" to this fine escargot meal, but in this case, we are the snails. Enjoy!\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42922988]Curator page[/url]\n- I played the demo and instantly became enamored. The mix of Slay the Spire-style deck-building with elements of the ship combat from FTL: Faster Than Light is an absolutely fascinating mix, and the \"single-axis\" movement system adds a whole extra layer that I've never seen in anything except the Mega Man: Battle Network series.\n\nI bought the full game within the first hour of being available. After having played for nearly 4 hours at the time of writing, my opinion hasn't changed in the slightest. I already love what's available and so far I feel like I've barely scratched the surface.\n\nI can't wait to see what awaits in the future for this awesome title.\n\nEDIT: As a small addition, I will say: I beat my very first run, which is set to the lowest difficulty (Normal). I jumped up to Hard to try to unlock a new ship, and I haven't been able to beat a run since then. It's probably just that I'm bad, all things considered, but be aware that the changes made with difficulty increases are probably more impactful than they may seem.\n\nAlso I wanna say to the devs: thank you for launching the game with mod support and working on making it easier! But also please look into getting Steam Workshop support if you can!\n- The EOS stands for End of Service. I am sure someone has fun with this or there wouldn't be a reason to keep bringing it back. Right? The usual Tab Target MMO. I do like that you can teleport to quest givers and mobs instead of the usual auto or manual run. Aside from that there isn't anything modern here.\n\n【グループB】\n- Someone has to be the first, I guess.\n\nI don't know, I just didn't really feel too hooked on the game's premise. I feel less like I'm solving a puzzle and more like I'm hitting a pinata for all the clues. Every replay, I'm just going to have to do something whacky in order to get a new clue as to what might further my cause. And that doesn't really make me feel like I'm a part of a story, as much as a I feel like I'm going through an eternally looping monday, getting increasingly distanced to the world around me as I finally end up throwing myself overboard, because 'why not?'.\n\nI won't refund it, because I think the devs have poured a lot of heart into this game and I do think they deserve the money, but I couldn't really find too much entertainment in the game.\n- 12 years have passed and you decide to update the game by increasing the price, removing multiplayer, radio stations, and adding your shitty launcher, yet you haven't fixed those frame drop issues that have been sticking with us since release and make the game completely unplayable no matter what computer you're running it on.\n\n12 years for this. Fuck you Rockstar.\n- Volition ups the silly, and adds super powers, but loses a little something along the way.\n\nI loved Saint's Row: the Third, and by all rights should have loved IV as well, but I mostly just liked it. The set up was fun, and seemed to up the ante again, but then you get the presidency ripped away from you almost immediately (without even seeing the consequences of your first pushed legislation!). Placing the game in a virtual city for the most part with the only real characters being on your space ship, really kinda seemed to gut the game. Even when [spoiler]the world gets destroyed[/spoiler], a detached, \"meh\" was all I could muster. The humor is there, but it's mostly better in the DLC. The radio stations feel kind of underwhelming without DJs.\n\nFinally all the fun of collecting and customizing various interesting cars, and finding ways to climb or fall to interesting places with a stolen plane/parachute are gutted with the inclusion of super powers. Also, the super powers make gunplay, leveling any of your other stuff, and pretty much every mechanic carried over from Saints Row: the Third obsolete.\n\nIf you get this game, do yourself a favor and make sure you get all the DLC where most of the real fun is. Is it as good as the previous Saints Row? I don't think so, but I still recommend getting it and playing through it. It is a lot of fun, and I love the 50's break out scenario at the beginning.\n\nStacey's thoughts:\nStill awaiting DLC with Jane Austin and the D*ldo Bat.

Then I bought a horse and left the tutorial area, and things got weird. I'm pretty on board with this one.\n- Great story, great features. But in my honest opinion unless your going for a nostalgia trip, give it a pass. The gun play and AI alone is enough for me to justify a refund, I mean shit cops hear the sounds of gunshots right next to them and act like nothing is happening. Immersion 0/10 sorry. I must admit I really enjoyed this game on console, but I am gonna have to take the money and run. Notice how almost all of the reviews just say All YOU haD to do Was FoLlow The DAmn Train cj or Ill HAve TWo NumBER 9s. I cant say I didn't expect this game to be a little shit judging by how old it is, but I will NOT suck it off and say buy it, the actual game play is PATHETIC. In all honesty I think this game remastered with gta v's physics and polish would be SOOO much better than gta v. They really captured the hood life in this one, damn shame it fucking sucks. This game's age sadly isn't up to par and sadly, it's getting a fat thumbs down from this boomer.\n- I do think the Mixed review rating is justified, but for the wrong reasons.\nHere are a few pro's and con's from someone who's been a long-time fan and played every Dirt game except the first one.\n\nPRO:\n+ Handling and physics are alright on both \"Gamer\" and \"Simulation\" settings\n+ Decent soundtrack\n+ Building and leveling up your staff and garage gives the game more depth\n\nCON:\n- Horrendously inconsistent AI. In roughly 15 years of playing racing games I've never seen AI as inconsistent as in this game. I played on \"Tough\" and could complete some races with a 10+ second gap, while others were quite literally impossible. This is because of the auto generated track system - unlike in the previous Dirt games, the AI never actually drives on the track, but stage times are auto-generated by how an AI *would* likely perform on a stage. \n- Lack of tracks / Boring tracks. As mentioned, there are no proper tracks for Rally events as they are auto-generated. While the tech behind it is quite impressive, this leaves most tracks feeling incredibly dull with no highlights or features whatsoever. Remember the cool cliff sides from Greece in Dirt Rally? None of these here. Essentially all tracks feel the same no matter what the location is. Couple that with the fact that there are only 5 locations and you'll find yourself bored quite quickly. Rallycross and Landrush tracks are not auto generated, but feel incredibly boring and forgettable. Baja or Malaysia in Dirt 2 were such a blast, but Dirt 4? Yawn.\n- Historical Rally. In its entirety. It's just normal Rally with older cars, but after a while I refused to continue this event type as the events are dragged out as hell. Near the middle you'll have to complete 12 events with each 5 stages. That's 60 stages in total. Consider my previous point about tracks feeling dull and I can't help but wonder who actually completed all these events. This seems to be a Codemasters thing though as I had the same issue with Grid Autosport.\n- Menuing. Why is it that I need to go out of the career every time I want to buy a car? Why is selecting sponsors (which you'll do often as they expire after awhile) in the same category where you can customize your car? Everything is a huge mess and finding the right things took me more time than it should every time.\n+ Lack of rewards. I actually found Joyride, which isn't part of the main career, to be the most fun thing to do in the game. Even though the events in Joyride repeat frequently but with different cars, it was a proper challenge compared to the career and is somehow quite addicting. The issue with it is that it's meaningless to complete. You don't get anything for getting a Gold medal on everything, not even new liveries or, heck, even an achievement. It's utterly pointless.\n\nAll in all this game is easily the weakest entry in the franchise (minus Dirt 1 maybe, but that one had a way smaller budget). To top it off it just feels like this game has no soul either. I vividly remember Dirt 2's gritty and colorful presentation, while this one lacks anything I could remember the game by. Really all this game made me want to do is play Dirt 2 or Dirt Rally again. Cheers and thanks for reading.\n- UGH! The scariest thing about this game is that someone at Steam okayed it for being released. Absolute garbage! Frustrating as heck and not fun in the least bit. If you want a scare, you might accidentally get one through a jumpscare, but don't count on it. Avoid this game at all costs, even if its free, I would be hesitant to recommend downloading this pile of crap. You'll spend the entire time just trying to find things to click on, and when you do, you're rewarded with? some of the worst animations ever to be found in gaming\n- *Sigh* This game was just tiring. I wouldn't come to say it was a complete rip off of Paper's Please, but it was a very similar game but just worse. Mainly to the point that I played, at most, 10 minutes, I saw multiple repeats of the same messages, and the only updates were legislation, unlike in Papers, Please where you got new rules and new tools almost every day. I won't completely judge the game since I haven't played it the entire way through, but it's just not very good. Plain and simple.\n- Playing Football Manager is like doing drugs. You don't know why people do it, and you don't know how to do it. However, once you start doing it and get the hang of it, you can never stop doing it. 5 stars\n- So, I hated this game at first...\n\n I've never been into a MMO before, and I went into it with a mindset of \"FUCK YEAH! MULTIPLAYER SKYRIM LETS GO\" - In short don't do that. This isn't going to be like playing Skyrim, Oblivion, Morrowind. \n\nIt is when it all comes down to the core an MMO, it's set in Tamriel, it sounds like Tamriel and the storylines feel like an Elder Scrolls game. However being an MMO, it has a lot of grindy MMO style quests. And don't get me wrong, it's bewildering at first, all these mechanics, all these places to go....and before the 'One Tamriel' update if you chose the wrong faction, you were screwed, in a place all on your own surrounded by all these people who are WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY higher level than you. But thankfully they changed all of that. The game scales now, so you can rock up to a dungeon with your level V300 mate, and still have some fun slicing up enemies.\n\nSo I saw a friend playing the other day, and spent a few hours installing this to join him (By the way its like 70 Gig...If you have slow internet prepare for a few days of download), I got back on it after not playing for 14 months, but this time I was playing with a friend who was already Veteran Level 250, So I was in luck, he introduced me to everything and I got used to all the deconstructing of equipment to get my blacksmithing up, showed me about dungeons and bascially got me to enjoy the grind. I think my previous time was a bit lackluster because I got dropped in the middle of the Aldmeri Dominion on my own, without any of my friends. So I left.\n\nNow I know what I'm doing, and keep in mind I usually hate MMO's never played WoW or anything like that, this is the first one. I'm enjoying myself, I'm triple digits into this game time-wise and I don't see it stopping now. We've made a guild for noobies. To help them out, and get them to enjoy the game also. Because the community is nice...but you still get the elitist fucks from any competitive game kicking you out of dungeons because you're only level 14. But you won't get that when you're in a guild, having people to play with and explain all the mechanics did help, a lot. I've even gone as far as to buy this AGAIN on steam just to collect my hours and so on.\n\nAdd-ons are awesome being able to mod basic features of the game to help with information and quality of life improvements is a must. I'll provide an essential mods pack if any of you wish to know.\n\nFor those of you who actually got this far into this, well done. I didn't think I'd keep you captivated long enough to get to the end.\n\nIf any of you are new to the game, on EU server and would like to join a guild to show you the way, add me or visit our [url=www.godsofsalt.com]website[/url] and join us on teamspeak, or just message us in game @diseasedcrow.\n\nBut all in all if you like Elder Scrolls and you think you want to try this, just do, I'm glad I gave it a second chance.\n- \"The good things, the happy things, all of it changes. Nothing can stay the same forever. Still...can you find it in your heart to still love this place?\" (paraphrase)\n\nClannad . . .\n\nOH Clannad . . .\n\nI remember watching the anime in high school, and absolutely falling in love with it. Upon realizing the REAL story was told in a visual novel...I HAD to get my hands on it. I almost died of a joy-induced heart attack when a legitimate English version of the game was released on Steam.\n\nThis game bro. This f***** game. When I was a senior in high school back in the day, this game was my refuge. I was mostly friends with older kids back then, so by the time I was a senior I didn't really have anybody to chill with cuz all my friends already graduated. Its kinda hard for me to make new friends, then and now if I'm being honest. I related to Nagisa a lot for that reason. \n\nI mostly related to Tomoya and Sunohara tho. One of my best friends growing up really reminded me of Sunohara no cap lol. Type of dude who was the comic relief/brunt of everyone's s*** talking but w/ a mutual understanding its done in jest and love. And when things ever got serious we always had each others' backs, and even tho he's a goofball and kind of a meme, he's seriously loyal and a true ride or die.\n\nMany times when Tomoya was expressing himself in this game, I had to almost pinch my face and remind myself I'm not the one thinking these thoughts: I'm playing a VN lol. That's how much I seriously related to Tomoya. In so many aspects and ways that would make my review even longer than it is now if I were to attempt to explain why I relate to Tomoya so much. Yeah, sure that could just be shrewd character design from Maeda Jun's part, but it was almost uncanny how many of the things Tomoya went thru when he was younger/issues with his father/intimacy issues he develops later on in adulthood etc. almost perfectly mirrored what I was struggling with irl. It gave me something to relate to. It expressed emotions I was having trouble even admitting were present in my own self. Maybe that's the real reason I love Clannad so much, and maybe because of that I sit here biased with rose-colored nostalgia goggles. But even if I type this review with a tinge of rose-coloring obstructing my critical eyes, I can say with confidence that Clannad is more than a game. More than an anime. \n\nClannad is an experience. An experience I wish I could forget all about...just so I could experience it anew all over again. Whether you experience Clannad thru the anime, VN, movie, whatever...Clannad is an experience in a league of its own in my book. And the best way to have your Clannad experience is by playing this masterpiece of a Visual Novel. Hands down. \n\nHonestly, I'd ideally have all Clannad virgins go straight to the VN and play it to completion but that's just not a realistic request as this game takes the average player 80+ hours to complete just the main story apart from optional achievements haha. If you're a fan of the anime...why haven't you played the VN yet!? Lol. If you've never seen the anime or movie I'd STILL recommend playing this game. Just keep in mind to use a guide (just trust me on that. please) and be willing for it to be a bit boring at first. If you stick with it, believe me...it's not gonna stay boring for long.\n\nIf you liked the anime but hated the anime ending, PLAY THE VN. No spoilers, but trust me when I say the VN ending is the true conclusion of the Clannad experience. You'll find out what I mean if you stick with the VISUAL NOVEL to the end.\n\nI didn't go to my senior prom. I spent it playing this game. And I don't regret that decision one bit to this day. I experienced this game, standing in similar shoes as Tomoya at that time irl: rebellious kid about to graduate high school with no real goals or aspirations, struggling to find it hard to \"love this place\" or truly find something passionate to live for. I didn't want to go to college. There was nothing I wanted to do there. Most of the people in my grade back then thought I was quiet and lonely freshman-sophomore, then bad news junior-senior when I started acting out. I was just, lost. \n\nExperiencing Clannad helped me find what I was truly passionate about in life. Family. Friendship (as corny as that may sound). Being able to step up for what only YOU can protect when life is calling you to maturity.\n\nClannad helped me see that even though things can get dark... even though tragedies will happen regardless of our efforts to keep them from happening... even though things can never, and will never, ever stay the same in this life...and even if you lose your way eventually... and sadly reach such a lost and depressed state in life, that you mistakenly conclude for a short while you'd rather sever all your connections and ties with the world and everybody in it... in an effort to try to prevent experiencing even more pain... \n\nThat \"loving this place,\" loving this world, loving people, and forming deep, lifelong and lasting connections with this world and its people, NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS, is ALWAYS, ALWAYS, worth it in the end. Especially when it matters the most.\n\nNow I'm not gonna front: Clannad isn't for everybody. Some people just can't get into the moe art style. Some people may find it a bit too melodramatic at times. Some people may find some of the comedy or bits of the story weird, or just not their cup of tea. Some people may find it hard to relate to all of the characters, and for some people it won't have a Cindarella's slipper level of relatability like it did for me. For those people who are kinda feelin \"ehh idk if i'll really like this game\" I'd say it'd be smart to watch the anime first. But if you're feeling good about it and wanna experience Clannad the BEST way: cop this VN. Just wait for the good bits to slowly boil. Patience is a virtue :) And save yourself hours of rage by using a guide from the beginning until the after-story credits roll. With Clannad I'd say its almost always recommended to use a guide.\n\nAnd if you love the anime and haven't played the VN... you're weirdo number 1, 2, 3, 4 and even 5. Haha I'm playin but srsly get the VN already you owe it to yourself to experience the VN. Knowing what happens in the story and getting some events \"spoiled\" doesn't detract from the VN experience. That I promise you. As someone who watched the anime before playing the VN, who's now such an obvious fanboy of the Clannad VN as demonstrated by my wall of text of a review (lol), trust me: I'd bet money you'll love this game just as much as I do.  \n\nTo Maeda Jun, and all of the brilliant writers of this quintessential, modern classic of a story: thank you. Thank you for gifting all of us the experience that is Clannad. Because of your labours, you've helped a wayward knucklehead like me finally be able to declare this in spirit and in truth:\n\n\"I love this place.\"\n\nLong live Kazamatsuri!\n- Alright. **Frog Detective 3: Corruption at Cowboy County** is done and dusted.\n\nIn this latest mystery for the *Frog Detective* to solve, somebody has....stolen...all the Cowboy County resident's....HATS!!! \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3067651098\n\nWill you find the missing hats? Will you find the Hat Thief? These questions and more will be answered in this game!\n\nThis was actually the longest game in the series by a wide margin. Too about and hour forty to wrap up, and the game features two parts. The second part accessed after the credits roll.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3067650496\n\nEpiside 3 was an excellent wrap up to the series. It is completely Steam Deck compatible. Also...doing sick scooter tricks around the desert is pretty sweet.\n\nThis one is an easy recommendation, and presumably, you will have played the other two games anyway, so you'll want to finish the series.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3067651219\n\n[code]If you found this review helpful and would be interested in supporting my Curator group, it would be appreciated. Cheers.\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/curator/32549618/[/code]\n- I bought the game and the mechanics are fun! The battle system is super impactful and just FEELS fun. It really gives you a sense of satisfaction. And it has interesting elements that really every game should have... but the UI sucks, the classes are genderlocked, and there are so many systems going on at once it's annoying. Like something as simple as a constant notification in the middle of the screen of some other person or random guild you know nothing about doing quests or getting skill points. It's a fun game, but has WAAAY too many minor (except genderlocked classes. Genderlock is never a minor thing) problems that just add up making it annoying to play\n- Mysterious, claustrophobic, and psychedelic --- this is undoubtedly the most unorthodox game in The Legend of Heroes series. This game is basically what you get when you put The Legend of Heroes, Shin Megami Tensei and a certain Silent Hill title [i](which I won't specify for a good reason)[/i] into a blender machine. Nonetheless, it is still very much an LoH game at its core, though its semi-fandisc nature holds it back from being as coherent of an overall package as its two predecessors.\n\nI cannot stress this enough: [b][u]If you were a big fan of the previous two games, you will not necessarily like this game; on the other hand, if you didn't hold them in high regard, this game is still worth trying out due to its stark contrast in tone and structure from its predecessors.[/u][/b] There is a good reason this game is named [u][b]\"the 3rd\"[/b][/u] instead of \"Third Chapter\", because it is definitely not a direct continuation of SC (i.e. Trails in the Sky Second Chapter).\n\nIf you want more of the upbeat, kingdom-trotting adventure of the previous two games, you're not going to find it here.\n\nIf you want towns full of vibrant NPCs, you're not going to find it here (at least not in the main story).\n\nIf you want a protagonist who wears their heart on their sleeves and acts like your typical spunky JRPG hero, you're not going to find it here.\n\nThis game is first and foremost [u][b]a gameplay-heavy dungeon crawler[/b][/u], one that is light on (main) story but carries some very heavy themes. The most interesting aspect of the game to me is that [i][b]the protagonist Kevin Graham is not a hero[/b][/i] (which is ironic considering the name of this series). This game is his harrowing personal journey, one in which he doesn't set out to save the world, his homeland, or anyone for that matter.\n\nThere are initially only two playable characters, but more and more join your party at a steady pace throughout the game [b](16 in total)[/b]. Be sure to talk to these characters when you swap them out of your party; they are ironically the only source of \"NPC dialogue\" for the majority of the game, and their dialogue updates after every plot point like in most other Falcom games. You know Falcom has done their NPCs justice in FC&SC when their complete absence here creates an uneasy sense of isolation.\n\nThere are visual-novel-like sidequests (called Memory Doors) which serve to further flesh out the characters and setting of this series, giving all the playable (and some non-playable) characters their own spotlight to shine in. To this day the cast of Trails in the Sky still remains my favorite cast of any RPG, and I have to give a good chunk of the credit to this game's characterization of them.\n\nThese sidequests take up a sizeable chunk of the game, which one might argue distract from the dungeon-crawling main game. Fortunately, they don't expire like in FC&SC and can be accessed at any point in the game before the final dungeon (with convenient fast-travel to boot), effectively enabling the player to pace the game themselves. \n\nWord of warning though, some of these sidequests take on a much darker tone than one would expect: there's a very good reason why the console versions of this game was censored [i](don't worry, the Steam version isn't)[/i]. Please be mentally prepared for the final sidequest you come across in the game, i.e. [spoiler]Star Door 15[/spoiler].\n\nThere is also plenty of foreshadowing for the rest of the series littered throughout the game, some obvious and some very subtle [i](I'm looking at you Mr. N)[/i]. Needless to say, this game gives you lots to think about if you are into the lore of this series, especially if you have played some of the later Trails games.\n\nOh, and did I mention that the soundtrack is widely regarded as the best in the trilogy?\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nTo end on a more critical note, I'd like to elucidate the \"semi-fandisc\" nature of this game:\n\nThere is severe disconnect between the main story and side content, with the latter adding nothing to the former for the most part; the sidequests are more of an anthology of supplementary material for the entire Trails series and are only tenuously tied to the main campaign, which by itself is sparse in story.\n\nThere is also an egregious amount of asset recycling from the previous two games. Although this is mostly justified within the context of the story, it's still vexing and makes the devs look lazy. They had the opportunity to add a lot of interesting new locales, especially those pertaining to Kevin and the church, but they chose not to for the majority of the game. Get ready to traverse through lots of familiar looking areas and dungeons...\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nP.S. Advice for 1st playthrough: If you are here mostly to enjoy the story, don't play on Hard; if you value your sanity as a gamer, don't play on Nightmare. Seriously, don't.\n\nP.S.2 When you first open up the game, don't skip the \"Falcom\" logo animation; just sit back and watch. There's a bit more after that.\n\nP.S.3 If you're really curious as to which Silent Hill title I was comparing this game to, potential spoilers if you are familiar with the SH franchise: [spoiler]Silent Hill 2[/spoiler]. Just how deep the similarities run between these two games, I'll let you find out for yourself.\n\nP.S.4 A bit more on the censorship of this game: Falcom cut out large chunks of the aforementioned final sidequest when porting the 3rd from PC to the Sony consoles (PSP, PS3, and PSVita). They did this in order to keep the age rating consistent across the Sky trilogy; the PC version of the 3rd would undoubtedly have been rated \"M\" had it gone through ESRB. If you need a list of potentially distressing content in this game, feel free to PM me.\n- I really liked the concept of this game of navigating through orbits to collect crates and then successfully landing on the exit.  However, there just isn't enough content to justify it being sold as a complete product, especially at its current price of $6.99.  You see everything there is in the first couple of levels.  No new mechanics are added to the game as you progress.  The developer admits that the game is too simple and the fix was to add artificial difficulty to make the game longer.  For instance, rather than have intuitive controls using toggles, it requires the player to activate thrusters with one hand and turn them off with another.  The level design stops adding anything new and just adds more tedious narrow paths that must be navigated rather than an actual challenge or puzzles.  Finally, the DLC appears to be “pay to win” rather than getting any new content, it just gives the player access to aircraft that should be included already in the game.  By level 9 it is near impossible to progress any further with the default ship as it cannot accelerate fast enough to get through the small orbit and requires purchasing the DLC to advance the level.\n- [h1]A game meant to bring back memories that is similar to Super Mario World on the SNES and it does this with relatively few gameplay and gimmick elements.

After all, it has to be ready for take-off in order for children everywhere to receive their presents on schedule. But a wicked troll blasts us out of the sky just as the test drive is about to end. He went over the line and wants to ruin Christmas for everyone on Earth. It is up to us to bring the troll to his senses and save Christmas for everyone.\n\nTLoS brings players to one world and six levels of great platforming that are reminiscent of Super Mario World (SNES) but simplified. There are only six levels total, one of which is a castle, before the final battle with the troll. The only difference is that we will be collecting chocolate cookies rather than the traditional yellow coins. We also lose part of our cloak when we are injured, so it's not uncommon for you to find yourself jumping through the levels wearing nothing but red boxer shorts. For instance, red blocks can give you a new coat, which means extra life, or Santa socks and hats, which give a power-up or simply chocolate cookies. The power-up allows you to throw stones as if you had collected the Fire Flower from Super Mario, and that's about it. TLoS also offers a 2-4 co-op player mode, in which players will be able to work together to complete this short and family-friendly adventure.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3009359595\n\nSimilar to Super Mario World, you walk to a level to choose them in the Overworld. Once we reach a certain level, we are allowed to walk, leap, and even sprint. Additionally, there are other indications on the screen that show you how many cookies you have already gathered and how much time is remaining to finish the level. We get an extra life when 100 cookies are collected. We can activate a checkpoint about halfway through the level to pick up exactly where the checkpoint was reached, instead of having to do the entire level all over again. The game also features side-scrolling and underwater levels. The only problem is that if you quit at level three, close the game and start again, you have to start from level one, so you have to play the game in one go. This means that there are no save points or \"save states\". Considering the length of the game, this is not a big deal, but it's still \"annoying\".\n\n[h3] My Specs [/h3]\n\n[code]CPU: i9 9900k\nGPU: RTX 2080 Ti\nRAM: DDR4 32 GB RAM\nOS: Win10\nResolution: 1440p @144hz\n[/code]\n\n[h3] Conclusion [/h3]\n\nWe are all hoping that Nintendo will release their IPs on Steam so that we can play with them one more time. We may all agree, based on experience, that this is probably never going to happen, but Indie developers are there to make it happen. To avoid the tedious teachings at school, you used to be able to play these types of games in class on the usual Flash Player websites, and now you can play them on Steam. Though it's not a masterpiece, it's extremely minimalistic, and it's unquestionably too short, the 20 minutes I spent playing it were nevertheless a lot of fun, especially because the platforming is accurate and not wonky at all. Just remember, it's very minimalistic and may be too minimalistic for some, but if that doesn't bother you, feel free to go ahead and try it out.\n\nIt would be my personal highlight if there were additional levels, more secret exits, more power-up alternatives, and more hours of overall playtime.\n\n[h2] Final Verdict: 8/10 A typical gas station snack that turns out to be a surprisingly good one.🎅 [/h2]\n- Disclaimer: This is review from player who prefer story-rich game and haven't played any game by Arkhouse Telegraph.\n\nThe good:\n+ Outstanding 80's-esque visual pixel artstyle. It reminds me of few SNES/Atari/Gameboy games.\n+ Fairly good soundtrack.\n+ Some cutscene/area have fascinating atmosphere.\n+ Run well with Steam proton, so it's likely this game is playable for Linux/Steam Deck user. Although the platformer area might show too many small detail for 7\" display.\n+ Game OST/artbook is available for free on Arkhouse website.\n\nThe bad:\n- While i understand nature of this game require player to find out most thing and go through trial-and-error, some parts definitely need to be explained better. I refer to lack of autosave (for most part of the game), not letting player know about manual save (you can do it by head left after exit for cylinder elevator until you see display/sign \"< S\" and suggestion to visit block H (where you get some guidance).\n- While the manual say i can play R. U. N. E. 3000 first, i have hard time understanding the story and lore/world building. Conversation such as \"DO? DORODO!\" is mostly gibberish and i only can make vague guess based on few specific term (\"V2\", \"50/50\", etc.) and area i've visited. Short recap of previous games (even it's on the manual) could be really helpful for newcomers.\n\nThe ugly:\n* I experience a bug where i fight boss i'm not supposed to fight yet. In detail, [spoiler] after i exit from P block to get symbol cracking code, i was thrown to G block where i fight G-Cat/10th boss. The worst part is the boss HP bar started with red color and auto 3-60 cannon never perform attack. Fortunately the bug doesn't occur again after i load from manual save.  [/spoiler].\n* The gameplay variation/idea is very interesting, but the execution is mixed bags (more explanation on below paragraph)\n\nSaturn Quest: R. U. N. E. 3000 has lots of gameplay variant/modes (Adventure, Shoot'em up, Platformer and many more) to keep the game fresh. While each area/boss have different reason why it's challenging/difficult, many of those is very unbalanced. For example, [spoiler] Bioplatus M-3D/6th boss [/spoiler] require you to have extraordinary eye-hand coordination and multitasking skill. Among all enemy that resemble boss fight, i only managed to beat 6-7 boss without using cheat.\n\nThis game also has very few checkpoint on each area/boss. On adventure/platformer area, you could restart from beginning after spending 10-20 minutes where you have to avoid same trap or collect same item again. On boss fight, that means you'll need to repeat whole fight most of the time. It's could be annoying because since you're forced to find out boss behavior the hard way or repeating tedious part of the fight.\n\n3 HP and lack of difficulty option could be irritating for most modern player. There are time when i found out i only lose 3-10 HP when i use cheat and beat the boss. If there's easier difficulty where i have 6-10 HP, i could beat more boss by myself. But don't get me wrong, i feel really satisfied each time i beat boss (which i deemed can be beaten with practical amount of effort) without cheat. If the developer bother add easy difficulty which has higher player HP, give more Nana and slightly lower boss HP, far more people could enjoy this unique piece of artwork.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nWhile i have some rant, it's really unique experience even though i've played few hundred games. In overall, i have more positive sentiment than negative sentiment of this game. But even though i choose \"Yes\" when Steam ask \"Do you recommend this game?\", i'd rather choose \"Neutral\" or \"Information\" instead. If you're fan of 80's game or really like difficult game, you might come to like this game. But for most people, i'd recommend you to seek other game. Although if you really insist to play this game, you could use Cheat Engine and modify HP/Nana using value type Double (also called float64 or 8-byte float).\n\nP.S. I definitely will play the sequel (Episode IV-VI: White Meteor Saga according to the artbook) [b]IF[/b] the developer bother add easy difficulty option and more checkpoint during boss fight/exploration.\n- Boss fight Heihachi vs Kazuia devil fprm\nThird form, three 1/3 heal and every heal comes with unti-combo breaker. \nGOOD JOB NAMCO ON GAMEDISGNE WITH DIFFICULTY BALLANCE! \n\nI love the game but this is bullshit, and this should be fixed for the sake of u know,\nEven Ork, even doctor in third tekken was easier\n(Difficulty: Medium)\n\nEverything else is good though\n- A fun game for drinking parties, take a shot every time you feel like you just wasted 19 cents.\n- It's a puzzle game about placing toppings onto donuts and delivering them to different areas on the boar. Great vibe and the first few hours are fun, but it gets incredibly repetitive even with the frequent introduction of new mechanics, especially so if you don't click with said mechanics particularly well. If it's on sale, give it a go - you very well might like it much more than I did.\n- I have it on the Epic store but the amount of stuttering it has made it unplayable so I gave up. I got the Humble choice for $6 to get a steam key and try it on here because I have a few games on steam that run well but run poorly on other platforms like the awful Windows store or the below average Epic launcher, but it's unfortunately the same deal on here for this game. It has done it on two entirely different computer setups for me so that tells me that they didn't bother to spend enough time testing enough different pc setup combinations when it was in development, and my pc setup isn't rare by any means. The look and functioning of the UI and menu's shows that it is a obvious direct console port which would explain their lack of attention to the pc version.\n\nEven giving it a fair shot based on content, it's pretty much just a modified version of Borderlands 2. The amount of dialogue is unbearable. No one in the game EVER shuts up, and every single last word they say is cringe. It's like a kid in fifth grade who laughs at fart jokes wrote the entire script. In addition to everyone never shutting up, the main boss randomly has page-long speeches over the radio just to make sure you get the message that they want you to feel entirely uncomfortable at this game's bottomless amount of cringe.\n\nThe gameplay is identical to BL2, with the only real new noticeable features being that some guns have two functions that you can toggle on and off with the C key and of course the new playable characters. However even without the stuttering ruining the game for me, it's my opinion that BL3's negatives, mainly the insane amount of neverending dialogue and how unbelievably cringe it is, overshadow its positives.\n- Heard joke once: Man goes to doctor. Says he's depressed. Says life seems harsh and cruel. Says he feels all alone in a threatening world where what lies ahead is vague and uncertain. Doctor says, \"Treatment is simple. Steam is having a sale tonight. Go buy a game. That should pick you up.\" Man siles. Says to Doctor, \"good idea, Doc! A nice relaxing distraction!\" Man goes home. Man buys DF.\n\nGood joke. Everybody laugh.\n\n\n\nBut seriously, I built a working moat with a remote drainage system control tower and a 4 storey above ground fort, becoming a thriving 200-strong hold of what was once a moribund empire of less than 10 dwarves. 100/10 game that is definitely worth the learning curve.\n- The good:\n+ Great story with satisfying finale.\n+ Endearing main cast/characters.\n+ Great world building meets with 90s Indonesia culture.\n+ Pleasant pixel artstyle. The cutscenes visual is amazing, even though i notice few awkward animation.\n+ Nice soundtrack.\n+ Puzzle is mostly well balanced. Not too difficult and doesn't make you feel bored/annoyed either.\n\nThe bad: - \n\nThe ugly:\n* Some pacing problem. There are so many sidetrack a.k.a. \"To complete sub-task C you also must complete sub-sub-task X, Y and Z\" during chapter 2-4.\n* Sometimes you might have to going around in circles to solve certain task or accidentally skipped something.\n\nDespite few flaws, A Space for the Unbound is definitely best game developed by Mojiken Studio and best story-driven/adventure game among all games created by Indonesian developer. If you like side-scrolling/adventure game (such as GRIS, Unreal Life or Oneshot) or game made by Mojiken Studio/Toge production (such as Coffee Talk or When The Past Was Around), you should give this game a try.\n- I like to think of this game as what a Telltale game should have been.\nReal decisions that have real consequences. Allies who leave you due to the actions you take, betrayal due to dumb decisions. All of which only happen due to the choices you can make.\nBut instead of quicktime events, you play some games of Gwent.\nSome really difficult decisions as well, ones that i had to seriously stop and think about. A couple of stupidly easy ones as well, but i can forgive that.\nAlso some fantastic tongue in cheek references to other games/pop culture that i had some laugh out loud moments.\n\nYou also get to upgrade and customise your deck as you earn new cards along the way and they do that well. Save a <random character so as no spoiler> and convince him to journey with you? You know have access to his cool card (and trust me, there are some really cool cards). \nBut piss him off so he leaves, well his card is no longer available to you. I'm actually convinced ive missed a possible card or two due to some story decisions.\n\nIf there was one thing i think the game lacks, its risk.\nSome people have complained that its too easy, even on the hardest difficulty, which i think has some truth to it, but even that i dont think is the real problem.\nThe real problem is that if you lose a fight, it doesnt let you continue, you just retry till you win.\nSo if the game asks you, do you engage in a risky fight to save some of your trapped soldiers or do you leave them to their fate, you obviously would always choose the risky fight, as there is no punishment to losing the fight. You just keep retrying till you win.\nIt does take the weight away from a bunch of decisions and i also think it takes away that feeling if triumph you should get when you win the difficult fight and save the troops. You literally risked nothing.\nHowever, There are more than enough difficult decisions that have nothing to do with combat that you will still love this game.\nNot sure how they could fix this at this point, since the story is already fairly detailed with branching decisions.\nMaybe something to keep in mind for the next game. Give us fights that if we lose affect the story badly. Make it feel riskier for us to always choose the better path, so we are tempted to choose the easier one and therefore feel good when we succeed the  hard one, or feel the consequences when we fail the harder path.\n\nIs it worth the cost? I honestly think so, I haven't regret the money ive spent so far. Some people complaining its too short for what it costs (based on the 30 hour estimate, not them having actually played it), but for me its a really good quality 30 hours and i wish more games would take note.\nPeople complaining about 30 dollars for 30 hours are the reason Dragon Age Inquisition had 60 hours of useless grindy soul destroying fetch quests instead of being a streamlined, awesome game.\n- First of all, i'd like to mention that i found this game by chance. But it's surprisingly better than some RPGMaker game i've tried and it's not your typical RPGMaker which is surprising since it's developed by one person.\n\n[h2]Story/character[/h2]\nOverall the story is good enough to keep myself immersed with the game. However the story and characters aren't really memorable. For lack of better comparison, it's similar with movie which entertain you but you won't remember it for long time. Although it's probably because i've played many top-rated RPGMaker game which have more budget/resource.\n\n[h2]Gameplay[/h2]\nWhile the developer emphasize this game is story-focused game, i would also describe this game as puzzle-focused RPGMaker game. Store page mention 3 hours, but it took me 9.5 hours to beat this game. Although if i never experience bug (mentioned below) and stuck at one puzzle (where i asked help on Steam discussion), i expect i would spend 7.5 hours.\n\nThe amount and variety of puzzle presented on this game is surprisingly very diverse. Some of them are the best puzzle I've experienced even though I've played fair amount of RPGMaker game. Although few others feels repetitive, difficult due to lack of hint or force you to walk around if you miss/skip something. Lack of option to run/always run is also mildly annoying for me.\n\nAnd since the puzzle of this game is rather challenging/tricky for RPGMaker game, here are few general hints from me in case you're stuck,\n[list]\n    [*]Check for hidden/invisible wall.\n    [*]Try to use items on your inventory.\n    [*]Some interactive object have no impact to solve the puzzle.\n    [*]The game show some hint, usually by highlight/flicker certain object.\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Graphic/music[/h2]\nNothing much to say here. There's few usage of stock RPGMaker asset which used accordingly. The music is nice. While the artstyle/visual is on good side, personally i feel it doesn't match very well with space/sci-fi theme. The cutscene CG also looks good.\n\n[h2]Misc.[/h2]\nThis game runs well on Linux with only minor problem. I experienced one bug which makes me unable to continue the game (not caused by Linux, since it also happen on device which use Windows OS), but the developer fixed it after some time. The game only offer single save file which is annoying to me since i experienced a bug and few puzzle are very tricky.\n\n[h2]Conclusion[/h2]\nOverall Mihirha's Legacy is nice RPGMaker despite few hiccups I've mentioned above. The developer is also responsive to my query which is also plus point. If you're RPGMaker enthusiast, you might want to try this game.\n- This is like, the End of Evangelion of RPGmaker games.\n- 8 years of free updates and counting\nCheap price of $9.99 and frequent sales\nHundreds of hours of gameplay\nA crap load of customization options\nAmazing mod support\nTold Epic Games to go away when they tried to buy them out\n\nHow based can a developer get???\n- \nWell, after almost a year of not playing this game, I must say, the devs did fix most of my issues. *Most*. Creative mode is fun, but you still need to collect stuff to make things, which is incredibly tedious. On top of that, the character dialogue is still really annoying and you need a NASA computer to play at a stable framerate, but hey, you can actually play without getting your ass beat. I'd like to up my ranking to an 8/10. Very fun, but I highly recommend playing with others. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOG REVIEW (outdated):\nThis game has potential, but unfortunately having fun with it is impossible if you aren't a hardcore survivalist.\n\nCritical Issue #1:\nThe main characters won't stop talking. Everytime you eat or hold the torch they say an unfunny one-liner that makes me want to gouge my eyes out with forks. Even Robin Ayou from Subnautica: Below Zero talked less, and the original game had a silent protaganist. Having characters that have constant dialogue that always repeats is just so annoying to the point where I had to turn off the volume. If the main characters were silent but atleast talked with each other, then I could see potential in that. But they just talk and talk and talk and none of it means anything.\n\nCritical Issue #2:\nThe enemies are way too hard to battle. To make better gear, you need to take on enemies that are so difficult to battle. Maybe you could say I'm just not good at battling enemies in survival games, but I was able to easily battle monsters in Terraria, Minecraft, Subnautica and Raft just fine. When your in-game monsters are too hard to defeat without gear that requires you to battle even MORE monsters, it is not fun, repetitive, and frustrating.\n\nCritical Issue #3:\nThe story is in the background. The fact that the story doesn't impact the game as much as it should is probably the worst aspect of any piece of media out there. The game sends you an a goose chase to find the  main story and it is infuriating. The story itself is all over the place. First it just seems like you need to make yourself grow bigger, but then it goes completely off the rails and into this scientist bunker with a robot that gives you quests, but you can ignore him and continue playing. I don't know if they finished the story, but so far it is not good.\n\nSomewhat Critical Issue:\nThere is no setting to dial back the graphics without lowering the resolution to look like Terraria. I can't see, and it is dumb and brings the whole beautiful vibe of being small down, ironically.\n\nMinor Issues:\nThe music is bland, and although I love electronic/synth music, this is just not it. The fact that you can't have bugs as pets or mounts, or even herd them is extremely upsetting. The farming sucks ass, it gives you 4 items of what you grew every 2 in-game days, when you can just find that item in more abundance at the place where it is located. Under the pond... JESUS CHRIST, the graphics are so bad. The wavy filter looks so bad, and you can see the entire underwater area crystal f**king clear, even though other smaller bodies of water have some kind of murkiness to it. Minor issues like this hold back the game.\n\nAlthough this is still in early access, it feels as if they wasted a lot of potential already. For such a unique world and concept, it never really exploits the amazing and obvious things that it can accomplish. Why not grow your own personal army of ants? Oh sorry, you can pick up eggs but they hatch and they aren't friendly. Why not create a raft made of weed stems and lilypads? Oh sorry, you can just build a base that looks like a boat. Although there are much worse steam games out there, and ones that I have hated more than this, this was sort of a slap to the face. It's not god-awful, and there are a lot of good things about it like the cartoony bug designs and the beautiful graphics, but honestly, it's a 6/10 bordering on a 7, and although many others have enjoyed this, being the super critical demogorgon that I am, this didn't exactly \"ground\" me.\n- This game is basically awesome, under 3 conditions:\n\n1- You get rid of all on-screen icons (i.e. incoming attacks, ennemy spotting)\n2- Do not care about secondary missions only here to further lenghten the game's lifespan\n3- Play the game as you would if  YOU were in charge\n\nBasically, nevermind the Ubisoft micro transactions' system and other abhorrent company induced  greed-leaned system to get stuff faster and more easily by robbing you out of your hard-earned cash...you can finish the game without spending a single dime in the store, it's all pay to win...\nThe open-world aspect is very satisfying and rewarding, in terms of progression, don't fall for the micro transaction system\nCombat is easy even in the highest difficulty setting, but makes you think you are badass when you slash through waves of ennemies, whose AI is rather basic, with your arsenal of rockets, LMGs and explosives but it is satisfying as fuck!\n\nImagine strapping C4 to your plane, jump out of it, have it crashing down an ennemy outpost meanwhile you are parachuting down and throwing hand grenades their way, land on a roof and eliminate the remaining ennemies with fire ammo shotgun and a motherfucking M60 with armor-piercing bullets while throwing dynamites and there you have it...FarCry5 in a nutshell\n\nOh and don't forget about the flame-thrower lol, who doesn't love a flame-thrower scorching ennemies to their own demise eh?\n\nFarCry5 got it all, extreme freedom of how you wanna handle a situation (stealthily or all guns blazing) while being challenging enough in the highest difficulty setting!\nP.S. don't forget to turn off all the on-screen icons, really ruins it for hardcore FPS fans by making it extremely easy, please hear me out, you don't need these!\n- Great gameplay with baaad user experience. There are no tooltips or explanations as to what is going on at all, just kinda gotta figure it out. Otherwise the gameplay is smooth and there's a climb mode called spiral, slay the spire style, very fun. 5 different classes all able to level their decks and get new cards and abilities until lvl 30 I think, got my enchantress to 20 but still more to go. Story mode is more of a tutorial but still interesting.\n- Great game, Horrible new publishers who stole the IP from the original creators. Do not support these thieves\n- Great Game, play the Demo instead of reading reviews.\n- Horrible game couldn't learn how to drift in 13 hours i was using a wheel btw apparently its harder but like wheel is cool I'm not gonna play it on controller that's lame. My dad also couldn't drift either and he knows how to drift irl. I also cant get a refund because i spent so long try to drift :(\n- This is easily one of the funniest games I played in 2017.  In the 20 hours it took me to solve it the first time, I pretty much did nothing else until I had finished it, despite the fact that I was supposed to be studying.\n\nThe game is set in absurd western themed world where humour is so baked into the fabric of everything that there is virtually nothing that isn't some kind of joke.  This could easily fall flat if it were poorly written, but I found the writing to be fantastic.  Obviouslly humour is subjective so if you aren't onboard with it's humour you proably won't get much out of it.  For everyone else you are due for a hell of a ride as the game is an absolute hoot.\n\nThe game takes place in a kind of openinsh world with your character setting out from a location on their horse. You can either select to \"Wander\" in which case you will make a broad loop out and around, potentially unovering new map locations or encountering a random encounter.  You can also direct travel to locations you have found and will also be told about map locations from NPC's or as the outcomes of various quests.    The world is feels quite expansive with a lot of interesting locations to explore.  There are a couple of central plot quests to pursue and a bunch of side quests as well.  In my 20 hour playthrough I managed to complete the main story but still had a few side things Id managed to miss all the clues for.\n\nCombat in the game takes place in a turn based format that should feel familiar to anyone has played a JRPG before.  You stand on one side, your foes tand on the other and you select your various attacks and abilities from a list specific to each characters class.  As you gain XP  you can choose what skills you buy so you can tailor your character to your play style, with higher skill levels costing increasing amounts of XP.  You can further personalise your character with a swathe of various equiment, almost all of which is humorous and absurd.  The combat is not particularly complex but its good enough and the humour is so good that it really does the heavy lifting for keeping you engaged.\n\nAs you can see from the screenshots the graphics portray everything in stick figures, but everything is surpisingly detailed and the great animation and the little touches really add to the charm of world.  A still screenshot doesn't really do justice to how much fun this game is to see in motion.\n\nThe music and sound are suprisingly good too, with twangy guitars and banjos mixed with good old time whistling and other wild west sounding stuffness.  Once again is better than you have any right to expect from such an overtly daft title and between the lively graphics and relelentless humour It's just another layer of polish to draw you into the games odd version of the wild west.\n\nLook I flat out loved this game. It was a delight. As I said, your milage may vary if the humour doesn't tickle your funny bone but I can tell you now, never have I laughed so hard at a game as I did digging through the spitoons in West of Loathing.\n\nGold.\n\n9 out of 10\n- If you are looking for a game that you can never master, here is the game for you.\n- I bought this game in order to review it, seeing as there were no current reviews for it. \nI thought I'd help the game out by maybe giving it that tiny bit of publicity it needed to get off the ground.\nIn doing so I have failed. As this game isn't worth reviewing, there is nothing to review. Well, I should say there is stuff to review but I feel as though the dev's didn't even attempt to make this a game that anyone would enjoy. Well actually I'll let them off of the target of \"enjoy\", I'd go further to say it doesn't even feel like they tried to make a game that someone who had nothing to do and was bored out of their mind would say maybe I'll play this for a bit\nI jumped straight in, ignored the help in menu and started playing. It took me at least 4-5 mins before I even had the slightest concept of what was going on and what I had to achieve. Once I did get the hang of it I still thought \"I must be missing something, I'm not really doing anything\" so I ventured to the help menu to find that nope, thats it buddy.\nThe controls are lacking, the soundtrack and the sound effects (which happen to be a melody playing) do not blend at all, (they play completely out of time on top of the soundtrack).\nYou can buy it and prove me wrong, go ahead. This is just my opinion.\n- EDIT: I nominated this game for game of the year (2023)\n\nLong ago I had heard about this game and how detailed and intricate it could be, and how you could spend hours upon hours building the massive empire of dwarves only for it to all come crashing down in some spectacular but unforeseen way.  Then I got into Rimworld briefly and thought it was ok, but it tended toward chaos a bit too much for my liking.  THEN I heard this game was coming to steam and I eagerly awaited it.\n\nIt's not necessarily that I was too good to play a game with mostly ascii/character graphics (I used to play them a lot back in the 1980s).  I was more intimidated by the depth of the game and not knowing if there was a wiki for it (there is) or how I'd find help if I needed it (I'm sure there's a ton of communities JUST for this game).  I expected that when it came to Steam, it'd be beefed up and worth the wait.\n\nWell it finally arrived and I think I'm STILL a bit intimidated by the sheer amount of options you have... mostly because it's not just me that I have to worry about, but a whole community of dwarves.  In the case of something like minecraft, I could dig a whole intricate tunnel and if stuff starts to go bad, I just high-tail it out of there and recover until I can go back and finish it.  In Dwarf Fortress though, if stuff starts to go bad, you can't just leave.  You are encouraged to deal with the adversity and push onward in the name of greatness... or something.\n\nIn a way it's like role playing, except you don't have to roll character sheets and you don't really control any of the characters directly.  You make decisions about where to mine, what trees to chop down, what to build, what to trade, what to plant, and for every thing there is a season (turn turn turn).  You're forced to deal with death, birth, attacks, sickness, madness, and a ton of other things that I have no idea are coming.  \n\nI keep thinking \"I could do better\" and I start a new game, but then I start to realize that no matter what I do, I'm never gonna have a perfect game, or a game where everything goes exactly according to plan.  I am eventually going to have to buckle down and stick to one game save to see it through.\n\nIf you're like me and starting something new holds a lot more interest than continuing an existing project (ADHD?) you may have difficulty with this game.  At the same time you may become so engrossed in it that you lose track of time and suddenly it's 6am and you wonder why you stayed up all night digging holes.  I'm starting to feel a bit of the madness myself.  (it's almost 4:30am as I write this)\n\nIn any case, it's probably not for everyone, but I'd say if you're unsure, find the non-steam version and try that, and if you can grok what's going on and it interests you, definitely buy this and support the developers... OR buy this and try to stay under the 2 hour refund  limit while you learn the basics (Good luck with that, it'll be 6 hours before you know what happened).  I believe this game is worth the money though (full price).  If you were going to wait for a sale you'd be waiting a long time anyway.  \n\nTL;DR If this looks interesting to you, don't wait! Buy now.  If you aren't sure, do a bit of research and come back and buy it.\n- Even with over 500 years difference between us, Andreas is one of the most relatable characters I've played this year because I too would rather try to ineffectively solve random mysteries than directly confront my depression.\n- [h1]An amazing sequel to Resident Evil 1.\n\nIncluding auto-saves, no more tedious door/room loading transitions, fluid movement controls, new weapons, enemies and more!\n\nThe character models and graphics are absolutely amazing!\nClaire lookin' pretty fire in the red jacket. Reminds you of Zoey from Left4Dead.\n(Although neither were modeled from each other, a total coincidence)\n\nDefinitely more fun than RE:1 in my opinion!\n\n10/10[/h1]\n- Disclaimer: This is review from player who prefer story-rich game and haven't played any game by Arkhouse Telegraph.\n\nThe good:\n+ Outstanding 80's-esque visual pixel artstyle. It reminds me of few SNES/Atari/Gameboy games.\n+ Fairly good soundtrack.\n+ Some cutscene/area have fascinating atmosphere.\n+ Run well with Steam proton, so it's likely this game is playable for Linux/Steam Deck user. Although the platformer area might show too many small detail for 7\" display.\n+ Game OST/artbook is available for free on Arkhouse website.\n\nThe bad:\n- While i understand nature of this game require player to find out most thing and go through trial-and-error, some parts definitely need to be explained better. I refer to lack of autosave (for most part of the game), not letting player know about manual save (you can do it by head left after exit for cylinder elevator until you see display/sign \"< S\" and suggestion to visit block H (where you get some guidance).\n- While the manual say i can play R. U. N. E. 3000 first, i have hard time understanding the story and lore/world building. Conversation such as \"DO? DORODO!\" is mostly gibberish and i only can make vague guess based on few specific term (\"V2\", \"50/50\", etc.) and area i've visited. Short recap of previous games (even it's on the manual) could be really helpful for newcomers.\n\nThe ugly:\n* I experience a bug where i fight boss i'm not supposed to fight yet. In detail, [spoiler] after i exit from P block to get symbol cracking code, i was thrown to G block where i fight G-Cat/10th boss. The worst part is the boss HP bar started with red color and auto 3-60 cannon never perform attack. Fortunately the bug doesn't occur again after i load from manual save.  [/spoiler].\n* The gameplay variation/idea is very interesting, but the execution is mixed bags (more explanation on below paragraph)\n\nSaturn Quest: R. U. N. E. 3000 has lots of gameplay variant/modes (Adventure, Shoot'em up, Platformer and many more) to keep the game fresh. While each area/boss have different reason why it's challenging/difficult, many of those is very unbalanced. For example, [spoiler] Bioplatus M-3D/6th boss [/spoiler] require you to have extraordinary eye-hand coordination and multitasking skill. Among all enemy that resemble boss fight, i only managed to beat 6-7 boss without using cheat.\n\nThis game also has very few checkpoint on each area/boss. On adventure/platformer area, you could restart from beginning after spending 10-20 minutes where you have to avoid same trap or collect same item again. On boss fight, that means you'll need to repeat whole fight most of the time. It's could be annoying because since you're forced to find out boss behavior the hard way or repeating tedious part of the fight.\n\n3 HP and lack of difficulty option could be irritating for most modern player. There are time when i found out i only lose 3-10 HP when i use cheat and beat the boss. If there's easier difficulty where i have 6-10 HP, i could beat more boss by myself. But don't get me wrong, i feel really satisfied each time i beat boss (which i deemed can be beaten with practical amount of effort) without cheat. If the developer bother add easy difficulty which has higher player HP, give more Nana and slightly lower boss HP, far more people could enjoy this unique piece of artwork.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nWhile i have some rant, it's really unique experience even though i've played few hundred games. In overall, i have more positive sentiment than negative sentiment of this game. But even though i choose \"Yes\" when Steam ask \"Do you recommend this game?\", i'd rather choose \"Neutral\" or \"Information\" instead. If you're fan of 80's game or really like difficult game, you might come to like this game. But for most people, i'd recommend you to seek other game. Although if you really insist to play this game, you could use Cheat Engine and modify HP/Nana using value type Double (also called float64 or 8-byte float).\n\nP.S. I definitely will play the sequel (Episode IV-VI: White Meteor Saga according to the artbook) [b]IF[/b] the developer bother add easy difficulty option and more checkpoint during boss fight/exploration.\n- [I received this product for free from a giveaway]. Only played for a short time, but sheesh, it's a bit of a mess both visually and gameplay wise. There's not much I can really say that would differ from what's shown in the trailer (rather crude MS-paint looking drawings with a few short looping backgrounds). You jump when moving right or left, flappy-bird esque, you dodge stuff going across the screen and from the top, which is a bit boring to me, but some may enjoy it more. You also have to go out of the screen to dodge sometimes, but also if you go too far out (who knows how far) you'll die as well. It might be an okay time waster for free (like old flash games), but I wouldn't recommend spending your money on this.\n- Holy fuck. I wish I could recommend this game. I really, really wish I could. But there's just so much frustration with the core experience that kills me, to the point that I cannot see myself going through to the end.\n\nOkay. The graphics, story, music, world design and even some of the small design features are incredible. I don't need to tell anyone that. I love Studio Ghibli, and as a fellow composer, Joe Hisaishi's music. However, the core aspect you probably noticed I left out is the gameplay. Yeah.\n\nThe amount of grind in this game feels unreal, which as a JRPG I wouldn't care about, but the combat system is so utterly meaningless. I saw a review that said something to the effect of - the game works on \"if you find a difficult section, you can't outsmart it, just have to grind until it's not difficult anymore\" and that is the most accurate sentence I've heard about any game. A third of my playtime is grind. The sacrifice of static turn-based combat is the game has a major lack of input from the player, but also a lack of responsiveness when the player actually needs to make quick and smart decisions. For reference, I got up to when the game gives you a dragon and essentially sets you off on a quest for 3 magic macguffin items, where it should open up, but that's when the majority of grind kick in.\n\nImagine you were playing Pokemon, but every evolution resets your level. No hyperbole, it resets the level to 1, and you have to grind it up all again, spending about an hour to get back the stats you lost, which itself is dependant on the evolution actually being worth it (it usually isn't). Not only that. but all the Pokemon you catch also only come at level 1. That is this game. What I find incredibly difficult about this is you have to willingly handicap yourself to progress for an hour, and if you try to evolve your familiars in bulk, you end up with a useless party. This whole system of catching creatures they directly took from Pokemon, meaning they saw how leveling up worked and thought this needed to be changed. It was a very deliberate design decision. Not to mention you often get multiple evolution paths that drastically change play-styles with little to no indicator to what you're actually choosing from.\n\nAs a kid, this game would be too complex with too many systems and options to handle at once. As an adult, I don't have the time to pour hours into a game that so frequently disrespects your time. If this game wasn't animated by Studio Ghibli, it would've been forgotten about quickly. Change my mind.\n- Honestly I've put over 400 hours into 20XX and this game is even better! Even though it's unfinished as of current it's still a fantastic time and truly stands out on it's own.\n- (If you're past a certain age, I can just say that this is Take Two Interactive's \"Bureau 13\" game, except actually done WELL. If not, keep reading.)\n\nTechnobabylon was one of the best games I played in 2017 (yeah I know it came out in 2015, shh). Wadjet Eye has done it again with Unavowed, one of the best games I played in 2018 and an amazing capstone to all of their work so far. You can play this game without having played the Blackwell series, but you'll get a little more out of it if you have.\n\nIt's also a rather dark piece of work, with a tone somewhere between Sleepy Hollow (the TV show) and something like Buffy. Your character (whose gender and former profession are chosen by you) gets possessed and goes on a year-long murderfestival rampage across New York City. Eventually the Unavowed, a brave supernatural-evil-fighting duo show up, and with the body back in your own control you sign up to fight evil with them. \n\nAs the game goes on, you recruit more characters in Bioware style, solve mysteries (all of which center around that year of hell your character went through), make Tough Choices and work to make the city a better place. All in absolutely gorgeous 640x480 resolution pixel art. \n\nThere were a couple of puzzles that slowed me down (the word \"LEGS\" is going to cause me to make faces for weeks) but this mostly flowed very smoothly. If you're at all a fan of past Wadjet Eye creations, this game needs to be in your life. If you're not, it's a good starting place, maybe the best starting place except that its quality might spoil you for the rough patches of past games.\n\nThis game contains some gore, some body/existential horror that might be jarring to some, and a lot of swearing.\n- Would I recommend DBD? ...It's complicated.\n\nDead By Daylight is an unique experience of asymmetric hide and seek/tag with shifting rules. \nIs the game fun? Yes. Is it creative? Yes.\nIs it fair and enjoyable? Well, it depends.\nGames get very intense, and playing as killer is some of the most intense gaming experience I've ever accumulated...\nWhich is where things often go wrong. The survivors seem to have decided that the killers have to honor strict code of rules. Don't use these items, these abilities, or these strategies. If you do, you'll be insulted after the game.\nIf you follow these rules, the odds are that you will spend the game running in literal circles, the survivors will win, t-bag you at the gate and then insult you after the game. I don't know about you, but that kind of ruins the game for me. It is actually kind of amazing how helpless one can feel in this game.\n\nSo to conclude my thoughts; I really like the game, but I also really hate it. I can't recommend it, as every time I fire it up, there is about 50% chance I feel more harassed, than entertained.\nI play a lot of online games, from League of Legends to Tekken, but this is the only one that makes me frequently think: \n\"I should really uninstall this\"\n\nEdit: \nI returned after a long break, and I still kinda like the game. \nHowever, same pattern repeats whenever I return. Eventually, I get teabagged one time too many and uninstall the game. The game is fun, the community could not be much worse. And sadly, that often ruins the experience.\n- I really liked the concept of this game of navigating through orbits to collect crates and then successfully landing on the exit.  However, there just isn't enough content to justify it being sold as a complete product, especially at its current price of $6.99.  You see everything there is in the first couple of levels.  No new mechanics are added to the game as you progress.  The developer admits that the game is too simple and the fix was to add artificial difficulty to make the game longer.  For instance, rather than have intuitive controls using toggles, it requires the player to activate thrusters with one hand and turn them off with another.  The level design stops adding anything new and just adds more tedious narrow paths that must be navigated rather than an actual challenge or puzzles.  Finally, the DLC appears to be “pay to win” rather than getting any new content, it just gives the player access to aircraft that should be included already in the game.  By level 9 it is near impossible to progress any further with the default ship as it cannot accelerate fast enough to get through the small orbit and requires purchasing the DLC to advance the level.\n- Is Duskers a fun game? Yes. Would I recommend it? No, because of one simple reason:\n\nA lack of content with no mod support.\n\nDuskers is a little like No Man's Sky in the sense that the first few hours are filled with fun and wonder, but everything afterwards becomes a disappointment because the game turns out to be far more shallow than it initially seemed. As a player, I yearned to explore more of the randomly generated galaxy in Duskers because I wanted to see what other horrors, mods, and derelict types I would encounter in the empty universe - but in the end, it turned out that there was really very little else to see besides what you find in the first couple of hours. \n\nHere's a quick rundown of where the content was most lacking:\n\n--Enemy types: there's only 4 different enemies. FOUR. They also behave pretty much identically with the exception of the last one.  This was definitely the biggest interest-killer for me. \n\n--Derelict types end up mattering very little. Government A? Salvage C? Military B? It really doesn't change the layout in a particularly noticeable fashion, with the only differences being 1-2 extra ship defense turrets or something like that. \n\nI really, really wanted to give Duskers a thumbs up - I loved the aesthetic, I loved the atmosphere, and I loved the unique command line interface - but unfortunately, after a few hours, I came to realize that there's really just not enough actual content here, and that's heartbreaking for fans of this niche genre like myself.\n\n\n- game is good and perfect graphics but i have a big big problem that the machines like harvesters dosent harvest all the crops and leave a lot behind !! and also sowing and planting machines !!!! what a big problem \n\ni been playing farming simulator since farming simulator 2011 and i never had a problem like this before ..\n\nHELP ME PLEASEEEEE\n\nPlus This game is just like every farm before :) only with a better graphics\n- It's more of a mixed recommendation but the positives outweigh the negatives if you're a returning fan.\n\nEverything in the game that's an adaptation of the original FF7, I love.  It gave me major nostalgia vibes to walk through a gorgeously rendered versions of FF7's environments.  The combat is much more engaging - no more watching a tv show on the side while I button-mash another random encounter.  Many of the big story moments still hit and I found even more to love in the characters based on their performances going beyond text boxes and blocky animations.  Even the music is just top-notch.  The OST will be a mainstay in my playlist for years.  It feels like I'm seeing the old game with fresh eyes and remembering why it made such an impact.\n\nThat said, the new content feels like a filler arc in a beloved anime.  Your character falls into a random hole like 3-4 times, spends 2 hours fighting random baddies, and then walks out like \"right, so back to that thing I was doing.\"  I don't even know if a new player could understand wtf is happening with Sephiroth because he's never really introduced and certain essential events are never explained.  It tries to take some clever left-turns on the plot so returning players have new surprises to enjoy but it often feels pretentious and pointless.  The ending gave me flashbacks to Peter Jackson's Hobbit trilogy because of how unnecessarily forced it was and the sudden cartoon levels of action.\n\nI'm tentatively enthusiastic for the sequel but there's a few troubling signs I hope don't become a trend.\n- In 2013, after 10 years of waiting, the Sim City community of modders, fans, and aficionados rushed out to purchase the fifth installment of Sim City. Ten years is a long time to wait for a game, but people had a lot of faith in Maxis when they announced the title. Long story short, it was a massive dissapointment. Maxis and EA crippled Sim City 5 with DRM, Always On APM, tiny maps, forced origin installation, lacking mod support, no steam support, and a forced multiplayer aspect.  I decided to not purchase the title, so it may have been a decent game, but 2 years later a team of 12 people created a game that does everything maxis insisted was utterly and totaly impossible.  \n\nEverything the mod community did that kept Sim City 4 on the shelves in Wallmarts across America for an entire decade was ignored. Maxis (and to a lesser extent EA) ignored the fans, and gave the people who had kept them in business for twenty years a crippled subpar game.  And for that Maxis is now out of business. They will never make another game, and it is no one's fault but theirs.\n\nNow pretend none of that happened. It's 2013 again, and here it is people: Sim City 5. \n\nThe game balance is a bit on the easy side for veterans of the genre, but the potential map size is ENOURMOUS and customizing your city could fill up years of gameplay time.  The game runs so smoothly with so much going on, it really shows how lazy Maxis was with their approach.  The glass in buildings reflects the sun and the buildings near it, there are dynamic shadows, zoning is back, and it is not 'dumbed down'.  A single tile in this game is twice the size of the alloted map in Sim City, and you can purchase dozens of additional tiles to expand.  The map editor is awesome, the community is thriving, there are mods to do anything you want, and this is the city building game we've all been waiting for.  I can not possibly reccomend this more.\n- The Witch's House has been my most favorite RPG Maker horror game for years and now I have the remaster which I can buy to directly support the developer. Needless to say how good it is so I will only talk about what is changed and what still remains.\nThe game is still suspenseful and very atmospheric. Some people may worry that the updated graphic and engine may take that away but trust me it is still there and not going anywhere.\nSome sound effects/dialogues have been changed beside the graphic which I am not against it at all. Still very like the remaster.\nThe control is still the same which is as clunky as before when you are not used to. I think the developers know that and decided to not change it so I won't complain. Just say it out for you to know because the game is very old so the control is still there in the past with many other RPG maker games.\nI very like the new graphic and I think they deserve much more compliments for this. However, I like the weird-big-eye Viola model and her less hair skinny portrait more. It look weird and funny at the same time. The new model makes her more beautiful but the portrait makes her kinda fat (at least to me).\nThe new hard mode is.... hard that all I can say without spoiler.\nI don't know whether or not I should calll this a remake but at least it is done better than DSR. And Small indie developers should be supported more. May be \"Ib\" will be remastered some days too if this game is success\nThump Up!\n- good game but later missions seem to be less polished ran in multiple bugs when playing as The Son enemies getting stuck in impossible to reach places and for some odd reason some characters have dog killing animations that for the most part are bugged and only work half the time causing an insta death and a retry don't even understand why later in the game you have to do animations to kill dogs as for basically the whole game you don't need to perform animations also seems to have some input lag throughout the whole game but overall its decent and when its on sale you should buy it.\n- [i] THIS MATCH WILL BE RED HOT. HERE GOES [/i]\n\nLord knows what attempt number, and you again hear the ring bell. The level boss keeps laughing, taunting your every failure. The brainwashing music is starting to give you a headache, your eyes are moving on their own, the difficulty is boiling your blood to the very cells and the controller screams for mercy as every retry gets more and more intense. The anger flows and the addicted child in you claims it will be the last try. The reactions become pure instinct, flowing in a quick, relentless succession of moving, shooting and dodging a thousand projectiles. But suddenly, it happens. \n\n[i]A KNOCKOUT![/i] \n“Phew, that was intense...time for the next one!”\n\nThis is the very essence of Cuphead. A punishing yet immensly satisfying game of bullet hell, mixed with a beautiful and just so goddamned perfectly recreated animation technique that will have you wondering what crazy stuff they will make up next. This is a game that yells nostalgia and effort in every moment. It’s a wonderful experience that at every turn you can tell they didn't just put blood, tears, effort and sweat at every second of work for the last years, they put so much LOVE. Love for the past and love for an era long gone but never forgotten.\n\nThe most pure fun I had raging in the whole year. Absolutely recommended to anyone up for a challenge that will give as much as it takes.\n- if you're looking to experience the greatest time travel drama ever made then I really recommend giving it a chance because there is a lot to love here. Steins;Gate: Elite is a great game, every part is animated, which is nice. Many scenes have completely different music and honestly it all fits better. I think it is the best version of Steins;Gate. If you've only watched the anime, this is worth checking out for the additional endings and science themes.\n\nSteins;Gate Elite is a new way to discover the classic story, fusing the anime with the visual novel. El Psy Kongroo, 10/10\n- Hard as balls, fantastic music, great gameplay, and a great premise in the story.  It also has the side benefit of being completely unique, nothing else like it out there at the moment.\n\nA game I keep cursing at, rage quiting, and yet keep coming back to.  Truly rewarding, as the game gets better as you get better.\n\nCan't recommend it enough.\n- Armored Souls Prepare to sigh....\nIf you are a long running fan of this game it's a mixed bag, if you are new to the series you might like it.\n\nFor the new comers this is robots on roller skates, also screw the natural laws of physics because it makes a cool game.  The key to this game is overwhelming fire power and maneuverability. Here's the rub for me I have AC1 and a PS2 to play it on, I have every US release of this game since AC1 to AC4A, I never finished Nine breaker as it was boring. Below are my gripes, my praise, then my mixed bag in order of paragraphs.\n\nFirst the bad: this game is infested with mechanics that are from Dark Souls and have no place in an AC game.  In no order here they are: status effects, stunning other players,  firing hand weapons cause you to stop moving and leave yourself vulnerable,  repair kits (the flasks from souls), being stunned due to poise (or whatever new dumb name they called it), resupply before a boss fight, and 360 shields.  Stats effects build up like they do in dark souls, this is new to the franchise and really has no place in it, I could see heat weapons causing things to over heat more quickly and maybe some other things, the way this is done is so odd, it feels like a multiplayer add on.  Although its fun to stun bosses and other opponents, this is new to the game and feels like it doesn't belong, I can only assume its been added for competitive multi again.  There's always been this idea that traumatic impacts don't hit the pilots in this game, it's just always been like that and considering the tech it make sense. The latter is true for your AC being stunned too.  AC as a series has gone back and fourth on making you stop to fire a BACK mounted weapon unless you had quad legs or a tank base, this game is the first where a hand weapon makes you stop to fire it.  This is an utter anathema to the game in general, maneuverability and quickly timed dodges were always key.  It ruins your ability to stay moving and fight effectively, which also limits the fun in building and designing your AC.  I don't think there is an AC game in the US with \"repair kits\" yet.  I'm not saying get gud we don't need repair kits, but they are just a distraction to me with no added value.  Giving a player a very high health value is not bad, but I makes each engagement more meaningful, I need to keep my HP high, their are may fights I had where I didn't need to bother with them.  Adding to this mess is the boost before a boss fight, they were never announced like this before; whatever HP you had going in was all you got.  This sticks with me, because the most memorable boss in the whole series was the only one I cannot beat: I took too much damage before the boss fight every time, no magic box to helped me out.  For those of you who are curious it was Zinaida in last Ravens, the suicide drones took too much out of me before the battle.  In AC4A and AC4 there were 360 shields, I'm only guessing, but the shields seemed to mitigate damage.  I don't know because don't get hit or kill them fast has always been my basic plan.  In this new one, its just another health bar that exists for reasons... I don't mind the old shield system give up a defensive advantage for things like assault armor blasts.\n\nThe good stuff.  I like the mix of common enemies being easily dispatched, but still being a threat if you are too slow.  Adding to this is the more dangerous commons like the quad leg MT's.  There is a good combat balance here with crazy mini bosses mixed in like the stealth sniper bots. The bosses are big and badass, with some conventions thrown out the window like the bull charging boss not being weak after a charge. I did hate all the boss fights that involved a 360 shield. The world looks great, yup just darn purdy.  The new super fast tank base inspired by a wheel chair is dumbly fun.  The odd addition of quad legs letting you basically hover is novel and adds some depth to the outfitting of an AC.  Keeping reverse joint legs making you jump faster/higher is classic. The more effective AOE weapons on groups feels more strategic or a the very least feels damn cool when you nail three targets with one shot. Finally letting your AC back mount hand weapons and switch to them at the price of a second or two is a massive evolution, I love it, it should have always been there.\n\nSo there some other things that have changed, which I have mixed thoughts about.  There's now a thing with chips that make you more resilient to damage and other RPGesq things, cool I guess, its another reason to do the arena.  I still will kill them all until I am #1. Hidden objects are now in the game, I don't like them, but whatever, first time I have had to google anything on AC game other then where to buy it.  The plot is oddly boring for me, I think that's just me, last game being AC4A. The game announces when you are making a plot altering decision, its ok, but I would like it if the world just reacted to my decisions naturally no banners.  Weak spots on bosses,  ok its a thing, but firing an AT or plasma weapon at something (that isn't a soft spot) does nothing...not matter how many impacts, ehhh fine. \n\nI'm not done with the game, but over all fun.  Quit making armored souls and make Armored Core.  I was here before demon souls and I will be here after whatever souls, but only if you just keep making ARMORED CORE.  Is there a Japanese word for purity of purpose or ideal? I could use it to try and get my point across. \n\n\nP.S. the fan community paint jobs uploaded on line are gold.\n\n- Very calm game with heartwarming moments. Better played with friends. Really brilliant gameplay idea. I just hope it gets a final ending really soon!\n\nEdit: After reaching the ultimate end, I felt bit disappointed. The progress was just straight up boring and uninteresting after years of restarting again and again.\nVery fun game anyways\n- Steam version Review (For veterans coming from the mobile version):\n\nHi everyone! I've been a long time fan, playing the game on mobile since 1.5 (Theory of everything)\nThe Steam version is great, because, PC versions are always better, so if you have the mobile version and you're looking to \"Upgrade\" your game, this is your ticket. I highly disagree with people who try to crack the game. Come on, what are 4 dollars just to support the person who made us this amazing game? With that said, I will list all the pros and cons, comparing to the mobile version:\nPros:\n-Obviously better graphics, the backgrounds look beautiful and the blocks are more detailed, you can also adjust graphics to your prefference, varying from quiality, windowed mode resolution, as well as some other adjustments.\n-The level editor interface is VERY comfortable, there's a shortcut key for EVERYTHING. Nothing compared to Bluestacks. Using the new layers mode, you can classify your objects of the level in groups, for example, you can use one layer for solid blocks, one for decor, one for effects, etc... Incredibly helpful, as this will prevent you from constantly fighting with the game, in order to select an object which is placed in the same location as others.\n-Gameplay is great. Multiple ways to jump, and keys to place and remove checkpoints on practice. Really looking foward to being able to make your own controls scheme on 2.1!\n-2 exclusive icons. 'Cause why not, exclusives are always good.\n-Incredibly faster online performance. On mobile, it' almost impossible to save your progress. On PC it's done quick, songs are downloaded fast, as well as levels.\n-Tired of your phone/tablet running out of battery but you want to keep playing? No longer a problem! Unless you don't pay your electricity service (Higly unlikely) or have laptop (Just play while plugged in).\n\nCons:\n\n-Obviously, this great version cannot be taken on the go, so... Back to mobile GD.\n\nAlas, I'm done. This version is amazing. Recommended 100% to every Geometry Dash mobile player and newcomer as well. Thanks for reading, hope this makes you decide to buy the game!\n10/10 -IGN\n- This game surprised me in how good it was. I had heard about it, like everyone, and also like a lot of people I had dismissed it as a watered-down Dark Souls clone with a Star Wars skin, and let it collect dust in my Steam collection.\n\nI was wrong. The game's combat is tight and polished, just the right difficulty on Normal. The movement, the general game feel, is superb. The game has a competent story with excellent characterizations, character arcs, dialogue, exposition, world-building, and pacing.  The music feels like top-shelf Star Wars without being a lazy copypasta of John Williams's score (though you'll hear sprinklings of familiar motifs throughout, of course). \n\nThere are collectibles (they are all cosmetics), but it's a tasteful, reasonable amount of them, and they are distributed in a way that feels fun instead of like a chore, and you're never pressured into collecting them with menus or reminders; they are entirely optional in both a technical and a psychological sense. I actually found it fun to collect new appearances in order to play dress-up \"Fashion Souls\". \n\nThere are bosses, and they are challenging but not frustrating. Definitely easier than Dark Souls's harder bosses like Ornstein or Artorias, but still tricky enough that it feels rewarding to overcome them.\n\nIf I had to describe this game in two words, it would be \"just right\". There is just the right amount of each little element that it feels fun, never tedious, never like a grind. I'm a jaded old man who has seen it all and who is not easy to entertain, and I found this game extremely refreshing. If you read this review during the sale where it's only 3.99 USD, get it immediately.\n- [h1]After over 600 hours (played a few months extra via gamepass), im ready to drop a 'goodbye' review[/h1]\n\n\nI've bought this game knowing what im getting myself into, as i was playing FH4 for roughly 500 hours, being in a discord community that is very engaging with the game and players and is in an overall high quality, it made me want to keep playing both Forzas for way more time than initially intended, so im really grateful to these discord groups and their staff and members for this reason.\nWith that being being said, playing on your own will make your experience way quicker to be burnt out than with a community (and i aint talking about co-op convoys, but just getting more content by other players you can befriend with and talk to online). Community-wise, the game feels kinda the same like GTA V online, where you're dropped into an unnamed massive server with random players around you, yet arent given enough tools to properly communicate with them. Add to that, the horrendous platform that is called MS store / Xbox console companion that feels so damn clunky that even befriending and chatting with other friends is a gauntlet on its own, and makes you feel like you really need to find an actual community on a 3rd party platform (discord is generally ideal for this), or else you're being left to play alone even if the game is in online mode. These hurdles can be felt regardless if playing the Steam version or MS version, as making a MS account is necessary for this game to work and be connected online.\n\n[b]Ok, enough chatter about friends. . . .[/b]\n\n\nThe game itself is great and welcoming for the car newbs and car nuts alike, and no matter where you are on the car spectrum IRL and in the gaming world, you will feel the fun of this game especially if this is your first or 2nd Forza Horizon experience (i.e - you havent played FH 1-3). FH4 was quite similar to this one but had a lot more passion put into it, while FH5 has been given lots of QoL updates over its predecessors. Things like increased amount of props and the ability to put props in route creation so now you can design your own tracks with props involved, turning this game into a gmod-like experience if you're so inclined, alongside adding 'rules' to the driving experience, turning any typical race into a minigame of its own, with different objectives than just 'finish first'.\n[b]Important side note - [/b]This game is mostly for arcade fun and not designed for sim racing in mind, meaning that any gripes you have about its physics, sound, lack of competitiveness, etc, are quite redundant as there is always a fragile balance between fun and realism. Also, this game will not fulfill your mid 2000's NFS vibes, at all. This game is its own sub-genre of sorts and is less about weeb car upgrades (tho there are plentiful overall) and nitro, and more about car veriety and making new builds.\n\nThe game is structured with a playlist system - Each month is divided into 4 seasons (4 seasons per month - one per week). The months are called 'series' which the game devs are pushing into the game, and you have a month-long content to enjoy, with a weekly 'reset' time for each season (happening every thursday afternoon). Each month has its own theme, e.g - japanese cars, offroad racing, classic cars,  high performance track cars, etc. Each week (season) you get a new playlist of objectives to do (this is generally referred to as 'the weekly grind') like certain tournaments and other stuff. Playing with no pause would take you about 5-10 hours to finish an entire weekly playlist, in a typical non tryhardy playstyle.\n\n[b]Other content in this game[/b]\n\n* Over 700 cars in total, and more are being added every month with new (free) updates.\n* A spacious open world map of Mexico where you can drive freely with other players, (randoms or friends), either as freeroam or as a grouped convoy.\n* Co-op mode with random lobbies or friends you invite ahead of time.\n* Online racing, when you're playing against upto 11 other players (no bots) in typical fashion racing for xp and money (in game currency, called cr for short).\n* Community-made tracks - This is where the real fun begins especially if you're a member of a group that delivers high quality custom tracks. These tracks can have any theme in them like high/low performance cars, any road type, etc.\n* Auction house - You can buy and sell cars in an auction with other players.\n* Forza-official radio stations with genres like EDM, pop music, hip hop, rock, and lots of latina-based music.\n* Community livery and tunes - You can create and share your own car tunes and liveries and take others' from the community database.\n* Countless other minigames like capture the flag, zombies, super7 (custom objective-based challenges), and even a full scale battle royale mode.\n\n\n[b]My GamerTag is Avees128, so check out my custom tracks / tunes if you feel like it![/b]\n\n\n\n[b]Game versions and DLC expansions - Which to buy?[/b]\n\nThis game has 3 versions - Standard, Deluxe, and Premium. In general, you should only be thinking to buy either the standard or the premium version, as the deluxe only gives the (base game and) car pass, which is a free access to a bunch of some other cars you could eventually get in game anyway, without paying for that game version. The premium version of the game also adds some other meaningless car packs and (more importantly) 2 expansion maps.\nNow, you could see the fairly negative reviews these 2 expansions (Hot Wheels and Rally Adventure) have on steam, and this is because the reviewers have compared these DLC's to the DLC's from the past FH games, which were objectively superior to these current ones in most ways. Do you care about Hot Wheels at all? If no, skip it. Are you a rally fanatic? If no, then skip this one as well.\nImo, these 2 DLC's dont give an enjoyable content (and im not even a fan of HW nor Rally), especially when being compared to the past DLC's from FH4 (personally played and loved every inch of it) and FH3 (have not played at all but i only hear positive things about it and its DLC's - which ironically, one of them was HW).\n\n\n[b]Performance - [/b]I have a Ryzen 9 5900x + AMD RX 5700xt. When testing the built-in benchmark a year ago, i was getting the following results:\n\n1080p high - 113 FPS\n1080p ultra - 79 FPS\n1440p high - 99 FPS\n1440p ultra - 69 FPS (nice)\n\nUpscaling (FSR/DLSS) in this game is really bad, both for AMD and nVidia tech, so avoid these if you can. I cant comment on Ray Tracing since i cant run any RT features with my GPU, but from what i can tell, its minimal RT at best (which also means minimal performance drops). The game really loves Smart Access Memory / reBAR, so make sure you have it enabled if you can for a great fps boost of about 20% !.\n\n\n[b]In conclusion - [/b]The game itself is great and is a legit time sink (for better and for worse), but if you're not engaged in a welcoming community, it will be a relatively short amount of time (50-100ish hours till you'll feel exhausted from the endless grind of everything, so bare that in mind). If you're unsure if this game fits your flavor of racing game, i would either opt for the standard version or just try it out via gamepass and see how it feels like (just note that there are NO cross saves between the MS store platform and steam, so you will need to start over if you're switching between versions!).\n- After almost 300 hours in-game, I might be qualified to review this. I'll start by saying that Larian has really got something special here. I'm glad that the work is ongoing, but the progress is palpable. I've broken down my review into a couple sections to hopefully give you a better idea of what you can expect.\n\n1. Graphics\nBG3 has the best graphics in any CRPG I've played up until this point. The animations still need work, as there are a number of cutscenes where things and characters are misplaced. However, environments, spell effects, equipment, characters, etc., are all meticulously designed and you can rest assured that Larian has painstakingly made even the most inconsequential NPC stand out.\n\n2. Sound\nThe sound design is fantastic. Each spell and weapon attack has a unique sound. The ambient sounds are distinct with each area you are located in, as well as the soundtrack. The soundtrack, in general, is well composed. I could sit on the title screen and just listen to the opening song for a long time. The voice acting is fantastic, especially the narrator. The only issue that I've found with the sound is similar to that of graphical bugs: cutscenes need polish. Sometimes characters don't properly voice their lines when cued. If there is a large fight going on with many different effects at once, some new effects may not properly play either.\n\n3. Story\nNot a whole lot of tied up loose ends story-wise as of yet. However, the intro scene is phenomenal. Probably the best intro cutscene in just about any game I've played. From there, the story picks up on a grand scale, then drops you off in the  starting area. You then begin to pick up the pieces to figure out what is going on and how to best solve your little problem. The storyline so far as what's available in EA isn't overly complex, but the particularly enticing part about it is the number of other smaller plots and characters which lend to the main. Over the course of my playthrough, I've picked up several potential paths which could ultimately be taken probably closer to the midpoint of the finished game. \n\n4. Characters\nI'll keep this one brief, but I just want to take a second to say that all of the characters are very well fleshed out and distinct. Even simple NPC's have personalities which, for the most part, don't strike me as cookie cutter in any way. Care has been taken into writing seemingly each and every character, even many animals and corpses. Many actions you take have an effect on your party's opinion of you, but each character has different preferences. Some party members, however, are a tough to nail down as to what makes them happy, even after almost 300 hours. The personality differences between what is expressed through character dialogue and what changes their opinion of your character can feel a bit inconsistent.\n\n5. Combat\nThe combat is fun and rewarding. Each action you take feels as if it has a distinct impact on the battle. This is partially due to the aforementioned animation and sound effects, very punchy and flashy, lots of pretty colors. This is also thanks, in part, to the combat system adopted from 5th ed. D&D. The die rolls, while not visible during combat, add quite a bit of tension and strategy to a fight. You can't just fling cantrips and spells willy-nilly at random enemies and expect to come out on top (for the most part). The balancing is done well enough to allow for a fair fight, but one that doesn't hold your hand throughout and is rewarding when you win. The world design is also done so well that, anywhere a fight could possibly break out (you can attack/kill anyone), the environment lends a lot of variation and strategy to the fight. The enemies are also very smart, to the point where they will flank and take the high ground on you. Stay frosty!\n\n6. Exploration\nExpanding on the final point of the Combat section, the world design makes Faerun feel alive. There is usually something to find around every corner; exploration is very rewarding. Exploration is rewarded in a few different ways. You can get unique loot (while not necessarily as distinct as titles such as Elden Ring, there is a good variety of equipment to find), find interesting social encounters, or battles. Furthermore, battles can be turned to social encounters or vice versa. The versatility in how the player overcomes different situations is very well thought out. My main grip with the exploration is a personal one, but it's the map. It can get sort of tedious trying to navigate the world using the map. But, the exploration area is not particularly sprawling, so you won't be caught wandering around looking for a particular area for too long. A few important items for side quests also come to mind as being particularly hard to find, as they don't really stand out from the background. But, holding Left ALT will bring up titles for items lying around the area if you want to go that route.\n\n7. Races/Classes\nThe current races available are as follows: drow, human, githyanki, dwarf, elf, half elf, halfling, gnome, and tiefling. The classes are fighter, wizard, rogue, ranger, cleric, warlock, druid, sorcerer, warlock, and bard. Larian has done a good job distinguishing each race and class from one another, whether the customization options or progression. The only issue that I have is that the full PHB selection is not yet available. There are subraces available for each race, each with differing characteristics from another. The subclasses are all very self explanatory, if you are familiar with the 5th edition Player's Handbook. A few names had to be changed for certain things within classes, probably due to licensing issues. Also no multiclassing as of just yet. Curious to see if they decide to patch that one in.\n\n8. Character Creation (Visual)\nKind of simplistic at this point. There are no sliders which allow to you to sculpt the face or body, although there are a fair number of preset faces. A good number of hairstyles and facial hair options, as well as colors to apply. And yes, you can apply beards to female dwarves (lookin' at you, Rings of Power).\n\n9. Progression\nSimilar progression to 5e, except that there are several events which grant XP other than just slaying your enemies. Now comes the main problem I have with EA, the level cap. The world is very well designed and very dense, each action you take for the most part feels well rewarded with XP. But, a full playthrough of all the content could see you sitting at 4th level for several hours before completing. This is especially frustrating because 5th level is when you get your second attack and 3rd level spells. But the loot in the game still allows for a little more variety as it does continue to progress in power/utility even up until the end.\n\n10. Optimization\nI run this on a pretty mid-system (Ryzen 5, 1660ti, 16gb RAM) and I can hold between 50-60 fps when exploring on high settings. When in a busier fight, my fps ranges from 35-45 ish. There are a few bugs which impact functionality (dialogue not displaying during conversation, getting stuck on a character's turn during combat, random crashes, etc.). Luckily, these have all vastly reduced in frequency. While the gameplay is by no means flawless, it has reduced frequency enough to where it's not so bothersome as to ruin the game for me. Just depends on your bug tolerance. If you're a Bethesda fan, you'll be just fine.\n\nJust a final thought before I end this thing. If you just want to experience something different and don't mind playing a work in progress, this game is for you. Larian is fantastic at listening to user feedback for optimization to things as small as simple tooltips. If you want a full experience (and I 100% would not blame you if that were the case), just wait until it comes out. Hoping for early-mid '23.\n- [b][i]AMID EVIL[/i] is very much [i]Quake[/i] 1 level design in a [i]Hexen[/i]/[i]Heretic[/i] universe.[/b] It's well done. We're a bit spoiled this year with outstanding '90s FPS shooters. Personally, I prefer both [i]Ion Maiden[/i] and [i]DUSK[/i] over this title for the following reasons:\n\n1) I find [i]AMID EVIL[/i] to be a bit generic in terms of theme; the fantasy setting could use a bit more to set it apart.\n\n2) I prefer real or low fantasy weapons/guns over wands and totally high fantasy weapons. Now, don't get it twisted - I appreciate that these high fantasy weapons exist, but yeah, they leave something to be desired. I miss reloading and all of that. \n\n3) The level design in [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is much more 'sprawling' (for lack of a better term) just like the original [i]Quake[/i]. Most levels are indoors in what feels like an underground compound (at the time of writing this review). I personally like the backwoods feel of [i]DUSK[/i], or the dystopian cityscape of [i]Ion Maiden[/i] far more. I want to look up at the sky in most levels.\n\n4) The enemy design is different than the other two games I mention, which is good - but they all mostly have a 'same' kind of feel. The enemies are all super fast, so most of your efforts are focused on running backwards while fending them off. It's fun, but gunplay isn't quite as fun as the other two games for this particular reason.\n\n5) The font and overall menu system definitely feels 'Early Access'. I know the font is being worked on, which is desperately needed. \n\n6) My favorite way to play the game is Endless mode - and I feel like that's a flaw in itself. It's the opposite for me with [i]DUSK[/i]. I want to fall in love with the campaign, but eh, there isn't really any story or anything all that interesting to suck me in. The secrets are super easy to find compared to the other two games, too.\n\n7) No multiplayer. Now, I really don't care about this - but who designs a game in this genre without building this in from the ground up? You know the community is going to whine about this. Questionable design decision to say the least.\n\n[b]Well, it sounds like I just dumped all over the game.[/b] Please don't get me wrong. [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is a welcome addition to the genre. The *great news* is that this is not just some reskin of [i]DUSK[/i] - it certainly is it's own thing. And that's really important. \n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+Fairly polished game for Early Access\n+It's the most modern version of the original [i]Quake[/i] we've seen this year\n+Well optimized\n+Lots of content right now\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-The universe is generic\n-No multiplayer\n-The font is too hard to read\n-Music is nothing to write home about\n-The secrets are easy, and there really aren't all that many of them\n-Weapons could use more 'oomph' to them; also we should be able to use the special ability when we want to as opposed to it autotriggering\n\n[b]I was psyched out of my mind for [i]AMID EVIL[/i] - and while it is certainly good - I think I'll be focused more on [i]DUSK[/i] and [i]Ion Maiden[/i].[/b] Because, let's face it, gaming time is valuable and we can't play everything.\n- Overall its a great hunting game. The base game is good enough on its own to give you an enjoyable experience hunting several varieties of animals. \n\nI feel that some of the best content is in the DLC's. I dont mind the price tag for maps are they are just a large and some of them have a truly diverse animal population. \n\nThe Weapon Packs have some items that really should have been available in the base game (.22 rifle).\nTripod stands, Tents and ATV's are also DLC items that i feel should have been included in the base game. \n\nThe cost for these packs are not huge, and I have bought them, but they really do impact your play in a meaningful way so it is hard not feel like they were left out on purpose. \n\nBeing a former hunter in real life I would say that the realism of it is pretty good. Lung shots and heart shots drop animals quickly and using the right ammo along with good aim greatly influences this. A poor shot will leave you tracking this wounded animal across the map till you sneak up on it again or just give up. \n\nThey have a system called Tru Racks (sumthn like that) that simulates different qualities of animals. So you end up with little bucks, average bucks, and monster bucks. Weight and coloration plays a part in this too. In short every animal has a trophy of some kind and they are varied by what must be some sort of RNG. \n\nAll that having been said, this game can devolve into a shooting gallery were you kill everything on sight as there in no real incentive not to. You get money and experience for every kill you claim and wiping out a heard of deer with your DLC M1 Garand on your DLC Tripod Stand becomes the quickest way to bypass the grind.\n\n It feels like the game starts as a \"hunting sim\" and becomes a \"poaching sim\" once you realize the progression system is going to take a long time to do...\"ethically?\".\n\n\nAgain, this is a game i would recommend, but it is just that, a game. \n\n\n- Melatonin is a simple rhythm game, with a focus on ease of gameplay and calmer sounds.\nIf you're expecting something on the tougher or more upbeat side, this ain't it.  Ironically, I had more fun as I stopped focusing on scoring well, and more fun when I was just feeling the music and half-asleep.  The sounds and songs are quite relaxing lol.\n\nOn the shorter side of games, it still delivers an enjoyable experience in what it offers. The timing is a *little* on the forgiving side, and there are even accessibility options if you need a little more help, such as timing circles, metronome, and a bigger Perfect window.  If you'd rather go for a challenge, a Perfect only option is also available.\n\nControls are quite simple, using [strike]4[/strike] 3 directional keys and an action key (Space by default). In each tutorial, you're told whether you'll need to hit directional keys or the action key, and whether they're held or not, as well as general timing.  For some stages, the instructions don't give you as good an idea as the tutorial itself/timing circles do (Work and Time levels for me).  All good, but in some levels you get tempo changes in the middle of the song that can throw you a bit off, especially if you're just grooving to the audio cues... when you can hear and distinguish them.  Unfortunately, there are a few levels where the audio cues are either far too similar to each other, or happen too quickly to react to.  This can be a bit of a bummer, as I prefer working off audio for rhythm games, as their focus should be lol.  \n\nWhile Melatonin doesn't bring a whole lot to the table, it doesn't need to.  Less is more here, and the art and sound direction definitely hit their target.\nRelax.\n- Good lord, do we have a Game of the Year 2017 candidate here or WHAT?\n\nA million twin stick shooters have come and gone over the years since Robotron.  Many have compared themselves and failed.\n\nEugene Jarvis is the creative consultant on this title - so if anything has some \"spirit of Robotron\" in it - this is the game.\n\nThe game is Robotron + Gauntlet with a bunch of secrets rolled in.  As will all good twich arcade games, greed plays a central part in the game.  If you just want to mindlessly blast your way through the worlds - you can.  But you will not be rewarded for it.\n\nScoring high in this game is all about the multiplier - and the multiplier is all about saving humans (which can be harder than it sounds).  You have to chain your pickups of humans to get the highest multiplier.\n\nYou'll bring some great weaponry along the way; Rocket Launchers, Laser beams, smart bombs - even a melee sword.  Powershot is my fav :)\n\nAlong with the regular crew of bad guys,  you'll have special things to find and destroy too.\n\nCROSS PLATFORM leaderboards and local co-op play seal the deal.  Throw in a much of mini-achivements (feats) and you'll be so damn hooked on this game.\n\nIf you love twin stick twich arcade games?  Don't even think about it - BUY NOW.\n- It's a pretty game, but there's no option for manual saves, and autosaves only happen once in a great while instead of immediately after solving each puzzle or progressing through conversations. I also felt like the walking was extremely clunky with the mouse and keyboard, and I'd prefer click-to-walk.\n- When I show new games to one of my friends she always asks if it is possible to pee in the game and sadly I usually must tell her that it isnt possible because there is so few games where this special detail is being paid attention to. But this here my dude! I tried to show her the game yesterday so I got her setup on the valve index and start the game all good, but we couldn’t move at all... We tried everything! We tried physically move in our vr room to see the boards that had text written on them because we spawned behind them which I found a little weird as well. On the board it said eat the hamburger to start the game or eat the poo to guit. I saw a box on the street and I remembered by seeing the trailer there was a box where inside there was a burger so immediately we worked hard to try and reach the burger so we could start the game. It was too far away for us to try and actually in real life walk to it so we had to just accept defeat. She didn’t get to see her first vr game where it would be possible to urinate. I saw a update post a few minutes ago where you were saying something about movemnet in the game that you have to grip and throw arms around or something? This I guess we didn’t try since usually moving is one of the triggers to teleport or just the stick like in any controller. Today we will try again and hopefully succeed in our task to urinate in a vr game! You could be making history today my friend. And for all the bad reviews for this game I want to just say a couple things: cmon dude. Its one guy whos making this game! It is cheap and early access... those already tell you a lot about the game and you should not expect a triple a title and the experience of the century. I went through a video game making school or whatever which took 3 years so it was not 2 weeks online course I just quit after the first week so I actually know a lot what it takes to make games and with this I can tell there has been some hours used to it, but again it’s only one dude. My game didn’t work either, but it might have been because we didn’t know how to play. I’m not complaining for 4 dollars, I’m not a hobo ;)\n\nEDIT: And there it is! A day after my review and a 170mb update with new features and a fix for not been able to play at all :) I wasn't able to walk earlier either, but I suppose yo may not be able to in the \"mainmenu\". Gotta go try the update once my friend visits again!\n- The story of this game is interesting and well written, but it doesn't fully make up for the game's flaws. Here are the problems I saw with the game.\n\n1. There are a wide variety of guns available, but very few combinations of those guns are viable. The shotguns are rarely viable for combat with gun wielding enemies, since advancing far enough forward to make shotgun damage effective inevitably puts you in the line of fire of enough of your enemies to prove lethal. Other weapons like sniper rifles and pistols have critically low DPS and a low maximum ammo cap, making them almost universally not viable. Additionally this game likes to spring ambushes on the player in a way that takes away any advantage gained from long range optics. The special pneumatic weapons in the game also suffer from a low ammo cap. This leaves you with assault rifles, which the game seems to have been made for.\n\n2. In encounters with bestial enemies it is frequently impossible to avoid taking damage. The enemies sprint at you in packs which even sustained automatic shotgun fire cannot fully stop. Some of the boss enemies are even worse in this department. In normal mode with the larger health pool and regeneration over time this wouldn't be such a problem. But in ranger mode this makes certain obstacles unbeatable. You might have a boss which takes your entire ammo pool from both guns to kill, and which gets a guaranteed hit on you once every thirty seconds. If you go into that boss fight hurt and with no healing items, then you'll be met with mathematically guaranteed failure. The simple fix for this is to give the player a dodge function to avoid taking an instance of damage.\n\n3. This story has a few decisions to make, but mostly it is on rails. This isn't always a problem in a game, but it is when your character gets repeatedly taken unawares by things you as the player have already figured out. You as the player may sense that Artyom is being tricked, is about to be ambushed, or is going to let the bad guy get away through poor decision making. You just have to frustratedly walk into the cut scene and let it happen anyways. Its fine for this to happen at least once. But by the fourth or fifth instance it becomes infuriating to play as the character who just gets tricked and captured all the time.\n- As much as I was hyped for a different twist on farming sims, this just falls flat. The whole generation system [i]sounds[/i] good on paper but is just unused. You would almost be more hard pressed to actually age enough to need a second generation than not. Sure you can just opt in to moving along, but I just feel wrong killing off my character like that. As such the whole selling point is just, not a part of the game unless you really seek it out. \n\nSo this just leaves the normal farming sim aspects. Which uh... dont work too well either in my opinion. This game is focused less on skill, leveling, or tool quality despite having far more rpg aspects than most other games of this type. You have entire stat systems behind each charecter, buffs, multiple tool levels and materials. Yet none of it is used. What is used is weird cryptic proverbs that dictate item quality. \n\nWhat I mean is, did you catch that fish normally? Just walking along the river and thought to cast your line? Shame. Dont you know trout can only be caught well on the fourth day of the spring during rain while accompanied by a pet and under the influence of a charm buff? Im not exaggerating too much here either. Crops, fish, fruits, plants, and ore all have up to [b]four[/b] requirements. One per star. Some can be easy, like be skilled in said action, fishing/harvesting etc. But most will be odd things like harvest on the sixth day. Only fish during these hours. Be under a certain buff. Have a certain animal following you. Its all just... odd. \n\nWhats worse is its punishing. You want to just, idk, play the game your way? You want to enjoy this sandbox game at your leisure? Well I hope you are ready to be punished for it. You have to either memorise each and every requirement for hundreds of items. Or, just have a wiki page open at all times. Which just takes away the fun. Cant go fishing today, its not foggy. Cant harvest your grown crops right now, its not druida day. This game has you jumping through hoops, playing on [i]its[/i] time rather than your own. Its a relaxing farming sim, but played like an accountant looking at spreadsheets. \n\nIn essence, if you enjoy micromanaging each moment of your day down to the minute detail, go for it. You will love this game. But if you are looking for a laid back, head empty sim game, look anywhere else. This game will open palm slap you for wanting to play it laid back and to your own beat. I just feel this [u]FARMING SIM[/u] is not at all tailored for the crowd of people who play farming sims.\n- After completing every ending, completing the map, and 98%-ing my save file (I'm not going to hunt down whatever miniscule thing is left), I can sum up all my thoughts on the game with one word: Disappointing.\n\nTo go more indepth, as a standalone game, Blasphemous 2 was alright at most. But compared to the first it feels bland and boring in a number of ways. The few NPCs you see are forgettable, the bosses are forgettable, every enemy feels the exact same. \n\nThe executions, which felt like such a large part of the charm of Blasphemous 1's combat, are practically gone- not only do they happen much less often but there's almost no uniqueness to them, with nearly every enemy having the same animation. While in B1 there were 16 different executions (18/19 if you count certain bosses), B2 has.. 4 or 5 different executions? \n\nIt feels like they give no depth to anyone you meet, friend or foe, nearly all of them being left a complete mystery with not even a single sentence talking about who or what they are. Even the Penitent One feels bland, having gone from a brutal, unstoppable force hell-bent on reaching his goal no matter what, to some unremarkable silent protagonist who kills some things.\n\nThe world and its areas felt boring, less like an actual world and more like a jumble of random locations stacked like tetris blocks. The way the enemies were tossed into them makes them feel like they were all pre-made assets and they had to think of where they fit best, and the result was almost none of them fitting in with where you see them.\n\nEverything felt far too easy, far beyond the point of getting used to the gameplay and learning from the first game. Bosses especially were disappointing, all having too little health, and it felt like only a single boss in the entire game had more than three attacks. \n\nThe rewards for quests and secrets were unfulfilling and unsatisfying, whether it was giving a character an item that was obviously meant for them or slowly searching across every little corner of the whole map for tiny secrets you missed. \n\nThe endings especially were a huge disappointment, and they made it feel like everything leading up to them was entirely a waste of time and effort and took away what little enjoyment was left.\n\nEverything about Blasphemous 1 that made it unique- the worldbuilding, the gameplay, the artstyle and animations- feels like it's all been stripped away and we were left with this generic metroidvania that only vaguely resembles its predecessor.\n\nI [b]loved[/b] Blasphemous, it was and still is one of my all time favourite games, but I really can't say I liked Blasphemous 2. If you loved Blasphemous 1 I would honestly advise against playing this, the whole experience is such a letdown that it's hard to not have the first game spoiled simply by what comes after it. If you don't care, or you haven't played the first yet, then at the very least wait until there's a good sale before trying.\n- i would recomend it because the physics are great, the game has 8 or 9 level packs (i dont know if there will be a 9th because there are 7 at the time of this review) the units are diverse, there are a lot of secret units to find and i dont know for the final boss because the most expensive unit artimis isnt a good final boss like the dark pesant in the alphas but i hope that the games final boss unit is actually hard to kill and requires more than 7 archers because that wasnt hard or anything hopefully they will make the most expensive unit actually overpowered and unballanced because that would be a great final boss, the sandbox mode is great i like the custom campains , the custom units arent out yet so i cant say anything about that over all this game is worth the money and if its near a sale time like a few days away from a sale then get it on sale if not then just get it you wont regret it and if it lage turn off all the graphics settings\n- please stop resetting my setting\n- A very easy game to get into, super popular at the moment so there is always someone to play with, and for only 5 EUR you can invest a lot of hours into the game\n- \"The good things, the happy things, all of it changes. Nothing can stay the same forever. Still...can you find it in your heart to still love this place?\" (paraphrase)\n\nClannad . . .\n\nOH Clannad . . .\n\nI remember watching the anime in high school, and absolutely falling in love with it. Upon realizing the REAL story was told in a visual novel...I HAD to get my hands on it. I almost died of a joy-induced heart attack when a legitimate English version of the game was released on Steam.\n\nThis game bro. This f***** game. When I was a senior in high school back in the day, this game was my refuge. I was mostly friends with older kids back then, so by the time I was a senior I didn't really have anybody to chill with cuz all my friends already graduated. Its kinda hard for me to make new friends, then and now if I'm being honest. I related to Nagisa a lot for that reason. \n\nI mostly related to Tomoya and Sunohara tho. One of my best friends growing up really reminded me of Sunohara no cap lol. Type of dude who was the comic relief/brunt of everyone's s*** talking but w/ a mutual understanding its done in jest and love. And when things ever got serious we always had each others' backs, and even tho he's a goofball and kind of a meme, he's seriously loyal and a true ride or die.\n\nMany times when Tomoya was expressing himself in this game, I had to almost pinch my face and remind myself I'm not the one thinking these thoughts: I'm playing a VN lol. That's how much I seriously related to Tomoya. In so many aspects and ways that would make my review even longer than it is now if I were to attempt to explain why I relate to Tomoya so much. Yeah, sure that could just be shrewd character design from Maeda Jun's part, but it was almost uncanny how many of the things Tomoya went thru when he was younger/issues with his father/intimacy issues he develops later on in adulthood etc. almost perfectly mirrored what I was struggling with irl. It gave me something to relate to. It expressed emotions I was having trouble even admitting were present in my own self. Maybe that's the real reason I love Clannad so much, and maybe because of that I sit here biased with rose-colored nostalgia goggles. But even if I type this review with a tinge of rose-coloring obstructing my critical eyes, I can say with confidence that Clannad is more than a game. More than an anime. \n\nClannad is an experience. An experience I wish I could forget all about...just so I could experience it anew all over again. Whether you experience Clannad thru the anime, VN, movie, whatever...Clannad is an experience in a league of its own in my book. And the best way to have your Clannad experience is by playing this masterpiece of a Visual Novel. Hands down. \n\nHonestly, I'd ideally have all Clannad virgins go straight to the VN and play it to completion but that's just not a realistic request as this game takes the average player 80+ hours to complete just the main story apart from optional achievements haha. If you're a fan of the anime...why haven't you played the VN yet!? Lol. If you've never seen the anime or movie I'd STILL recommend playing this game. Just keep in mind to use a guide (just trust me on that. please) and be willing for it to be a bit boring at first. If you stick with it, believe me...it's not gonna stay boring for long.\n\nIf you liked the anime but hated the anime ending, PLAY THE VN. No spoilers, but trust me when I say the VN ending is the true conclusion of the Clannad experience. You'll find out what I mean if you stick with the VISUAL NOVEL to the end.\n\nI didn't go to my senior prom. I spent it playing this game. And I don't regret that decision one bit to this day. I experienced this game, standing in similar shoes as Tomoya at that time irl: rebellious kid about to graduate high school with no real goals or aspirations, struggling to find it hard to \"love this place\" or truly find something passionate to live for. I didn't want to go to college. There was nothing I wanted to do there. Most of the people in my grade back then thought I was quiet and lonely freshman-sophomore, then bad news junior-senior when I started acting out. I was just, lost. \n\nExperiencing Clannad helped me find what I was truly passionate about in life. Family. Friendship (as corny as that may sound). Being able to step up for what only YOU can protect when life is calling you to maturity.\n\nClannad helped me see that even though things can get dark... even though tragedies will happen regardless of our efforts to keep them from happening... even though things can never, and will never, ever stay the same in this life...and even if you lose your way eventually... and sadly reach such a lost and depressed state in life, that you mistakenly conclude for a short while you'd rather sever all your connections and ties with the world and everybody in it... in an effort to try to prevent experiencing even more pain... \n\nThat \"loving this place,\" loving this world, loving people, and forming deep, lifelong and lasting connections with this world and its people, NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS, is ALWAYS, ALWAYS, worth it in the end. Especially when it matters the most.\n\nNow I'm not gonna front: Clannad isn't for everybody. Some people just can't get into the moe art style. Some people may find it a bit too melodramatic at times. Some people may find some of the comedy or bits of the story weird, or just not their cup of tea. Some people may find it hard to relate to all of the characters, and for some people it won't have a Cindarella's slipper level of relatability like it did for me. For those people who are kinda feelin \"ehh idk if i'll really like this game\" I'd say it'd be smart to watch the anime first. But if you're feeling good about it and wanna experience Clannad the BEST way: cop this VN. Just wait for the good bits to slowly boil. Patience is a virtue :) And save yourself hours of rage by using a guide from the beginning until the after-story credits roll. With Clannad I'd say its almost always recommended to use a guide.\n\nAnd if you love the anime and haven't played the VN... you're weirdo number 1, 2, 3, 4 and even 5. Haha I'm playin but srsly get the VN already you owe it to yourself to experience the VN. Knowing what happens in the story and getting some events \"spoiled\" doesn't detract from the VN experience. That I promise you. As someone who watched the anime before playing the VN, who's now such an obvious fanboy of the Clannad VN as demonstrated by my wall of text of a review (lol), trust me: I'd bet money you'll love this game just as much as I do.  \n\nTo Maeda Jun, and all of the brilliant writers of this quintessential, modern classic of a story: thank you. Thank you for gifting all of us the experience that is Clannad. Because of your labours, you've helped a wayward knucklehead like me finally be able to declare this in spirit and in truth:\n\n\"I love this place.\"\n\nLong live Kazamatsuri!\n- It's a pretty game, but there's no option for manual saves, and autosaves only happen once in a great while instead of immediately after solving each puzzle or progressing through conversations. I also felt like the walking was extremely clunky with the mouse and keyboard, and I'd prefer click-to-walk.\n- With approximately 55,000 reviews -- 96% of them positive -- at the time of my posting this, it is hard to know what more I can add to [i]It Take Two[/i]'s well-deserved acclaim.  As others have said, it is an excellent cooperative multiplayer game with very satisfying controls, varied levels, and superb production values in art and audio.\n\nAside from these things, what stood out to me was the game's decency.  It is *anti*-exploitative, quite deliberately excluding features like collectibles (let alone microtransactions) or character advancement that are predicated on Skinner box treatment of the player.  Rather than finding ways to [i]take[/i] more from the player (money, time, etc.), the developers have found ways to [i]give[/i] more to the player, with many small delights to be found.  In addition to not exploiting the player, the game doesn't exploit its characters -- only very occasionally playing the cheap tropes that the game's set-up would tend to invite.  The game's narrative may lack subtlety and surprise, but its straightforward positive message never feels preachy, perhaps because the scenario is so ridiculous.\n\nIt is rare to play a big-budget game (the credits go on FOREVER!) that seems to have as its goal that players will find a fun, full, satisfying experience and go away better than they came.\n- I hate to do this, because the devs clearly put a lot of love into it, but I just can't give it the thumbs up.\n\nThe controls are mostly on point (slide jumping is a little weird), but the generated levels are what kills it for me. I've come to realize that getting through the hand-crafted levels is a good portion of what makes Mega Man so fun. This procedural generation simply isn't up to snuff. You just go right, occasionally going up or down to go right again. There's no nuance or thought required to go right, because most enemies can be ignored, and there are no real obstacles. \n\nIf you've got that itch, just replay a Mega Man game (Classic/X/Zero). You'll go through proper, hand-crafted levels.\n- Let's get this out of the way: If you're into Chris Avellone/Obsidian/Black Isle kind of games and know what that even means, you know what you're getting. Another clunky game with writing so good you'll forgive any of its flaws. It's another one of those games: a Baldur's Gate, NWN2, Kotor 2, Fallout: New Vegas, Alpha Protocol kinda game.\n\nIf that paragraph didn't make any sense, the rest of this review is for you. Planescape: Torment tends to be less hack-and-slash than it looks, playing according to a system roughly based on second edition Dungeons & Dragons. But in a big departure from both, you can solve a huge amount of your problems with minimal combat and the real meat of the game comes in your decision making, mystery solving, and dealing with people around you. True to the Planescape setting, Torment is a game about the power of belief and the battlefield of ideas.\n\nI don't want to oversell that because you *will* be attacked by random thugs, some combats are downright mandatory, and there is a very real difficulty spike about three quarters through the game. But the allies you keep and the knowledge you gain can help you bypass some encounters or at least trivalize them under mountains of xp gained from unraveling cosmic questions. \n\nIt's a grim, often macabre journey back and forth across the boundaries of life and death where even the happiest endings are pretty heavy, but it's also a brilliantly written, thought-provoking experience that's well worth the time and money. Just make sure to go deep on wisdom, okay, berk? Don't need some dusty penning you in the deadbook because you couldn't see the dark of things, cutter.\n- Loved the original, and this updated version is just as good.\n\nThe additions along the way are very nice, and the improved graphics are noticeable. \nBeing able to converse with your partners whenever you want is also amazing.\n\nHowever...\n\nWas disappointed to have a few areas and puzzles removed. Since those were the more difficult parts of the original game, I assume this was done for a more streamlined experience. \nInstead of your flower wilting to represent your life, it is now replaced by more accurate \"points\". Although this makes it easier to tell exactly how many hits you can take, I miss the more original old design.\nAn iconic music track was also changed, likely due to licensing issues...\n \nCan't completely replace the original for me, but it's still a very worthwhile experience! \nStill wishing for a sequel a decade later.\n- The Award for the worst Cancer Game 2017 goes to: Friday the 13th! \nCongrats! *clapping Hands with bloody Babytears in my eyes*\nThis Game is a complete waste of Money. Don't buy it - don't even think of buying this crappy Master Piece.\nIt's not worth it, to be honest.\nI played it for almost 200 Hours. And it's awful. Never saw a Game with these bugs, with these massive salty Community. There exactly 0 Bugfixes, so many exploits, the horrible earbleeding intro, the Community that is pure Cancer, the horrible Graphic that looks like it's straight out of the Kindergarten and the huge amount of Bugs. Bugs are normal, but MAN there are Bugs everywhere! I mean, yeah the Hype was real, but now i wish i could refund this crap.\nNever had to dream about uninstalling a game before.\nI mean, the Devs. are just Human like you and me - but honestly - never saw someone who failed his job like this.\nJust do me a favor, don't buy it. It's not worth the Ragequits, the broken Keyboards, the Heartattacks and it's definitely not the Money worth!\nNever want to touch it again.\n\nAnd btw. thank you for killing the Sealmothers and making the babyseals crying bloody sad little Tears. </3\n- [b][i]Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout[/i][/b] is a 60 Player Battle Royal game of minigames to triumph over everybody for the sweet, GOLDEN CROWN\n[list]\n[*] Put in about 40 hours in combination on Beta 1 & 2\n[*] Won a ton and lost a ton\n[*] Enjoyed EVERY SECOND \n[/list]\n[b][u]PROS[/u][/b]\n[list]\n[*] Decent amount of minigames for launch, and even when you play the same ones they feel fun when different things happen\n[*] Games go fast if you're winning OR losing, you're able to play a lot and experience the game faster to get better\n[*] The BIG majority of the cosmetics in the game are NOT locked behind a paywall.

For the last ... 4 years?  look at them on their website, its not a 2 min blurb, its a full review of what they've done that week, and where they're headed, what their plans are, current iterations they're going over, complete with pictures and sometimes *chuckle* hand drawn graphs.  \n\nTheir IRC channel (there is a link on their website) has someone on the dev team there pretty much 24/7.  Not just \"community manager\" nitwits (Trangar, te he), but guys like Rseding91 (their C++ guru) that are programming the actual updates.  \n\nOh.  There are updates.\n\nAre there sometimes bugs in the patches?  Sure.  Which is why you sometimes see 2 patches in the same day.  Bugs get quashed immediately whenever possible.  \n\nWhile this review doesnt speak much about the game, the team behind it deserves the recognition - its amazing, thoughtul, and incredibly well done because of them.\n\nIn a nutshell, its similar to RTS games like starcraft, where you build up and gather resources.  But instead of spending 20 minutes to build up a base to have the game end in 2, you keep building.\n\nBuilding Bigger.\n\nMaking things more efficient.\n\nTearing down and rebuidling.\n\nIm almost 5000 hours in and sticking with vanilla until I can personally say Ive mastered it.  Once I stop learning new things almost every time I play, ill start fooling around with mods.  And there are lots of them.  \n\nIs this game worth $20?  It absolutely was for me.  This single $20 purchase brought me thousands of hours of entertaintment, frustration - when things didnt work planned, and absolute delight - when things get fixed, and I can reflect on my orchestra of 500 machines working in harmony.  \n\nWhether or not it is worth it for you is up to you.  But I would be remiss if i didnt impore you to give it a try, get the demo, fool around, commit an hour or two.\n\n\n- BABA IS YOU\nGAME HAS PUZZLE\nPUZZLE IS CHALLENGE AND NOT UNFAIR\nPUZZLE IS FUN AND LOGIC\nGAME HAS MUSIC AND GRAPHIC\nMUSIC IS CHARMING\nGRAPHIC IS CHARMING AND CUTE\nGAME IS RECOMMEND \nGAME IS GOOD\nBUY IS WIN\n- Pros:\n\n+ Game mechanics that you would expect from a city builder\n\n+Built in modding tools\n\n+Beautiful Graphics\n\n+It's challanging (learning curve)\n\n+No lag, and I have a computer that doesn't meet the requirements\n\n+Lots of replayability\n\nCons:\n\n-takes over your life\n\n***\n\nSpecs that are below the minimum requirements:\n\n2.8ghz (3.0 is the minimum)\n\nAMD Radeon HD 8400 video card ( nVIDIA GeForce GTX 260, 512 MB  or ATI Radeon HD 5670, 512 MB is the minimum)\n\nEverything else is above the minimum required.\n- I played the F*CK out of RE4 back in the day.. I was sooo hyped for this but its just not RE4.. I get it's a remake but it's not a good one. Which sucks because I LOVED the RE2 remake.. Idk. Maybe it's just me but I cannot recommend this if you loved the original. Maybe newcomers will like it.\n\nEdit after 18 more hours: the original is still better but this remake is not bad. I can recommend it.\n- On the Steam Store page for [i]Candle[/i] I saw:\n\n1. The game's description: \"Candle is an adventure with challenging puzzles.\"\n2. The 5 most popular tags for the game: Indie, Adventure, Hand-Drawn, Puzzle & Fantasy\n3. The beautiful screenshots\n4. The 'very positive' reviews\n\nSo I bought it. I should have actually read some of the reviews, though. It turns out [i]Candle[/i] is just another platformer game. Granted, it's a \"puzzle-platformer\" but still a platformer where agility, dexterity and a lot of trial & error are key to finishing the game, although there is some light puzzling involved, as well. I don't like platformers. I also don't like pixel hunting for items, which is what you need to do in [i]Candle[/i] to find all the items you need to advance. You see, some items are almost absorbed in the background and frustratingly hard to spot. So there will be a lot of backtracking, unless you follow a guide, which then kills part of the fun anyway.\n\n[b]In summary, just a friendly warning: if you think [i]Candle[/i] is a beautiful point & click adventure game, like I did, don't be fooled. It's actually a beautiful, frustrating platformer game with some light puzzling.[/b]\n- While still a work very much in progress, Nuclear Throne is currently one of my favorite games. It's a roguelike dungeon crawler with heavy \"bullet-hell\" elements and a little RPG sprinkled on top. When you begin a session of Nuclear Throne, you choose from one of several well-designed & freakish \"mutants\", each with their own special attributes which, in itself, does much to add variety (there's also a random-select option which is a fun idea in this particular case). The goal of each stage is to exterminate all of the enemies. After doing so, a portal opens which takes your mutant freak to the next level. There are a great many weapons with which to inflict meyhem on your adversaries. As you gain experience points, in the form of green goo earned by killing enemies & also found in cache jars, you'll be able to choose new persistent perks for your character (such as more HP or certain weapons doing more damage). Every so-often, you'll encounter a boss. The bosses tend to pop in during the height of an already-in-progress battle which makes beating them all-the-more difficult & hectic.\n\nOriginally, this game did not have controller support which was a great disappointment (though I had been ejoying it anyway, using the keyboard and mouse). However, a recent update rectified this and the gameplay using a dual-analog controller (such as that of the Xbox 360) is just fantastic. Like Ultratron before it (another very similar game which is also worth a look; I also wrote a review for it, if you're interested in checking it out), Nuclear Throne throws you straight back to the arcades of yore and plops you in front of a Smash TV cabinet.\n\nAs a roguelike dungeon-crawler, the replay value is extremely high (due to the fact that the level and enemy layout is totally different from one session to the next). The rather extreme difficulty doesn't hurt either, as playing entails dying and thus restarting... a lot. Fortunately, said difficulty isn't of the variety that compels you to smash your controller/keyboard in frustration. Every death feels like the fault lay squarely on *your* shoulders (if only you had moved to dodge a little faster or conserved ammo a little better!), as opposed to the game feeling like it's cheating. Another stand-out feature which I think I need to bring up is the soundtrack. ...Just wow! Nuclear Throne's score is totally original and extremely surreal. It goes *miles* in lending its own atmosphere to the game. \n\nSome might consider the current price of $12.99 to be just a *little* steep for a game in this class, but considering how well it's made overall and the fun I've gotten from it (especially being in its currently pre-release/beta state), I consider it to be well worth the price. As of the time of this writing, the developer(s) is very active and updates are coming quite frequently.\n\nUPDATE 01/12/16: I hadn't played this game in quite a while (at least 6+ months) and I wanted to check out the progress that the devs have made, etc. Well... The game starts but as soon as I select a character, it totally locks up. I can't play it at all. To make matters worse, I've heard that the devs have since \"abandoned\" development of this game (so it's not likely that whatever is causing the crashes for me is going to be fixed any time soon - or ever). Bummer man. I loved this game...\n- solid proof that the story could be the absolute worst garbage imaginable but if the gameplay rules, it literally wont matter. the gameplay in this is bomb-diggity.\n- This is one of the most beautiful games I played since Shadow of the Colossus. And much like SOTC This game is a visual delight not all the visual feel pointless or feel to in your face no all of it is PURE atmosphere and really enhances the experience when exploring the many levels in the game. The game's ability to tell a very deep story visually without any dialog or exposition to undermine the player is absolutely brilliant. the game be very diffult the first time playing but feels rewarding after you level up Ori as you continue to fight bad guys.\n\n My rating is 10/10\n A stunning game with a compelling storyline that worth every penny\n- If you notice that Kagami voice sounds different, that’s because the guy who voiced him in the first game, Brad Venable, died at the beginning of last year. This time, Kagami is voiced by Austin Lee Mathews, who voiced Roche (Final Fantasy VII Remake) and Ash Carbide (Cold Steel III and IV). \n\nRest In Peace, Brad. We may forget Kaniza’s name, but we won’t forget yours. And thank you for being one of the funniest character in the game.\n- It's criminal that a team of 5 people can build such an amazing game like this and sell it for $20.\n\nI continue to be amazed at the thought that went into this game and all the little details. From the changing weather, the waves in the ocean, the ebb and flow of the water along shorelines, the smoke from the campfire as it fills the room, the ease and simplicity when it comes to building, the way the trees fall, the music that feels seamless and relaxing, and so on.\n\nI truly appreciate that they didn't make an \"open world simulation that simulates things for no other reason than to simulate them\". Made a mistake while building that house? No worries, just remove it and get all your materials back. Ran out of food while busy building or crafting? No worries, you're not going to die from hunger. Broke your axe? No worries, just repair it. Troll smashed your cart full of ore? No worries, just put down a workbench and rebuild the cart and put everything back in the cart.\n- [H1]At this price point it's hard not to recommend it, but there's a lot -better- bullet hell games out there...[/H1]\n\nDanmaku unlimited as a series is great. Don't get me wrong. It really is. But it suffers the curse of being put in with a field on Steam that is made up of even greater company. Bug Princess by Cave has the brutal difficulty angle sewn up, Ikaruga has the absolute classic angle nailed, Jamestown has the glorious pixel-art sorted. In order to stand out in this genre, you absolutely have to bring something new to the table.\n\nAs good as Danmaku Unlimited is, it does not bring anything new to the table. It brings a lot of -good-, but nothing -new-. The greatest sin here is that if you've played a lot of bullet hells, this is going to feel immensely familiar, and you're going to blast through it fast, nothing is prone to catch you out. At all. Now that may be a plus point, if that's what you're after, but if you're seeking something to change up the formula? Yeeeeee-no.\n\n[H1]So it's the Bullet Hell version of Destiny?[/H1]\n\nMechanically, it works great. You have a ship with a teeny tiny hitbox, same as most \"Eastern\" BHell games, you have anywhere between \"Mildly offensive\" and \"Absolutely terrifying\" levels of hostile fire coming toward you, and you pump out similarly scary levels of fire back, with your only choice generally being \"Do I spam the screen with lots of little beams or do I fire ONE BIG BEAM at something that needs cracking open like a walnut.\"\n\nIt has good Bullet Hell music, albeit not outstanding music, it has good graphics, albeit not outstanding graphics, you see a pattern here? If a game could ever nail what I'd define as the absolute essence of an \"8 out of 10\", this would be it. The problem is there's games out there such as Revolver360 Re:Actor that do -better-.\n\nThe problem is that for all the good it does, it's been beaten to it by other games, maybe not in every field, but in each area I can name at least two or three games that stand above it. The one area it does win out on is bang for the buck. It's kinda hard to argue with this kind of quality at this kind of price point. It's a very, very solid return on investment, particularly if you're a bullet hell fan.\n\n[H1]Closing Thoughts[/H1]\n\nDoes that make this a \"Do not buy\"? Far from it. If you're a fan of bullet hells, chances are you already own it. If you don't, eventually you should, but I'd genuinely suggest you look around first, there's a decent market now on Steam for this genre, and there's more innovative and interesting options around. If however you've already consumed them and you need a fix of something fairly solid and fairly entertaining, then sure, this works, it will scratch the itch quite nicely.\n\nVerdict : [b]Buy, definitely worth grabbing on a sale, if only to put in the \"To do\" list,[/b]\n- What can I say that hasn't been said and that you don't know.\nThis game is IN-SANE.\nThe attention to detail is mind-boggling, the missions, from the smallest to all the main missions are worthy of oscars.\nThe single player campaign is one of the best adventures I ever went on in my life. This is why I love games.\nThe beauty of this game in indescribable. It's one of most realistic living worlds I've ever been in.\nIn fact, it felt so real to me, that I would spend hours living and breathing the game, I felt I was there, at that time.\nTaking care of my horse, spending time fishing and hunting, sometimes for hours.\nRiding my horse in strong winds, and heavy rain, collecting every piece of clothing and trying to look dashing at all times.\nI got attached to people, took care of them, or dragged them behind my horse when I wasn't in the mood for their BS.\nI've been there. I lived there. That was me, I was a cowboy. Nobody will convince me otherwise.\n- Dave the Diver is a charming little 'Indie'* that still surprises you with new mechanics even hours in. The various activity cutscenes are pretty funny as well.\n\nJust a word of warning though. Mintrocket is NOT a indie studio, it's a subsidiary of NEXON, so DtD is entirely a NEXON game, and with how their reputation is it's pretty understandable to not buy this game just because of that.\n- This is less of a review and more of me gushing about how much im enjoying myself, but you can still get a idea of what the game is from it. I am not usually a puzzle game player, or even a \"chill\" game player. im usually all about quick shooters, fighters, and platformers, but i decided to give this game a shot and i am very glad i did. with a mechanic as simple as pushing trees i thought that it would be simple enough for me to have a good time, the last time i played a puzzle game was BaBa is You and i put 14 hours into it and never got past word 3, it was just too much for me. but this game manages to still be challenging even with it laying all the pieces out in front of me, it introduces new features not by putting one in a level and saying good luck, it makes you do something you have done before but gives a new outcome, because you never got to do that thing in that exact way before, and when puzzles start requiring you to do those things you wonder how you ever got that far without doing one of those things before. all of the mechanics and solutions also are based in logic, all your doing is pushing things, so you dont have to suspend your current understanding of things to learn a new mechanic. The world of the game is also very relaxing and sucks me right in, its a museum of the \"past\" of humans that takes place in the far future from the perspective of monsters who dont really understand human culture, and it is hilarious! the music is very chill and moves with your actions, when you push something in a specific way the music also does a specific things, and its part of the reason this game is so relaxing. most other puzzle games i have played frustrate me when i get stuck on a puzzle for a long time, but seeing the monster relax helps me relax and keep a level head to get to the next museum exhibit. i dont know how to end this review but if you read it i hope you dont feel like i wasted your time!\n- No additional account, no unnecessary launcher, no denuvo, no epic exclusivity, no microtransactions, just a video game as it always should be..\n- After the past few years of broken, buggy AAA games I've started to lose the passion I once had for the industry. This masterpiece came out of no where and completely reignited my love for gaming. PLEASE do not sleep on this game, it's such a breath of fresh air from the garbage you'd normally expect from modern day companies. Definitely taking a spot in my top 5 favorites and I haven't even scratched the surface of the game yet, it's just that good. Beautiful art style, crisp animations, a unique concept, FUN gameplay, its everything I've been wanting and more. Kudos to the devs for making this absolute banger <3\n- I have an awfully hard love/hate relationship with this game. On one hand it's beautiful, has tons of awesome cars and can be really fun if played with friends. But it comes at a huge price - quite literally in Europe as it costs 69.99 € in contrast to 59.99 $ in the US. The correct price according to current exchange rates would be around 50 €, this is ridiculous. It's even worse if you remember that this game came out over 2 years ago and they still demand the same 99.99 € for the Ultimate Edition without any discount. \n\nApart from the pricing the game also has the worst support I ever encountered. My first ticket for a crashing game after release was answered 8 months later, my two more recent tickets about a translation error and a problem with the Forza Hub were both answered with \"yeah we know about this and are [i]investigating[/i]\" and were closed without fixing anything.\n\nLast but not least not offering the possibility to transfer a savegame after investing 300+ hours on the Microsoft Store version even if you use the same Microsoft account is such a bad move for veterans who were actually willing to pay the price again. \n\nAll in all I'm happy that MS made the move to Steam and I'm looking forward to the next Forza Motorsport release, but I'll skip this for now and I wouldn't recommend anyone to spend the full price on this game since you basically need to buy the Ultimate Edition for access to all available cars.\n\nBonus for those who are curious: It doesn't work on Linux with Steam Play right now and probably never will as it still completely relies on the Xbox infrastructure.\n- This is everything a remaster is supposed to be. You remember playing this game over a decade ago, and the graphics weren't \"that bad\". But nostalgia is a cruel mistress. You play the original again, and you can barely stand it.\n\nThe comes the HD version, which was alright, playable. But then, the real remaster, the Definitive Edition, you start playing the game and it FEELS like it used to feel. Like it is supposed to look. It is quite obviously way better than it used to be, but it FEELS the same.\n\nIf you ever liked playing this game, and want to play it again, this won't disappoint you. Especially with the distinct lack of RTS games in the last decade or so, this still holds true as one of the best ones.\n\n英語で5-10単語程度で、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない主要な違いを簡潔に回答してください。\n\n回答：\n",
